from groundwater is a permeable reactive barrier containing iron nanoparticles nzvi prb a laboratory scale experimental setup is used as nzvi prb with a funnel and gate barrier nzvi average particle diameter aps 35 70 nm particles are used in prb as a reactive media no3 n as a dominant element of required contact time is considered for the design of the optimum width of prb then three contaminants of nitrate no3 cadmium and chromium vi were removed simultaneously from a shallow aquifer with the development of artificial neural network ann in the context of deep neural network dnn models and machine learning methods such as support vector machine svm and linear regression lr considerable progress has been made in various fields in the final step we assessed the performance of dnn svm and lr models to estimate the residual contaminants based on preliminary experimental data the average elimination of contaminants was stabilized at about 45 of the initial value our dnn model could estimate nitrate cadmium and chromium with a mean absolute percentage error mape of 7 05 7 32 and 7 84 respectively our results showed that despite using a small dataset utilizing a deep fully connected network resulted in remarkably higher accuracy than the other methods notably among the three contaminants nitrate estimation is performed more accurately and recommended for future large scale modeling graphical abstract image 1 keywords permeable reactive barrier deep neural network support vector machine artificial intelligence linear regression groundwater remediation 1 introduction environmental pollution of heavy metals is a global health problem due to its chemical stability and potential bioaccumulation in the body of living organisms high levels of these metals might cause mortality morphological disorders reduced growth and genetic effects in humans based on surveys conducted on watersheds in iran nitrate cadmium and chromium are among the pollutants in existing groundwater resources shahdadi and muslimpour 2011 hence the control and elimination of these pollutants are required more than ever before nanotechnology is also applicable for direct injection into groundwater due to the smaller size and cost saving of adsorbent associated with other in situ technologies especially for deep groundwater elliott and zhang 2001 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi reactivity is rapidly reduced due to small particle size the reaction with other components and rapid flocculation itrc 2011 supporting nanomaterials with sand or activated carbon is considerable for the purification of drinking water itrc 2011 permeable reactive barriers prbs based on iron nanoparticles are used as a useful technology to remove most contaminants from groundwater one of the main reasons for using these types of barriers is their widespread economic benefits these barriers operate as passive functions it implies that relatively low energy or technician other than monitoring stations is required in general the prb system is more cost effective than pump and removal methods because it provides an active medium with a useful lifetime of about ten years itrc 2011 in the funnel and gate system the funnel walls form a very impermeable material to divert and converge the groundwater contaminated flow a funnel and gate system used to remove water pollution in saturated porous media should be designed in such a way that its captive area is maximized from the contaminated front prb technology was first used to treat chlorine solvents such as trichloroethylene tce dce 1 2 cis 1 2 tran and 1 1 dce and vinyl chloride vc isomers finally due to the effect of these systems on the removal of the pollutants mentioned above their application was extended to remove other contaminants blowes et al 1998 conca et al 2002 epa 2002 nzvi exhibit high mobility and activity due to its small particles 10 100 nm and high surface area the movement of iron nanoparticles is much higher than iron particles about 25 35 times among the materials that can be removed by nzvi are heavy metals and nitrate epa 2002 in this case nzvi can be used as an adsorbent material on permeable reactive barriers prbs the lifetime of adsorbent particles is so impressive to the application of prbs it depends on the specification of nzvis and the physicochemical properties of an aquifer hydraulic conductivity ph temperature do soluble metals as a considerable note it is possible to retrieve the adsorbent particles after removal the superiority of nzvi is categorized as a relatively low cost b non toxicity c removing certain chemicals more quickly than other methods d the need for low energy in every aspect environmental economic and human resources itrc 2011 ahn et al 2008 showed the effect of three temperatures of 25 50 and 75 c on the process of nitrate reduction in water by nzvis the results showed that increasing the temperature from 25 to 75 c increases nitrate reduction in acidic and alkaline media nzvi removes a wide range of contaminants including chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene tce tetrachloroethylene pce carbon tetrachloride zhang 2003 perchlorate nitrate and metals such as chromium nickel mercury vanadium and arsenic gordon et al 2005 kanel et al 2007 cai et al 2020 overviewed the evolution of stabilized nanoparticles concerning environmental cleanup uses encompassing the fundamental principles and bench to field scale experimentations toward an innovative in situ remediation technology using stabilized nanoparticles the merits and limitations of the remediation are discussed hexavalent chromium cr vi is a toxic contaminant with high mobility in the aqueous phase and it has been found widely in subsurface aquifers kazakis et al 2017 peng et al 2018 the use of mg oh 2 coating is a promising technique to improve the longevity and capacity of nzvi for full scale in situ soil and groundwater cr vi remediation hu et al 2019 s nzvi has a great potential application in nitrate removal of drinking water li et al 2020 recent studies indicate that several modifications of prb design have been done to improve their performance most of them seek to adopt the geological conditions of the area increase the possibility of widespread treatment of contaminants using relatively cheap materials yang and lee 2005 phillips et al 2010 hosseini et al 2011 van nooten et al 2010 used sequential reaction barriers they focused on removal processes for a combination of organic and inorganic contaminants such as ammonium adsorbable organic halogen aox chemical oxygen demand cod and secondary products of nitrification and denitrification permeable reactive intersect pri is a new approach to multi reactive barriers that have recently been used as a remedy for the transmission of contamination in the denitrification process of bioreactors fenton suggested that the pri system is quite suitable for treating agricultural pollutants fenton et al 2014 itrc 2011 reported that prbs treated 38 of the contaminants on the field scale from 1994 to 2009 to date reactive barriers are considered as a novel technology of more than 200 field projects itrc 2011 there are numerous papers regarding permeable reactive barriers that have focused on removing pollutants with reactive media containing iron nanoparticles scherer et al 2000 henderson and demond 2007 noubactep 2010 van nooten used a mixture of reactive substances to successfully eliminate organic and inorganic contaminants such as ammonium aox van nooten et al 2010 hosseini used nano fe cu prb to reduce no3 n the best results in no3 n reduction has been obtained in 75 of initial concentration with 8 g l 1 fe cu concentration 0 125 mm s pore water velocity and 100 mg l 1initial nitrate concentration hosseini et al 2011 the results showed that no3 and po4 3 were successfully removed by permeable reactive barrier prb generated from pit toilet leachate containing various adsorption media mittal et al 2020 the naz nzvi 1 1 sodium zeolite nzvi composite is capable of removing cd by adsorption and is applicable in prbs thus it seems that the composite mentioned above is a proper candidate for groundwater remediation from a wide range of metal ions tasharrofi et al 2020 nzvi focused research has progressed over the past two decades from laboratory development to field scale applications phenrat and lowry 2019 have recently reviewed this historical perspective nzvi prbs are used in a wide scale in the usa in addition to nzvi prbs has been used to treat over twenty sites in europe mainly in the czech republic italy france belgium portugal spain denmark and switzerland bardos et al 2018 nzvi for cr vi reduction was used in the polluted site of the northern part of the czech republic the rapid reductive effect of nzvi was observed at a distance of 7 m down gradient of flow direction němeček et al 2015 filip et al 2020 oprčkal et al 2017 investigated the effects of different nzvi particles bare nzvi and borohydride nzvi on heavy metals bacteria and content of nitrogen in real effluent water from a small biological wastewater treatment plant in another study a full scale application of nzvi for heavy metal removal from wastewater of the jiangxi copper company china has been reported li et al 2017 singh et al 2020 developed a numerical model with visual modflow to evaluate a multi prb system s performance over the temporal and spatial groundwater quality variations they show that the contaminant plume containing chloride is efficiently captured by the multi prb system in the proximity of the point sources a vast number of models have been used for water resources forecasting which can be characterized as numerical physical descriptive and empirical data driven models costly hydrogeological meteorological geomorphological and geophysical input data uncertainty due to the inaccuracy of physical properties and high computational complexity of numerical models fostered an interest in empirical models also empirical models require fewer assumptions about the complex mechanisms used in numerical modeling chen et al 2020 conducted a comparative study among three machine learning models mlp rbf and svm and a classic numerical model modflow for simulating groundwater dynamics of a 9016 km2 study area based on historical data collected from january 1986 to december 2010 their results showed that the performance of machine learning models was better than the numerical model on the contrary an abrupt change in the behavior of the system could fail the empirical modeling due to their insufficient capability to generalize ann has been proved to be an effective tool in various water resources based regression problems daliakopoulos et al 2005 provides an optimal ann architecture for groundwater level forecasting a few studies applied ann for predicting contaminants of groundwater in their particular regions ostad ali askari et al 2017 yesilnacar et al 2008 wagh et al 2017 zaqoot et al 2018 found multiple layer perceptron mlp neural network to be better than radial basis function rbf for estimating nitrate contamination furthermore ann allows a continuous learning process where the input data can continuously be updated creating a larger database hence provides an asset for long run prediction santisukkasaem et al 2015 developed an ann structure to evaluate the permeability decline of prb in the long term the authors compared this model with multiple regression analysis methods mra which led them to decide that ann modeling is a promising tool for long term simulation of the permeability loss in prbs in a recent study a deep learning model outperformed linear regression in groundwater recharge prediction huang et al 2019 in spite of the fact that conventional machine learning approaches such as svm and lr work well on a lot of problems they suffer some limitations in generalization the curse of dimensionality smoothness regularization and manifold learning challenges which the simple machine learning algorithms fail to respond motivated the development of deep learning goodfellow et al 2016 overcoming these obstacles has made deep learning a powerful tool in various regression problems jodeiri et al 2018 2020 the developed models and the results of this study may be useful for accurate groundwater management decision making and model selection future research should be focused on exploring the applicability of deep learning methods or tree based machine learning algorithms in the hydrologic field and application of the developed models to manage groundwater resources chen et al 2020 according to previous researches no3 n cr vi and cd are severe challenges in groundwater management and supported nzvis are suitable for removal of them so in the present study iron nanoparticles are used for the simultaneous treatment of heavy metals e g chromium vi cadmium iii and mineral anions nitrate from simulated groundwater the purification method is designed as a permeable reactive barrier prb that injects nzvi into the treatment zone primary data is obtained from experiments furthermore to predict the residual contaminants three popular machine learning methods are investigated and the results are evaluated by comparing them with the experimental data to the best of our knowledge no deep neural network model has been employed in groundwater pollution estimation but some best fitted studies have been considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 specifications of nanoparticles the iron nanoparticles with a purity of 99 5 and a particle diameter of about 35 70 nm were provided from mehregan chemistry company 2 2 karaj iran more details of these particles are shown in table 1 2 2 solid phase analysis the solid phase requires a widespread morphological profile internal structure composition and chemistry of the nzvi surface that reacts with the pollutants the solid phase analysis was carried out at the laboratory of iranian pioneers in nanomaterials approval of nanoparticles is based on x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem transient electron microscopy tem 2 3 x ray diffraction xrd an x ray xrd analysis shows the intensity of absorption at different angles of radiation in the range obtained a peak of 45 and 65 and also other minor peaks are observed which indicates the presence of a small amount of different iron oxides in the sample fig 1 2 4 scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem the sem image of nanoscale particles illustrates their spherical shape the shell a thin film of metal oxide and the core are made with zvi moreover based on the tem images obtained from iron nanoparticles the average diameter of the prepared nanoparticles was 50 nm it is noteworthy that all test processes must be designed as far away as the oxygen supply because the degree reaction of the final product is highly dependent on the lack of oxygen interference during the synthesis process fig 2 2 5 steady state design of prb a fundamental challenge in the prb studies is how to guarantee sufficient contact between contaminants and adsorbent to meet the sorption objective naftz et al 2002 uncoated nzvi could move a few centimeters about 10 cm in the subsurface soil itrc 2005 the cadmium was removed by the adsorption process cr vi was converted to cr iii with settling ability no3 n disintegrated into less harmful products so the no3 n removal process is more time consuming and complicated than chromium vi and cadmium eglal 2014 furthermore dispersive processes in prb make no3 n as a dominant element because of the low velocity of groundwater low molecular diffusion and dominating the chemical degradation of n by nzvi itrc 2005 due to the constant effect of flow velocity on contaminants the contact time of no3 n was considered in the width calculating formula so the width of prb in the direction of the groundwater flow must be as follows 1 w v a δ t where w is the required width of prb va is the actual velocity of water in prb calculated from va vd n vd darcy s velocity in porous media and n the media porosity and δt is contact time between nzvi and no3 n itrc 2005 results of choe et al 2004 yang and lee 2005 on a batch experiment indicated that using of a much greater bet surface area for nzvi more extensive than 31 4 m2 g the first order or pseudo first order reaction could not model the reaction between nzvi and no3 n however choosing the best fitted reaction model is needed for more investigations in this study a mixed order reaction model was reported by huang and zhang 2004 is used to obtain the δt value 2 d c d t μ α s ρ m c k n c where αs is the specific surface area of nzvi m 2 g ρ m is the mass concentration of fe0 g l μ is the specific nitrate reduction rate mm m 2 min k n is the half saturation concentration of n mm and c the no3 n concentration in the bulk solution mm integrating equation 2 with respect to c 0 c i n f to c c e f f and t 0 to t results in 3 δ t t t 0 k n ln c e f f c i n f c e f f c i n f μ α s ρ m where c eff and c inf are the influent and effluent n concentration in prb respectively the value of ρ m can be calculated as follows tratnyek et al 2003 4 ρ m m f e 0 v s o l where m fe 0 is the mass of nzvi v sol is the volume of solution and δt is the required contact time between no3 n and nzvi in the gate to reduce c inf to c eff 2 6 laboratory prb setup to study the performance of the prb in removing nitrate cadmium and chromium a laboratory model was made of plexiglass with dimensions of 17 95 40 schematically fig 4 for desired dimensions the proportion of the flow path length in the aquifer prb and the hydraulic head is needed to attain the considered velocities in the aquifer and prb also prb width is significant in achieving the required contact time of no3 n and nzvi the funnel and gate setup of prb was used with a length of 15 cm perpendicular to the water direction contaminated water was passed through a 45 funnels convergence angle rocca et al 2007 as an aquifer model sand with an effective diameter of d50 1 50 mm and a maximum and minimum diameter of 6 and 0 075 mm is used according to the guideline of itrc 3 3 interstate technology regulatory council itrc established in 1995 2011 the flow velocity of prb should be 50 75 of the aquifer flow velocity reactive area formation prb media consists of sand with an effective diameter of d50 1 20 mm and maximum and minimum diameter of 4 75 and 0 075 mm respectively a primary reservoir was provided to supply influent water with certain no3 n cadmium cd chromium vi concentration into the porous medium a supply reservoir in upstream and downstream of the permeable reactive barrier was considered to make a steady state condition of the stream through the aquifer according to darcy s equation an absolute pore velocity through the medium was prepared with adjustment of water level in these reservoirs ataie ashtiani et al 1999 the tank was placed vertically and filled with water and sand at the height of 5 cm to establish a homogeneous porous medium and prevent air entrapment then to reach the highest density such as groundwater aquifers 5 cm layers were compacted the hydraulic load of the inlet and outlet flow of the porous medium was controlled by inserting a cylinder before entering the porous medium as well as installing a valve in the outlet flow path darcy s equation was used to create a pore velocity in the porous medium the flow velocity of the aquifer and prb area was adjusted to 1 71 and 0 79 m day respectively which attains the design requirements the initial concentration of nitrate chromium and cadmium according to the standard of drinking water was considered as 100 mg l and 5 3 mg l respectively the contaminant limit standards based on who 4 4 world health organization who and iranian standard table 2 the flow rate passes through the aquifer according to the site conditions it is worth noting that the flow velocity within the aquifer differs from the flow velocity in prb media it should be 50 75 of the aquifer flow velocity to prevent reverse flow and loss of nanoparticles as well as to achieve the desired contact time itrc 2011 before the start of the main trials several series of experiments were performed to determine the sampling time step at the specified positions the duration of injecting nanoparticles and the total experiment time most of the tests are performed at room temperature 25 celsius because of its essential effect on the reaction rate the main reservoir is provided separately to supply water flowing through the porous medium with a specific concentration of contaminated water the contaminants were prepared with a particular concentration of nitrate cadmium and chromium in the main tank manually adding salts of cd no3 2 nano3 and k2cr2o7 to attained the initial concentration of contaminants a specified volume tank of 6 2 l at the beginning and 1 7 l at the end of the laboratory model were designed to create a defined hydraulic gradient over the porous medium for adjusting the water level in the tanks and measuring the outlet discharge a valve was fitted in the downstream tank and was restricted to an upstream tank by a floating water height of 18 5 cm 35 cm of sand with a height of 20 cm was used to simulate the upstream aquifer of the reactive area the reactive barrier was also designed from 15 cm of sand with a height of 20 cm and prb was used as a funnel and gate containing sand with specified grading the prb with 135 convergence angle and 15 cm width was set up perpendicular to the contaminated plume the water used in all experiments contains the parameters shown in fig 3 and the amount of turbidity and ph was 0 1 ntu and 7 62 respectively the pressure gravity system was implemented to inject nanoparticles into the reactive area as follows 6 mm plastic tubes were drilled in a perpendicular flow direction with specified orifices at 0 5 and 0 75 cm intervals across the height which is shown in fig 4 before performing the main tests by dye injecting through the tubes it was assured that they were working correctly at the desired height 20 cm each experiment lasted 300 min with an 18 min interval among each sampling furthermore the initial 30 min was assigned to the injection of nanoparticles once every 10 min 10 ml of nzvi was dissolved in distilled water and injected into the reaction medium for 30 min according to the msds 5 5 material safety data sheet instructions the nanoparticles should be subjected to ultrasonic waves for homogeneous dispersion in the aqueous phase the ultrasonic device of the laboratory of tehran university engineering faculty was used to disperse the nanoparticles for 15 min with ultrasonic waves for determining the effect of the injectable nanoparticles 2 and 3 mg l concentrations were used the initial concentration values and the consumed nanoparticles were selected based on previous research choe et al 2004 finally 15 samples for each contaminant and scenario total of 90 samples were prepared the width of the prb in the direction of flow w cannot be precisely determined without modular tests because of its essential role in the prb s efficiency in removing contaminants it is also necessary for the contact of reactive materials iron nanoparticles and contaminants in the prb but due to the variety of parameters and the difficulty of modeling experiments previous studies for the desired prb length ranging from 10 to 12 cm were considered according to the prb design and implementation guide issued by the itrc team in 2011 iron nanoparticles move about 10 cm through porous media for wet and drought effects that produce different hydraulic gradients the required thickness must be considered beyond 10 to 12 the suitable prb thickness was demonstrated by controlling the absence of nanoparticles in the output flow the ability to face unsupervised tasks encouraged the interest in deep learning in the early stages but successes in supervised learning outshined this mirbagheri 2019 jodeiri et al 2019 in this study we propose a deep feed forward neural network devised for our particular regression problem the selected model is the basis of deep learning models which processes the raw input through multiple layers using supervised learning that transforms the raw input data into a higher abstract and representative features 2 7 criteria for analysis to evaluate models performance five statistical measures are employed the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse the mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae and nash r2 value varies between zero and 1 0 the closer it is to 1 0 the more accurate the prediction is the rmse value should be close to zero smaller mape value shows a better forecast all the statistics are strongly influenced by the size of data as well as the outliers noori et al 2011 2 8 calibration and verification of deep model artificial neural network ann is a computational tool inspired by the nervous system mcculloch and pitts 1943 it consists of some simple computational units neurons organized in groups called layers these units are highly connected and the weighted connections transfer the information from one unit to another one the purpose of the network is to approximate a complicated function by adjusting the connection weights through the training process the desired ann architecture which is the number of layers units and the way they are interconnected has to be found through trial and error one of the distinguishing features of ann that makes them attractive for forecasting tasks is that there are a few prior assumptions about the models for problems under study khashei and bijari 2010 deep feedforward neural network structure assumes that all input variables are independent of each other britz 2015 also it assumes that inputs order has no meaning improvements in the study of ann led to the concept of deep learning dl which is a subset of machine learning dl utilizes a multi layer neural network and provides a powerful algorithm for supervised problems e g regression and classification each dl model includes a part for extracting the distinctive features of the input data and another for mapping these features to the output we use a typical dl model i e a deep feed forward network for our problem the more the number of layers and units the higher the complexity of the function that the network represents fig 5 represents the structure of our proposed n l 7 layer network consisted of three parts one input layer five hidden layers and one output layer the output vector y of the k th layer can be obtained via 5 y k f k w k t y k 1 b k k 1 t o n l where y 0 is the input w k is the n u k n u k 1 weight matrix where n u k is the number of units in the k th layer b k is bias value and y n l is the network output for hidden layers the activation function f k is selected as rectified linear units relu function 6 f k a max 0 a k 1 t o n l 1 and for the output layer activation function f n l the linear function is commonly used in regression problems 7 f k a a k n l in the training phase mean squared error e is computed using the difference between the network output and the desired output many learning methods are available to minimize this error e and adjusting the network parameters including stochastic gradient descent with momentum root mean squared propagation and adam kingma and ba 2014 adam is an adaptive first order stochastic optimization which has shown promising results in training various dnns this method alters network parameters using the following update rule 8 m l β 1 m l 1 1 β 1 e w l 9 v l β 2 v l 1 1 β 2 e w l 2 10 m l m l 1 β 1 11 v l v l 1 β 2 12 δ w l α m l v l ε where m l and v l are the 1st and 2nd moment estimates β 1 β 2 0 1 are 1st and 2nd moment decay rates m l and v l are bias corrected 1st and 2nd moment estimates α r is the learning rate ε 0 is a numerical term and δ w is the weights update in the l th iteration finally the trained network is used to predict the output of the new samples in the test set 3 result and discussion for each contaminant two scenarios were considered fig 6 ninety samples were studied for contaminants and evaluated fig 7 in each scenario the effect of flow velocity and the amount of adsorbent nanoparticles on the final elimination ratio of contaminants have been investigated in the first scenario the flow rate and consumed nanoparticles are considered to be 3 m day and 2 g l respectively in the second scenario these values are increased to 5 m day and 3 g l in all experiments the elimination ratio increased at the beginning and decreased in the ultimate process finally it is fixed at an interval of between 40 and 50 approximately the relative percentage of elimination increases to about 70 as a result of the increasing amount of nzvi consumption in the second scenario the performance of our system has been more stable and prosperous in heavy metals removal this result can be related to the difference between heavy metals and the nitrate removal process thus the system may be affected by the decomposition and absorption processes to a great extent fig 7 3 1 comparing deep model with developed svm and lr models both svm and lr models have been developed to predict the outlet concentration of the triple contaminants to compare them with the deep model the results are summarized in table 3 as can be seen the r2 value of the deep model is more than the others the results of mape and mae show that the deep model has a lower error in comparison to others in predicting the amount of each contaminant rmse of each model is suitable and near to zero finally the nash coefficient of our model is more than svm and lr especially for determining chromium cr in this study despite using the small dataset of laboratory pilot a deep model was developed which is more reliable and applicable in today s practice therefore comparing the results of the developed deep model and both well known models support the superiority of the deep model to svm and lr the results of nitrate removal modeling by our deep neural network dnn indicate that this method is suitable for prediction of removal rate based on the components mentioned above the process of estimating the residual concentration of nitrate was proportionate to our expanded model in the paper deep model and modeled the process with an error of less than 8 compared to other approaches the method developed in this paper provides more accurate results in general all three models performed better in the second scenario fig 8 the results of deep neural networks dnn indicate that this method is suitable for predicting the removal rate of chromium the process of estimating the residual concentration of chromium was proportionate to our expanded model in the paper deep model and modeled the process with an error of less than 8 compared to other approaches the method developed in this paper provides more accurate results but it is not acceptable in the process of chromium removal about 5 10 is absorbed by the natural soil and the primary chromium is converted to cr iii with a high potential settling rate failure to achieve the appropriate results by the models may be due to the above conditions or lack of a big dataset for accurate modeling fig 9 in the first scenario estimating the residual concentration of cadmium is not well done however by increasing the concentration of nanoparticles in the second scenario we achieved a much better estimate of the variation the cadmium removal process was only carried out by adsorption thus the amount of nzvi enhancement in the barrier provided reasonable estimates finally the dnn developed model performed better than others fig 10 4 conclusion in this paper the permeable reactive barrier containing iron nanoparticles was designed to remove nitrate chromium and cadmium simultaneously accordingly the present research might be considered as a field project since various conditions such as simultaneous contaminants drinking water with chemical interfering elements high initial concentration contaminants and natural sand have been taken since the longevity of the nanoparticles is reduced during the removal processes further studies ought to be carried out on the modification of nanoparticles the average elimination of contaminants was stabilized at about 45 of the initial value then we designed a 7 layer deep feed forward neural network to predict the residual groundwater contaminants to assess our model s performance we compared the results with two well known machine learning algorithms support vector machine svm and linear regression lr r2 rmse mae nash and mape statistical measures are considered to evaluate the accuracy of these three models in predicting nitrate cadmium and chromium contaminants based on experimental data our dnn model could estimate nitrate cadmium and chromium with a mean absolute percentage error mape 7 05 7 32 and 7 84 respectively the results represent the superiority of the dnn model despite the absence of a big dataset the deep model could capture more variations of the removal rates than other models owing to the complexity of the estimated function furthermore svm surpassed lr on account of the inherent non linear characteristic of the regression problem notably among the three contaminants nitrate estimation is performed more accurately and recommended for future large scale modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the following are the

introduction environmental pollution of heavy metals is a global health problem due to its chemical stability and potential bioaccumulation in the body of living organisms high levels of these metals might cause mortality morphological disorders reduced growth and genetic effects in humans based on surveys conducted on watersheds in iran nitrate cadmium and chromium are among the pollutants in existing groundwater resources shahdadi and muslimpour 2011 hence the control and elimination of these pollutants are required more than ever before nanotechnology is also applicable for direct injection into groundwater due to the smaller size and cost saving of adsorbent associated with other in situ technologies especially for deep groundwater elliott and zhang 2001 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi reactivity is rapidly reduced due to small particle size the reaction with other components and rapid flocculation itrc 2011 supporting nanomaterials with sand or activated carbon is considerable for the purification of drinking water itrc 2011 permeable reactive barriers prbs based on iron nanoparticles are used as a useful technology to remove most contaminants from groundwater one of the main reasons for using these types of barriers is their widespread economic benefits these barriers operate as passive functions it implies that relatively low energy or technician other

2011 in the funnel and gate system the funnel walls form a very impermeable material to divert and converge the groundwater contaminated flow a funnel and gate system used to remove water pollution in

itrc 2011 ahn et al 2008 showed the effect of three temperatures of 25 50 and 75 c on the process of nitrate reduction in water by nzvis the results showed that increasing the temperature from 25 to 75 c increases nitrate reduction in acidic and alkaline media nzvi removes a wide range of contaminants including chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene tce tetrachloroethylene pce carbon tetrachloride zhang 2003 perchlorate nitrate and metals such as chromium nickel mercury vanadium and arsenic gordon et al 2005 kanel et al 2007 cai et al 2020 overviewed the evolution of stabilized nanoparticles concerning environmental cleanup uses encompassing the fundamental principles and bench to field scale experimentations toward an innovative in situ remediation technology using stabilized nanoparticles the merits and limitations of the remediation are discussed hexavalent chromium cr vi is a toxic contaminant with high mobility in the aqueous phase and it has been found widely in subsurface aquifers kazakis et al 2017 peng et al 2018 the use of mg oh 2 coating is a promising technique to improve the longevity and capacity of nzvi for full scale in situ soil and groundwater cr vi remediation hu et al 2019 s nzvi has a great potential application in nitrate removal of drinking water li et al 2020 recent studies indicate that several modifications of prb design have been done to improve their performance most of them seek to adopt the geological conditions of the area increase the possibility of widespread treatment of contaminants using relatively cheap materials yang and lee 2005 phillips et al 2010 hosseini et al 2011 van nooten et al 2010 used sequential reaction barriers they focused on removal processes for a combination of organic and inorganic contaminants such as ammonium adsorbable organic halogen aox chemical oxygen demand cod and secondary products of nitrification and denitrification permeable reactive intersect pri is a new approach to multi reactive barriers that have recently been used as a remedy for the transmission of contamination in the denitrification process of bioreactors fenton suggested that the pri system is quite suitable for treating agricultural pollutants fenton et al 2014 itrc 2011 reported that prbs treated 38 of the contaminants on the field scale from 1994 to 2009 to date reactive barriers are considered as a novel technology of more than 200 field projects itrc 2011 there are numerous papers regarding permeable reactive barriers that have focused on removing pollutants with reactive media containing iron nanoparticles scherer et al 2000 henderson and demond 2007 noubactep 2010 van nooten used a mixture of reactive substances to successfully eliminate organic and inorganic contaminants such as ammonium aox van nooten et al 2010 hosseini used nano fe cu prb to reduce no3 n the best results in no3 n reduction has been obtained in 75 of initial concentration with 8 g l 1 fe cu

barrier prb generated from pit toilet leachate containing various adsorption media mittal et al 2020 the naz nzvi 1 1 sodium zeolite nzvi composite is capable of removing cd by adsorption and is applicable in prbs thus it seems that the composite mentioned above is a proper candidate for groundwater remediation from a wide range of metal ions tasharrofi et al 2020 nzvi focused research has progressed over the past two decades from laboratory development to field scale applications phenrat and lowry 2019 have recently reviewed this historical perspective nzvi prbs are used in a wide scale in the usa in addition to nzvi prbs has been used to treat over twenty sites in europe mainly in the czech republic italy france belgium portugal spain denmark and switzerland bardos et al 2018 nzvi for cr vi reduction was used in the polluted site of the northern part of the czech republic the rapid reductive effect of nzvi was observed at a distance of 7 m down gradient of flow direction němeček et al 2015 filip et al 2020 oprčkal et al 2017 investigated the effects of different nzvi particles bare nzvi and borohydride nzvi on heavy metals bacteria and content of nitrogen in real effluent water from a small biological wastewater treatment plant in another study a full scale application of nzvi for heavy metal removal from wastewater of the jiangxi copper company china has been reported li et al 2017 singh et al 2020 developed a numerical model with visual modflow to evaluate a multi prb system s performance over the temporal and spatial groundwater quality variations they show that the contaminant plume containing chloride is efficiently captured by the multi prb system in the proximity of the point sources a vast number of models have been used for water resources forecasting which can be characterized as numerical physical descriptive and empirical data driven models costly hydrogeological meteorological geomorphological and geophysical input data uncertainty due to the inaccuracy of physical properties and high computational complexity of numerical models fostered an interest in empirical models also empirical models require fewer assumptions about the complex mechanisms used in numerical modeling chen et al 2020 conducted a comparative study among three machine learning models mlp rbf and svm and a classic numerical model modflow for simulating groundwater dynamics of a 9016 km2 study area based on historical data collected from january 1986 to december 2010 their results showed that the performance of machine learning models was better than the numerical model on the contrary an abrupt change in the behavior of the system could fail the empirical modeling due to their insufficient capability to generalize ann has been proved to be an effective tool in various water resources based regression problems daliakopoulos et al 2005 provides an optimal ann architecture for groundwater level forecasting a few studies applied ann for predicting contaminants of groundwater in their particular regions ostad ali askari et al 2017 yesilnacar et al 2008 wagh et al 2017 zaqoot et al 2018 found multiple layer perceptron mlp neural network to be better than radial basis function rbf for estimating nitrate contamination furthermore ann allows a continuous learning process where the input data can continuously be updated creating a larger database hence provides an asset for long run prediction santisukkasaem et al 2015 developed an ann structure to evaluate the permeability decline of prb in the long term the authors compared this model with multiple regression analysis methods mra which led them to decide that ann modeling is a promising tool for long term simulation of the permeability loss in prbs in a recent study a deep learning model outperformed linear regression in groundwater recharge prediction huang et al 2019 in spite of the fact that conventional machine learning approaches such as svm and lr work well on a lot of problems they suffer some limitations in generalization the curse of dimensionality smoothness regularization and manifold learning challenges which the simple machine learning algorithms fail to respond motivated the development of deep learning goodfellow et al 2016 overcoming these obstacles has made deep learning a powerful tool in various regression problems jodeiri et al 2018 2020 the developed models and the results of this study may be useful for accurate groundwater management decision making and model selection future research should be focused on exploring the applicability of deep learning methods or tree based machine learning algorithms in the hydrologic field and application of the developed models to manage groundwater resources chen et al 2020 according to previous researches no3 n cr vi and cd are severe challenges in groundwater management and supported nzvis are suitable for removal of them so in the present study iron nanoparticles are used for the simultaneous treatment of heavy metals e g chromium vi cadmium iii and mineral anions nitrate from simulated groundwater the purification method is designed as a permeable reactive barrier prb that injects nzvi into the treatment zone primary data is obtained from experiments furthermore to predict the residual contaminants three popular machine learning methods are investigated and the results are evaluated by comparing them with the experimental data to the best of our knowledge no deep neural network model has been employed in groundwater pollution estimation but some best fitted studies have been considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 specifications of nanoparticles the iron nanoparticles with a purity of 99 5 and a particle diameter of about 35 70 nm were provided from mehregan chemistry company 2 2 karaj iran more details of these particles are shown in table 1 2 2 solid phase analysis the solid phase requires a widespread morphological profile internal structure composition and chemistry of the nzvi surface that reacts with the pollutants the solid phase analysis was carried out at the laboratory of iranian pioneers in nanomaterials approval of nanoparticles is based on x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem transient electron microscopy tem 2 3 x ray diffraction xrd an x ray xrd analysis shows the intensity of absorption at different angles of radiation in the range obtained a peak of 45 and 65 and also other minor peaks are observed which indicates the presence of a small amount of different iron oxides in the sample fig 1 2 4 scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem the sem image of nanoscale particles illustrates their spherical shape the shell a thin film of metal oxide and the core are made with zvi moreover based on the tem images obtained from iron nanoparticles the average diameter of the prepared nanoparticles was 50 nm it is noteworthy that all test processes must be designed as far away as the oxygen supply because the degree reaction of the final product is highly dependent on the lack of oxygen interference during the synthesis process fig 2 2 5 steady state design of prb a fundamental challenge in the prb studies is how to guarantee sufficient contact between contaminants and adsorbent to meet the sorption objective naftz et al 2002 uncoated nzvi could move a few centimeters about 10 cm in the subsurface soil itrc 2005 the cadmium was removed by the adsorption process cr vi was converted to cr iii with settling ability no3 n disintegrated into less harmful products so the no3 n removal process is more time consuming and complicated than chromium vi and cadmium eglal 2014 furthermore dispersive processes in prb make no3 n as a dominant element because of the low velocity of groundwater low molecular diffusion and dominating the chemical degradation of n by nzvi itrc 2005 due to the constant effect of flow velocity on contaminants the contact time of no3 n was considered in the width calculating formula so the width of prb in the direction of the groundwater flow must be as follows 1 w v a δ t where w is the required width of prb va is the actual velocity of water in prb calculated from va vd n vd darcy s velocity in porous media and n the media porosity and δt is contact time between nzvi and no3 n itrc 2005 results of choe et al 2004 yang and lee 2005 on a batch experiment indicated that using of a much greater bet surface area for nzvi more extensive than 31 4 m2 g the first order or pseudo first order reaction could not model the reaction between nzvi and no3 n however choosing the best fitted reaction model is needed for more investigations in this study a mixed order reaction model was reported by huang and zhang 2004 is used to obtain the δt value 2 d c d t μ α s ρ m c k n c where αs is the specific surface area of nzvi m 2 g ρ m is the mass concentration of fe0 g l μ is the specific nitrate reduction rate mm m 2 min k n is the half saturation concentration of n mm and c the no3 n concentration in the bulk solution mm integrating equation 2 with respect to c 0 c i n f to c c e f f and t 0 to t results in 3 δ t t t 0 k n ln c e f f c i n f c e f f c i n f μ α s ρ m where c eff and c inf are the influent and effluent n concentration in prb respectively the value of ρ m can be calculated as follows tratnyek et al 2003 4 ρ m m f e 0 v s o l where m fe 0 is the mass of nzvi v sol is the volume of solution and δt is the required contact time between no3 n and nzvi in the gate to reduce c inf to c eff 2 6 laboratory prb setup to study the performance of the prb in removing nitrate cadmium and chromium a laboratory model was made of plexiglass with dimensions of 17 95 40 schematically fig 4 for desired dimensions the proportion of the flow path length in the aquifer prb and the hydraulic head is needed to attain the considered velocities in the aquifer and prb also prb width is significant in achieving the required contact time of no3 n and nzvi the funnel and gate setup of prb was used with a length of 15 cm perpendicular to the water direction contaminated water was passed through a 45 funnels convergence angle rocca et al 2007 as an aquifer model sand with an effective diameter of d50 1 50 mm and a maximum and minimum diameter of 6 and 0 075 mm is used according to the guideline of itrc 3 3 interstate technology regulatory council itrc established in 1995 2011 the flow velocity of prb should be 50 75 of the aquifer flow velocity reactive area formation prb media consists of sand with an effective diameter of d50 1 20 mm and maximum and minimum diameter of 4 75 and 0 075 mm respectively a primary reservoir was provided to supply influent water with certain no3 n cadmium cd chromium vi concentration into the porous medium a supply reservoir in upstream and downstream of the permeable reactive barrier was considered to make a steady state condition of the stream through the aquifer according to darcy s equation an absolute pore velocity through the medium was prepared with adjustment of water level in these reservoirs ataie ashtiani et al 1999 the tank was placed vertically and filled with water and sand at the height of 5 cm to establish a homogeneous porous medium and prevent air entrapment then to reach the highest density such as groundwater aquifers 5 cm layers were compacted the hydraulic load of the inlet and outlet flow of the porous medium was controlled by inserting a cylinder before entering the porous medium as well as installing a valve in the outlet flow path darcy s equation was used to create a pore velocity in the porous medium the flow velocity of the aquifer and prb area was adjusted to 1 71 and 0 79 m day respectively which attains the design requirements the initial concentration of nitrate chromium and cadmium according to the standard of drinking water was considered as 100 mg l and 5 3 mg l respectively the contaminant limit standards based on who 4 4 world health organization who and iranian standard table 2 the flow rate passes through the aquifer according to the site conditions it is worth noting that the flow velocity within the aquifer differs from the flow velocity in prb media it should be 50 75 of the aquifer flow velocity to prevent reverse flow and loss of nanoparticles as well as to achieve the desired contact time itrc 2011 before the start of the main trials several series of experiments were performed to determine the sampling time step at the specified positions the duration of injecting nanoparticles and the total experiment time most of the tests are performed at room temperature 25 celsius because of its essential effect on the reaction rate the main reservoir is provided separately to supply water flowing through the porous medium with a specific concentration of contaminated water the contaminants were prepared with a particular concentration of nitrate cadmium and chromium in the main tank manually adding salts of cd no3 2 nano3 and k2cr2o7 to attained the initial concentration of contaminants a specified volume tank of 6 2 l at the beginning and 1 7 l at the end of the laboratory model were designed to create a defined hydraulic gradient over the porous medium for adjusting the water level in the tanks and measuring the outlet discharge a valve was fitted in the downstream tank and was restricted to an upstream tank by a floating water height of 18 5 cm 35 cm of sand with a height of 20 cm was used to simulate the upstream aquifer of the reactive area the reactive barrier was also designed from 15 cm of sand with a height of 20 cm and prb was used as a funnel and gate containing sand with specified grading the prb with 135 convergence angle and 15 cm width was set up perpendicular to the contaminated plume the water used in all experiments contains the parameters shown in fig 3 and the amount of turbidity and ph was 0 1 ntu and 7 62 respectively the pressure gravity system was implemented to inject nanoparticles into the reactive area as follows 6 mm plastic tubes were drilled in a perpendicular flow direction with specified orifices at 0 5 and 0 75 cm intervals across the height which is shown in fig 4 before performing the main tests by dye injecting through the tubes it was assured that they were working correctly at the desired height 20 cm each experiment lasted 300 min with an 18 min interval among each sampling furthermore the initial 30 min was assigned to the injection of nanoparticles once every 10 min 10 ml of nzvi was dissolved in distilled water and injected into the reaction medium for 30 min according to the msds 5 5 material safety data sheet instructions the nanoparticles should be subjected to ultrasonic waves for homogeneous dispersion in the aqueous phase the ultrasonic device of the laboratory of tehran university engineering faculty was used to disperse the nanoparticles for 15 min with ultrasonic waves for determining the effect of the injectable nanoparticles 2 and 3 mg l concentrations were used the initial concentration values and the consumed nanoparticles were selected based on previous research choe et al 2004 finally 15 samples for each contaminant and scenario total of 90 samples were prepared the width of the prb in the direction of flow w cannot be precisely determined without modular tests because of its essential role in the prb s efficiency in removing contaminants it is also necessary for the contact of reactive materials iron nanoparticles and contaminants in the prb but due to the variety of parameters and the difficulty of modeling experiments previous studies for the desired prb length ranging from 10 to 12 cm were considered according to the prb design and implementation guide issued by the itrc team in 2011 iron nanoparticles move about 10 cm through porous media for wet and drought effects that produce different hydraulic gradients the required thickness must be considered beyond 10 to 12 the suitable prb thickness was demonstrated by controlling the absence of nanoparticles in the output flow the ability to face unsupervised tasks encouraged the interest in deep learning in the early stages but successes in supervised learning outshined this mirbagheri 2019 jodeiri et al 2019 in this study we propose a deep feed forward neural network devised for our particular regression problem the selected model is the basis of deep learning models which processes the raw input through multiple layers using supervised learning that transforms the raw input data into a higher abstract and representative features 2 7 criteria for analysis to evaluate models performance five statistical measures are employed the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse the mean absolute percentage error mape mean absolute error mae and nash r2 value varies between zero and 1 0 the closer it is to 1 0 the more accurate the prediction is the rmse value should be close to zero smaller mape value shows a better forecast all the statistics are strongly influenced by the size of data as well as the outliers noori et al 2011 2 8 calibration and verification of deep model artificial neural network ann is a computational tool inspired by the nervous system mcculloch and pitts 1943 it consists of some simple computational units neurons organized in groups called layers these units are highly connected and the weighted connections transfer the information from one unit to another one the purpose of the network is to approximate a complicated function by adjusting the connection weights through the training process the desired ann architecture which is the number of layers units and the way they are interconnected has to be found through trial and error one of the distinguishing features of ann that makes them attractive for forecasting tasks is that there are a few prior assumptions about the models for problems under study khashei and bijari 2010 deep feedforward neural network structure assumes that all input variables are independent of each other britz 2015 also it assumes that inputs order has no meaning improvements in the study of ann led to the concept of deep learning dl which is a subset of machine learning dl utilizes a multi layer neural network and provides a powerful algorithm for supervised problems e g regression and classification each dl model includes a part for extracting the distinctive features of the input data and another for mapping these features to the output we use a typical dl model i e a deep feed forward network for our problem the more the number of layers and units the higher the complexity of the function that the network represents fig 5 represents the structure of our proposed n l 7 layer network consisted of three parts one input layer five hidden layers and one output layer the output vector y of the k th layer can be obtained via 5 y k f k w k t y k 1 b k k 1 t o n l where y 0 is the input w k is the n u k n u k 1 weight matrix where n u k is the number of units in the k th layer b k is bias value and y n l is the network output for hidden layers the activation function f k is selected as rectified linear units relu function 6 f k a max 0 a k 1 t o n l 1 and for the output layer activation function f n l the linear function is commonly used in regression problems 7 f k a a k n l in the training phase mean squared error e is computed using the difference between the network output and the desired output many learning methods are available to minimize this error e and adjusting the network parameters including stochastic gradient descent with momentum root mean squared propagation and adam kingma and ba 2014 adam is an adaptive first order stochastic optimization which has shown promising results in training various dnns this method alters network parameters using the following update rule 8 m l β 1 m l 1 1 β 1 e w l 9 v l β 2 v l 1 1 β 2 e w l 2 10 m l m l 1 β 1 11 v l v l 1 β 2 12 δ w l α m l v l ε where m l and v l are the 1st and 2nd moment estimates β 1 β 2 0 1 are 1st and 2nd moment decay rates m l and v l are bias corrected 1st and 2nd moment estimates α r is the learning rate ε 0 is a numerical term and δ w is the weights update in the l th iteration finally the trained network is used to predict the output of the new samples in the test set 3 result and discussion for each contaminant two scenarios were considered fig 6 ninety samples were studied for contaminants and evaluated fig 7 in each scenario the effect of flow velocity and the amount of adsorbent nanoparticles on the final elimination ratio of contaminants have been investigated in the first scenario the flow rate and consumed nanoparticles are considered to be 3 m day and 2 g l respectively in the second scenario these values are increased to 5 m day and 3 g l in all experiments the elimination ratio increased at the beginning and decreased in the ultimate process finally it is fixed at an interval of between 40 and 50 approximately the relative percentage of elimination increases to about 70 as a result of the increasing amount of nzvi consumption in the second scenario the performance of our system has been more stable and prosperous in heavy metals removal this result can be related to the difference between heavy metals and the nitrate removal process thus the system may be affected by the decomposition and absorption processes to a great extent fig 7 3 1 comparing deep model with developed svm and lr models both svm and lr models have been developed to predict the outlet concentration of the triple contaminants to compare them with the deep model the results are summarized in table 3 as can be seen the r2 value of the deep model is more than the others the results of mape and mae show that the deep model has a lower error in comparison to others in predicting the amount of each contaminant rmse of each model is suitable and near to zero finally the nash coefficient of our model is more than svm and lr especially for determining chromium cr in this study despite using the small dataset of laboratory pilot a deep model was developed which is more reliable and applicable in today s practice therefore comparing the results of the developed deep model and both well known models support the superiority of the deep model to svm and lr the results of nitrate removal modeling by our deep neural network dnn indicate that this method is suitable for prediction of removal rate based on the components mentioned above the process of estimating the residual concentration of nitrate was proportionate to our expanded model in the paper deep model and modeled the process with an error of less than 8 compared to other approaches the method developed in this paper provides more accurate results in general all three models performed better in the second scenario fig 8 the results of deep neural networks dnn indicate that this method is suitable for predicting the removal rate of chromium the process of estimating the residual concentration of chromium was proportionate to our expanded model in the paper deep model and modeled the process with an error of less than 8 compared to other approaches the method developed in this paper provides more accurate results but it is not acceptable in the process of chromium removal about 5 10 is absorbed by the natural soil and the primary chromium is converted to cr iii with a high potential settling rate failure to achieve the appropriate results by the models may be due to the above conditions or lack of a big dataset for accurate modeling fig 9 in the first scenario estimating the residual concentration of cadmium is not well done however by increasing the concentration of nanoparticles in the second scenario we achieved a much better estimate of the variation the cadmium removal process was only carried out by adsorption thus the amount of nzvi enhancement in the barrier provided reasonable estimates finally the dnn developed model performed better than others fig 10 4 conclusion in this paper the permeable reactive barrier containing iron nanoparticles was designed to remove nitrate chromium and cadmium simultaneously accordingly the present research might be considered as a field project since various conditions such as simultaneous contaminants drinking water with chemical interfering elements high initial concentration contaminants and natural sand have been taken since the longevity of the nanoparticles is reduced during the removal processes further studies ought to be carried out on the modification of nanoparticles the average elimination of contaminants was stabilized at about 45 of the initial value then we designed a 7 layer deep feed forward neural network to predict the residual groundwater contaminants to assess our model s performance we compared the results with two well known machine learning algorithms support vector machine svm and linear regression lr r2 rmse mae nash and mape statistical measures are considered to evaluate the accuracy of these three models in predicting nitrate cadmium and chromium contaminants based on experimental data our dnn model could estimate nitrate cadmium and chromium with a mean absolute percentage error mape 7 05 7 32 and 7 84 respectively the results represent the superiority of the dnn model despite the absence of a big dataset the deep model could capture more variations of the removal rates than other models owing to the complexity of the estimated function furthermore svm surpassed lr on account of the inherent non linear characteristic of the regression problem notably among the three contaminants nitrate estimation is performed more accurately and recommended for future large scale modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supplementary data the following are the

factors fuzzy membership gis groundwater potentiality sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater is one of the significant natural potable water resources that form in existing voids and fractures in geological units and sub surface sediments naghibi et al 2015 it has the vital role not only in human well being but it also affects the ecological system and the economic growth the total easily available earth freshwater is about 15 ayibotele 1992 this limited potable resource necessitates to be utilized with more efficient way globally due to the rapid growth of population explosion the per capita available water is decreasing with time that leads to the threatening to human being owing to this critical issue worldwide combined with climate change the significance of groundwater has gained the highest attention for the whole environmental safety and life support structure however to fulfill the growing demand of groundwater for the domestic industrial and agricultural purposes the declination of groundwater has become a serious concern according to shah et al 2003 tube wells and power operated wells serve about 60 of the irrigation requirement in india in future the supply of freshwater is likely to be the most challenging task due to depletion of groundwater increased supply demand and irresponsible utilization of this natural resource that needs immediate effective planning and management for groundwater replenishment mapping of groundwater potential zones is the platform that can provide the solution for the sustainable use of groundwater resources in this field of research recently the utilization of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis has achieved popularity many research works related to delineation of groundwater potential zone using rs and gis technique had been reported till date murthy 2000 sener et al 2005 dar et al 2010 pasupuleti et al 2019 several researchers used gis based model coupled

groundwater being the primary source of drinking water of the district it fulfills the domestic requirements cgwb 2013 groundwater development within the district is mainly focused to meet the requirements of irrigational and domestic services thus to maintain the groundwater sustainability and its replenishment strategy needs urgent attention the mapping of groundwater potential zones can be very much helpful to initiate proper groundwater management actions in this region jhariya 2019 conducted a study for delineating groundwater potential zones in chhokra nala micro watershed covering only six villages 220 km2 area which falls within raipur district the author utilized gis and rs based overlay model considering ten hydrogeo meteorological layers such as geology drainage

delineation was carried out using eight litho hydrogeological factors in arang block western part of the district singha and pasupuleti 2020 hence the current study aims to cover up the whole district for the zonation of groundwater potentiality fuzzy gis approach helps to estimate the importance of factors using fuzzy membership fm value in a very efficient way however to our best knowledge in the present study for the first time fuzzy gis approach has been considered to delineate the groundwater potential zones based on the literature survey none of the research work had been focused in this region hence in the present study the integrated technique of fuzzy gis has been carried out for the development of sustainable groundwater resource within the study area 2 study area raipur district

extending 2 km of river mahanadi cgwb 2013 cavernous limestone chandi formation poses the highest groundwater yield 0 5 14 lps in the study area followed by charmuria limestone yield 0 5 to 7 lps and shale deposits of gunderdehi formation yield 0 1 to 3 lps respectively river mahanadi and kharun are the two major rivers flowing through eastern and western boundary of the district covering lengths of 51 75 km and 89 5 km respectively 3 data and methods 3 1 selection of controlling factors respective sub classes and rating assignment the groundwater availability of any region depends on various earth features i e hydro geological factors as well as meteorological units andualem and demeke 2019 singha et al 2019 based on the above facts and available data a total of eleven groundwater influencing factors namely aquifer geomorphology drainage density slope elevation lineament density land use land cover soil texture rainfall distribution proximity to surface water body and water table depth were used to delineate the gpzs within the study region the various sources of the applied data are described in table 1 all the selected possible responsible factors and their respective sub classes were initially examined with groundwater experts working within the study region a suitable rating system from 1 to 10 scales was assigned to the factors sub class based on their relative importance on groundwater occurrence the adopted subjective judgment for rating assignment was done in such a manner that higher the importance towards groundwater potentiality higher the rating was allocated to the factors sub class the reclassified thematic maps for all the factors were prepared using arcgis 10 4 the details of the adopted methodology are shown in fig 2 3 2 development of gpz map the fuzzy geospatial technique was used to develop the gpz map in gis environment it is a two tire approach namely computation of fuzzy membership fm values of each factor through proper fm function and overlaying of fm build layers using suitable operator to overlay the fm based layers in gis platform according to zadeh 1965 the fuzzy set fs theory allows the scale of object existence within a set in between 0 and 1 depending on the fm values every membership map of separate classes was prepared utilization of fuzzy overlay process permitted to analyze the possibility of occurrences associated with multiple set within the multi criteria overlay operation however based on the mapping with the domain of crisp inputs the fm function characterized the fs by generating degree of membership within 0 and 1 out of several fm function the selection of suitable function mainly depends on the midpoint and spread factors in addition appropriate fm function can be selected by relating the significance of each factor with the target mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 in the present study a linear fm function was adopted to generate fm values of all eleven controlling factors the fuzzy linear function establishes the linear relationship between the minimum and maximum inputs assigned by the user a zero value was allotted to those values which were less than the minimum whereas values higher than the maximum were allotted with the value of one respectively 1 μ y 0 i f y min 1 i f y max y min max min o t h e r w i s e where the min and max are user inputs depending on the control in groundwater occurrence the fm values of all factors were assigned all the selected factors fm spatial layers were prepared using kriging interpolation technique as it is the preeminent linear unbiased estimator webster and oliver 2007 kriging method estimates the unknown values using the weighted moving mean of known values fuzzy overlying operation of factors map can be performed using any five available fuzzy operators viz and or algebraic product algebraic sum and gamma fuzzy and operator is the same as intersection logical set that pull out the minimum fuzzy membership weight value of the pixel and consequently assign the extracted lowest value to the final output map the mathematical expression is given as 2 μ y min μ 1 y μ 2 y μ 3 y μ n y where μ1 μ2 μ3 μn are the membership weights of the respective factors layer and n is the number of factor layers selected fuzzy or operator is the same as the logical union set that pull out the maximum fuzzy membership weight value of the pixel and accordingly assign the extracted lowest value to the final output map as per eq 3 3 μ y max μ 1 y μ 2 y μ 3 y μ n y fuzzy algebraic product operator uses the multiplication value of any respective pixel from various selected factors layer in the computation process that results a decreased value this is due the effect of multiplication of smaller values less than 1 in this process a smaller number of pixels fall under the high groundwater potential category according to esri 2012 the selection of this operator is highly sensitive for any location the mathematical expression of fuzzy algebraic product is given in eq 4 4 μ y i 1 n μ i where μi represents the pixel s membership value for the factor i fuzzy algebraic sum operator produces linear combined output described by eq 5 thus it results in the increased pixel values in the final output map i e values tend to 1 or equal to the maximum contributing values esri 2012 5 μ y 1 i 1 n 1 μ i anbalagan et al 2015 reported that results of fuzzy and and fuzzy or were dominated as a result of single contributing fuzzy set in another study carried out by kayastha et al 2013 have shown the success rate of fuzzy gamma operator over the other operator in the current study fuzzy gamma operator eq 6 was used for overlaying operation of the groundwater control factors fm layers hence the gis fuzzy overlay tool was used to overlay the fm maps to develop the final gpz map of the study region 6 μ y f u z z y a lg e b r i c s u m γ f u z z y a lg e b r i c p r o d u c t 1 γ 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the significant factors among all eleven groundwater controlling with respect to the groundwater potentiality of the current study region in this process the fm spatially distributed map of each factor was removed at a time during the fuzzy overlay operation the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd values of groundwater potential indices were estimated for every overlaid map using eq 3 gogu and dassargues 2000 singha et al 2019 7 p i x g p z i n g p z x i n where p ix is the computed sensitivity in the removal of one factor x gpz i is the groundwater potential indices estimated by eq 2 gpz xi is the index value of groundwater potentiality estimated after removal of one factor x n and n are the number of total factors used in eq 2 11 and eq 3 10 respectively 3 4 validation of gpz map model validation was performed with 28 pumping well yield data of the study area the well yield values used for validation ranged from 0 02 to 31 00 lps liter per second represented the ground truth scenario of groundwater potentiality of different aquifers of the study area the yield values were categorized into three sub classes namely low 0 02 3 00 lps moderate 3 00 6 00 lps and high yield 6 00 lps the well points were superimposed on the developed gpz map the gpz indices of the respective well points were extracted to conduct the similarity analysis pearson s correlation analysis 4 results and discussion in this section geo spatial variation of selected controlling factors their importance on groundwater potentiality in terms of fuzzy memberships development of gpz map model sensitivity analysis and validation statistic are discussed 4 1 aquifer groundwater occurrence transport and storage are influenced by the sub surface lithology achu et al 2020 according to murasingh et al 2018 groundwater potentiality of any region is mainly attributed to the water bearing aquifers formations in the current study a total of six types of aquifers were identified namely purple calcareous shale limestone with dolomite with shale and sandstone grey bedded flaggy limestone laterite shale with chert and green clay bands and alluvium fig 3 a based on the groundwater potentiality the highest and lowest ratings were assigned to alluvium rating 10 and purple calcareous shale rating 4 table 2 the quaternary alluvium deposits in the study area comprises with gravel sand silt and clay particles that makes the alluvium aquifer highly permeable in nature as compared to the other aquifers and hence assigned with the maximum rating of 10 singha et al 2019 in the study area a shallow depth of laterite deposits bears high groundwater potentiality similarly the groundwater potentiality of grey bedded flaggy limestone charmuria formation as well as the limestone and dolomite with shale and sandstone chandi formation is also high due to higher permeability and porosity as compared to the purple calcareous shale gunderdehi formation cgwb 2011 a major portion of the study region covered by limestone with dolomite with shale and sandstone 51 76 which is mostly found in the western part whereas shale with chert and green clay bands 0 32 located in the upper northern part of the study area showed with the lowest areal distribution table 2 the fuzzy membership value of aquifer parameter varied between 0 0574 lowest and 0 8561 highest fig 4 a 4 2 geomorphology the topography and landform of a particular region is represented by its distributed geomorphological pattern that controls the groundwater occurrence within the area arulbalaji et al 2019 the surface geomorphological units of the study area were classified into six categories such as valley fill buried pediment flood plain pediment pediplain and alluvium fig 3b as per the relative importance with respect to the tendency towards infiltration of surface water into groundwater storage relatively higher ratings were assigned to the alluvium 8 pediplain 7 and pediment 6 as compared to the other geomorphological units table 2 more than 80 portion of the study region is covered by pediplain 2377 62 km2 followed by buried pediment 195 09 km2 pediment 150 88 km2 flood plain 82 27 km2 alluvium 70 29 km2 and valley fill 36 55 km2 the geographical coverage of various sub classes and the fuzzy membership fm of this controlling factor are shown in fig 4b the fm values ranged from 0 0101 to 0 9129 and relatively higher fm values were observed in the western portion of the study area due to assigning the higher rating to the pediplain 4 3 drainage density the availability of groundwater in a region is influenced by the natural drainage pattern of that area and plays a vital role in groundwater potentiality ganapuram et al 2009 drainage density is inversely proportional to the permeability and hence it has a significant impact in the computation of groundwater potential index arulbalaji et al 2019 drainage density of the study region varies from 0 to 4 417 km km2 and accordingly the entire research area was categorized into five sub classes such as 0 0 88 0 88 1 77 1 77 2 65 2 65 3 53 and 3 53 km km2 respectively fig 3c a large portion of the study region fell in the range of 1 77 2 65 km km2 958 14 km2 whereas drainage density values more than 3 53 km km2 covered a smallest area 119 62 km2 respectively table 2 drainage density of 3 53 km km2 was mostly found in the western portion except some patches in central and eastern side of the study area fig 3c the maximum and minimum fm values were observed as 0 0041 and 0 9279 respectively within the study area fig 4c 4 4 slope groundwater occurrence and its flow highly depend on available topographic slope yeh et al 2016 according to the available topographic slope the entire study region was categorized into three sub classes such as 0 4 4 10 and 10 fig 3d the current study area mostly fell in a slope less than 10 2673 30 km2 i e 91 78 of total area table 2 more the flatty surface higher the chances of surface water penetration and hence the maximum rating 9 was assigned to class 0 4 followed by 4 10 5 and 10 2 respectively table 2 in the study area slope fm values ranged from 0 0063 to 0 9215 fig 4d 4 5 elevation the availability of groundwater also affected by the elevation of the land and governed by lithological meteorological condition degradation of land surface etc pourghasemi et al 2012 ground surface situated at lower elevated areas represent the good groundwater potentiality due to long retention of groundwater that enhances the chance for higher groundwater recharge singha et al 2019 the present study area had ground elevation values from 173 m to 279 m and accordingly the whole study area was divided into three sub classification such as 173 215 215 233 and 233 m fig 3e groundwater flows from higher contour to lower contour and higher elevated area promotes to higher runoff of rainfall water therefore relatively higher ratings were assigned to the area with elevation values less than 233 m table 2 the spatial distribution map of elevation fm showed a minimum and maximum value of 0 0574 and 0 8561within the study area fig 4e 4 6 lineament density the secondary porosity and permeability of the geological formation is increased due to presence of faults and fractures and it is the indicator of groundwater availability yeh et al 2016 lineament density map was prepared based on available fractures in litho logical strata the lineament density value was observed from 0 to 4 27 km km2 and accordingly the study area was categorized into five sub classes such as 0 0 8 0 8 1 6 1 6 2 4 2 4 3 2 and 3 2 km km2 fig 3f the area having higher lineament density values were assigned with higher ratings due to occurrence of groundwater in the fracture zone selvam et al 2015 fig 3f indicated that relatively higher lineament density values were found in the central and western part of the study region a minimum and maximum value of fm was observed as 0 0205 and 0 8960 respectively fig 4f 4 7 land use land cover lulc among the various groundwater controlling factors land use land cover contributes a significant impact on groundwater recharge martin et al 2017 irrigated land and vegetation and water body are the potential source of groundwater recharge whereas built up area and wasteland poses restriction against the infiltration of groundwater patra et al 2018 according to the land use pattern the study region was categorized into seven sub classification units such as urban built up area mining industries wasteland barren rocky tree clads area rural built up area agricultural land and water body respectively fig 3g a large portion of the study region was covered by agricultural land 2236 60 km2 and being one of the significant sources of groundwater occurrence and thus a higher rating was assigned to this land use pattern table 2 a minimum and maximum rating was allocated form urban built up area rating 3 and water body 10 table 2 the lulc fm value varied from 0 0205 to 0 8960 within the study area fig 4g 4 8 soil texture the soil texture influences the infiltration rate of percolation water a variety of soil texture was observed in the study area which were categorized into five sub classes namely clay clayey loam gravelly sand clay loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam respectively fig 3h depending on the permeability nature of these soil texture types the sandy loam was assigned with the maximum rating of 9 whereas the minimum rating of 4 was allocated to the clay soil distribution table 2 a major portion of the study region was covered with clayey loam type of soil 1848 50 km2 the highest and lowest soil texture fm values were 0 0811 and 0 8358 respectively fig 4h the spatial distribution of fm values showed that the central part of the study area fell under relatively higher fm values fig 4h 4 9 rainfall distribution rainfall distribution plays a vital role in groundwater prospects and it is controlled by different local hydrogeological and hydrological factors singha et al 2019 the rainfall distribution within the study area ranged between 1458 and 1623 mm year and based on that the whole area was classified into three categories such as 1458 1515 1515 1568 and 1568 mm year fig 3i ratings of sub classes were allocated on the basis of higher the rainfall higher the rating due to higher chances of groundwater recharge and vice versa the spatial distribution map of rainfall distribution fig 3i showed that the central and upper northern part of the study regions 1515 mm year received more rainfall as compared to the lower southern parts and assigned relatively higher rating rating 4 for the present analysis table 2 the rainfall fm values varied between 0 1164 and 0 8082 in the study region and relatively higher fm values mostly found in the upper portion of the study area fig 4i 4 10 proximity to surface water body the distance from the surface water body plays a vital role for the availability of groundwater within the surrounding vicinity area closer to the surface water body were allocated with higher ratings as the groundwater recharge are possibly more than the area situated at far away from water bodies the proximity to surface water body was calculated using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis and the minimum and maximum proximity values were found as 0 and 6324 55 m respectively within the study region based on the calculated proximity values the entire study area was classified into five sub categories such as 0 250 250 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 2000 m fig 3j a large portion of the study area 926 20 km2 were in the range of 1000 2000 m from the surface water body followed by 500 1000 m 775 26 km2 250 500 m 427 76 km2 0 250 m 403 22 km2 and 2000 m 380 26 km2 respectively table 2 the spatial distribution map of fm values ranged from 0 0041 to 0 9279 in the area fig 4j 4 11 water table depth the available water table depth of an area represents the groundwater potentiality of that region according to andualem and demeke 2019 the hydraulic gradient of any area is represented by the existing water table level of that area and it is a potential parameter for identifying the area of groundwater potentiality hence areas having shallow water table depth assigned with relatively higher ratings as compared to the area where groundwater table was found at deeper level the pre monsoon water table data was used in the present analysis to consider the extreme condition linked with groundwater availability and storage the pre monsoon water table depth range was observed from 1 927 m to 14 424 m and accordingly the study area was categorized into four sub classes such as 0 3 3 6 6 9 and 9 m fig 3k the maximum area of the area fell under the groundwater table depth of 6 9 m 1734 99 km2 followed by 3 6 m 922 71 km2 0 3 m 228 98 km2 and 9 m 26 02 km2 respectively table 2 the fm spatial distribution map showed a minimum and maximum value of 0 0205 and 0 8960 respectively fig 4k 4 12 gpz map of study area all the selected groundwater potential controlling factor fm layers which are prepared with kriging interpolation technique were integrated using fuzzy overlay tool in arcgis 10 4 the gamma operator with a γ value of 0 9 was used to develop the gpz map of the study area fig 5 a the computed gpz indices were ranged between 0 0636 and 0 7737 with a mean and standard deviation sd value of 0 2985 and 0 1076 based on the computed indices whole study area was divided into three sub classes namely low 0 0636 0 2557 moderate 0 2557 0 3922 and high gpz 0 3922 0 7737 using natural jenks method in gis platform result showed that a major part of the area was in moderate to low gpzs table 3 the low groundwater potentiality observed in the southern and central western part of the study area is mainly because of low rated aquifer sub units such as purple calcareous shale rating 4 limestone and dolomite with shale and sandstone rating 5 lack of high lineament density lulc patterns such as urban built up area and mining or industrial area distribution of relatively less permeable soil such as clay and clayey loam relatively higher proximity to surface water body less rainfall distribution 1515 mm year and deeper groundwater table 6 m similarly a major part of high to moderate gpzs was found in the northern and eastern portion of the study region mainly attributed due to relatively highly permeable aquifers such as alluvium grey bedded flaggy limestone and shale with chert and green band clay presence of relatively flatter ground slope 0 4 mostly lower elevated lands 233 m available of higher lineament density 0 80 3 20 km km2 distribution of permeable soil texture such as sandy clay loam gravel sand clay loam and sandy loam higher rainfall distribution 1515 mm year lower values of proximity to surface water body due to more existing surface water body and comparatively shallow water table depth 6 m respectively the areal distribution of various gpz was as follows moderate 1235 89 km2 high 1088 72 km2 low gpz 588 09 km2 however groundwater potentiality was relatively high in the northern and eastern part as compared to the area laid in western and southern part of the study region fig 5a 4 13 model sensitivity analysis model sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each controlling factors one by one from the overlying operation in gis environment during the computation process of gpz results showed that the higher sd values were observed for the lineament density sd 0 0057 proximity to surface water body sd 0 0046 and for the aquifer factors sd 0 0036 table 4 higher the sd value indicates higher the spatial variation of factors in the study area however the lower sd values were observed for slope sd 0 0014 and geomorphology sd 0 0018 during the removal of these factors compared to the removal of other factors from the map overlay process table 4 model sensitivity analysis results indicated that lineament density proximity to surface water body and aquifer were the most significant factors whereas the very marginal influences observed for the elevation and rainfall factors in computation of gpz respectively 4 14 model validation to check the reliability and precision of proposed model 28 available well yield values were superimposed on the final gpz map of the study region fig 5b after that the well wise gpz indices were extracted in gis platform to conduct the similarity analysis the well yield values considered for the model validation purpose represent the real scenario of groundwater potentiality of various existing aquifer within the study region therefore to enhance the acceptance of the proposed model a wide range of well yield values from 0 02 to 31 lps were considered in model validation pearson s correlation analysis between well yield values and gpz indices achieved a significant positive correlation of r 0 77 fig 6 which clearly justified the model authenticity and reliability 5 conclusions in the current study a fuzzy geospatial technique was used to demarcate the gpzs in the raipur district chhattisgarh india the linear function based fuzzy membership values of selected eleven groundwater controlling factors were computed in gis platform to generate respective layers and further overlaid using fuzzy gamma operator results indicated that the western and southern part of the study area fell under poor gpz zone due to presence of unfavorable conditions for groundwater occurrence and needs for the proper groundwater management and planning to increase the groundwater level moreover the model sensitivity analysis highlighted the lineament density proximity to surface water body and aquifer as the most significant groundwater potential controlling factors in the study area pumping well yield data were utilized to validate the final gpz map of the study region a significant positive pearson s correlation coefficient r of 0 77 was observed between well yield and computed gpz indices which justified the preciseness and reliability of the proposed model based on the current finding it may be concluded that utilization of various surface and sub surface groundwater controlling factors in fuzzy geospatial technique can be a capable approach for delineating the gpz in a very precise manner the current approach will be helpful to provide greater insights in this field by involving more

factors fuzzy membership gis groundwater potentiality sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater is one of the significant natural potable water resources that form in existing voids and fractures in geological units and sub surface sediments naghibi et al 2015 it has the vital role not only in human well being but it also affects the ecological system and the economic growth the total easily available earth freshwater is about 15 ayibotele 1992 this limited potable resource necessitates to be utilized with more efficient way globally due to the rapid growth of population explosion the per capita available water is decreasing with time that leads to the threatening to human being owing to this critical issue worldwide combined with climate change the significance of groundwater has gained the highest attention for the whole environmental safety and life support structure however to fulfill the growing demand of groundwater for the domestic industrial and agricultural purposes the declination of groundwater has become a serious concern according to shah et al 2003 tube wells and power operated wells serve about 60 of the irrigation requirement in india in future the supply of freshwater is likely to be the most challenging task due to depletion of groundwater increased supply demand and irresponsible utilization of this natural resource that needs immediate effective planning and management for groundwater replenishment mapping of groundwater potential zones is the platform that can provide the solution for the sustainable use of groundwater resources in this field of research recently the utilization of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis has achieved popularity many research works related to delineation of groundwater potential zone using rs and gis technique had been reported till date murthy 2000 sener et al 2005 dar et al 2010 pasupuleti et al 2019 several researchers used gis based model coupled

groundwater being the primary source of drinking water of the district it fulfills the domestic requirements cgwb 2013 groundwater development within the district is mainly focused to meet the requirements of irrigational and domestic services thus to maintain the groundwater sustainability and its replenishment strategy needs urgent attention the mapping of groundwater potential zones can be very much helpful to initiate proper groundwater management actions in this region jhariya 2019 conducted a study for delineating groundwater potential zones in chhokra nala micro watershed covering only six villages 220 km2 area which falls within raipur district the author utilized gis and rs based overlay model considering ten hydrogeo meteorological layers such as geology drainage

delineation was carried out using eight litho hydrogeological factors in arang block western part of the district singha and pasupuleti 2020 hence the current study aims to cover up the whole district for the zonation of groundwater potentiality fuzzy gis approach helps to estimate the importance of factors using fuzzy membership fm value in a very efficient way however to our best knowledge in the present study for the first time fuzzy gis approach has been considered to delineate the groundwater potential zones based on the literature survey none of the research work had been focused in this region hence in the present study the integrated technique of fuzzy gis has been carried out for the development of sustainable groundwater resource within the study area 2 study area raipur district

function and overlaying of fm build layers using suitable operator to overlay the fm based layers in gis platform according to zadeh 1965 the fuzzy set fs theory allows the scale of object existence within a set in between 0 and 1 depending on the fm values every membership map of separate classes was prepared utilization of fuzzy overlay process permitted to analyze the possibility of occurrences associated with multiple set within the multi criteria overlay operation however based on the mapping with the domain of crisp inputs the fm function characterized the fs by generating degree of membership within 0 and 1 out of several fm function the selection of suitable function mainly depends on the midpoint and spread factors in addition appropriate fm function can be selected by relating the significance of each factor with the target mohebbi tafreshi et al 2018 in the present study a linear fm function was adopted to generate fm values of all eleven controlling factors the fuzzy linear function establishes the linear relationship between the minimum and maximum inputs assigned by the user a zero value was allotted to those values which were less than the minimum whereas values higher than the maximum were allotted with the value of one respectively 1 μ y 0 i f y min 1 i f y max y min max min o t h e r w i s e where the min and max are user inputs depending on the control in groundwater occurrence the fm values of all factors were assigned all the selected factors fm spatial layers were prepared using kriging interpolation technique as it is the preeminent linear unbiased estimator webster and oliver 2007 kriging method estimates the unknown values using the weighted moving mean of known values fuzzy overlying operation of factors map can be performed using any five available fuzzy operators viz and or algebraic product algebraic sum and gamma fuzzy and operator is the same as intersection logical set that pull out the minimum fuzzy membership weight value of the pixel and consequently assign the extracted lowest value to the final output map the mathematical expression is given as 2 μ y min μ 1 y μ 2 y μ 3 y μ n y where μ1 μ2 μ3 μn are the membership weights of the respective factors layer and n is the number of factor layers selected fuzzy or operator is the same as the logical union set that pull out the maximum fuzzy membership weight value of the pixel and accordingly assign the extracted lowest value to the final output map as per eq 3 3 μ y max μ 1 y μ 2 y μ 3 y μ n y fuzzy algebraic product operator uses the multiplication value of any respective pixel from various selected factors layer in the computation process that results a decreased value this is due the effect of multiplication of smaller values less than 1 in this process a smaller number of pixels fall under the high groundwater potential category according to esri 2012 the selection of this operator is highly sensitive for any location the mathematical expression of fuzzy algebraic product is given in eq 4 4 μ y i 1 n μ i where μi represents the pixel s membership value for the factor i fuzzy algebraic sum operator produces linear combined output described by eq 5 thus it results in the increased pixel values in the final output map i e values tend to 1 or equal to the maximum contributing values esri 2012 5 μ y 1 i 1 n 1 μ i anbalagan et al 2015 reported that results of fuzzy and and fuzzy or were dominated as a result of single contributing fuzzy set in another study carried out by kayastha et al 2013 have shown the success rate of fuzzy gamma operator over the other operator in the current study fuzzy gamma operator eq 6 was used for overlaying operation of the groundwater control factors fm layers hence the gis fuzzy overlay tool was used to overlay the fm maps to develop the final gpz map of the study region 6 μ y f u z z y a lg e b r i c s u m γ f u z z y a lg e b r i c p r o d u c t 1 γ 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the significant factors among all eleven groundwater controlling with respect to the groundwater potentiality of the current study region in this process the fm spatially distributed map of each factor was removed at a time during the fuzzy overlay operation the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd values of groundwater potential indices were estimated for every overlaid map using eq 3 gogu and dassargues 2000 singha et al 2019 7 p i x g p z i n g p z x i n where p ix is the computed sensitivity in the removal of one factor x gpz i is the groundwater potential indices estimated by eq 2 gpz xi is the index value of groundwater potentiality estimated after removal of one factor x n and n are the number of total factors used in eq 2 11 and eq 3 10 respectively 3 4 validation of gpz map model validation was performed with 28 pumping well yield data of the study area the well yield values used for validation ranged from 0 02 to 31 00 lps liter per second represented the ground truth scenario of groundwater potentiality of different aquifers of the study area the yield values were categorized into three sub classes namely low 0 02 3 00 lps moderate 3 00 6 00 lps and high yield 6 00 lps the well points were superimposed on the developed gpz map the gpz indices of the respective well points were extracted to conduct the similarity analysis pearson s correlation analysis 4 results and discussion in this section geo spatial variation of selected controlling factors their importance on groundwater potentiality in terms of fuzzy memberships development of gpz map model sensitivity analysis and validation statistic are discussed 4 1 aquifer groundwater occurrence transport and storage are influenced by the sub surface lithology achu et al 2020 according to murasingh et al 2018 groundwater potentiality of any region is mainly attributed to the water bearing aquifers formations in the current study a total of six types of aquifers were identified namely purple calcareous shale limestone with dolomite with shale and sandstone grey bedded flaggy limestone laterite shale with chert and green clay bands and alluvium fig 3 a based on the groundwater potentiality the highest and lowest ratings were assigned to alluvium rating 10 and purple calcareous shale rating 4 table 2 the quaternary alluvium deposits in the study area comprises with gravel sand silt and clay particles that makes the alluvium aquifer highly permeable in nature as compared to the other aquifers and hence assigned with the maximum rating of 10 singha et al 2019 in the study area a shallow depth of laterite deposits bears high groundwater potentiality similarly the groundwater potentiality of grey bedded flaggy limestone charmuria formation as well as the limestone and dolomite with shale and sandstone chandi formation is also high due to higher permeability and porosity as compared to the purple calcareous shale gunderdehi formation cgwb 2011 a major portion of the study region covered by limestone with dolomite with shale and sandstone 51 76 which is mostly found in the western part whereas shale with chert and green clay bands 0 32 located in the upper northern part of the study area showed with the lowest areal distribution table 2 the fuzzy membership value of aquifer parameter varied between 0 0574 lowest and 0 8561 highest fig 4 a 4 2 geomorphology the topography and landform of a particular region is represented by its distributed geomorphological pattern that controls the groundwater occurrence within the area arulbalaji et al 2019 the surface geomorphological units of the study area were classified into six categories such as valley fill buried pediment flood plain pediment pediplain and alluvium fig 3b as per the relative importance with respect to the tendency towards infiltration of surface water into groundwater storage relatively higher ratings were assigned to the alluvium 8 pediplain 7 and pediment 6 as compared to the other geomorphological units table 2 more than 80 portion of the study region is covered by pediplain 2377 62 km2 followed by buried pediment 195 09 km2 pediment 150 88 km2 flood plain 82 27 km2 alluvium 70 29 km2 and valley fill 36 55 km2 the geographical coverage of various sub classes and the fuzzy membership fm of this controlling factor are shown in fig 4b the fm values ranged from 0 0101 to 0 9129 and relatively higher fm values were observed in the western portion of the study area due to assigning the higher rating to the pediplain 4 3 drainage density the availability of groundwater in a region is influenced by the natural drainage pattern of that area and plays a vital role in groundwater potentiality ganapuram et al 2009 drainage density is inversely proportional to the permeability and hence it has a significant impact in the computation of groundwater potential index arulbalaji et al 2019 drainage density of the study region varies from 0 to 4 417 km km2 and accordingly the entire research area was categorized into five sub classes such as 0 0 88 0 88 1 77 1 77 2 65 2 65 3 53 and 3 53 km km2 respectively fig 3c a large portion of the study region fell in the range of 1 77 2 65 km km2 958 14 km2 whereas drainage density values more than 3 53 km km2 covered a smallest area 119 62 km2 respectively table 2 drainage density of 3 53 km km2 was mostly found in the western portion except some patches in central and eastern side of the study area fig 3c the maximum and minimum fm values were observed as 0 0041 and 0 9279 respectively within the study area fig 4c 4 4 slope groundwater occurrence and its flow highly depend on available topographic slope yeh et al 2016 according to the available topographic slope the entire study region was categorized into three sub classes such as 0 4 4 10 and 10 fig 3d the current study area mostly fell in a slope less than 10 2673 30 km2 i e 91 78 of total area table 2 more the flatty surface higher the chances of surface water penetration and hence the maximum rating 9 was assigned to class 0 4 followed by 4 10 5 and 10 2 respectively table 2 in the study area slope fm values ranged from 0 0063 to 0 9215 fig 4d 4 5 elevation the availability of groundwater also affected by the elevation of the land and governed by lithological meteorological condition degradation of land surface etc pourghasemi et al 2012 ground surface situated at lower elevated areas represent the good groundwater potentiality due to long retention of groundwater that enhances the chance for higher groundwater recharge singha et al 2019 the present study area had ground elevation values from 173 m to 279 m and accordingly the whole study area was divided into three sub classification such as 173 215 215 233 and 233 m fig 3e groundwater flows from higher contour to lower contour and higher elevated area promotes to higher runoff of rainfall water therefore relatively higher ratings were assigned to the area with elevation values less than 233 m table 2 the spatial distribution map of elevation fm showed a minimum and maximum value of 0 0574 and 0 8561within the study area fig 4e 4 6 lineament density the secondary porosity and permeability of the geological formation is increased due to presence of faults and fractures and it is the indicator of groundwater availability yeh et al 2016 lineament density map was prepared based on available fractures in litho logical strata the lineament density value was observed from 0 to 4 27 km km2 and accordingly the study area was categorized into five sub classes such as 0 0 8 0 8 1 6 1 6 2 4 2 4 3 2 and 3 2 km km2 fig 3f the area having higher lineament density values were assigned with higher ratings due to occurrence of groundwater in the fracture zone selvam et al 2015 fig 3f indicated that relatively higher lineament density values were found in the central and western part of the study region a minimum and maximum value of fm was observed as 0 0205 and 0 8960 respectively fig 4f 4 7 land use land cover lulc among the various groundwater controlling factors land use land cover contributes a significant impact on groundwater recharge martin et al 2017 irrigated land and vegetation and water body are the potential source of groundwater recharge whereas built up area and wasteland poses restriction against the infiltration of groundwater patra et al 2018 according to the land use pattern the study region was categorized into seven sub classification units such as urban built up area mining industries wasteland barren rocky tree clads area rural built up area agricultural land and water body respectively fig 3g a large portion of the study region was covered by agricultural land 2236 60 km2 and being one of the significant sources of groundwater occurrence and thus a higher rating was assigned to this land use pattern table 2 a minimum and maximum rating was allocated form urban built up area rating 3 and water body 10 table 2 the lulc fm value varied from 0 0205 to 0 8960 within the study area fig 4g 4 8 soil texture the soil texture influences the infiltration rate of percolation water a variety of soil texture was observed in the study area which were categorized into five sub classes namely clay clayey loam gravelly sand clay loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam respectively fig 3h depending on the permeability nature of these soil texture types the sandy loam was assigned with the maximum rating of 9 whereas the minimum rating of 4 was allocated to the clay soil distribution table 2 a major portion of the study region was covered with clayey loam type of soil 1848 50 km2 the highest and lowest soil texture fm values were 0 0811 and 0 8358 respectively fig 4h the spatial distribution of fm values showed that the central part of the study area fell under relatively higher fm values fig 4h 4 9 rainfall distribution rainfall distribution plays a vital role in groundwater prospects and it is controlled by different local hydrogeological and hydrological factors singha et al 2019 the rainfall distribution within the study area ranged between 1458 and 1623 mm year and based on that the whole area was classified into three categories such as 1458 1515 1515 1568 and 1568 mm year fig 3i ratings of sub classes were allocated on the basis of higher the rainfall higher the rating due to higher chances of groundwater recharge and vice versa the spatial distribution map of rainfall distribution fig 3i showed that the central and upper northern part of the study regions 1515 mm year received more rainfall as compared to the lower southern parts and assigned relatively higher rating rating 4 for the present analysis table 2 the rainfall fm values varied between 0 1164 and 0 8082 in the study region and relatively higher fm values mostly found in the upper portion of the study area fig 4i 4 10 proximity to surface water body the distance from the surface water body plays a vital role for the availability of groundwater within the surrounding vicinity area closer to the surface water body were allocated with higher ratings as the groundwater recharge are possibly more than the area situated at far away from water bodies the proximity to surface water body was calculated using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis and the minimum and maximum proximity values were found as 0 and 6324 55 m respectively within the study region based on the calculated proximity values the entire study area was classified into five sub categories such as 0 250 250 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 2000 m fig 3j a large portion of the study area 926 20 km2 were in the range of 1000 2000 m from the surface water body followed by 500 1000 m 775 26 km2 250 500 m 427 76 km2 0 250 m 403 22 km2 and 2000 m 380 26 km2 respectively table 2 the spatial distribution map of fm values ranged from 0 0041 to 0 9279 in the area fig 4j 4 11 water table depth the available water table depth of an area represents the groundwater potentiality of that region according to andualem and demeke 2019 the hydraulic gradient of any area is represented by the existing water table level of that area and it is a potential parameter for identifying the area of groundwater potentiality hence areas having shallow water table depth assigned with relatively higher ratings as compared to the area where groundwater table was found at deeper level the pre monsoon water table data was used in the present analysis to consider the extreme condition linked with groundwater availability and storage the pre monsoon water table depth range was observed from 1 927 m to 14 424 m and accordingly the study area was categorized into four sub classes such as 0 3 3 6 6 9 and 9 m fig 3k the maximum area of the area fell under the groundwater table depth of 6 9 m 1734 99 km2 followed by 3 6 m 922 71 km2 0 3 m 228 98 km2 and 9 m 26 02 km2 respectively table 2 the fm spatial distribution map showed a minimum and maximum value of 0 0205 and 0 8960 respectively fig 4k 4 12 gpz map of study area all the selected groundwater potential controlling factor fm layers which are prepared with kriging interpolation technique were integrated using fuzzy overlay tool in arcgis 10 4 the gamma operator with a γ value of 0 9 was used to develop the gpz map of the study area fig 5 a the computed gpz indices were ranged between 0 0636 and 0 7737 with a mean and standard deviation sd value of 0 2985 and 0 1076 based on the computed indices whole study area was divided into three sub classes namely low 0 0636 0 2557 moderate 0 2557 0 3922 and high gpz 0 3922 0 7737 using natural jenks method in gis platform result showed that a major part of the area was in moderate to low gpzs table 3 the low groundwater potentiality observed in the southern and central western part of the study area is mainly because of low rated aquifer sub units such as purple calcareous shale rating 4 limestone and dolomite with shale and sandstone rating 5 lack of high lineament density lulc patterns such as urban built up area and mining or industrial area distribution of relatively less permeable soil such as clay and clayey loam relatively higher proximity to surface water body less rainfall distribution 1515 mm year and deeper groundwater table 6 m similarly a major part of high to moderate gpzs was found in the northern and eastern portion of the study region mainly attributed due to relatively highly permeable aquifers such as alluvium grey bedded flaggy limestone and shale with chert and green band clay presence of relatively flatter ground slope 0 4 mostly lower elevated lands 233 m available of higher lineament density 0 80 3 20 km km2 distribution of permeable soil texture such as sandy clay loam gravel sand clay loam and sandy loam higher rainfall distribution 1515 mm year lower values of proximity to surface water body due to more existing surface water body and comparatively shallow water table depth 6 m respectively the areal distribution of various gpz was as follows moderate 1235 89 km2 high 1088 72 km2 low gpz 588 09 km2 however groundwater potentiality was relatively high in the northern and eastern part as compared to the area laid in western and southern part of the study region fig 5a 4 13 model sensitivity analysis model sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each controlling factors one by one from the overlying operation in gis environment during the computation process of gpz results showed that the higher sd values were observed for the lineament density sd 0 0057 proximity to surface water body sd 0 0046 and for the aquifer factors sd 0 0036 table 4 higher the sd value indicates higher the spatial variation of factors in the study area however the lower sd values were observed for slope sd 0 0014 and geomorphology sd 0 0018 during the removal of these factors compared to the removal of other factors from the map overlay process table 4 model sensitivity analysis results indicated that lineament density proximity to surface water body and aquifer were the most significant factors whereas the very marginal influences observed for the elevation and rainfall factors in computation of gpz respectively 4 14 model validation to check the reliability and precision of proposed model 28 available well yield values were superimposed on the final gpz map of the study region fig 5b after that the well wise gpz indices were extracted in gis platform to conduct the similarity analysis the well yield values considered for the model validation purpose represent the real scenario of groundwater potentiality of various existing aquifer within the study region therefore to enhance the acceptance of the proposed model a wide range of well yield values from 0 02 to 31 lps were considered in model validation pearson s correlation analysis between well yield values and gpz indices achieved a significant positive correlation of r 0 77 fig 6 which clearly justified the model authenticity and reliability 5 conclusions in the current study a fuzzy geospatial technique was used to demarcate the gpzs in the raipur district chhattisgarh india the linear function based fuzzy membership values of selected eleven groundwater controlling factors were computed in gis platform to generate respective layers and further overlaid using fuzzy gamma operator results indicated that the western and southern part of the study area fell under poor gpz zone due to presence of unfavorable conditions for groundwater occurrence and needs for the proper groundwater management and planning to increase the groundwater level moreover the model sensitivity analysis highlighted the lineament density proximity to surface water body and aquifer as the most significant groundwater potential controlling factors in the study area pumping well yield data were utilized to validate the final gpz map of the study region a significant positive pearson s correlation coefficient r of 0 77 was observed between well yield and computed gpz indices which justified the preciseness and reliability of the proposed model based on the current finding it may be concluded that utilization of various surface and sub surface groundwater controlling factors in fuzzy geospatial technique can be a capable approach for delineating the gpz in a very precise manner the current approach will be helpful to provide greater insights in this field by involving more

11982,high fluoride concentration in drinking water is a public health concern worldwide therefore this study is aimed to investigate the plausible adsorption mechanism and applicability of natural and aluminum coated stilbite alc sti for fluoride removal batch adsorptive defluoridation experiments were performed as function of solution ph adsorbent dose contact time and concentration variation at room temperature results of the study revealed that 10 mg l fluoride reduced to 0 339 mg l using alc sti from aqueous solutions the experimental data showed that maximum adsorption capacity of 11 52 mg g was predicted through freundlich isothermal model the study suggested that adsorption mechanism was due to aluminol silanol and hydroxyl functional groups as well as water molecules within alc sti equally important in suitability of the adsorbent was that aluminum leached from alc sti surfaces during the experiment was 0 2 mg l making the adsorption media safe for water treatment the co incidence of large amount of natural zeolite and high level of fluoride in drinking waters in ethiopian rift valley areas pulls the very vital aspect of the work graphical abstract image 1 keywords aluminum coated zeolite adsorptive mechanism defluoridation stilbite 1 introduction fluoride is a major environmental concern that causes dental to skeletal fluorosis and associated health risks when found beyond safe limit ozsvath 2009 sources of fluoride in water could be mainly from leaching of minerals rocks and sediments via weathering of parent rock materials raju 2016 basically elevated concentrations of fluoride are common when conditions favor the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in calcium poor aquifers rango et al 2012 the discharges of fluoride from anthropogenic activities are also another important sources in water high occurrence of fluoride in groundwater can be predicted by the presence of high concentrations of bicarbonate carbonate and sodium ions with ph values greater than seven young et al 2011 thole 2013 fluoride f intake through drinking water in small amounts 0 5 1 5 mg l is important in preventing dental caries it is also vital in promoting the strength and healthy conditions of bones whereas at higher concentrations 1 5 mg l fluoride causes dental to skeletal fluorosis depending on the dose and duration of exposure denbesten and li 2011 the prevention of dental caries and bone damage is due to interaction of calcium minerals with fluoride forming fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f neel et al 2016 skeletal and non skeletal manifestations as a result of fluoride are common in children due to low calcium in early bone development frazão et al 2011 it has been estimated that about 200 million people suffer from fluorosis in several countries

amini et al 2008 jagtap et al 2012 consequently 1 5 mg l was set as a maximum contamination limit mcl in drinking water by who fawell et al 2006 jha et al 2013 various defluoridation technologies are available including membrane technique bhadja et al 2016 precipitation nalgonda rao et al 2008 electrolytic separation mumtaz et al 2015 freeze desalination yang et al 2017 and adsorption gai et al 2015 nowadays adsorption processes using various natural modified and synthetic adsorbents for effective defluoridation are usually applied adsorbents such as double or tri metal hydr oxides alumina clay materials carbon nanotubes apatite minerals and so on chai et al 2013 dou et al 2012 gai et al 2015 karmakar et al 2016 li et al 2003 mohapatra et al 2009 tor 2006 wu et al 2007 have been developed and tested for fluoride uptake although several attempts have shown promising adsorptive capacities for fluoride however applicability tests of most adsorbents and mechanism study are limited thus easly applicable and efficient adsorbent is vital to reach especially rural affected populations in this work locally available natural zeolite and its modified form were explored for fluoride uptake making advantage of tunable properties of zeolites natural zeolite is abundantly found and easily exploited resources throughout the world including ethiopia tadesse 2009 zeolites are minerals with crystalline hydrated alumino silicates with framework having unique intrinsic properties such as high surface area tunable surface and shape selectivity tuning the surface properties via modification of zeolite could change the adsorption capacities by influencing si al ratio within zeolites garcía et al 2014 on top of its proven cationic exchange chemically modified zeolites with inorganic salts or organic surfactants showed to be effective in removing anionic species haggerty and bowman 1994 li et al 1999 natural stilbite sti from ethiopia was used for fluoride removal previously gómez hortigüela et al 2013 and its capacity was found to be low thus sti with aluminum modification for significant increase in adsorption capacity was tested accordingly the major objectives were to assess the potential of natural sti from ethiopia and alc sti to remove fluoride from aqueous solutions indicating adsorption mechanisms involved therefore batch adsorption

highscore 1 0a was used for the interpretation of xrd results and indicated the highest peaks see the highest values of intensity in the xrd fig 1 2 thus the adsorbent referred to as sti the major

investigated by varying the time from 15 min to 1440 min for both adsorbents unmodified stilbite sti and aluminum coated stilbite alc sti a preliminary test on the effect of contact time using natural sti and alc sti was accomplished in order to observe the difference in removal capacities fig 3 the results revealed that natural sti provided negligible amount of removal capacities as compared to alc sti with similar experimental conditions literature data on the defluoridation using sti showed similar performance as reported by gómez hortigüela et al 2013 instead the removal capacities of alc sti showed imminent potential follow up experiments were focused on alc sti due to the significant removal capacity a rapid rate of fluoride uptake during the first 15 min contact time followed by a slow adsorption until 360 min was observed during the experiment the rapid fluoride ion removal from aqueous solution during initial stage of contact time was presumably due to the fact that initially all adsorbent sites were vacant kebede et al 2014 and the instantaneous utilization of most readily available active outer surfaces of alc sti by fluoride ions salifu et al 2013 the slower adsorption at the later stages may be due to a gradual diffusion of fluoride into inner adsorbent surfaces and small active sites remained for adherence contact time of 360 min was considered as equilibrium time because fluoride adsorption could not show significant increase afterwards indicating adsorption desorption remain constant 3 1 1 kinetic models the rate of adsorption is a function of different parameters including functional groups of the adsorbent surface area concentration of adsorbate and adsorbate adsorbent interactions mondal et al 2015 the study of adsorption kinetics is important to forecast the reaction pathways and mechanism of adsorption pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models were used to test the kinetic data model equations as presented in

effect of initial ph and mechanism insights the effect of solution ph and buffering conditions of alc sti are presented in figs 4 and 5 it was shown that the removal of fluoride using alc sti was effective over a wide initial ph range of 3 10 depending on pzc and ft ir data the probable governing mechanism of fluoride adsorption is proposed as i coulombic attraction represented in eq 6 in acidic medium ph pzc ii ligand exchange due to h2o eq 7 and oh exchange onto alc sti surfaces when ph pzc of alc sti eq 8 similar mechanisms and surface properties were suggested in aluminum based adsorbents in previous literatures salifu et al 2013 alemu et al 2014 mondal and george 2015 in general the change in ph values would influence a broad spectrum of conditions in the solution and adsorbate adsorbent interactions the buffering effects of adsorbents which could be explained by the amphoteric nature of oxides surfaces were also noticed to influence adsorption process the adsorbent alc sti showed appreciable buffering effect fig 5 the adsorbent able to bring the initial ph of solution 6 5 to 7 0 when measured after adsorption which is near to the ph of the adsorbent in water and or to the pzc of alc sti pzc of alc sti is 7 43 ph in water 7 45 such buffering effect on adsorption was also demonstrated in the use of aluminum hydroxide for f uptake enhancing adsorption capacity gai et al 2015 remarkably the responsible mechanism of f removal was supposed to be affected by the processes to gain the final ph of the solution from the initial set the plausible mechanism of fluoride adsorption is further verified with ft ir data presented in fig 6 the broader spectrum peaks at 3428 3436 cm 1 for alc sti before fluoride loading and the peak at 3533 cm 1 after adsorption of fluoride on to alc sti could be attributed to the oh stretching vibrations of water molecules as zeolite is a water bearing mineral the most distinct features evident within the stilbite spectra are the bending vibration of the oh group at 1635 cm 1 müller et al 2015 in addition to this the strong band at 609 cm 1 is assigned to the vibrational mode of alo6 while another two bands at 1116 and 1643 cm 1 can be attributed to al oh stretching and bending vibrations in the alc sti oh lattices pechar and rykl 1981 with the adsorption of fluoride onto the adsorbent surface the peak intensities are modified and the peak at 535 cm 1 could be related to the al f interactions barathi et al 2014 the change in intensities and broadening of functional groups of oh 3428 3436 cm 1 of alc sti before fluoride loading and at 3533 cm 1 after adsorption and stretching and bending vibrations of si o al o groups and si o m m al mg etc in a spectrum were among the points indicating the adsorption insights of f upon alc sti müller et al 2015 thus the plausible mechanisms involved eqs 6 8 can be proposed in the adsorption of f considering the behavior of adsorbate and adsorbent species in the aqueous solution 6 sti alo h 2 f sti al o h 2 f 7 sti alo h 2 f alf h 2 o 8 sti aloh f sti alf oh where aloh is the aluminol group 3 3 effect of adsorbent dose batch experiments were performed using different masses of the adsorbents 4 40 g l at fixed 10 mg l f ph 6 5 and at room temperature 22 1 c the effect of adsorbent dose has been illustrated in fig 7 the f removal capacities decrease as the adsorbent doses increase which could by explained on the basis of adsorption dynamics and mass transport as well as adsorbate adsorbent interaction forces rutherford and do 2000 fewer f ions were available per unit mass of adsorbent as a result of large doses of sorbents 3 4 effect of initial concentration the adsorption capacities of alc stl increase with an increase in initial f concentrations figs 8 and 9 it was observed that 10 mg l f decreased to 0 293 mg l with an adsorbent dose of 5 g l alc sti which is below the who maximum contamination limit 1 5 mg l alc sti showed expected maximum fluoride uptake capacity of 11 52 mg g this adsorption capacity is greater even from the commercial aluminum hydroxide gai et al 2015 model parameters of langmuir and freundlich were summarized in table 3 at optimal conditions langmuir model is assumed to describe the relationship between the adsorbate and fixed homogeneous active surfaces of adsorption being all active sites with equal size and shape langmuir 1918 whereas freundlich isotherm model assumes heterogeneous surface with possibility of adsorbate adsorbate interaction the non linear forms of both models are given in eqs 9 and 10 9 langmuir q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 10 freundlich 1 n q e k f c 1 n where qe mg g the amount of f adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium ce mg l is the concentration of f in

capacity and adsorption intensity respectively fig 9 presents the non linear langmuir and freundlich adsorption plots at equilibrium freundlich model r2 0 9817 better fitted for alc sti compared to the langmuir model r2 0 9619 furthermore to confirm the fitness of models distribution of residuals experimental sorbed concentration minus fitted sorbed concentration along the isotherm was evaluated favorability of adsorption can be evaluated using separation factor rl r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 initial f concentrations in mg l and b l mg is the langmuir constant rl was found in range of 0 040 0 629 for concentration ranges of f studied with decreasing in the rl value as initial concentration increases the value of rl was found within the range 0 rl 1 signifying favorable equilibrium adsorption 3 5 application of the adsorbent three samples of natural well water containing 15 4 mg l fluoride were collected from a well found in jimma university compound ethiopia the physicochemical characteristics of the samples were investigated and reported in table 4 batch adsorption experiment was carried out for the well sample waters without adjusting the ph of the sample water ph 7 45 this experiment was accomplished at optimal conditions of the batch system evaluated using aqueous solutions fluoride concentration of the well water 15 4 mg l f was reduced to 2 3 mg l onto 40 g l of alc sti fig 10 although the reduction is high from 15 4 to 2 3 mg l the need for further treatment to reduce 2 3 mg l f to below the permissible level 1 5 mg l is important thus multi stage adsorption or higher dose of alc sti would be required for this particular high concentration of fluoride tested however f levels in most groundwater is lower than tested thus possibility of alc sti to reduce f contaminated water to potable limit is likely the main disadvantage of aluminum based adsorbents were the high residual aluminum remained in aqueous solution after defuoridation gai et al 2015 however in this work it was found that the residual aluminum ion leached from alc sti at optimum conditions was found to be 0 09 mg l which is by far less than the drinkable limit of aluminum ion 0 2 mg l the leaching of aluminum from the alumina based surfaces into its free and hydroxide ions in the aqueous medium is reported to be very low the presence of high fluoride concentrations may increase the dissolution due to the formation of aluminium hydr oxide fluoride complexes george et al 2010 3 6 comparison of alc sti with other adsorbents aluminum based adsorbents have been widely used for defluoridation techniques because of the affinity between aluminum and fluoride which result in high adsorption capacity mondal and george 2015 for instance aluminum based sorbents acquired a capacity of 43 29 mg g f using aluminum based particles synthesized by precipitation assaoui et al 2020 3 14 mg g f by alumina alkoxide kamble et al 2010 and magnesia amended activated alumina with 10 12 mg g f maliyekkal et al 2008 calcium based adsorbents were found capacities with the order hydroxyapatite fluorspar quartz activated by ferric ions calcite quartz fan et al 2003 a summary of reported literatures adsorption capacities are presented in table 5 relative to the studied adsorbent alc sti in fact direct comparison of alc sti with other adsorbents would face difficulties due to the differences in operating parameters 4 conclusions a batch scale adsorptive defluoridation experiments were performed as function of solution ph adsorbent dose contact time and agitation speed at room temperature the study suggested that the adsorption mechanism was due to the co operative actions of aluminol silanol functional groups and the hydroxyl as well as water molecules for f ion exchange which well involved to enhance the adsorption capacity the batch defluoridation using alc sti was found to be promising due to the following main findings high adsorption capacity of 11 52 mg g the possibility of working in wide ph ranges 3 10 and the buffering effect of the adsorbent which suits the drinking applications moreover the residual aluminum concentration after defluoridation by alc sti was found to be 0 09 mg l which is by far lower than who guideline for aluminum 0 2 mg l in drinking water it is shown that alc sti is highly important to be scaled up for fluoride removal as a proven method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest with any author or funder acknowldegnment authors are thankful for jimma university for

11982,high fluoride concentration in drinking water is a public health concern worldwide therefore this study is aimed to investigate the plausible adsorption mechanism and applicability of natural and aluminum coated stilbite alc sti for fluoride removal batch adsorptive defluoridation experiments were performed as function of solution ph adsorbent dose contact time and concentration variation at room temperature results of the study revealed that 10 mg l fluoride reduced to 0 339 mg l using alc sti from aqueous solutions the experimental data showed that maximum adsorption capacity of 11 52 mg g was predicted through freundlich isothermal model the study suggested that adsorption mechanism was due to aluminol silanol and hydroxyl functional groups as well as water molecules within alc sti equally important in suitability of the adsorbent was that aluminum leached from alc sti surfaces during the experiment was 0 2 mg l making the adsorption media safe for water treatment the co incidence of large amount of natural zeolite and high level of fluoride in drinking waters in ethiopian rift valley areas pulls the very vital aspect of the work graphical abstract image 1 keywords aluminum coated zeolite adsorptive mechanism defluoridation stilbite 1 introduction fluoride is a major environmental concern that causes dental to skeletal fluorosis and associated health risks when found beyond safe limit ozsvath 2009 sources of fluoride in water could be mainly from leaching of minerals rocks and sediments via weathering of parent rock materials raju 2016 basically elevated concentrations of fluoride are common when conditions favor the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in calcium poor aquifers rango et al 2012 the discharges of fluoride from anthropogenic activities are also another important sources in water high occurrence of fluoride in groundwater can be predicted by the presence of high concentrations of bicarbonate carbonate and sodium ions with ph values greater than seven young et al 2011 thole 2013 fluoride f intake through drinking water in small amounts 0 5 1 5 mg l is important in preventing dental caries it is also vital in promoting the strength and healthy conditions of bones whereas at higher concentrations 1 5 mg l fluoride causes dental to skeletal fluorosis depending on the dose and duration of exposure denbesten and li 2011 the prevention of dental caries and bone damage is due to interaction of calcium minerals with fluoride forming fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f neel et al 2016 skeletal and non skeletal manifestations as a result of fluoride are common in children due to low calcium in early bone development frazão et al 2011 it has been estimated that about 200 million people suffer from fluorosis in several countries across the globe including india 0 68 2 88 mg l f narsimha and sudarshan 2017 raj and shaji 2017 ethiopia up to 40 mg l f alemu et al 2015 china sri lanka usa asia and rift valley countries in africa amini et al 2008 jagtap et al 2012 consequently 1 5 mg l was set as a maximum contamination limit mcl in drinking water by who fawell et al 2006 jha et al 2013 various defluoridation technologies are available including membrane technique bhadja et al 2016 precipitation nalgonda rao et al 2008 electrolytic separation mumtaz et al 2015 freeze desalination yang et al 2017 and adsorption gai et al 2015 nowadays adsorption processes using various natural modified and synthetic adsorbents for effective defluoridation are usually applied adsorbents such as double or tri metal hydr oxides alumina clay materials carbon nanotubes apatite minerals and so on chai et al 2013 dou et al 2012 gai et al 2015 karmakar et al 2016 li et al 2003 mohapatra et al 2009 tor 2006 wu et al 2007 have been developed and tested for fluoride uptake although several attempts have shown promising adsorptive capacities for fluoride however applicability tests of most adsorbents and mechanism study are limited thus easly applicable and efficient adsorbent is vital to reach especially rural affected populations in this work locally available natural zeolite and its modified form were explored for fluoride uptake making advantage of tunable properties of zeolites natural zeolite is abundantly found and easily exploited resources throughout the world including ethiopia tadesse 2009 zeolites are minerals with crystalline hydrated alumino silicates with framework having unique intrinsic properties such as high surface area tunable surface and shape selectivity tuning the surface properties via modification of zeolite could change the adsorption capacities by influencing si al ratio within zeolites garcía et al 2014 on top of its proven cationic exchange chemically modified zeolites with inorganic salts or organic surfactants showed to be effective in removing anionic species haggerty and bowman 1994 li et al 1999 natural stilbite sti from ethiopia was used for fluoride removal previously gómez hortigüela et al 2013 and its capacity was found to be low thus sti with aluminum modification for significant increase in adsorption capacity was tested accordingly the major objectives were to assess the potential of natural sti from ethiopia and alc sti to remove fluoride from aqueous solutions indicating adsorption mechanisms involved therefore batch adsorption experiments were conducted under different conditions and applicability of the adsorbent was performed onto well waters 2 materials and methods a stock solution of 1000 mg l f was prepared by dissolving 2 21 g of naf 98 finkem italy in de ionized water and stored with polyethylene plastic bottles calibration standards of 0 05 0 1 1 10 and 100 mg l were prepared from 1000 mg l f stock

h2so4 titrant phenolphthalein and bromo cresol green indicators and calcon indicator were used to determine both calcium hardness and alkalinity 2 1 adsorbent processing and characterization five types of natural zeolite minerals adsorbents were collected from hashengie ethiopia and screened based on their effectiveness for f removal among these adsorbents collected natural stilbite tuff sti was selected according to its better performance for f removal sti was washed several times with de ionized water astm e 11 sieve of 300 μm mesh size was used to separate the adsorbent powders sti constituents were identified combining xrd and icp oes analysis the xrd patterns of finely ground powder were taken on a bruker d8 eco with a cu anode incident beam anode tube with 40 kv and 25 ma

according to epa 3052 da silva et al 2014 afterwards the suspension was filtered with acid resistant 0 45 μm filters whatman 542 whatman international ltd and measured using icp oes vista mpx ccd simultaneous varian version 2 0 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of sti and alc sti before and after adsorption were measured under vacuum with precautions taken to avoid moisture uptake 2 2 aluminum coating on natural stilbite aluminum coated sti was prepared for batch adsorption study according to asere et al 2017 adapting modification applied for scoria thus 50 g of sti powder particle size less than 0 075 mm was soaked with 300 ml of 0 5 m al2 so4 3 16h2o solution the mixture was well shaken in an orbital shaker for 12 h to provide homogenous coating on the surface of sti with alum then the ad mixture was decanted and dried in an oven at 70 c for 12 h the dried ad mixture of ph about 2 8 was adjusted to 7 with 5 m nh4oh this ph adjustment is to enhance precipitation of oxide of alum on the surface of adsorbent the precipitate was further dried in an oven at 70 c for 12 h finally the dried coated sti was washed with distilled water several times until supernatant provides clear solution then the aluminum coated stilbite alc sti was dried in an oven with 70 c for 48 h and stored in a tight plastic bottles for use 2 3 determination of point of zero charge pzc the point of zero charge of alc sti was determined using batch equilibrium method according to literature borah and senapati 2006 specifically 50 ml of 0 1 m nano3 99 9 merck germany was prepared and the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to values from 2 5 to 12 0 following that 1 g of alc sti was added to each solution and shaken until equilibrium 6 h then the solution was filtered and final ph

dissolving 4 g disodium edta salt 58 g nacl and 57 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 1 l volumetric flask then 125 ml of 6 m naoh was added to adjust the ph to 5 4 and the flask was filled to the mark with de ionized water batch experiments were performed in triplicate and the average results were reported in addition results were presented with error bars based on standard deviation of the triplicate measurements 2 5 characterization of real water samples the amount of chloride and nitrate in sampled well water was analyzed using argentometric titration mohr method and spectrophotometric method respectively narayana and sunil 2009 thus nitrate reacts with phenoldisulphonic acid producing nitro derivatives in a basic medium the colored complex produces an intensity

expected maximum fluoride uptake capacity of 11 52 mg g this adsorption capacity is greater even from the commercial aluminum hydroxide gai et al 2015 model parameters of langmuir and freundlich were summarized in table 3 at optimal conditions langmuir model is assumed to describe the relationship between the adsorbate and fixed homogeneous active surfaces of adsorption being all active sites with equal size and shape langmuir 1918 whereas freundlich isotherm model assumes heterogeneous surface with possibility of adsorbate adsorbate interaction the non linear forms of both models are given in eqs 9 and 10 9 langmuir q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 10 freundlich 1 n q e k f c 1 n where qe mg g the amount of f adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium ce mg l is the concentration of f in the solution at equilibrium the langmuir constants q m a x mg g and b l mg refer adsorption density and adsorption energy respectively kf mg g and 1 n are freundlich constants related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively fig 9 presents the non linear langmuir and freundlich adsorption plots at equilibrium freundlich model r2 0 9817 better fitted for alc sti compared to the langmuir model r2 0 9619 furthermore to confirm the fitness of models distribution of residuals experimental sorbed concentration minus fitted sorbed concentration along the isotherm was evaluated favorability of adsorption can be evaluated using separation factor rl r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 initial f concentrations in mg l and b l mg is the langmuir constant rl was found in range of 0 040 0 629 for concentration ranges of f studied with decreasing in the rl value as initial concentration increases the value of rl was found within the range 0 rl 1 signifying favorable equilibrium adsorption 3 5 application of the adsorbent three samples of natural well water containing 15 4 mg l fluoride were collected from a well found in jimma university compound ethiopia the physicochemical characteristics of the samples were investigated and reported in table 4 batch adsorption experiment was carried out for the well sample waters without adjusting the ph of the sample water ph 7 45 this experiment was accomplished at optimal conditions of the batch system evaluated using aqueous solutions fluoride concentration of the well water 15 4 mg l f was reduced to 2 3 mg l onto 40 g l of alc sti fig 10 although the reduction is high from 15 4 to 2 3 mg l the need for further treatment to reduce 2 3 mg l f to below the permissible level 1 5 mg l is important thus multi stage adsorption or higher dose of alc sti would be required for this particular high concentration of fluoride tested however f levels in most groundwater is lower than tested thus possibility of alc sti to reduce f contaminated water to potable limit is likely the main disadvantage of aluminum based adsorbents were the high residual aluminum remained in aqueous solution after defuoridation gai et al 2015 however in this work it was found that the residual aluminum ion leached from alc sti at optimum conditions was found to be 0 09 mg l which is by far less than the drinkable limit of aluminum ion 0 2 mg l the leaching of aluminum from the alumina based surfaces into its free and hydroxide ions in the aqueous medium is reported to be very low the presence of high fluoride concentrations may increase the dissolution due to the formation of aluminium hydr oxide fluoride complexes george et al 2010 3 6 comparison of alc sti with other adsorbents aluminum based adsorbents have been widely used for defluoridation techniques because of the affinity between aluminum and fluoride which result in high adsorption capacity mondal and george 2015 for instance aluminum based sorbents acquired a capacity of 43 29 mg g f using aluminum based particles synthesized by precipitation assaoui et al 2020 3 14 mg g f by alumina alkoxide kamble et al 2010 and magnesia amended activated alumina with 10 12 mg g f maliyekkal et al 2008 calcium based adsorbents were found capacities with the order hydroxyapatite fluorspar quartz activated by ferric ions calcite quartz fan et al 2003 a summary of reported literatures adsorption capacities are presented in table 5 relative to the studied adsorbent alc sti in fact direct comparison of alc sti with other adsorbents would face difficulties due to the differences in operating parameters 4 conclusions a batch scale adsorptive defluoridation experiments were performed as function of solution ph adsorbent dose contact time and agitation speed at room temperature the study suggested that the adsorption mechanism was due to the co operative actions of aluminol silanol functional groups and the hydroxyl as well as water molecules for f ion exchange which well involved to enhance the adsorption capacity the batch defluoridation using alc sti was found to be promising due to the following main findings high adsorption capacity of 11 52 mg g the possibility of working in wide ph ranges 3 10 and the buffering effect of the adsorbent which suits the drinking applications moreover the residual aluminum concentration after defluoridation by alc sti was found to be 0 09 mg l which is by far lower than who guideline for aluminum 0 2 mg l in drinking water it is shown that alc sti is highly important to be scaled up for fluoride removal as a proven method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest with any author or funder acknowldegnment authors are thankful for jimma university for chemical and material provision 
11983,groundwater consumption is considered as a major exposure route to fluoride in humans therefore this study unraveled the sources and sinks of groundwater fluoride in the vea catchment of northeastern ghana using an integration of litho petrography hydrogeochemical analysis multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis in this regard 70 groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and analyzed for major ions and stable isotopes using standard procedures whilst 10 rock samples were collected from the crystalline basement rocks of the birimian supergroup and used for the petrographic studies the petrographic results revealed the dominance of quartz microcline plagioclase albite biotite muscovite and hornblende in the lithological units the order of dominance of fluoride in the various lithologies is k feldspar rich granitoid hornblende biotite granitoid basaltic flow hornblende biotite tonalite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite granitoid the groundwater fluoride concentrations varied from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 68 mg l almost 61 of the samples have fluoride concentrations above the world health organization s maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l groundwater is supersaturated with respect to albite due to silicate weathering and undersaturated with respect to fluorite and calcite this enhanced ion exchange and fluoride mobilization in the groundwater from progressive calcite precipitation the fluoride concentrations show positive correlations with na mg2 hco3 and so4 2 confirming that fluoride enrichment is due to silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions the δ18o and δ2h values with respect to v smow vary between 4 15 and 2 75 and 22 49 and 13 74 respectively suggesting considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater enriched isotopic composition is observed with low fluoride concentration whilst depleted isotopic composition is observed with a higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater the stable isotopic compositions of the groundwater also indicated meteoric origin with an evaporative effect which partly influences the groundwater chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fluoride contamination stable isotopes vea catchment ghana 1 introduction fluoride f in drinking water is now a global health concern although f is required for proper tooth functioning in desired levels concentrations exceeding 1 5 mg l may cause significant health problems who 2017 high levels of f occurs in several parts of the world including africa asia and middle east e g adimalla and li 2019 li et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 zango et al 2019 in most of these areas prolonged drinking of groundwater with high f levels has led to incidences of dental fluorosis for instance in parts of the indo gangetic alluvial plains kumar et al 2019 reported f concentrations up to 5 8 mg l leading to severe cases of dental fluorosis and bone deformities in children based on petrographic analysis of the host rocks in the area as well as molar ratios of chemical species kumar et al 2019 stated that the high groundwater f is due to intense water rock interaction and dissolution from fluoride bearing minerals in the granitic basement of the indo gangetic alluvial plains similarly zango et al 2019 recently reported high groundwater f concentrations up to 13 29 mg l in the north east region of ghana which causes dental fluorosis in the region especially among children they attributed the f enrichment to geogenic processes including ion exchange reactions intense water rock interactions and mineral dissolution in the bongo district of the upper east region of ghana sunkari and abu 2019 also documented high groundwater f up to 4 0 mg l in boreholes and indicated that the people are exposed to initial symptoms of dental fluorosis like in the north east region of ghana the f mobilization in the bongo district is due to ion exchange reactions and dissolution from fluoride rich minerals in the bongo granitoids apambire et al 1997 craig et al 2018 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 elsewhere across the globe high groundwater f has also been linked to dissolution from rocks and ion exchange reactions e g chae et al 2007 farooqi et al 2007 thivya et al 2017 dehbandi et al 2018 moreover saxena and saxena 2014 mentioned that f levels in groundwater are controlled by the climatic conditions of arid to semi arid areas acting on the regional and local geology coupled with the flow pattern of the groundwater groundwater f can as well be sourced from igneous and metamorphic rocks with apatite feldspars hornblende pyroxene biotite fluorite and clay minerals like illite as the culprits thivya et al 2017 it is also not uncommon to associate groundwater f enrichment to the intensity of anthropogenic activities such as industrial and agricultural activities kundu and mandal 2009 assessment of the source of groundwater f has been effectively conducted using conventional geochemical graphs geochemical modeling multivariate geostatistical analysis and environmental isotopes olaka et al 2016 martins et al 2018 enalou et al 2018 su et al 2019 such an integrated approach is able to unravel groundwater flow patterns recharge sources effects of evaporation on hydrogeological systems and thus the mechanisms responsible for groundwater f mobilization in the vea catchment groundwater is the main potable water supply for domestic purposes considering its relatively cheap cost of abstraction the people have dug wells for their domestic water supplies and there are several boreholes that are actively in use however the exploitation and safety of groundwater in this area is beset with numerous setbacks emanating from interplay of geogenic processes and some anthropogenic activities there is the possibility of intense dissolution from fluoride bearing minerals in the bongo granitoids in the area just as reported in the bongo district which is part of the vea catchment no readily available research on groundwater quality with respect to contaminants such as fluoride in the entire vea catchment was found in the literature at the time of this study most of the studies are localized restricted to specific towns and districts in the area or on regional scale koffi et al 2017 conducted a hydrogeochemical study on groundwater and surface water in the vea catchment but the aim of the study was to assess the quality of the water for domestic and agricultural purposes their study did not also determine the fluoride concentrations of the water in the area and thus the overall quality of the water is not well known therefore the current study seeks to assess the influence of the local geology on the groundwater f levels using petrography of the host rocks hydrochemistry multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotopes the study will unravel the mechanisms responsible for f mobilization in groundwater of the vea catchment since this is the first study in the area reporting high groundwater f it would serve as a policy framework for stakeholders in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic conditions the vea catchment which is a sub catchment of the white volta basin in ghana is a trans boundary catchment covering part of burkina faso bongo district and bolgatanga municipality both in the upper east region ghana in ghana the vea catchment is located between latitudes 10 43 n and 11 n and longitudes 0 45 w and 1 w fig 1 a the catchment covers a total drainage area of about 305 km2 the average slope and altitude are 0 2 and 196 5 m a s l respectively the area is characterized by a single season of rainfall that begins from may and ends in october with an average monthly rainfall of 986 mm temperatures are always high and average at 28 6 c nonetheless monthly averages range from 26 4 c at the peak of the rainy season in august to an extreme value of 32 1 c in april dickson and benneh 1995 as it is common for the tropics diurnal temperature changes in the area exceed monthly variations dickson and benneh 1995 the vea catchment has a total evaporation of 2050 mm which exceeds the annual rainfall more than two folds 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the vea catchment is geologically within the navrongo nangodi greenstone belt of the paleoproterozoic birimian of ghana kesse 1985 underlying the catchment are felsic gneisses basaltic rocks and pyroclastic suite of rocks intruded at places by doleritic dykes granodiorites leube et al 1990 fig 1a according to milési et al 1989 three types of granitoids intrude in the area namely belt type granitoids basin type granitoids and k feldspar rich granitoids the belt and basin type granitoids intrude the volcanic and the metasedimentary suit of rocks respectively fig 1b the k feldspar rich granitoids are very coarse grained and are identified only in the region and hence a type locality name of bongo granitoids is given to them the belt type intrusive bodies are composed of hornblende biotite plagioclase feldspars and other accessory minerals on the other hand the basin type granitoids are composed largely of potassium feldspar biotite and muscovite together with some accessory minerals these intrusive bodies are coarse to medium grained however the most prominent outcrops in the area are the k feldspar rich granitoids bongo granitoids generally the dominant mineralogical composition of the rocks in the area is potassium and plagioclase feldspars the rocks in the area have undergone varying degrees of deformations characterized by shearing and jointing their coarse nature together with brittle deformations also makes them porous these deformational features and the porous fabric serve as conduits channel ways for water to readily infiltrate the rocks thereby facilitating chemical alteration of the mineral constituents the vea catchment forms a significant part of the crystalline basement aquifers in northern ghana where the aquifers are mainly within the weathered rocks that are overprinted by unique fractures storage of groundwater in the rocks is generally very poor but increases at the zone of the weathered and fractured rocks groundwater occurrence in the area depends largely on the thickness of the overburden and the degree of fracture of bedrocks recharge is from direct precipitation and the main vea dam that frequently gets flooded during the rainy season sunkari and abu 2019 stated that the average recharge is approximately 4 of the total annual precipitation that is 40 mm year higher water levels are restricted to areas with higher granitic elevation maybe due to increasing rates of recharge alongside decreasing horizontal conductivity martin and van de giesen 2005 borehole yields are low ranging from 0 13 to 0 32 l s but then are sufficient for installation of hand pumps apambire et al 1997 2 3 petrographic studies geological field mapping exercise was carried out in march 2019 during the dry season when the grasses within the study area were dry and burnt in isolated areas this made movement in the field easy and outcrops visible and accessible during the sample collection efforts were made to take fresh relatively fresh rock samples 10 samples were collected and thin sections prepared the thin sections were petrographically studied using reflected light microscope at the department of earth science university of ghana 2 4 geochemical analysis of groundwater samples groundwater sampling was carried out at the peak of the dry season in march 2019 a total of seventy 70 water samples were collected from boreholes in the area major dissolved elements were analyzed for all the 70 samples alkalinity and physical parameters such as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature and ph of the samples were measured in situ using hach field titration kit and portable ec and ph meters groundwater samples from boreholes were subsequently filtered through 0 45 μm membranes and collected in preconditioned polyethylene bottles filtered and acidified 1 v v hno3 samples were used for major cations while filtered unacidified samples were used or anion analysis na and k were analyzed using flame photometer ca2 and mg2 were determined by edta titration major anions cl so4 2 hco3 f and no3 were determined using dionex ics 90 ion chromatography system at the ghana atomic energy commission in accra the data was supplemented from the database of community water and sanitation agency cwsa in the upper east region of ghana in order to maintain the accuracy and a degree of confidence in the integrity of the data all the sampling bottles and glassware were soaked in a 5 nitric acid for a day and rinsed with deionized water before use instruments used were calibrated with standard chemical solutions prepared from commercially available chemicals and validated with standard reference materials srm and certified reference materials crm the srm were analyzed repeatedly at predetermined intervals to confirm that the method remained in a state of statistical control duplicate samples were also measured and compared and their results were found reproducible within 5 error limit again accuracy of the laboratory analysis was checked using the anion cation balance method and only those results within 5 were relied on for subsequent interpretation 2 5 stable isotope analysis during the sample collection in the field separate samples were collected in tightly capped 20 ml hdpe bottles the isotope analysis involved oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of sixty nine 69 samples the water samples collected were analyzed using a los gatos research dlt 100 liquid isotope water analyzer at the ghana atomic energy commission in accra the analyzer was coupled to a ctc lc pal liquid auto sampler los gatos inc ca pre calibrated internal laboratory standards and a blank were used in sample runs and the results were normalized to the vsmow slap δ scale the analytical precision was 0 1 o and 0 3 o for the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes respectively the detailed method of measurement is described in iaea 2009 2 6 data analysis the hydrochemical data was interpreted by means of ternary piper diagram piper 1953 and bivariate plots using aquachem software version 4 0 groundwater f spatial distribution map was generated using kriging interpolation technique with surfer software version 13 kriging was the choice of interpolation technique since it uses semi variograms in solving surface estimation problems sunkari and abu 2019 sunkari et al 2020 the saturation indices of the mineral phases identified in the water samples were calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 multivariate statistical analysis involving pearson correlation and r mode factor analysis were used in understanding the inter ion relationships and associations as well as deducing the sources of the ions during the r mode factor analysis principal component analysis was the extraction method used whereas varimax rotation was the rotation technique in order to minimize the number of factors to extract in the r mode factor analysis kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 was employed because the kaiser criterion filters out factors with initial eigenvalues 1 0 the multivariate statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics version 25 the origin of the groundwater was understood by the stable isotope patterns of the samples aquachem software version 4 0 was used in producing cross plots of the isotopes and other ions global meteoric water line gmwl was taken from craig 1961 from the equation below 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 where δ is the enrichment parameter of the isotope h and o are the heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen respectively however since the gmwl is a line of best fit used globally it may not reflect the local conditions in the study area hence the local meteoric water line lmwl proposed by akiti 1986 for ghana defined by equation 2 was used in this study 2 δ 2 h 7 86 δ 18 o 13 61 3 results and discussion 3 1 petrography the petrographic results fig 2 indicate the presence of quartz microcline plagioclase biotite muscovite hornblende opaque minerals and other accessory minerals quartz is the source of sio2 although there is no major element geochemical data to support this claim the feldspars microcline and plagioclase na bearing feldspar albite are the source of k and na respectively this is due to the nature of the twinning that is tartan and polysynthetic twining of the microcline and albite plagioclase of these minerals under reflected light these minerals contribute to f levels in groundwater according to ozsvath 2006 and chae et al 2006 based on the textures and mineral assemblages of the studied samples the samples are sub euhedral coarse textured and largely leucocratic the leucocratic nature is due to the large quartz and microcline content there are largely anhedral textures of biotite muscovite and hornblende in majority of the samples these anhedral textures are due to the readily alteration of the minerals due to the unstable nature of the minerals in the granitic rocks upon exposure to agents of chemical alteration like water the diversified mineralogical composition of these samples suggests the formation of the minerals at different times and temperature and this informs their level of stability with respect to chemical alteration there is the presence of accessory chlorite sericite and epidote which are alteration minerals of biotite feldspars microcline and plagioclase albite and hornblende fig 2 the dominance of the minerals table 1 is as follows quartz 41 microcline 31 plagioclase 17 2 biotite 3 1 muscovite 2 2 and hornblende 1 2 in the lithological units the order of dominance of fluoride in the various lithologies is k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite hornblende biotite granitoid basaltic flow hornblende biotite tonalite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite granitoid table 2 3 2 hydrochemistry the statistical summaries of the hydrochemical parameters are presented in table 3 whereas the concentrations of all the hydrochemical parameters are given in supplementary table 1 the ph of the water varies from 7 03 to 7 74 with a mean value of 7 30 consistent with the who acceptable range of 6 5 8 5 who 2017 such range of ph suggests that the water is near neutral to slightly alkaline the moderate alkaline ph may be due to dissolved clays and carbonates associated with the metasedimentary rocks which serve as appropriate medium for adsorption and desorption of metals and toxic ions like fluoride in groundwater keshavarzi et al 2010 zango et al 2019 the temperature of the water varies from 24 2 to 31 3 c with a mean of 27 2 c the ec values range from 176 to 1352 μs cm with a mean value of 400 μs cm falling within the guideline value of 2500 μs cm who 2017 the tds concentrations 96 8 744 mg l mean of 221 mg l were also generally low and the groundwater can be described as fresh based of freeze and cherry 1979 classification the low tds values are also likely due to the short residence time of the groundwater limiting intense water rock interaction sunkari et al 2019 the well depths range from 17 0 to 70 0 m with a mean of 42 8 m and from the supplementary table 1 it is observed that the deeper the well the higher the major ion concentrations in terms of major cation concentrations na is the dominant cation with concentrations ranging from 10 9 to 211 mg l and a mean concentration of 38 6 mg l table 3 the who guideline value for na in drinking water is 200 mg l who 2017 implying that some of the samples exceeded the guideline value such a trend is probably from silicate weathering from the granitoids in the area ca2 is the second most abundant cation in the groundwater varying from 1 40 to 26 8 mg l with a mean value of 9 95 mg l falling within the who maximum permissible limit of 200 mg l table 3 the mg2 concentrations also vary from 1 02 to 28 5 mg l with a mean concentration of 7 14 mg l table 3 k is the least dominant cation in the groundwater with concentrations in the range of 0 49 5 20 mg l and a mean value of 1 97 mg l far below the standard guideline value of 200 mg l table 3 in all the major cation concentrations vary in the order of na ca2 mg2 k suggesting rapid release of na from albite via alteration and leaching processes fig 2 although k bearing microcline is dominant it is not contained in the high temperature minerals like ca bearing anorthite na bearing albite and mg bearing biotite hornblende hence it is relatively stable compared to these minerals and as such will be released last and possibly less into groundwater hco3 is the most abundant major anion in the groundwater with concentrations in the range of 30 0 260 mg l and a mean concentration of 80 0 mg l table 3 this might be due to limited dissolution of carbonate minerals in the aquifer system since the area contains no carbonate rocks fig 1 the cl concentrations range from 14 7 to 178 mg l with a mean concentration of 37 0 mg l falling within the who guideline value of 250 mg l table 3 similarly the so4 2 concentrations 1 01 62 9 mg l with a mean value of 9 29 mg l are also within the who maximum permissible limit of 200 mg l table 3 perhaps ion exchange reactions or limited dissolution of gypsum are the culprits for the so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater other anions of importance in groundwater studies are f and no3 since their concentrations can affect the health of consumers of the water therefore the f concentrations of groundwater in the vea catchment vary from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 66 mg l table 3 this suggests that the water is contaminated with f since the maximum permissible limit of f in drinking water is pegged at 1 5 mg l who 2017 worryingly the mean concentration 1 68 mg l exceeds the guideline value 1 5 mg l exposing the people to the threat of dental fluorosis the high fluoride samples are mostly within the area dominated by k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite and hornblende biotite granitoid fig 1 table 2 the no3 concentrations 3 29 54 7 mg l mean value of 16 3 mg l also exceed the acceptable limit of 50 mg l table 3 the relatively high no3 concentrations may be due to leaching from nitrate fertilizers sunkari et al 2020 applied on farms in the vea catchment altogether the major ion concentrations in groundwater of the vea catchment vary in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 3 3 geochemical evolution of groundwater ternary piper diagram piper 1953 has been widely used in groundwater studies to discriminate the various hydrochemical facies and geochemical evolution of groundwater in aquifer systems therefore this study also used piper diagram to show the type of water in the vea catchment from the piper diagram fig 3 the dominant hydrochemical facies is na ca hco3 85 followed by ca na mg hco3 10 and mg na hco3 5 the dominance of na ca hco3 water type might be due to silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions in the aquifer similar reason may be accounting for the other two types of water in the area koffi et al 2017 studied the hydrochemistry of some parts of the vea catchment and mentioned that the dominant hydrochemical facies in the vea catchment is ca mg hco3 water they also linked the dominance of the ca mg hco3 water type to cation exchange and silicate weathering which is consistent with the findings of this study 3 4 groundwater fluoride distribution a total of 43 samples out of the 70 samples under this study have groundwater f above 1 5 mg l this implies that about 61 of the people in the communities where the groundwater was sampled from the entire vea catchment is drinking water that is detrimental to their health the affected communities are mostly around the northeastern central and southwestern parts of the study area fig 4 the major communities in these areas include bongo vea nzangongo balungu kodorogo tarungo nyarega and sumbrungu fig 4 areas with groundwater f between 1 5 and 2 4 mg l include namoo amokobisi 1 namoo yakabisi sambolingu kansoe sambolingu amanga bungu balungu doni balungu langanabisi bongo nabisi zoko tarongo bogorodo namoo amokobisi 2 boko tendama 2 gowri vea akugrebisi vea gunga vea asornabisi bongo shs 2 nabiisi pri jhs sumbrugu pri jhs

nyarega 2 fig 4 however areas with groundwater f between 2 5 and 3 9 mg l include balungu chps bongo shs 1 kabere chps kodorogo chps st annes pri jhs vea kupielga nyarega asammabisi akanweebisi dulungu naabis and sumbrungu amogribisi fig 4 all these communities are intruded by k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite and hornblende biotite granitoid fig 1 indicating possible intense dissolution it is indeed worrying that boreholes in public schools and health care centers in the area are all extremely contaminated with f though this study did not conduct a medical assessment of the teeth of the people in the area it was observed that most of the children and even adults have mottled teeth which is likely evidence for dental fluorosis the vea catchment is not precluded from the menace of dental fluorosis as observed in most parts of the upper east region majority of the people have mottled teeth but are unaware of the cause of such ailment the rural people believe that it is a curse from their gods and ancestors and the elite in the society rather attribute it to poor dental care at homes however the severity of the issue suggests that none of the reasons given by the inhabitants may be accounting for the incidence of dental fluorosis 3 5 controlling factors of groundwater chemistry gibbs plots gibbs 1970 have been effectively used over the years to decipher the implication of weathering evaporation and dilution on groundwater chemistry on the gibbs plots fig 5 a and b the studied samples of the vea catchment largely support water rock interaction as the dominant process controlling the elevated f contents in the groundwater with one sample indicating evaporation dominance the effect of water rock interaction on f levels in groundwater has been extensively studied in the literature shah and danishwar 2003 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 zango et al 2019 a plot of the f concentrations mg l against the well depths m reveals a linear relationship r 0 41 where an increase in the f concentrations 1 5 mg l is associated with increasing well depth although some shallow wells also have high f concentrations fig 5c this might be pointing to the longer groundwater residence times and thus intense water rock interaction and ion exchange reactions in the aquifer however the shallow wells with high f concentrations 1 5 mg l may be as a result of anthropogenic activities around the aquifer when equilibrium is reached between na and f the high na released into groundwater could produce soft water thereby facilitating higher f concentration levels naseem et al 2010 na na cl ratio is a suitable proxy in discriminating origins of groundwater hounslow 1995 the average na na cl ratio of the groundwater is 0 53 supporting the influence of albite on the groundwater chemistry f concentrations are found to be higher in granitic rocks than any other rock type with a range of 500 and 1400 mg kg koritnig 1978 krauskopf and bird 1995 high levels of f in aquifers have been attributed to biotite dissolution and fluoride replacement of oh sites due largely to their similar ionic radii f 1 23 1 36 å and oh 1 37 1 40 å li et al 2003 naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 this fluoride enrichment process is time dependent as prolonged residence time of biotite bearing rocks is reported to have resulted in elevated f levels raju et al 2009 rao et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 following the chemical reaction below 3 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg al2si3o10 oh 3 2f about 61 of borehole samples have elevated levels of f above the acceptable levels of 1 5 mg l table 3 and this is due to biotite dissolution and evaporation from the aquifers young et al 2011 this is consistent with the dominance of hornblende biotite granitoid in the area fig 1 and the high amount of fluoride up to 3 78 mg l released from these rocks into groundwater table 2 the presence and contribution of mafic and ultramafic minerals to the f levels in the area is shown by the low mg ca mg ratio of 0 37 suggesting trace content of biotite and hornblende minerals in the area fig 2 alteration of microcline albite and muscovite into clay minerals such as smectite and kaolinite particularly kaolinite can release f bearing minerals from granitic rocks via the process of kaolinization and concentrate it in groundwater the area has huge deposits of kaolinite in the balungu and vea dam flood plain with a river serving as a source of water to the vea dam the elevated levels of f within the catchment could be attributed partly to the process of kaolinization the effect of silicate weathering on groundwater f concentration has been constrained using na cl ratio when the ratio na cl values 1 this is indicative of silicate weathering and halite dissolution naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 almost all the studied samples have na cl values 1 fig 6 a this is due to the weathering of the felsic gneisses in the area which subsequently leached the excess na into the groundwater the high na cl molar ratio also indicates that apart from silicate weathering halite dissolution was also responsible for the elevated na and cl concentrations in the groundwater the dominance of silicate weathering in the area as revealed in this study is consistent with the findings of koffi et al 2017 additionally all the samples plot above the 1 1 line except two samples on the na mg l and cl mg l bivariate plot fig 6a implying the dominance of ion exchange reactions enriching these ions the two samples that plot below the 1 1 line are due to reverse ion exchange reactions that provided the excess na and cl the plotting of some of the samples in close proximity to the 1 1 line further highlights the effect of halite dissolution on the groundwater chemistry the molar ratios of na ca2 are also greater than 1 for all the samples indicating low calcium activity fig 6b the high na ca2 molar ratios also point out the prevalence of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer considering the plotting of majority of the samples above the 1 1 line on the na mg l and ca2 mg l bivariate plot fig 6b however just as observed in the na mg l and cl mg l bivariate plot the three samples that plot below the 1 1 line on the na mg l and ca2 mg l bivariate plot reveal that reverse ion exchange is responsible for the na and ca2 concentrations of those samples a plot of na mg l versus hco3 mg l fig 6c indicates that the excess hco3 resulted from calcite precipitation which eventually reduced the ca2 concentration relative to the na concentration younas et al 2019 this is a clear evidence for the reverse ion exchange process observed in the na mg l versus hco3 mg l bivariate plot fig 6c the dominant role of silicate weathering especially weathering of the granite gneisses on the groundwater chemistry is further constrained on the bivariate plot of the molar ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na fig 6d on this diagram carbonate dissolution appears to influence the chemistry of only two samples moreover bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 gives a hint that the samples with f concentrations above 1 fall below the 1 1 equiline fig 6e this confirms the silicate weathering and base ion exchange reactions dominant in the aquifer that progressively elevated the hco3 and f concentrations in groundwater the effect of dolomitization on the groundwater chemistry cannot be precluded in the vea catchment since majority of the samples plot along the 1 1 line fig 6e however de dolomitization facilitated the removal of excess ca2 and mg2 in the water and enhanced the addition of na via ion exchange in the recharging freshwater zango et al 2019 the ca2 and so4 2 concentrations may also be as a result of dissolution of gypsum since majority of the samples plot close to and along the 1 1 line on the ca2 and so4 2 cross plot fig 6f nevertheless it is worthy to mention that reverse ion exchange and perhaps anthropogenic input from decomposed sulfates in fertilizers may also account for the groundwater so4 2 enrichment laxmankumar et al 2019 3 6 sources of groundwater fluoride about 61 of the boreholes in the vea catchment that intersect biotite rich granitoids contain f levels above the maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l this jeopardizes the health and livelihood of the rural folks that dwell on the water for domestic purposes the high groundwater f occurred under alkaline conditions ph 7 03 7 74 it is widely reported that alkaline conditions increase in ph favor groundwater f mobilization keshavarzi et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 zango et al 2019 as stated earlier the vea catchment contains high amounts of clay minerals and thus the alkaline ph alongside the presence of the clays may be a control mechanism for the f mobilization in the groundwater keshavarzi et al 2010 stated that f has the proclivity of getting adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces in alkaline water this implies that the high f concentrations in the studied groundwater might be as a result of f adsorption on the surfaces of clay minerals under the dominant alkaline conditions in the area this is supported by the positive correlation r 0 19 between ph and f table 4 also the increase in ph na and hco3 eventually increases groundwater f concentrations via the aforementioned mechanisms in the previous section from the gibbs plots it is observed that water rock interaction is the dominant geochemical process residing in the hydrogeological system of the vea catchment such process is common in semi arid environments where ion exchange reactions involving ca2 and na result in the reduction of ca2 and the enrichment of na and f karro and uppin 2013 the possible cation exchange reaction that took place between ca2 and na is supported by the dominance of na bearing plagioclase fig 2 and the high content of na with a mean of 40 3 mg l relative to the mean ca2 concentration of 24 5 mg l table 3 additionally the f concentrations show positive correlations with most of the hydrochemical parameters including ec tds na mg2 hco3 and so4 2 table 4 indicating that f enrichment is related with the mechanisms enriching these parameters in the water as explained above most of these hydrochemical parameters are enriched in the water via ion exchange reactions and similar explanation can be given to the groundwater f enrichment nevertheless negative correlation of f with k and ca2 table 4 implies reverse ion exchange reactions in the aquifer system geochemical modeling is widely used in groundwater studies to calculate the saturation indices si of mineral phases residing in water and contributing to groundwater f enrichment younas et al 2019 zango et al 2019 the mineral phases identified in the water include albite si 0 32 to 5 59 mean 1 38 calcite si 2 72 to 0 06 mean 1 20 dolomite si 3 97 to 0 13 mean 2 38 fluorite si 2 26 to 0 19 mean 1 33 gypsum si 6 24 to 1 67 mean 3 40 and halite si 9 08 to 5 43 mean 7 65 table 3 suggesting that all the samples are undersaturated with respect to these minerals except albite and calcite on a bivariate plot of the si calcite versus f mg l all the samples plot in the calcite undersaturation zone except one sample that plots in the calcite saturation zone fig 7 a similarly all the samples appear to fall within the fluorite undersaturation zone in the si fluorite versus f mg l plot fig 7b the results clearly elucidate that groundwater in the vea catchment evolved under alkaline conditions where most of the samples are undersaturated with respect to calcite which enhanced progressive removal of ca2 and preferential release of f in solution in such a scenario the groundwater retains higher f concentrations prior to saturation with fluorite it is suggested that fluorite dissolution in the vea catchment is facilitated by the progressive precipitation of calcite notwithstanding the undersaturation of majority of the samples with respect to fluorite and calcite the strong positive correlation r 0 45 between si fluorite and si calcite further highlights the role calcite plays in the f concentrations in the groundwater fig 7c therefore f and ca2 have a direct relationship the groundwater is also undersaturated with respect to dolomite as observed in the cross plot of the si dolomite versus f concentrations fig 7d suggesting the prevalence of ambient conditions necessary for calcite dissolution lermi and ertan 2019 almost 91 of the samples are saturated with respect to albite reflecting the dominance of silicate weathering in the aquifer fig 7e it also highlights the role granitoids in the area fig 1 play in the chemistry of the groundwater f enrichment in the groundwater seems to be related to albite dissolution in view of the positive correlation r 0 095 between si albite and f concentrations and also confirms the dominance of ion exchange reactions in the hydrogeological system of the vea catchment undersaturation of groundwater with respect to halite fig 7f may be due to higher halite solubility which enhanced halite dissolution to release na and cl in the groundwater 3 7 multivariate statistical analysis factor analysis with principal component analysis as the extraction method was applied to the hydrochemical parameters to show their relationships and determine the factors responsible for each association using the kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 three principal components with eigenvalues 1 0 but less than 2 0 and total variance of 74 9 were extracted supplementary table 2 the first principal component accounts for about 13 2 of the total variance and correlates positively with all the hydrochemical parameters with very strong positive loadings on ec tds na k ca2 hco3 and no3 supplementary table 2 fig 8 it is well established that such association of hydrochemical parameters is as a result of weathering ion exchange reactions and intense water rock interaction yidana et al 2010 however the association of no3 with other hydrochemical parameters in the first principal component may be pointing to input from domestic sewage and nitrate fertilizers applied on farms in the vea catchment zango et al 2019 the second principal component accounts for 12 7 of the total variance and positively correlates with tds na mg2 and f with very strong positive loadings on cl and so4 2 supplementary table 2 fig 8 this kind of association also suggests the dominance of ion exchange reactions silicate weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals such as fluorite and biotite laxmankumar et al 2019 in the area but the strong positive correlation of so4 2 with other hydrochemical parameters in the second principal component might also be giving a hint to anthropogenic contribution to the groundwater chemistry through the application of sulphate fertilizers on farmlands since the people are mainly farmers the third principal component which accounts for 8 39 of the total variance loads positively on ec tds so4 2 hco3 and strongly correlates with ph temperature mg2 and f supplementary table 2 fig 8 this suggests that reverse ion exchange reactions are prevalent in the area however the association of so4 2 in this group further highlights anthropogenic contribution from agricultural activities to the groundwater chemistry 3 8 verification from isotopic compositions the summary of δ18o and δ2h compositions of the groundwater is presented in table 2 the δ18o and δ2h values with respect to v smow vary between 4 15 and 2 75 and 22 5 and 13 7 respectively suggesting considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater most of the samples plot along or near the gmwl and lmwl and mostly in between the two meteoric water lines fig 9 a indicating their meteoric water origin qian et al 2014 salifu et al 2017 this implies that groundwater in the vea catchment is likely recharged from fresh local precipitation rainfall however some of the samples shifted from the gmwl and plotted in the lower slope area along the evaporation line suggesting that after precipitation the water goes through secondary evaporation younas et al 2019 therefore f in the groundwater may be released from the aquifer materials via local meteoric recharge and to some extent evaporation furthermore a plot of δ18o and f concentrations indicates that higher groundwater f concentrations are fairly homogenized relative to the δ18o and thus low δ18o values fig 9b the enriched isotopic composition is observed with the low fluoride concentrations whilst the depleted isotopic composition is with higher concentrations of fluoride table 2 accordingly mixing of groundwater with fast vertically recharged water and surface water along the groundwater flow conduits may be accounting for this trend xie et al 2013 such observation has already been reported by clark and fritz 2013 and goller et al 2005 4 conclusion and recommendations this study was conducted to understand the source of high fluoride in groundwater within the vea catchment of northeastern ghana this involved petrographic analysis of rock samples hydrochemical analysis multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis the area is mainly composed of biotite rich granitoids of the paleoproterozoic birimian supergroup the petrographic studies show in decreasing compositional order quartz microcline k rich plagioclase na rich biotite mg rich muscovite ca mg rich hornblende mg rich and other accessory minerals the major cations vary in the order of na ca2 mg2 k whereas the major anions vary in the order cl so4 2 hco3 na ca hco3 water is dominant in the area the fluoride concentrations vary from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 68 mg l in excess of the maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l the fluoride contamination affected a total of 43 boreholes in the study area representing about 61 of all boreholes where the samples were collected the affected communities are located in the northeastern central and southwestern parts of the vea catchment the hydrochemical and isotopic data reveal that the groundwater evolved under high impact of water rock interaction ion exchange reactions kaolinization and silicate weathering moreover evaporation after precipitation is another major process causing the enrichment of the ions in the water all these geogenic processes resulted in the mobilization of fluoride in the groundwater in elevated levels saturation indices of the mineral phases in the water indicated that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to albite due to silicate weathering and undersaturated with respect fluorite and calcite this enhanced ion exchange and fluoride enrichment from progressive calcite precipitation the high groundwater fluoride in the vea catchment exposes the people to dental fluorosis which jeopardizes the health and livelihood of the people therefore the stakeholders and decision makers in the area must come to the aid of the people by devising technologically cost effective methods of minimizing the groundwater fluoride such as rainwater harvesting facilities supply of drinking water from low fluoride surface water sources and use of solar energy powered electrolytic de fluoridation technology in the high fluoride

11983,groundwater consumption is considered as a major exposure route to fluoride in humans therefore this study unraveled the sources and sinks of groundwater fluoride in the vea catchment of northeastern ghana using an integration of litho petrography hydrogeochemical analysis multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis in this regard 70 groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and analyzed for major ions and stable isotopes using standard procedures whilst 10 rock samples were collected from the crystalline basement rocks of the birimian supergroup and used for the petrographic studies the petrographic results revealed the dominance of quartz microcline plagioclase albite biotite muscovite and hornblende in the lithological units the order of dominance of fluoride in the various lithologies is k feldspar rich granitoid hornblende biotite granitoid basaltic flow hornblende biotite tonalite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite granitoid the groundwater fluoride concentrations varied from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 68 mg l almost 61 of the samples have fluoride concentrations above the world health organization s maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l groundwater is supersaturated with respect to albite due to silicate weathering and undersaturated with respect to fluorite and calcite this enhanced ion exchange and fluoride mobilization in the groundwater from progressive calcite precipitation the fluoride concentrations show positive correlations with na mg2 hco3 and so4 2 confirming that fluoride enrichment is due to silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions the δ18o and δ2h values with respect to v smow vary between 4 15 and 2 75 and 22 49 and 13 74 respectively suggesting considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater enriched isotopic composition is observed with low fluoride concentration whilst depleted isotopic composition is observed with a higher concentration of fluoride in groundwater the stable isotopic compositions of the groundwater also indicated meteoric origin with an evaporative effect which partly influences the groundwater chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fluoride contamination stable isotopes vea catchment ghana 1 introduction fluoride f in drinking water is now a global health concern although f is required for proper tooth functioning in desired levels concentrations exceeding 1 5 mg l may cause significant health problems who 2017 high levels of f occurs in several parts of the world including africa asia and middle east e g adimalla and li 2019 li et al 2019 ganyaglo et al 2019 zango et al 2019 in most of these areas prolonged drinking of groundwater with high f levels has led to incidences of dental fluorosis for instance in parts of the indo gangetic alluvial plains kumar et al 2019 reported f concentrations up to 5 8 mg l leading to severe cases of dental fluorosis and bone deformities in children based on petrographic analysis of the host rocks in the area as well as molar ratios of chemical species kumar et al 2019 stated that the high groundwater f is due to intense water rock interaction and dissolution from fluoride bearing minerals in the granitic basement of the indo gangetic alluvial plains similarly zango et al 2019 recently reported high groundwater f concentrations up to 13 29 mg l in the north east region of ghana which causes dental fluorosis in the region especially among children they attributed the f enrichment to geogenic processes including ion exchange reactions intense water rock interactions and mineral dissolution in the bongo district of the upper east region of ghana sunkari and abu 2019 also documented high groundwater f up to 4 0 mg l in boreholes and indicated that the people are exposed to initial symptoms of dental fluorosis like in the north east region of ghana the f mobilization in the bongo district is due to ion exchange reactions and dissolution from fluoride rich minerals in the bongo granitoids apambire et al 1997 craig et al 2018 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 elsewhere across the globe high groundwater f has also been linked to dissolution from rocks and ion exchange reactions e g chae et al 2007 farooqi et al 2007 thivya et al 2017 dehbandi et al 2018 moreover saxena and saxena 2014 mentioned that f levels in groundwater are controlled by the climatic conditions of arid to semi arid areas acting on the regional and local geology coupled with the flow pattern of the groundwater groundwater f can as well be sourced from igneous and metamorphic rocks with apatite feldspars hornblende pyroxene biotite fluorite and clay minerals like illite as the culprits thivya et al 2017 it is also not uncommon to associate groundwater f enrichment to the intensity of anthropogenic activities such as industrial and agricultural activities kundu and mandal 2009 assessment of the source of groundwater f has been effectively conducted using conventional geochemical graphs geochemical modeling multivariate geostatistical analysis and environmental isotopes olaka et al 2016 martins et al 2018 enalou et al 2018 su et al 2019 such an integrated approach is able to unravel groundwater flow patterns recharge sources effects of evaporation on hydrogeological systems and thus the mechanisms responsible for groundwater f mobilization in the vea catchment groundwater is the main potable water supply for domestic purposes considering its relatively cheap cost of abstraction the people have dug wells for their domestic water supplies and there are several boreholes that are actively in use however the exploitation and safety of groundwater in this area is beset with numerous setbacks emanating from interplay of geogenic processes and some anthropogenic activities there is the possibility of intense dissolution from fluoride bearing minerals in the bongo granitoids in the area just as reported in the bongo district which is part of the vea catchment no readily available research on groundwater quality with respect to contaminants such as fluoride in the entire vea catchment was found in the literature at the time of this study most of the studies are localized restricted to specific towns and districts in the area or on regional scale koffi et al 2017 conducted a hydrogeochemical study on groundwater and surface water in the vea catchment but the aim of the study was to assess the quality of the water for domestic and agricultural purposes their study did not also determine the fluoride concentrations of the water in the area and thus the overall quality of the water is not well known therefore the current study seeks to assess the influence of the local geology on the groundwater f levels using petrography of the host rocks hydrochemistry multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotopes the study will unravel the mechanisms responsible for f mobilization in groundwater of the vea catchment since this is the first study in the area reporting high groundwater f it would serve as a policy framework for stakeholders in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic conditions the vea catchment which is a sub catchment of the white volta basin in ghana is a trans boundary catchment covering part of burkina faso bongo district and bolgatanga municipality both in the upper east region ghana in ghana the vea catchment is located between latitudes 10 43 n and 11 n and longitudes 0 45 w and 1 w fig 1 a the catchment covers a total drainage area of about 305 km2 the average slope and altitude are 0 2 and 196 5 m a s l respectively the area is characterized by a single season of rainfall that begins from may and ends in october with an average monthly rainfall of 986 mm temperatures are always high and average at 28 6 c nonetheless monthly averages range from 26 4 c at the peak of the rainy season in august to an extreme value of 32 1 c in april dickson and benneh 1995 as it is common for the tropics diurnal temperature changes in the area exceed monthly variations dickson and benneh 1995 the vea catchment has a total evaporation of 2050 mm which exceeds the annual rainfall more than two folds 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the vea catchment is geologically within the navrongo nangodi greenstone belt of the paleoproterozoic birimian of ghana kesse 1985 underlying the catchment are felsic gneisses basaltic rocks and pyroclastic suite of rocks intruded at places by doleritic dykes granodiorites leube et al 1990 fig 1a according to milési et al 1989 three types of granitoids intrude in the area namely belt type granitoids basin type granitoids and k feldspar rich granitoids the belt and basin type granitoids intrude the volcanic and the metasedimentary suit of rocks respectively fig 1b the k feldspar rich granitoids are very coarse grained and are identified only in the region and hence a type locality name of bongo granitoids is given to them the belt type intrusive bodies are composed of hornblende biotite plagioclase feldspars and other accessory minerals on the other hand the basin type granitoids are composed largely of potassium feldspar biotite and muscovite together with some accessory minerals these intrusive bodies are coarse to medium grained however the most prominent outcrops in the area are the k feldspar rich granitoids bongo granitoids generally the dominant mineralogical composition of the rocks in the area is potassium and plagioclase feldspars the rocks in the area have undergone varying degrees of deformations characterized by shearing and jointing their coarse nature together with brittle deformations also makes them porous these deformational features and the porous fabric serve as conduits channel ways for water to readily infiltrate the rocks thereby facilitating chemical alteration of the mineral constituents the vea catchment forms a significant part of the crystalline basement aquifers in northern ghana where the aquifers are mainly within the weathered rocks that are overprinted by unique fractures storage of groundwater in the rocks is generally very poor but increases at the zone of the weathered and fractured rocks groundwater occurrence in the area depends largely on the thickness of the overburden and the degree of fracture of bedrocks recharge is from direct precipitation and the main vea dam that frequently gets flooded during the rainy season sunkari and abu 2019 stated that the average recharge is approximately 4 of the total annual precipitation that is 40 mm year higher water levels are restricted to areas with higher granitic elevation maybe due to increasing rates of recharge alongside decreasing horizontal conductivity martin and van de giesen 2005 borehole yields are low ranging from 0 13 to 0 32 l s but then are sufficient for installation of hand pumps apambire et al 1997 2 3 petrographic studies geological field mapping exercise was carried out in march 2019 during the dry season when the grasses within the study area were dry and burnt in isolated areas this made movement in the field easy and outcrops visible and accessible during the sample collection efforts were made to take fresh relatively fresh rock samples 10 samples were collected and thin sections prepared the thin sections were petrographically studied using reflected light microscope at the department of earth science university of ghana 2 4 geochemical analysis of groundwater samples groundwater sampling was carried out at the peak of the dry season in march 2019 a total of seventy 70 water samples were collected from boreholes in the area major dissolved elements were analyzed for all the 70 samples alkalinity and physical parameters such as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature and ph of the samples were measured in situ using hach field titration kit and portable ec and ph meters groundwater samples from boreholes were subsequently filtered through 0 45 μm membranes and collected in preconditioned polyethylene bottles filtered and acidified 1 v v hno3 samples were used for major cations while filtered unacidified samples were used or anion analysis na and k were analyzed using flame photometer ca2 and mg2 were determined by edta titration major anions cl so4 2 hco3 f and no3 were determined using dionex ics 90 ion chromatography system at the ghana atomic energy commission in accra the data was supplemented from the database of community water and sanitation agency cwsa in the upper east region of ghana in order to maintain the accuracy and a degree of confidence in the integrity of the data all the sampling bottles and glassware were soaked in a 5 nitric acid for a day and rinsed with deionized water before use instruments used were calibrated with standard chemical solutions prepared from commercially available chemicals and validated with standard reference materials srm and certified reference materials crm the srm were analyzed repeatedly at predetermined intervals to confirm that the method remained in a state of statistical control duplicate samples were also measured and compared and their results were found reproducible within 5 error limit again accuracy of the laboratory analysis was checked using the anion cation balance method and only those results within 5 were relied on for subsequent interpretation 2 5 stable isotope analysis during the sample collection in the field separate samples were collected in tightly capped 20 ml hdpe bottles the isotope analysis involved oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of sixty nine 69 samples the water samples collected were analyzed using a los gatos research dlt 100 liquid isotope water analyzer at the ghana atomic energy commission in accra the analyzer was coupled to a ctc lc pal liquid auto sampler los gatos inc ca pre calibrated internal laboratory standards and a blank were used in sample runs and the results were normalized to the vsmow slap δ scale the analytical precision was 0 1 o and 0 3 o for the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes respectively the detailed method of measurement is described in iaea 2009 2 6 data analysis the hydrochemical data was interpreted by means of ternary piper diagram piper 1953 and bivariate plots using aquachem software version 4 0 groundwater f spatial distribution map was generated using kriging interpolation technique with surfer software version 13 kriging was the choice of interpolation technique since it uses semi variograms in solving surface estimation problems sunkari and abu 2019 sunkari et al 2020 the saturation indices of the mineral phases identified in the water samples were calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 multivariate statistical analysis involving pearson correlation and r mode factor analysis were used in understanding the inter ion relationships and associations as well as deducing the sources of the ions during the r mode factor analysis principal component analysis was the extraction method used whereas varimax rotation was the rotation technique in order to minimize the number of factors to extract in the r mode factor analysis kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 was employed because the kaiser criterion filters out factors with initial eigenvalues 1 0 the multivariate statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics version 25 the origin of the groundwater was understood by the stable isotope patterns of the samples aquachem software version 4 0 was used in producing cross plots of the isotopes and other ions global meteoric water line gmwl was taken from craig 1961 from the equation below 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 where δ is the enrichment parameter of the isotope h and o are the heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen respectively however since the gmwl is a line of best fit used globally it may not reflect the local conditions in the study area hence the local meteoric water line lmwl proposed by akiti 1986 for ghana defined by equation 2 was used in this study 2 δ 2 h 7 86 δ 18 o 13 61 3 results and discussion 3 1 petrography the petrographic results fig 2 indicate the presence of quartz microcline plagioclase biotite muscovite hornblende opaque minerals and other accessory minerals quartz is the source of sio2 although there is no major element geochemical data to support this claim the feldspars microcline and plagioclase na bearing feldspar albite are the source of k and na respectively this is due to the nature of the twinning that is tartan and polysynthetic twining of the microcline and albite plagioclase of these minerals under reflected light these minerals contribute to f levels in groundwater according to ozsvath 2006 and chae et al 2006 based on the textures and mineral assemblages of the studied samples the samples are sub euhedral coarse textured and largely leucocratic the leucocratic nature is due to the large quartz and microcline content there are largely anhedral textures of biotite muscovite and hornblende in majority of the samples these anhedral textures are due to the readily alteration of the minerals due to the unstable nature of the minerals in the granitic rocks upon exposure to agents of chemical alteration like water the diversified mineralogical composition of these samples suggests the formation of the minerals at different times and temperature and this informs their level of stability with respect to chemical alteration there is the presence of accessory chlorite sericite and epidote which are alteration minerals of biotite feldspars microcline and plagioclase albite and hornblende fig 2 the dominance of the minerals table 1 is as follows quartz 41 microcline 31 plagioclase 17 2 biotite 3 1 muscovite 2 2 and hornblende 1 2 in the lithological units the order of dominance of fluoride in the various lithologies is k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite hornblende biotite granitoid basaltic flow hornblende biotite tonalite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite granitoid table 2 3 2 hydrochemistry the statistical summaries of the hydrochemical parameters are presented in table 3 whereas the concentrations of all the hydrochemical parameters are given in supplementary table 1 the ph of the water varies from 7 03 to 7 74 with a mean value of 7 30 consistent with the who acceptable range of 6 5 8 5 who 2017 such range of ph suggests that the water is near neutral to slightly alkaline the moderate alkaline ph may be due to dissolved clays and carbonates associated with the metasedimentary rocks which serve as appropriate medium for adsorption and desorption of metals and toxic ions like fluoride in groundwater keshavarzi et al 2010 zango et al 2019 the temperature of the water varies from 24 2 to 31 3 c with a mean of 27 2 c the ec values range from 176 to 1352 μs cm with a mean value of 400 μs cm falling within the guideline value of 2500 μs cm who 2017 the tds concentrations 96 8 744 mg l mean of 221 mg l were also generally low and the groundwater can be described as fresh based of freeze and cherry 1979 classification the low tds values are also likely due to the short residence time of the groundwater limiting intense water rock interaction sunkari et al 2019 the well depths range from 17 0 to 70 0 m with a mean of 42 8 m and from the supplementary table 1 it is observed that the deeper the well the higher the major ion concentrations in terms of major cation concentrations na is the dominant cation with concentrations ranging from 10 9 to 211 mg l and a mean concentration of 38 6 mg l table 3 the who guideline value for na in drinking water is 200 mg l who 2017 implying that some of the samples exceeded the guideline value such a trend is probably from silicate weathering from the granitoids in the area ca2 is the second most abundant cation in the groundwater varying from 1 40 to 26 8 mg l with a mean value of 9 95 mg l falling within the who maximum permissible limit of 200 mg l table 3 the mg2 concentrations also vary from 1 02 to 28 5 mg l with a mean concentration of 7 14 mg l table 3 k is the least dominant cation in the groundwater with concentrations in the range of 0 49 5 20 mg l and a mean value of 1 97 mg l far below the standard guideline value of 200 mg l table 3 in all the major cation concentrations vary in the order of na ca2 mg2 k suggesting rapid release of na from albite via alteration and leaching processes fig 2 although k bearing microcline is dominant it is not contained in the high temperature minerals like ca bearing anorthite na bearing albite and mg bearing biotite hornblende hence it is relatively stable compared to these minerals and as such will be released last and possibly less into groundwater hco3 is the most abundant major anion in the groundwater with concentrations in the range of 30 0 260 mg l and a mean concentration of 80 0 mg l table 3 this might be due to limited dissolution of carbonate minerals in the aquifer system since the area contains no carbonate rocks fig 1 the cl concentrations range from 14 7 to 178 mg l with a mean concentration of 37 0 mg l falling within the who guideline value of 250 mg l table 3 similarly the so4 2 concentrations 1 01 62 9 mg l with a mean value of 9 29 mg l are also within the who maximum permissible limit of 200 mg l table 3 perhaps ion exchange reactions or limited dissolution of gypsum are the culprits for the so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater other anions of importance in groundwater studies are f and no3 since their concentrations can affect the health of consumers of the water therefore the f concentrations of groundwater in the vea catchment vary from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 66 mg l table 3 this suggests that the water is contaminated with f since the maximum permissible limit of f in drinking water is pegged at 1 5 mg l who 2017 worryingly the mean concentration 1 68 mg l exceeds the guideline value 1 5 mg l exposing the people to the threat of dental fluorosis the high fluoride samples are mostly within the area dominated by k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite and hornblende biotite granitoid fig 1 table 2 the no3 concentrations 3 29 54 7 mg l mean value of 16 3 mg l also exceed the acceptable limit of 50 mg l table 3 the relatively high no3 concentrations may be due to leaching from nitrate fertilizers sunkari et al 2020 applied on farms in the vea catchment altogether the major ion concentrations in groundwater of the vea catchment vary in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 3 3 geochemical evolution of groundwater ternary piper diagram piper 1953 has been widely used in groundwater studies to discriminate the various hydrochemical facies and geochemical evolution of groundwater in aquifer systems therefore this study also used piper diagram to show the type of water in the vea catchment from the piper diagram fig 3 the dominant hydrochemical facies is na ca hco3 85 followed by ca na mg hco3 10 and mg na hco3 5 the dominance of na ca hco3 water type might be due to silicate weathering and ion exchange reactions in the aquifer similar reason may be accounting for the other two types of water in the area koffi et al 2017 studied the hydrochemistry of some parts of the vea catchment and mentioned that the dominant hydrochemical facies in the vea catchment is ca mg hco3 water they also linked the dominance of the ca mg hco3 water type to cation exchange and silicate weathering which is consistent with the findings of this study 3 4 groundwater fluoride distribution a total of 43 samples out of the 70 samples under this study have groundwater f above 1 5 mg l this implies that about 61 of the people in the communities where the groundwater was sampled from the entire vea catchment is drinking water that is detrimental to their health the affected communities are mostly around the northeastern central and southwestern parts of the study area fig 4 the major communities in these areas include bongo vea nzangongo balungu kodorogo tarungo nyarega and sumbrungu fig 4 areas with groundwater f between 1 5 and 2 4 mg l include namoo amokobisi 1 namoo yakabisi sambolingu kansoe sambolingu amanga bungu balungu doni balungu langanabisi bongo nabisi zoko tarongo bogorodo namoo amokobisi 2 boko tendama 2 gowri vea akugrebisi vea gunga vea asornabisi bongo shs 2 nabiisi pri jhs sumbrugu pri jhs

dulungu naabis and sumbrungu amogribisi fig 4 all these communities are intruded by k feldspar rich granitoid bongo granite and hornblende biotite granitoid fig 1 indicating possible intense dissolution it is indeed worrying that boreholes in public schools and health care centers in the area are all extremely contaminated with f though this study did not conduct a medical assessment of the teeth of the people in the area it was observed that most of the children and even adults have mottled teeth which is likely evidence for dental fluorosis the vea catchment is not precluded from the menace of dental fluorosis as observed in most parts of the upper east region majority of the people have mottled teeth but are unaware of the cause of such ailment the rural people believe that it is a curse from their gods and ancestors and the elite in the society rather attribute it to poor dental care at homes however the severity of the issue suggests that none of the reasons given by the inhabitants may be accounting for the incidence of dental fluorosis 3 5 controlling factors of groundwater chemistry gibbs plots gibbs 1970 have been effectively used over the years to decipher the implication of weathering evaporation and dilution on groundwater chemistry on the gibbs plots fig 5 a and b the studied samples of the vea catchment largely support water rock interaction as the dominant process controlling the elevated f contents in the groundwater with one sample indicating evaporation dominance the effect of water rock interaction on f levels in groundwater has been extensively studied in the literature shah and danishwar 2003 sunkari et al 2018 sunkari and abu 2019 zango et al 2019 a plot of the f concentrations mg l against the well depths m reveals a linear relationship r 0 41 where an increase in the f concentrations 1 5 mg l is associated with increasing well depth although some shallow wells also have high f concentrations fig 5c this might be pointing to the longer groundwater residence times and thus intense water rock interaction and ion exchange reactions in the aquifer however the shallow wells with high f concentrations 1 5 mg l may be as a result of anthropogenic activities around the aquifer when equilibrium is reached between na and f the high na released into groundwater could produce soft water thereby facilitating higher f concentration levels naseem et al 2010 na na cl ratio is a suitable proxy in discriminating origins of groundwater hounslow 1995 the average na na cl ratio of the groundwater is 0 53 supporting the influence of albite on the groundwater chemistry f concentrations are found to be higher in granitic rocks than any other rock type with a range of 500 and 1400 mg kg koritnig 1978 krauskopf and bird 1995 high levels of f in aquifers have been attributed to biotite dissolution and fluoride replacement of oh sites due largely to their similar ionic radii f 1 23 1 36 å and oh 1 37 1 40 å li et al 2003 naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 this fluoride enrichment process is time dependent as prolonged residence time of biotite bearing rocks is reported to have resulted in elevated f levels raju et al 2009 rao et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 following the chemical reaction below 3 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg al2si3o10 oh 3 2f about 61 of borehole samples have elevated levels of f above the acceptable levels of 1 5 mg l table 3 and this is due to biotite dissolution and evaporation from the aquifers young et al 2011 this is consistent with the dominance of hornblende biotite granitoid in the area fig 1 and the high amount of fluoride up to 3 78 mg l released from these rocks into groundwater table 2 the presence and contribution of mafic and ultramafic minerals to the f levels in the area is shown by the low mg ca mg ratio of 0 37 suggesting trace content of biotite and hornblende minerals in the area fig 2 alteration of microcline albite and muscovite into clay minerals such as smectite and kaolinite particularly kaolinite can release f bearing minerals from granitic rocks via the process of kaolinization and concentrate it in groundwater the area has huge deposits of kaolinite in the balungu and vea dam flood plain with a river serving as a source of water to the vea dam the elevated levels of f within the catchment could be attributed partly to the process of kaolinization the effect of silicate weathering on groundwater f concentration has been constrained using na cl ratio when the ratio na cl values 1 this is indicative of silicate weathering and halite dissolution naseem et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 almost all the studied samples have na cl values 1 fig 6 a this is due to the weathering of the felsic gneisses in the area which subsequently leached the excess na into the groundwater the high na cl molar ratio also indicates that apart from silicate weathering halite dissolution was also responsible for the elevated na and cl concentrations in the groundwater the dominance of silicate weathering in the area as revealed in this study is consistent with the findings of koffi et al 2017 additionally all the samples plot above the 1 1 line except two samples on the na mg l and cl mg l bivariate plot fig 6a implying the dominance of ion exchange reactions enriching these ions the two samples that plot below the 1 1 line are due to reverse ion exchange reactions that provided the excess na and cl the plotting of some of the samples in close proximity to the 1 1 line further highlights the effect of halite dissolution on the groundwater chemistry the molar ratios of na ca2 are also greater than 1 for all the samples indicating low calcium activity fig 6b the high na ca2 molar ratios also point out the prevalence of ion exchange reactions in the aquifer considering the plotting of majority of the samples above the 1 1 line on the na mg l and ca2 mg l bivariate plot fig 6b however just as observed in the na mg l and cl mg l bivariate plot the three samples that plot below the 1 1 line on the na mg l and ca2 mg l bivariate plot reveal that reverse ion exchange is responsible for the na and ca2 concentrations of those samples a plot of na mg l versus hco3 mg l fig 6c indicates that the excess hco3 resulted from calcite precipitation which eventually reduced the ca2 concentration relative to the na concentration younas et al 2019 this is a clear evidence for the reverse ion exchange process observed in the na mg l versus hco3 mg l bivariate plot fig 6c the dominant role of silicate weathering especially weathering of the granite gneisses on the groundwater chemistry is further constrained on the bivariate plot of the molar ratios of mg2 na and ca2 na fig 6d on this diagram carbonate dissolution appears to influence the chemistry of only two samples moreover bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 hco3 gives a hint that the samples with f concentrations above 1 fall below the 1 1 equiline fig 6e this confirms the silicate weathering and base ion exchange reactions dominant in the aquifer that progressively elevated the hco3 and f concentrations in groundwater the effect of dolomitization on the groundwater chemistry cannot be precluded in the vea catchment since majority of the samples plot along the 1 1 line fig 6e however de dolomitization facilitated the removal of excess ca2 and mg2 in the water and enhanced the addition of na via ion exchange in the recharging freshwater zango et al 2019 the ca2 and so4 2 concentrations may also be as a result of dissolution of gypsum since majority of the samples plot close to and along the 1 1 line on the ca2 and so4 2 cross plot fig 6f nevertheless it is worthy to mention that reverse ion exchange and perhaps anthropogenic input from decomposed sulfates in fertilizers may also account for the groundwater so4 2 enrichment laxmankumar et al 2019 3 6 sources of groundwater fluoride about 61 of the boreholes in the vea catchment that intersect biotite rich granitoids contain f levels above the maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l this jeopardizes the health and livelihood of the rural folks that dwell on the water for domestic purposes the high groundwater f occurred under alkaline conditions ph 7 03 7 74 it is widely reported that alkaline conditions increase in ph favor groundwater f mobilization keshavarzi et al 2010 kumar et al 2018 zango et al 2019 as stated earlier the vea catchment contains high amounts of clay minerals and thus the alkaline ph alongside the presence of the clays may be a control mechanism for the f mobilization in the groundwater keshavarzi et al 2010 stated that f has the proclivity of getting adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces in alkaline water this implies that the high f concentrations in the studied groundwater might be as a result of f adsorption on the surfaces of clay minerals under the dominant alkaline conditions in the area this is supported by the positive correlation r 0 19 between ph and f table 4 also the increase in ph na and hco3 eventually increases groundwater f concentrations via the aforementioned mechanisms in the previous section from the gibbs plots it is observed that water rock interaction is the dominant geochemical process residing in the hydrogeological system of the vea catchment such process is common in semi arid environments where ion exchange reactions involving ca2 and na result in the reduction of ca2 and the enrichment of na and f karro and uppin 2013 the possible cation exchange reaction that took place between ca2 and na is supported by the dominance of na bearing plagioclase fig 2 and the high content of na with a mean of 40 3 mg l relative to the mean ca2 concentration of 24 5 mg l table 3 additionally the f concentrations show positive correlations with most of the hydrochemical parameters including ec tds na mg2 hco3 and so4 2 table 4 indicating that f enrichment is related with the mechanisms enriching these parameters in the water as explained above most of these hydrochemical parameters are enriched in the water via ion exchange reactions and similar explanation can be given to the groundwater f enrichment nevertheless negative correlation of f with k and ca2 table 4 implies reverse ion exchange reactions in the aquifer system geochemical modeling is widely used in groundwater studies to calculate the saturation indices si of mineral phases residing in water and contributing to groundwater f enrichment younas et al 2019 zango et al 2019 the mineral phases identified in the water include albite si 0 32 to 5 59 mean 1 38 calcite si 2 72 to 0 06 mean 1 20 dolomite si 3 97 to 0 13 mean 2 38 fluorite si 2 26 to 0 19 mean 1 33 gypsum si 6 24 to 1 67 mean 3 40 and halite si 9 08 to 5 43 mean 7 65 table 3 suggesting that all the samples are undersaturated with respect to these minerals except albite and calcite on a bivariate plot of the si calcite versus f mg l all the samples plot in the calcite undersaturation zone except one sample that plots in the calcite saturation zone fig 7 a similarly all the samples appear to fall within the fluorite undersaturation zone in the si fluorite versus f mg l plot fig 7b the results clearly elucidate that groundwater in the vea catchment evolved under alkaline conditions where most of the samples are undersaturated with respect to calcite which enhanced progressive removal of ca2 and preferential release of f in solution in such a scenario the groundwater retains higher f concentrations prior to saturation with fluorite it is suggested that fluorite dissolution in the vea catchment is facilitated by the progressive precipitation of calcite notwithstanding the undersaturation of majority of the samples with respect to fluorite and calcite the strong positive correlation r 0 45 between si fluorite and si calcite further highlights the role calcite plays in the f concentrations in the groundwater fig 7c therefore f and ca2 have a direct relationship the groundwater is also undersaturated with respect to dolomite as observed in the cross plot of the si dolomite versus f concentrations fig 7d suggesting the prevalence of ambient conditions necessary for calcite dissolution lermi and ertan 2019 almost 91 of the samples are saturated with respect to albite reflecting the dominance of silicate weathering in the aquifer fig 7e it also highlights the role granitoids in the area fig 1 play in the chemistry of the groundwater f enrichment in the groundwater seems to be related to albite dissolution in view of the positive correlation r 0 095 between si albite and f concentrations and also confirms the dominance of ion exchange reactions in the hydrogeological system of the vea catchment undersaturation of groundwater with respect to halite fig 7f may be due to higher halite solubility which enhanced halite dissolution to release na and cl in the groundwater 3 7 multivariate statistical analysis factor analysis with principal component analysis as the extraction method was applied to the hydrochemical parameters to show their relationships and determine the factors responsible for each association using the kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 three principal components with eigenvalues 1 0 but less than 2 0 and total variance of 74 9 were extracted supplementary table 2 the first principal component accounts for about 13 2 of the total variance and correlates positively with all the hydrochemical parameters with very strong positive loadings on ec tds na k ca2 hco3 and no3 supplementary table 2 fig 8 it is well established that such association of hydrochemical parameters is as a result of weathering ion exchange reactions and intense water rock interaction yidana et al 2010 however the association of no3 with other hydrochemical parameters in the first principal component may be pointing to input from domestic sewage and nitrate fertilizers applied on farms in the vea catchment zango et al 2019 the second principal component accounts for 12 7 of the total variance and positively correlates with tds na mg2 and f with very strong positive loadings on cl and so4 2 supplementary table 2 fig 8 this kind of association also suggests the dominance of ion exchange reactions silicate weathering and dissolution of fluoride rich minerals such as fluorite and biotite laxmankumar et al 2019 in the area but the strong positive correlation of so4 2 with other hydrochemical parameters in the second principal component might also be giving a hint to anthropogenic contribution to the groundwater chemistry through the application of sulphate fertilizers on farmlands since the people are mainly farmers the third principal component which accounts for 8 39 of the total variance loads positively on ec tds so4 2 hco3 and strongly correlates with ph temperature mg2 and f supplementary table 2 fig 8 this suggests that reverse ion exchange reactions are prevalent in the area however the association of so4 2 in this group further highlights anthropogenic contribution from agricultural activities to the groundwater chemistry 3 8 verification from isotopic compositions the summary of δ18o and δ2h compositions of the groundwater is presented in table 2 the δ18o and δ2h values with respect to v smow vary between 4 15 and 2 75 and 22 5 and 13 7 respectively suggesting considerable isotopic variation of the groundwater most of the samples plot along or near the gmwl and lmwl and mostly in between the two meteoric water lines fig 9 a indicating their meteoric water origin qian et al 2014 salifu et al 2017 this implies that groundwater in the vea catchment is likely recharged from fresh local precipitation rainfall however some of the samples shifted from the gmwl and plotted in the lower slope area along the evaporation line suggesting that after precipitation the water goes through secondary evaporation younas et al 2019 therefore f in the groundwater may be released from the aquifer materials via local meteoric recharge and to some extent evaporation furthermore a plot of δ18o and f concentrations indicates that higher groundwater f concentrations are fairly homogenized relative to the δ18o and thus low δ18o values fig 9b the enriched isotopic composition is observed with the low fluoride concentrations whilst the depleted isotopic composition is with higher concentrations of fluoride table 2 accordingly mixing of groundwater with fast vertically recharged water and surface water along the groundwater flow conduits may be accounting for this trend xie et al 2013 such observation has already been reported by clark and fritz 2013 and goller et al 2005 4 conclusion and recommendations this study was conducted to understand the source of high fluoride in groundwater within the vea catchment of northeastern ghana this involved petrographic analysis of rock samples hydrochemical analysis multivariate statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis the area is mainly composed of biotite rich granitoids of the paleoproterozoic birimian supergroup the petrographic studies show in decreasing compositional order quartz microcline k rich plagioclase na rich biotite mg rich muscovite ca mg rich hornblende mg rich and other accessory minerals the major cations vary in the order of na ca2 mg2 k whereas the major anions vary in the order cl so4 2 hco3 na ca hco3 water is dominant in the area the fluoride concentrations vary from 0 35 to 3 95 mg l with a mean concentration of 1 68 mg l in excess of the maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l the fluoride contamination affected a total of 43 boreholes in the study area representing about 61 of all boreholes where the samples were collected the affected communities are located in the northeastern central and southwestern parts of the vea catchment the hydrochemical and isotopic data reveal that the groundwater evolved under high impact of water rock interaction ion exchange reactions kaolinization and silicate weathering moreover evaporation after precipitation is another major process causing the enrichment of the ions in the water all these geogenic processes resulted in the mobilization of fluoride in the groundwater in elevated levels saturation indices of the mineral phases in the water indicated that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to albite due to silicate weathering and undersaturated with respect fluorite and calcite this enhanced ion exchange and fluoride enrichment from progressive calcite precipitation the high groundwater fluoride in the vea catchment exposes the people to dental fluorosis which jeopardizes the health and livelihood of the people therefore the stakeholders and decision makers in the area must come to the aid of the people by devising technologically cost effective methods of minimizing the groundwater fluoride such as rainwater harvesting facilities supply of drinking water from low fluoride surface water sources and use of solar energy powered electrolytic de fluoridation technology in the high fluoride

important economic activities of residents and therefore pollutants from such activities are a serious concern in the management of groundwater resources malki et al 2017 to protect and better management of valuable water resources in arid and semi arid regions it is essential to know the hydrochemical status and the process controlling their quality changes alaya et al 2013 xing et al 2013 sohrabi et al 2013 karunanidhi et al 2020 by analyzing the effects of geochemical processes on groundwater chemistry and the health risks associated with fluoride intake in a semi arid region of south india indicated that the in addition to geogenic factors agricultural runoff water and industrial effiuents can be considered as the controlling factors of water chemistry gutiérrez et al 2018 assessed the nitrate sources and operating processes in arid and semiarid aquifer systems the results indicated that synthetic and organic fertilizers are often a major source of n in aquifers karroum et al 2017 studied the geochemical processes controlling groundwater quality under a semiarid environment in central morocco their study presented new insights into the anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality on the other hand due to the lack of water and the reduction of agricultural land efficiency optimizing the area under cultivation and the amount of water consumed with appropriate quality is a necessity similarly if low quality water is used in the agricultural lands the rules for water resources management must be changed accordingly the growth process of plants and trees can be disrupted by chemical compounds in the irrigation water through toxicity or change in nutrients supply amiri et al 2020 ali et al 2018 ayers and westcot 1985 therefore to better understand the change in the quality of irrigation water and its subsequent adverse effects on soil quality as well as agricultural products ramos et al 2011 sandhi et al 2012 a study with a focus on this concern should be conducted sefiani et al 2019 adimalla et al 2020 2018 studied the irrigational suitability of groundwater in two areas using major ions and showed that the majority of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation uses iqbal et al 2020 tried to determine the hydrochemical processes governing the groundwater chemistry evaluation of groundwater quality and suitability for

and scaling in water supply facilities of various industries and drinking water distribution network can be associated with secondary consequences on the health of residents yan et al 2020 one of the problems of water transfer and distribution systems is the deposition of carbonate coatings or their dissolution from the inner wall of the pipes and as a result the entry of heavy metal impurities from the metal pipes into the water palazzo et al 2015 olivia et al 2013 corrosion reactions directly affect the consumption of water disinfectants and increase the biological activity of microorganisms vasconcelos et al 2015 on the other hand sedimentation and corrosion processes can reduce the nominal life and power of the water transmission network and reduce the network pressure as well as increase the energy required for pumping sunardi et al 2020 besides the thermal conductivity of thermal installations can be reduced due to sedimentation thereby increasing energy consumption dianati tilaki and mahmoudi 2018 the water quality assessment for industrial purposes can be assessed using some indices including langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi larson skold index l si puckorious scaling index psi and total hardness th in recent years the importance of water sedimentation or corrosion has been studied by several researchers e g taghavi et al 2019 amouei et al 2017 mirzabeygi et al 2016 masters et al 2015 deshommes et al 2010 in terms of water resources iran is one of the poorest countries and has an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm per year which is less than one third of the average rainfall in the world esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 in arid and semi arid areas which generally include the eastern southern and central parts of iran groundwater is the most important source of domestic industrial and agricultural sectors pazand and fereidoni sarvestani 2013 today in iran water scarcity has become one of the most important challenges facing governments the overexploitation of groundwater and severe droughts in recent years have reduced the quantity and quality of groundwater resources this study has tried to evaluate the controlling mechanisms of groundwater chemistry and to determine the quality of groundwater in 109 wells in yazd province iran for use in agricultural and industrial sectors using all the introduced indices in the literature despite many studies that only examine the suitability of water quality for various uses in this study the hydrochemical status and processes controlling the chemical composition of groundwater resources have also been investigated providing spatial distribution maps of these water samples will help local decision makers have new insights into the overall quality of groundwater it is expected that the results of this study can lead to better management of groundwater resources in this arid domain 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yazd province with an area of about 74 645 km2 is located on the central plateau of iran the average annual rainfall in this province is about 98 mm which is equivalent to 39 of iran s average rainfall 250 mm and about 10 of the global average rainfall 990 mm also the average annual evaporation of this province is about 3193 mm and the average temperature is 17 c in terms of ecosystem yazd province has a cold hot and dry semi arid ecosystem with little vegetation azizi jalilian et al 2020 the geographical and climatic conditions of yazd province have made it highly dependent on groundwater resources to meet its needs in the drinking agricultural and industrial sectors high temperatures low rainfall rates and high evaporation have caused almost no permanent river in the province the overexploitation of groundwater has played a key role in reducing aquifers storage and groundwater levels today the annual rate of decline in groundwater level in the yazd ardakan aquifer as the most important source of water supply for the majority of the population of this province is between 1 and 1 7 m year these conditions have caused 15 of the 19 aquifers in yazd province to be classified as prohibited in terms of groundwater pumping apart from the limited resources of karst water most of the aquifers in the province are formed in alluvial sedimentary basins according to the latest available information there are 6838 water sources including wells springs and qanats in yazd province from which a total of about 1 08 billion cubic meters of water is discharged annually amiri et al 2020 about 88 3 of groundwater is used in agriculture 7 in drinking water and 4 7 in industry 2 2 chemical sampling and analysis in this study groundwater resources were sampled in 109 wells the location of these samples was determined using the global positioning system gps and used to examine the spatial changes of the selected parameters and indicators these samples were prepared and stored under standard conditions iso 1993 and then transferred to the laboratory for analyzing apha 1985 fig 1 shows the distribution of sampling points based on the type of consumption drinking agricultural and industrial in the study area the parameters measured in this study include ph ec tds ca na k hco3 so4 and cl sulfate concentrations were measured using spectrophotometry hco3 mg cl ca parameters by titration na and k concentrations by photoelectric flame photometer ec and ph by electrochemical method and tds by gravimetric method 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry the chemical composition of groundwater during water rock sediment interaction is controlled by geochemical processes appleo and postma 1996 the results of water quality analysis include all major k ca mg na hco3 so4 cl ec tds and ph the statistical summary of the physicochemical parameters is presented in table 1 accordingly ec and ph values vary between 454 and 29 600 μs cm and 6 44 and 9 68 respectively therefore these water sources appear to be excellent to very poor quality and the acidity of the samples indicates poor acid to alkaline conditions of course in this case attention should be paid to the distribution of concentrations in different percentiles table 1 which is described below the minimum and maximum concentrations of sulfate and chloride are 35 5 9230 and 9 6 1485 6 mg l respectively which like other components have a wide range of concentrations considering the most important source of these variables the dissolution of evaporites seems to play a decisive role in controlling the concentration of the mentioned parameters similarly the concentration of sodium with the range of between 5 75 and 4800 1 mg l can be considered a function of the mechanism governing the two parameters so4 and cl on the other hand the dissolution of carbonate formations can play a significant role in controlling the concentration of calcium 16 1000 mg l and bicarbonate 91 5 1677 5 mg l besides due to the geological conditions of this area some calcium rich minerals such as feldspars pyroxenes and amphiboles can also play a role in the enrichment of ca in groundwater the results show that among cations na and ca and among anions so4 and hco3 have higher concentrations than other chemical ions on the other hand the order of average concentrations of cations and anions is so4 na hco3 cl ca mg k the distribution percentiles 25 50 and 75 of concentration for each parameter are also presented in table 1 accordingly despite the very high maximum for most physicochemical parameters the distribution percentiles indicate that 75 of measured values for each parameter are much smaller than the maximum values in other words less than 25 of them show high values this difference in maximum values and 75 distribution of the measured values in some parameters such as ec cl ca na and ph is very significant to determine the data distribution pattern and the methods to be used the normality test of the data sets for each variable was performed based on two tests kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk kitsos et al 2013 table 1 presents the normality tests for physicochemical variables results show that the p value significance level is zero which means rejecting the normality hypothesis for all variables in the shapiro wilk test and most parameters except ph in the kolmogorov smirnov test since the shapiro wilk method is generally used in the data category smaller than 2000 components amiri et al 2017 in the present study the accuracy of this method is higher than another test therefore as shown in table 1 none of the variables has a normal distribution and thus non parametric analyzes should be used for them determining the correlation coefficient between variables can provide valuable information about the possible source of the changes in this study due to the non normal distribution of variables spearman s correlation as a nonparametric analysis was used table 2 it should be noted that all statistical evaluations were performed using spss 21 ibm chicago ii usa and microsoft office 2016 as shown in table 2 ec as a representative of all chemical compounds in water has a strong positive correlation with various parameters such as k 0 96 mg 0 81 ca 0 77 so4 0 98 cl 0 84 and tds 0 99 however there is a positive moderate relationship between this parameter and k 0 50 these strong positive relationships can point to the role of water reaction with geological formations located along the flow path and changing the chemical composition of water as the most important factor in this case it should be noted that the highest ec correlation coefficient is seen with sodium sulfate and chloride which can indicate the significant role of dissolution of sediments and evaporites in controlling the hydrochemical status of these samples 3 2 hydrochemical facies to investigate the chemical status of groundwater resources in yazd province the chemical facies of each sample were determined based on the results of the chemical analysis table 3 presents the main hydrochemical facies of samples in this table three general types of carbonate sulfate and chloride are considered as references and then the chemical facies of each sample is determined based on the predominant cation and anion as shown most cation and anion in each facies are highlighted results show that the most common water type followed by chemical facies in this study area is chloride type with 50 46 and na cl facies 47 71 respectively on the other hand after the chloride water type the bicarbonate type with 44 04 is the most common chemical type based on the results ca hco3 and na hco3 have a relatively equal share in this type this table also shows the samples in each type and chemical fission a noteworthy point is that most samples with industrial table 3 bold red numbers and agricultural table 3 bold red underlined numbers uses show the chlorine type and na cl facies therefore it seems that over time the intelligent separation of water resources in terms of the type of consumption has been done by consumers so that poor quality waters are mainly used for agricultural and industrial purposes in contrast the main samples with drinking use table 3 black numbers are located in the bicarbonate type and this indicates the relative suitability of their quality compared to other samples it should be noted that the placement of some samples with drinking use in chlorine and sulfate types indicates their poor chemical quality based solely on the precedence and latency of ions in the water and not their maximum concentration also the placement of some industrial and agricultural samples in the bicarbonate type indicates their relatively good quality based only on the chemical type and not on the ion concentration 3 3 controlling mechanisms of water chemistry the concentration of ions in groundwater is mainly controlled by lithology i e chemical composition geochemical reactions and solubility of geological formations the sources of these soluble ions can be studied in different ways one of the most efficient methods is to display the values of na na ca and cl cl hco3 in each sample relative to its tds gibbs 1970 fig 2 shows the location of groundwater samples on the gibbs diagrams the concentration of the samples between the two end members including the interaction with the rocks as well as the evaporation and precipitation of high solubility formations shows that these two factors play the most important role in controlling the chemical composition of groundwater in this regard marandi and shand 2018 with a more accurate interpretation of the mechanisms affecting the end members of the gibbs diagram only by examining na na ca versus tds provided a better analysis of the hydrogeochemical status of groundwater resources accordingly in the rock dominance end member of the gibbs diagram the geochemical evolution resulting from the dissolution of some carbonate formations can be seen due to the reduction of the na na ca ratio on the other hand the influence of geochemical processes and weathering of silicate formations and consequently increase in na na ca ratio can be observed between the two end members of rock dominance and evaporation precipitation dominance given the current situation moving the chemical composition of some samples towards evaporation precipitation dominance can be justified by dissolving highly soluble formations or infiltrating and mixing with salt water as well as high residence time waters in addition to using the concept of gibbs the position of water samples in van wirdum s diagram was also assessed fig 3 this diagram uses the ca ca cl ionic ratio to ec accordingly the chemical composition of groundwater can be considered between atmocline meteoric water lithocline fresh calcium rich water and thalassocline seawater tanaskovic et al 2012 the results show that the studied samples are located between the two end members including li and th and this indicates an analysis similar to what was said about gibbs diagrams besides given the distribution of samples in this diagram it should be expected that the ionic ratios of samples change under the influence of some factors such as ion exchange in other words the diversity of chemical facies in these water samples is quite expected see table 3 as mentioned sometimes the chemical composition of groundwater can undergo significant changes in the flow path due to the physicochemical conditions prevailing in the aquifer one of the factors that change the concentration of water ions is ion exchange ion exchange is the replacement of ions absorbed on the surface of solid particles by ions in groundwater the na cl versus ca mg so4 hco3 ratio has been used to determine the role of ion exchange processes in groundwater chemistry control amiri et al 2015 assuming that all of the cl in groundwater originates from the dissolution of halite the positive value of na cl indicates the excess na in the water which in turn could come from a source other than the dissolution of halite the final amount of ca mg so4 hco3 also refers to a source other than the dissolution of gypsum and carbonates as a source of calcium or magnesium in the absence of these reactions all groundwater samples should be close to the center of the diagram fig 4 top left mclean et al 2000 in contrast if the role of these reactions dissolution of halite and carbonates is significant groundwater samples will be placed along a line with a negative slope as shown the samples are scattered along a negatively sloping line indicating the role of the dissolution of salt and carbonate in this region distribution of samples based on na cl vs ec fig 4 top right shows that samples with high ec have a lower na cl ratio indicating the role of direct ion exchange in changing the composition of most groundwater samples another ionic ratio that can be a reliable tool in determining the role of ion exchange in the control of the chemical composition of groundwater is the study of ca mg concentration against so4 hco3 accordingly if the role of reverse ion exchange is more significant than direct ion exchange the samples will be on the right side of the graph due to the increase in the concentration of so4 hco3 in contrast if the direct ion exchange has a more prominent role the points will be concentrated on the left side of the graph because of the increase in ca mg value excess sodium and magnesium in groundwater can be due to their exchange with sodium in the solid particles given the concentration of ca mg versus so4 hco3 fig 4 down the distribution of points indicates that calcium and magnesium may have other sources and this highlights the significant role of direct ion exchange in increasing the concentration of these cations in the water composition 3 4 multivariate analysis many studies have used multivariate methods to simplify and organize large data sets to better understand the relationship between them matiatos et al 2014 multivariate statistical methods have a wide range of formulas and their applications two of the key methods of which include the principal component analysis pca and the hierarchical cluster analysis hca a complete description of these multivariate statistical tools is provided by swan and sandilands 1995 and davis 2002 in the following the ability of these tools to better understand the geochemical mechanisms controlling the chemical composition of groundwater in yazd province has been used 3 5 principal component analysis pca in this part the measured value of 10 physicochemical variables in 109 sampling locations has been used the number of principal components is determined by the kaiser criteria accordingly only components that have eigenvalues greater than 1 are selected besides the normalized varimax rotation has been used to maximize the variance of the principal components and to better separate them from each other table 4 presents the statistical results of the pca also eigenvalues changes are displayed as presented the two first principal components have eigenvalues greater than 1 equal to 6 3 and 1 34 respectively which after the rotation sums of squared loadings are equal to 6 25 and 1 39 respectively and therefore are considered as two final components for the next analysis the results of the pca show that nearly 76 32 of the changes in the chemical composition of water can be assessed using the first and second principal components tables 4 and 5 in other words the variables in the first component with control of about 62 45 of the total variance play the most important role in changing groundwater chemistry in the studied samples on the other hand the second component accounts for about 13 87 of the chemical changes in groundwater resources in the first component some of the main ions in water such as sodium magnesium calcium sulfate and chloride have a strong positive correlation with tds and ec as a representative of the overall water composition these parameters indicate the role of water interaction with geological formations and their release into groundwater composition on the other hand two variables of bicarbonate with a load of 0 8 and a ph with a load of 0 7 have been identified as a separate component that controls about 14 of the composition of groundwater given the role that bicarbonate has along with other factors such as calcium and calcium sodium potassium and magnesium carbohydrates and hydroxides as well as exchange reactions and biological activities in water alkalinity as a criterion for determining water capacity in acid neutralization it seems that the negative correlation between ph and bicarbonate and certainly alkalinity is logical 3 6 hierarchical cluster analysis hca in this study hca was used to investigate the relationship between variables r mode and groundwater samples q mode cluster analysis helps to group physicochemical variables or water samples based on the level of similarity within the classes and the dissimilarity between the different groups these analyzes were performed using normalized data in the ward method in this method euclidean distances are used as a measure of similarity the result of r mode hca and q mode hca are presented in fig 5 and table 6 respectively the dendrogram prepared using cluster analysis fig 5 shows that in general physicochemical variables can be divided into two groups the first group cluster 1 includes ec tds so4 na ca mg and cl this cluster similar to that described for the first component of pca could indicate the significant role of water rock interaction in controlling groundwater chemistry the second group cluster 2 includes k hco3 and ph the parameters of this cluster are similar to the parameters of the second component of pca in q mode hca the similarity of the composition of groundwater samples in one group and also the difference between the chemical composition of each group with other groups has been used as a tool to divide the samples into different clusters as shown in table 6 the classification of 109 groundwater samples is evaluated in three modes 2 3 and 4 clusters in table 6 the red bold samples have industrial use the red bold underlined samples have agricultural use and the other samples have drinking use in the 2 cluster mode most of the drinking water samples are in cluster 1 and most of the agricultural and industrial water samples are in cluster 2 in 3 cluster mode all samples in cluster 1 in 2 cluster mode are still in cluster 1 without further separation on the other hand the agricultural and industrial water samples are more accurately separated in clusters 2 and 3 in this case most of the samples used in industrial and agricultural sectors are located in cluster 3 finally the most separation in groundwater samples is seen in 4 cluster mode accordingly the worst quality samples are in cluster 4 and the other clusters have fewer poor quality samples as shown in table 2 agricultural and industrial water samples have mainly na cl chemical facies and here these samples are in a common cluster note that the presence of some agricultural and industrial water samples among the drinking water samples indicates their appropriate quality and vice versa the presence of some drinking water samples among the industrial and agricultural water samples indicates their inappropriate quality 3 7 water quality for irrigation in this study groundwater quality for consumption in the agricultural sector has been evaluated using some known indicators here are some of the most important features of water consumption in agriculture 3 8 electrical conductivity ec based on the ec value groundwater samples are divided into different classes handa 1969 the results show that about 56 of the samples have good and permissible quality and about 44 of the samples do not have the appropriate quality for consumption in the agricultural sector table 7 3 9 sodium absorption ratio sar another parameter affecting water quality for consumption in agriculture is the na concentration gupta et al 2009 the high concentration of sodium in the water causes it to accumulate on the surface of solid soil particles and due to the increase in cation exchange capability and reduce the permeability of the land the drainage rate and the air circulation in the soil environment besides the sar is known as a good index for determining the relative concentration of sodium in the aquifer and is calculated as follows where the ion concentration is in milliequivalent per liter meq l the classification of groundwater samples based on sar values shows that nearly 98 of the samples have excellent quality todd 1995 or in other words classes s1 and s2 richards 1954 table 7 3 10 sodium percentage na the amount of sodium in the environment is also expressed as the percentage of sodium na this indicator can be determined using the following equation where the ion concentration is meq l the quality assessment of groundwater based on na wilcox 1995 shows that about 86 of samples have high quality to permissible and only about 14 of them have doubtful class table 7 3 11 residual sodium carbonate rsc in groundwater samples high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate relative to magnesium and calcium can affect soil permeability esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 this behavior can be demonstrated using rsc where the ion concentration is in meq l high levels of rsc more than 2 5 meq l make it unsuitable for irrigation usda 1954 the results show that the rsc value in all samples is less than 2 5 meq l and this indicates that their quality is suitable for irrigation table 7 3 12 magnesium absorption ratio mar another indicator used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water is the magnesium adsorption ratio mar raghunath 1987 where the ion concentration is in meq l based on the mar values in the samples are divided into two groups inappropriate mar 50 and appropriate or permissible mar 50 the results show that 94 5 of the studied samples have good quality and 5 5 have poor quality table 7 3 13 permeability index pi long term use of water of different qualities can affect the permeability of the soil doneen 1964 the pi is also a useful tool for assessing the potential for soil permeability change due to the use of water of different qualities in the agricultural sector this index is determined by the following relation where the ion concentration is in meq l if the pi is more than 75 it indicates excellent water quality for agricultural use also pi values between 25 and 75 and less than 25 indicate good and poor water quality respectively saleh al amry 2008 the results show that about 93 6 of the samples are in excellent and good quality table 7 3 14 kelly s ratio kr the kr is another ionic ratio that is used to determine the quality of irrigation water and is calculated as follows kelley 1963 where the ion concentration is in meq l if the kr is 1 and 1 it indicates the suitable and unsuitable quality of water for irrigation respectively due to the increase in the amount of sodium and the effect on soil permeability naseem et al 2010 the results show that 26 61 of the samples have unsuitable quality kr 1 and 73 93 of the samples have suitable quality kr 1 respectively table 7 3 15 wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 has introduced the simultaneous use of na and ec of groundwater as a powerful tool for determining the water quality for irrigation in this diagram the samples fall into one of five designated groups the results show that 39 samples 35 78 have ec values greater than 3000 μs cm as an unsuitable group boundary therefore about 64 of the samples are of excellent to doubtful quality fig 6 it seems that considering one or more components of water quality in diagrams such as the wilcox diagram it can be more accurate than any of the above indices 3 16 water quality assessment for industrial use in this part of the study various indicators including langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi larson skold index l si and puckorius scaling index psi were used to determine water quality in the industrial sector 3 17 langelier saturation index lsi this index is used as a tool to estimate the ability of calcium carbonate to precipitate in industrial equipment eg water distribution network or their corrosion potential by groundwater langelier 1936 according to this index the corrosive ability of groundwater is mainly due to the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and its reaction with carbonates especially ca and mg decreasing the ph of water can increase the corrosion ability of water therefore waters with low alkalinity and co2 saturation can increase its corrosion rate the lsi changes between 3 and 3 positive lsi values indicate the high potential for precipitation of caco3 due to the supersaturation of the water respect with this compound in this case the rate of precipitation on the equipment is much higher than the rate of corrosion by this water on the other hand negative lsi values indicate a low caco3 precipitation rate compared to the dissolution rate in other words under such conditions low alkalinity and high co2 concentration cause the corrosive ability of these waters to be much higher than the rate of scaling on the pipelines and equipment ravikumar and somashekar 2012 esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 the lsi value is calculated as follows where lsi is a function of the measured ph value and ph s the ph s indicates the acidity of water saturated respect with caco3 kumar et al 2009 the ph s value can be obtained using the following equation where the values of a b c and d are calculated as follows where the concentration of tds ca and alkalinity is in mg l the results show that 57 8 of the samples had the lsi value of less than 0 which indicates that the water is saturated respect with caco3 and tends to remove caco3 from the inner surface of industrial equipment such as pipes on the other hand 42 2 of the studied samples have the lsi value greater than 0 and therefore show that the water is supersaturated respect with caco3 and has the potential for precipitation in the equipment table 8 fig 7 shows the lsi values for groundwater samples 3 18 ryznar stability index rsi this empirical index is also used in combination with other indicators such as lsi to determine the tendency of water to precipitate and dissolve caco3 in pipelines ryznar 1944 the index can be calculated as follows the rsi changes in groundwater samples indicate that there is an equilibrium between precipitation and dissolution in only about 12 of the samples near 4 5 of the samples have the ability to precipitation high and mild and about 83 5 of the samples have the ability to corrosion mild and very high table 8 as shown in fig 8 the highest number of samples 81 samples is in the third class rsi between 6 8 and 8 5 3 19 larson skold index l si this indicator like the two indicators lsi and rsi is used to determine the potential for scaling or corrosion in industrial equipment according to larson and skold 1958 water alkalinity can reduce water corrosion on the other hand cl and so4 can increase corrosion potential the l si value is calculated as follows ravikumar and somashekar 2012 where the concentrations are in meq l as shown in table 8 84 4 of the samples have a high corrosion ability and their use in industry can lead to damage to equipment such as water distribution lines fig 9 also shows the change in l si values 3 20 puckorious scaling index psi this index indicates the buffering capacity of the water and the highest level of scaling until it reaches equilibrium davil et al 2009 like the rsi this index uses the equilibrium acidity relative and measured value to determine the buffering capacity the interpretation of this index is similar to the interpretations used for rsi sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 the psi is calculated as follows where the results show that the psi value in 88 samples 80 73 is more than 8 5 which indicates the very high corrosion potential of steel equipment also 7 34 of the samples have mild corrosion ability on the other hand about 10 of the samples have scaling potential table 8 fig 10 shows the changes in psi values in addition to the lsi rsi l si and psi indices some studies have noted the role of total hardness th in determining water quality in domestic and industrial sectors hard water can increase the consumption of household and industrial cleaners schroeder 1960 the classification of groundwater samples based on th sawyer and mccarthy 1967 shows that all samples are in the hard class 150 300 mg l and very hard more than 300 mg l 4 conclusion the most common water type followed by chemical facies in this study area is cl type and na cl facies respectively the position of samples on the gibbs and van wirdum diagrams indicate that the water rock interaction and dissolution of evaporites are the main controlling process of water chemistry distribution of samples based on na cl vs ec ca mg vs so4 hco3 and na cl vs ca mg so4 hco3 highlight the significant role of direct ion exchange in water chemistry change the results of pca showed that nearly 76 32 of the changes in the chemical composition of water can be assessed using the two first principal components based on r mode hca physicochemical variables can be divided into two clusters cluster 1 ec tds so4 na ca mg and cl and cluster 2 k hco3 and ph the results of q mode hca indicated that most of the samples used in the industrial and agricultural sectors are located in the same cluster considering the indices discussed the water quality for irrigation purposes is mainly excellent to permissible besides most groundwater samples have mild to high potential to corrode the equipment and pipelines it is recommended that in addition to continuously analyze the water quality to prevent damage to industrial equipment and water distribution network the corrosion resistant materials should be used declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11984,the hydrogeochemical and quality status of groundwater resources in yazd province the central plateau of iran has been investigated the most common water type followed by chemical facies in this study area is cl type with 50 46 and na cl facies 47 71 respectively besides the most samples with industrial and agricultural uses show the cl type and na cl hydrochemical facies the position of samples on the gibbs and van wirdum diagrams indicate that the water rock interaction and dissolution of evaporites are the main controlling process of water chemistry distribution of samples based on na cl vs ec ca mg vs so4 hco3 and na cl vs ca mg so4 hco3 highlight the significant role of direct ion exchange in water chemistry change the water quality for agricultural use is assessed based on some indices including ec na sodium absorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc magnesium absorption ratio mar permeability index pi kelly s ratio kr and wilcox diagram in general the water quality for irrigation purposes is mainly excellent to permissible the water quality assessment for industrial purposes is performed using some indices including langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi larson skold index l si puckorious scaling index psi and total hardness th based on these indices most groundwater samples have mild to high potential to corrode the equipment and pipelines graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry groundwater quality irrigation use industrial use central plateau of iran 1 introduction the chemical composition of groundwater can be altered by several factors such as the geology of the area the weathering rate of the geological formations along the flow path the quality of the recharge water the water residence time in the porous media leakage from anthropogenic contamination sources upconing of deep saline waters and the infiltration of brackish water from surface water sources amiri and berndtsson 2020 quino lima et al 2019 2020 amiri et al 2016 2017 sohrabi et al 2017 nakhaei et al 2015 jianova et al 2008 zhu et al 2007 in arid and semi arid regions of the world agricultural activities are recognized as one of the most important economic activities of residents and therefore pollutants from such activities are a serious concern in the management of groundwater resources malki et al 2017 to protect and better management of valuable water resources in arid and semi arid regions it is essential to know the hydrochemical status and the process controlling their quality changes alaya et al 2013 xing et al 2013 sohrabi et al 2013 karunanidhi et al 2020 by analyzing the effects of geochemical processes on groundwater chemistry and the health risks associated with fluoride intake in a semi arid region of south india indicated that the in addition to geogenic factors agricultural runoff water and industrial effiuents can be considered as the controlling factors of water chemistry gutiérrez et al 2018 assessed the nitrate sources and operating processes in arid and semiarid aquifer systems the results indicated that synthetic and organic fertilizers are often a major source of n in aquifers karroum et al 2017 studied the geochemical processes controlling groundwater quality under a semiarid environment in central morocco their study presented new insights into the anthropogenic impact on groundwater quality on the other hand due to the lack of water and the reduction of agricultural land efficiency optimizing the area under cultivation and the amount of water consumed with appropriate quality is a necessity similarly if low quality water is used in the agricultural lands the rules for water resources management must be changed accordingly the growth process of plants and trees can be disrupted by chemical compounds in the irrigation water through toxicity or change in nutrients supply amiri et al 2020 ali et al 2018 ayers and westcot 1985 therefore to better understand the change in the quality of irrigation water and its subsequent adverse effects on soil quality as well as agricultural products ramos et al 2011 sandhi et al 2012 a study with a focus on this concern should be conducted sefiani et al 2019 adimalla et al 2020 2018 studied the irrigational suitability of groundwater in two areas using major ions and showed that the majority of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation uses iqbal et al 2020 tried to determine the hydrochemical processes governing the groundwater chemistry evaluation of groundwater quality and suitability for irrigation use the results indicated that groundwater quality is not suitable for irrigation water quality for irrigation can be assessed using several qualitative indices and components like

to ensure sustainable development in each region despite some assumptions any water is not suitable for consumption in the industrial sector and some cases require quality improvement haritash et al 2016 wu et al 2015 industrial equipment is subject to corrosion and scaling due to the adverse effects of chemical reactions at high pressure and temperature hamzah et al 2008 problems with corrosion and scaling in water supply facilities of various industries and drinking water distribution network can be associated with secondary consequences on the health of residents yan et al 2020 one of the problems of water transfer and distribution systems is the deposition of carbonate coatings or their dissolution from the inner wall of the pipes and as a result the entry of heavy metal impurities from the metal pipes into the water palazzo et al 2015 olivia et al 2013 corrosion reactions directly affect the consumption of water disinfectants and increase the biological activity of microorganisms vasconcelos et al 2015 on the other hand sedimentation and corrosion processes can reduce the nominal life and power of the water transmission network and reduce the network pressure as well as increase the energy required for pumping sunardi et al 2020 besides the thermal conductivity of thermal installations can be reduced due to sedimentation thereby increasing energy consumption dianati tilaki and mahmoudi 2018 the water quality assessment for industrial purposes can be assessed using some indices including langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi larson skold index l si puckorious scaling index psi and total hardness th in recent years the importance of water sedimentation or corrosion has been studied by several researchers e g taghavi et al 2019 amouei et al 2017 mirzabeygi et al 2016 masters et al 2015 deshommes et al 2010 in terms of water resources iran is one of the poorest countries and has an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm per year which is less than one third of the average rainfall in the world esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 in arid and semi arid areas which generally include the eastern southern and central parts of iran groundwater is the most important source of domestic industrial and agricultural sectors pazand and fereidoni sarvestani 2013 today in iran water scarcity has become one of the most important challenges facing governments the overexploitation of groundwater and severe droughts in recent years have reduced the quantity and quality of groundwater resources this study has tried to evaluate the controlling mechanisms of groundwater chemistry and to determine the quality of groundwater in 109 wells in yazd province iran for use in agricultural and industrial sectors using all the introduced indices in the literature despite many studies that only examine the suitability of water quality for various uses in this study the hydrochemical status and processes controlling the chemical composition of groundwater resources have also been investigated providing spatial distribution maps of these water samples will help local decision makers have new insights into the overall quality of groundwater it is expected that the results of this study can lead to better management of groundwater resources in this arid domain 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area yazd province with an area of about 74 645 km2 is located on the central plateau of iran the average annual rainfall in this province is about 98 mm which is equivalent to 39 of iran s average rainfall 250 mm and about 10 of the global average rainfall 990 mm also the average annual evaporation of this province is about 3193 mm and the average temperature is 17 c in terms of ecosystem yazd province has a cold hot and dry semi arid ecosystem with little vegetation azizi jalilian et al 2020 the geographical and climatic conditions of yazd province have made it highly dependent on groundwater resources to meet its needs in the drinking agricultural and industrial sectors high temperatures low rainfall rates and high evaporation have caused almost no permanent river in the province the overexploitation of groundwater has played a key role in reducing aquifers storage and groundwater levels today the annual rate of decline in groundwater level in the yazd ardakan aquifer as the most important source of water supply for the majority of the population of this province is between 1 and 1 7 m year these conditions have caused 15 of the 19 aquifers in yazd province to be classified as prohibited in terms of groundwater pumping apart from the limited resources of karst water most of the aquifers in the province are formed in alluvial sedimentary basins according to the latest available information there are 6838 water sources including wells springs and qanats in yazd province from which a total of about 1 08 billion cubic meters of water is discharged annually amiri et al 2020 about 88 3 of groundwater is used in agriculture 7 in drinking water and 4 7 in industry 2 2 chemical sampling and analysis in this study groundwater resources were sampled in 109 wells the location of these samples was determined using the global positioning system gps and used to examine the spatial changes of the selected parameters and indicators these samples were prepared and stored under standard conditions iso 1993 and then transferred to the laboratory for analyzing apha 1985 fig 1 shows the distribution of sampling points based on the type of consumption drinking agricultural and industrial in the study area the parameters measured in this study include ph ec tds ca na k hco3 so4 and cl sulfate concentrations were measured using spectrophotometry hco3 mg cl ca parameters by titration na and k concentrations by photoelectric flame photometer ec and ph by electrochemical method and tds by gravimetric method 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry the chemical composition of groundwater during water rock sediment interaction is controlled by geochemical processes appleo and postma 1996 the results of water quality analysis include all major k ca mg na hco3 so4 cl ec tds and ph the statistical summary of the physicochemical parameters is presented in table 1 accordingly ec and ph values vary between 454 and 29 600 μs cm and 6 44 and 9 68 respectively therefore these water sources appear to be excellent to very poor quality and the acidity of the samples indicates poor acid to alkaline conditions of course in this case attention should be paid to the distribution of concentrations in different percentiles table 1 which is described below the minimum and maximum concentrations of sulfate and chloride are 35 5 9230 and 9 6 1485 6 mg l respectively which like other components have a wide range of concentrations considering the most important source of these variables the dissolution of evaporites seems to play a decisive role in controlling the concentration of the mentioned parameters similarly the concentration of sodium with the range of between 5 75 and 4800 1 mg l can be considered a function of the mechanism governing the two parameters so4 and cl on the other hand the dissolution of carbonate formations can play a significant role in controlling the concentration of calcium 16 1000 mg l and bicarbonate 91 5 1677 5 mg l besides due to the geological conditions of this area some calcium rich minerals such as feldspars pyroxenes and amphiboles can also play a role in the enrichment of ca in groundwater the results show that among cations na and ca and among anions so4 and hco3 have higher concentrations than other chemical ions on the other hand the order of average concentrations of cations and anions is so4 na hco3 cl ca mg k the distribution percentiles 25 50 and 75 of concentration for each parameter are also presented in table 1 accordingly despite the very high maximum for most physicochemical parameters the distribution percentiles indicate that 75 of measured values for each parameter are much smaller than the maximum values in other words less than 25 of them show high values this difference in maximum values and 75 distribution of the measured values in some parameters such as ec cl ca na and ph is very significant to determine the data distribution pattern and the methods to be used the normality test of the data sets for each variable was performed based on two tests kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk kitsos et al 2013 table 1 presents the normality tests for physicochemical variables results show that the p value significance level is zero which means rejecting the normality hypothesis for all variables in the shapiro wilk test and most parameters except ph in the kolmogorov smirnov test since the shapiro wilk method is generally used in the data category smaller than 2000 components amiri et al 2017 in the present study the accuracy of this method is higher than another test therefore as shown in table 1 none of the variables has a normal distribution and thus non parametric analyzes should be used for them determining the correlation coefficient between variables can provide valuable information about the possible source of the changes in this study due to the non normal distribution of variables spearman s correlation as a nonparametric analysis was used table 2 it should be noted that all statistical evaluations were performed using spss 21 ibm chicago ii usa and microsoft office 2016 as shown in table 2 ec as a representative of all chemical compounds in water has a strong positive correlation with various parameters such as k 0 96 mg 0 81 ca 0 77 so4 0 98 cl 0 84 and tds 0 99 however there is a positive moderate relationship between this parameter and k 0 50 these strong positive relationships can point to the role of water reaction with geological formations located along the flow path and changing the chemical composition of water as the most important factor in this case it should be noted that the highest ec correlation coefficient is seen with sodium sulfate and chloride which can indicate the significant role of dissolution of sediments and evaporites in controlling the hydrochemical status of these samples 3 2 hydrochemical facies to investigate the chemical status of groundwater resources in yazd province the chemical facies of each sample were determined based on the results of the chemical analysis table 3 presents the main hydrochemical facies of samples in this table three general types of carbonate sulfate and chloride are considered as references and then the chemical facies of each sample is determined based on the predominant cation and anion as shown most cation and anion in each facies are highlighted results show that the most common water type followed by chemical facies in this study area is chloride type with 50 46 and na cl facies 47 71 respectively on the other hand after the chloride water type the bicarbonate type with 44 04 is the most common chemical type based on the results ca hco3 and na hco3 have a relatively equal share in this type this table also shows the samples in each type and chemical fission a noteworthy point is that most samples with industrial table 3 bold red numbers and agricultural table 3 bold red underlined numbers uses show the chlorine type and na cl facies therefore it seems that over time the intelligent separation of water resources in terms of the type of consumption has been done by consumers so that poor quality waters are mainly used for agricultural and industrial purposes in contrast the main samples with drinking use table 3 black numbers are located in the bicarbonate type and this indicates the relative suitability of their quality compared to other samples it should be noted that the placement of some samples with drinking use in chlorine and sulfate types indicates their poor chemical quality based solely on the precedence and latency of ions in the water and not their maximum concentration also the placement of some industrial and agricultural samples in the bicarbonate type indicates their relatively good quality based only on the chemical type and not on the ion concentration 3 3 controlling mechanisms of water chemistry the concentration of ions in groundwater is mainly controlled by lithology i e chemical composition geochemical reactions and solubility of geological formations the sources of these soluble ions can be studied in different ways one of the most efficient methods is to display the values of na na ca and cl cl hco3 in each sample relative to its tds gibbs 1970 fig 2 shows the location of groundwater samples on the gibbs diagrams the concentration of the samples between the two end members including the interaction with the rocks as well as the evaporation and precipitation of high solubility formations shows that these two factors play the most important role in controlling the chemical composition of groundwater in this regard marandi and shand 2018 with a more accurate interpretation of the mechanisms affecting the end members of the gibbs diagram only by examining na na ca versus tds provided a better analysis of the hydrogeochemical status of groundwater resources accordingly in the rock dominance end member of the gibbs diagram the geochemical evolution resulting from the dissolution of some carbonate formations can be seen due to the reduction of the na na ca ratio on the other hand the influence of geochemical processes and weathering of silicate formations and consequently increase in na na ca ratio can be observed between the two end members of rock dominance and evaporation precipitation dominance given the current situation moving the chemical composition of some samples towards evaporation precipitation dominance can be justified by dissolving highly soluble formations or infiltrating and mixing with salt water as well as high residence time waters in addition to using the concept of gibbs the position of water samples in van wirdum s diagram was also assessed fig 3 this diagram uses the ca ca cl ionic ratio to ec accordingly the chemical composition of groundwater can be considered between atmocline meteoric water lithocline fresh calcium rich water and thalassocline seawater tanaskovic et al 2012 the results show that the studied samples are located between the two end members including li and th and this indicates an analysis similar to what was said about gibbs diagrams besides given the distribution of samples in this diagram it should be expected that the ionic ratios of samples change under the influence of some factors such as ion exchange in other words the diversity of chemical facies in these water samples is quite expected see table 3 as mentioned sometimes the chemical composition of groundwater can undergo significant changes in the flow path due to the physicochemical conditions prevailing in the aquifer one of the factors that change the concentration of water ions is ion exchange ion exchange is the replacement of ions absorbed on the surface of solid particles by ions in groundwater the na cl versus ca mg so4 hco3 ratio has been used to determine the role of ion exchange processes in groundwater chemistry control amiri et al 2015 assuming that all of the cl in groundwater originates from the dissolution of halite the positive value of na cl indicates the excess na in the water which in turn could come from a source other than the dissolution of halite the final amount of ca mg so4 hco3 also refers to a source other than the dissolution of gypsum and carbonates as a source of calcium or magnesium in the absence of these reactions all groundwater samples should be close to the center of the diagram fig 4 top left mclean et al 2000 in contrast if the role of these reactions dissolution of halite and carbonates is significant groundwater samples will be placed along a line with a negative slope as shown the samples are scattered along a negatively sloping line indicating the role of the dissolution of salt and carbonate in this region distribution of samples based on na cl vs ec fig 4 top right shows that samples with high ec have a lower na cl ratio indicating the role of direct ion exchange in changing the composition of most groundwater samples another ionic ratio that can be a reliable tool in determining the role of ion exchange in the control of the chemical composition of groundwater is the study of ca mg concentration against so4 hco3 accordingly if the role of reverse ion exchange is more significant than direct ion exchange the samples will be on the right side of the graph due to the increase in the concentration of so4 hco3 in contrast if the direct ion exchange has a more prominent role the points will be concentrated on the left side of the graph because of the increase in ca mg value excess sodium and magnesium in groundwater can be due to their exchange with sodium in the solid particles given the concentration of ca mg versus so4 hco3 fig 4 down the distribution of points indicates that calcium and magnesium may have other sources and this highlights the significant role of direct ion exchange in increasing the concentration of these cations in the water composition 3 4 multivariate analysis many studies have used multivariate methods to simplify and organize large data sets to better understand the relationship between them matiatos et al 2014 multivariate statistical methods have a wide range of formulas and their applications two of the key methods of which include the principal component analysis pca and the hierarchical cluster analysis hca a complete description of these multivariate statistical tools is provided by swan and sandilands 1995 and davis 2002 in the following the ability of these tools to better understand the geochemical mechanisms controlling the chemical composition of groundwater in yazd province has been used 3 5 principal component analysis pca in this part the measured value of 10 physicochemical variables in 109 sampling locations has been used the number of principal components is determined by the kaiser criteria accordingly only components that have eigenvalues greater than 1 are selected besides the normalized varimax rotation has been used to maximize the variance of the principal components and to better separate them from each other table 4 presents the statistical results of the pca also eigenvalues changes are displayed as presented the two first principal components have eigenvalues greater than 1 equal to 6 3 and 1 34 respectively which after the rotation sums of squared loadings are equal to 6 25 and 1 39 respectively and therefore are considered as two final components for the next analysis the results of the pca show that nearly 76 32 of the changes in the chemical composition of water can be assessed using the first and second principal components tables 4 and 5 in other words the variables in the first component with control of about 62 45 of the total variance play the most important role in changing groundwater chemistry in the studied samples on the other hand the second component accounts for about 13 87 of the chemical changes in groundwater resources in the first component some of the main ions in water such as sodium magnesium calcium sulfate and chloride have a strong positive correlation with tds and ec as a representative of the overall water composition these parameters indicate the role of water interaction with geological formations and their release into groundwater composition on the other hand two variables of bicarbonate with a load of 0 8 and a ph with a load of 0 7 have been identified as a separate component that controls about 14 of the composition of groundwater given the role that bicarbonate has along with other factors such as calcium and calcium sodium potassium and magnesium carbohydrates and hydroxides as well as exchange reactions and biological activities in water alkalinity as a criterion for determining water capacity in acid neutralization it seems that the negative correlation between ph and bicarbonate and certainly alkalinity is logical 3 6 hierarchical cluster analysis hca in this study hca was used to investigate the relationship between variables r mode and groundwater samples q mode cluster analysis helps to group physicochemical variables or water samples based on the level of similarity within the classes and the dissimilarity between the different groups these analyzes were performed using normalized data in the ward method in this method euclidean distances are used as a measure of similarity the result of r mode hca and q mode hca are presented in fig 5 and table 6 respectively the dendrogram prepared using cluster analysis fig 5 shows that in general physicochemical variables can be divided into two groups the first group cluster 1 includes ec tds so4 na ca mg and cl this cluster similar to that described for the first component of pca could indicate the significant role of water rock interaction in controlling groundwater chemistry the second group cluster 2 includes k hco3 and ph the parameters of this cluster are similar to the parameters of the second component of pca in q mode hca the similarity of the composition of groundwater samples in one group and also the difference between the chemical composition of each group with other groups has been used as a tool to divide the samples into different clusters as shown in table 6 the classification of 109 groundwater samples is evaluated in three modes 2 3 and 4 clusters in table 6 the red bold samples have industrial use the red bold underlined samples have agricultural use and the other samples have drinking use in the 2 cluster mode most of the drinking water samples are in cluster 1 and most of the agricultural and industrial water samples are in cluster 2 in 3 cluster mode all samples in cluster 1 in 2 cluster mode are still in cluster 1 without further separation on the other hand the agricultural and industrial water samples are more accurately separated in clusters 2 and 3 in this case most of the samples used in industrial and agricultural sectors are located in cluster 3 finally the most separation in groundwater samples is seen in 4 cluster mode accordingly the worst quality samples are in cluster 4 and the other clusters have fewer poor quality samples as shown in table 2 agricultural and industrial water samples have mainly na cl chemical facies and here these samples are in a common cluster note that the presence of some agricultural and industrial water samples among the drinking water samples indicates their appropriate quality and vice versa the presence of some drinking water samples among the industrial and agricultural water samples indicates their inappropriate quality 3 7 water quality for irrigation in this study groundwater quality for consumption in the agricultural sector has been evaluated using some known indicators here are some of the most important features of water consumption in agriculture 3 8 electrical conductivity ec based on the ec value groundwater samples are divided into different classes handa 1969 the results show that about 56 of the samples have good and permissible quality and about 44 of the samples do not have the appropriate quality for consumption in the agricultural sector table 7 3 9 sodium absorption ratio sar another parameter affecting water quality for consumption in agriculture is the na concentration gupta et al 2009 the high concentration of sodium in the water causes it to accumulate on the surface of solid soil particles and due to the increase in cation exchange capability and reduce the permeability of the land the drainage rate and the air circulation in the soil environment besides the sar is known as a good index for determining the relative concentration of sodium in the aquifer and is calculated as follows where the ion concentration is in milliequivalent per liter meq l the classification of groundwater samples based on sar values shows that nearly 98 of the samples have excellent quality todd 1995 or in other words classes s1 and s2 richards 1954 table 7 3 10 sodium percentage na the amount of sodium in the environment is also expressed as the percentage of sodium na this indicator can be determined using the following equation where the ion concentration is meq l the quality assessment of groundwater based on na wilcox 1995 shows that about 86 of samples have high quality to permissible and only about 14 of them have doubtful class table 7 3 11 residual sodium carbonate rsc in groundwater samples high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate relative to magnesium and calcium can affect soil permeability esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 this behavior can be demonstrated using rsc where the ion concentration is in meq l high levels of rsc more than 2 5 meq l make it unsuitable for irrigation usda 1954 the results show that the rsc value in all samples is less than 2 5 meq l and this indicates that their quality is suitable for irrigation table 7 3 12 magnesium absorption ratio mar another indicator used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water is the magnesium adsorption ratio mar raghunath 1987 where the ion concentration is in meq l based on the mar values in the samples are divided into two groups inappropriate mar 50 and appropriate or permissible mar 50 the results show that 94 5 of the studied samples have good quality and 5 5 have poor quality table 7 3 13 permeability index pi long term use of water of different qualities can affect the permeability of the soil doneen 1964 the pi is also a useful tool for assessing the potential for soil permeability change due to the use of water of different qualities in the agricultural sector this index is determined by the following relation where the ion concentration is in meq l if the pi is more than 75 it indicates excellent water quality for agricultural use also pi values between 25 and 75 and less than 25 indicate good and poor water quality respectively saleh al amry 2008 the results show that about 93 6 of the samples are in excellent and good quality table 7 3 14 kelly s ratio kr the kr is another ionic ratio that is used to determine the quality of irrigation water and is calculated as follows kelley 1963 where the ion concentration is in meq l if the kr is 1 and 1 it indicates the suitable and unsuitable quality of water for irrigation respectively due to the increase in the amount of sodium and the effect on soil permeability naseem et al 2010 the results show that 26 61 of the samples have unsuitable quality kr 1 and 73 93 of the samples have suitable quality kr 1 respectively table 7 3 15 wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 has introduced the simultaneous use of na and ec of groundwater as a powerful tool for determining the water quality for irrigation in this diagram the samples fall into one of five designated groups the results show that 39 samples 35 78 have ec values greater than 3000 μs cm as an unsuitable group boundary therefore about 64 of the samples are of excellent to doubtful quality fig 6 it seems that considering one or more components of water quality in diagrams such as the wilcox diagram it can be more accurate than any of the above indices 3 16 water quality assessment for industrial use in this part of the study various indicators including langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi larson skold index l si and puckorius scaling index psi were used to determine water quality in the industrial sector 3 17 langelier saturation index lsi this index is used as a tool to estimate the ability of calcium carbonate to precipitate in industrial equipment eg water distribution network or their corrosion potential by groundwater langelier 1936 according to this index the corrosive ability of groundwater is mainly due to the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and its reaction with carbonates especially ca and mg decreasing the ph of water can increase the corrosion ability of water therefore waters with low alkalinity and co2 saturation can increase its corrosion rate the lsi changes between 3 and 3 positive lsi values indicate the high potential for precipitation of caco3 due to the supersaturation of the water respect with this compound in this case the rate of precipitation on the equipment is much higher than the rate of corrosion by this water on the other hand negative lsi values indicate a low caco3 precipitation rate compared to the dissolution rate in other words under such conditions low alkalinity and high co2 concentration cause the corrosive ability of these waters to be much higher than the rate of scaling on the pipelines and equipment ravikumar and somashekar 2012 esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 the lsi value is calculated as follows where lsi is a function of the measured ph value and ph s the ph s indicates the acidity of water saturated respect with caco3 kumar et al 2009 the ph s value can be obtained using the following equation where the values of a b c and d are calculated as follows where the concentration of tds ca and alkalinity is in mg l the results show that 57 8 of the samples had the lsi value of less than 0 which indicates that the water is saturated respect with caco3 and tends to remove caco3 from the inner surface of industrial equipment such as pipes on the other hand 42 2 of the studied samples have the lsi value greater than 0 and therefore show that the water is supersaturated respect with caco3 and has the potential for precipitation in the equipment table 8 fig 7 shows the lsi values for groundwater samples 3 18 ryznar stability index rsi this empirical index is also used in combination with other indicators such as lsi to determine the tendency of water to precipitate and dissolve caco3 in pipelines ryznar 1944 the index can be calculated as follows the rsi changes in groundwater samples indicate that there is an equilibrium between precipitation and dissolution in only about 12 of the samples near 4 5 of the samples have the ability to precipitation high and mild and about 83 5 of the samples have the ability to corrosion mild and very high table 8 as shown in fig 8 the highest number of samples 81 samples is in the third class rsi between 6 8 and 8 5 3 19 larson skold index l si this indicator like the two indicators lsi and rsi is used to determine the potential for scaling or corrosion in industrial equipment according to larson and skold 1958 water alkalinity can reduce water corrosion on the other hand cl and so4 can increase corrosion potential the l si value is calculated as follows ravikumar and somashekar 2012 where the concentrations are in meq l as shown in table 8 84 4 of the samples have a high corrosion ability and their use in industry can lead to damage to equipment such as water distribution lines fig 9 also shows the change in l si values 3 20 puckorious scaling index psi this index indicates the buffering capacity of the water and the highest level of scaling until it reaches equilibrium davil et al 2009 like the rsi this index uses the equilibrium acidity relative and measured value to determine the buffering capacity the interpretation of this index is similar to the interpretations used for rsi sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 the psi is calculated as follows where the results show that the psi value in 88 samples 80 73 is more than 8 5 which indicates the very high corrosion potential of steel equipment also 7 34 of the samples have mild corrosion ability on the other hand about 10 of the samples have scaling potential table 8 fig 10 shows the changes in psi values in addition to the lsi rsi l si and psi indices some studies have noted the role of total hardness th in determining water quality in domestic and industrial sectors hard water can increase the consumption of household and industrial cleaners schroeder 1960 the classification of groundwater samples based on th sawyer and mccarthy 1967 shows that all samples are in the hard class 150 300 mg l and very hard more than 300 mg l 4 conclusion the most common water type followed by chemical facies in this study area is cl type and na cl facies respectively the position of samples on the gibbs and van wirdum diagrams indicate that the water rock interaction and dissolution of evaporites are the main controlling process of water chemistry distribution of samples based on na cl vs ec ca mg vs so4 hco3 and na cl vs ca mg so4 hco3 highlight the significant role of direct ion exchange in water chemistry change the results of pca showed that nearly 76 32 of the changes in the chemical composition of water can be assessed using the two first principal components based on r mode hca physicochemical variables can be divided into two clusters cluster 1 ec tds so4 na ca mg and cl and cluster 2 k hco3 and ph the results of q mode hca indicated that most of the samples used in the industrial and agricultural sectors are located in the same cluster considering the indices discussed the water quality for irrigation purposes is mainly excellent to permissible besides most groundwater samples have mild to high potential to corrode the equipment and pipelines it is recommended that in addition to continuously analyze the water quality to prevent damage to industrial equipment and water distribution network the corrosion resistant materials should be used declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
