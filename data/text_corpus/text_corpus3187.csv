15935,harmful algal blooms habs may quickly travel and inoculate new water bodies via currents and runoff in estuaries the role of in situ prokaryotic communities in the re establishment and growth of inoculated algal blooms remains unknown a novel on board incubation experiment was employed to simulate the sudden surge of algal blooms to new estuarine waters and reveal possible outcomes a dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae and a diatom species thalassiosira weissflogii which had bloomed in the pearl river estuary pre area were cultured to bloom densities and reintroduced back into pre natural seawaters the diatom showed better adaptation ability to the new environment and increased significantly after the incubation simultaneously particle attached pa prokaryotic community structure was strongly influenced by adding of the diatom with some opportunistic prokaryotes significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment whereas the dinoflagellate population did not increase following incubation and their pa prokaryotic community showed no significant differences relative to the control metagenomic analyzes revealed that labile carbohydrates and organic nitrogen produced by the diatom contributed to the surge of certain pa prokaryotes genomic properties of a bacteria strain which is affiliated with genus gmd16e07 planctomycetaceae and comprised up to 50 of pa prokaryotes in the diatom treatment was described here for the first time notably the association of planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii likely represents symbiotic mutualism with the diatom providing organic matter for planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins and detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange therefore the close association between planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii promoted the growth of both populations and eventually facilitated the diatom bloom establishment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bloom population dynamics

and climate change berry et al 2015 cao et al 2017 phlips et al 2015 algae and prokaryotes commonly interact in aquatic systems and algal blooms may alter the prokaryotic community and its ecological functions camarena gómez et al 2021 cui et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated bloom stage specific host specificity in algal associated prokaryotic communities for different algal species thus microbial behavior and succession patterns in phycosphere microenvironments may contribute to algal bloom formation and longevity alavi et al 2001 amin et al 2012 choi et al 2018 green et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 in addition modern omics studies have provided evidence of a linkage between changes in prokaryotic community functional genes and shifting organic matter cycles throughout different bloom stages brussaard et al 2017 durham et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 understanding the interactions between algae and associated prokaryotic communities will help clarify the mechanisms that mediate algal bloom dynamics choi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ramanan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 the study of algal bacterial relationship is gaining attention often focusing on bloom management and prevention coyne et al 2022 yong et al 2021 however prokaryotic functional profiles and their biogeochemical potential in algal bloom processes remain poorly understood this study aims to examine algal bacterial association under in situ bloom re establishment conditions in estuarine waters planktonic algal blooms may be transported over long distances via currents and runoff paerl et al 2018 for example a toxic dinoflagellate bloomed on the coast of north carolina after the seed population was carried by the gulf stream over 800 km from the source bloom site tester et al 1991 a massive phytoplankton bloom initiated in the great barrier reef lagoon spread 150 km in nine days via a river plume brodie et al 2010 algal bloom expansion could rapidly change local water column physico chemical factors such as turbidity dissolved organic carbon nutrients and dissolved oxygen it may also induce a sudden shift of prokaryotic community structure and function attempts have been made to study prokaryotic community succession during algal blooms in fixed stations berry et al 2017 cui et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 2018 some in situ algal bloom monitoring has confirmed prokaryotic community succession during bloom events raising the possibility that specific prokaryotic populations may occupy transitory ecological niches associated with particular bloom stages choi et al 2018 wemheuer et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 however few studies have examined the impacts of algal bloom phase on the local prokaryotic community this is because it is difficult to precisely predict algal bloom onset and progression in a natural open water system allen et al 2008 stumpf et al 2009 in this study a novel method was employed to simulate the inoculation of estuarine algal blooms to new waters comparative incubation experiments were carried out at four stations in the pearl river estuary pre to unveil the effects of prokaryotic community composition and function changes on the algal bloom re establishment and growth the pre also known as the great bay area is one of the most urbanized and populated estuaries in the world like other estuarine systems harmful algal blooms habs are a recurring problem in the pre with 337 habs mostly dinoflagellates and diatoms reported from 1980 to 2016 li et al 2019 the pre has an annual average discharge of 10 000 cubic meters per second and is subject to monsoon seasonality with a strong northeasterly season in winter and a weak southwesterly season in summer pan et al 2020 the complex energetic circulation and high river discharge at ebb tide can lead to river plumes in which buoyant masses of brackish water travel on top of dense ocean water with a persistent surface lens traveling considerable distances devlin and pan 2018 thus algal blooms formed at pre are likely to be transported to the adjacent outer coastal region within few hours or days to test what happens to the prokaryotic community when the seeds of a bloom are delivered to a coastal region one dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae and one diatom species thalassiosira weissflogii which had bloomed in the pre area were selected and cultured to bloom densities in the lab li et al 2013 lu et al 2014 they were then introduced and incubated in natural seawater at different stations to simulate the quick invasion of algal blooms to different locations in an estuarine system this study aimed to 1 test whether different algal blooms would re establish when they are introduced to new water bodies 2 evaluate the potential effects of the transplanted algal blooms on prokaryotic community abundance composition and function 3 identify the key prokaryotic species that respond to the algal bloom and unveil the interspecies interaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collections this study was carried out from august 18 25th 2020 during a cruise in the pre surface seawater 0 5 m depth was collected from sampling stations indicated in fig 1 a using a 5 l polymethyl methacrylate water sampler the 3 µm pore size was used for distinguishing free living fl from particle attached pa prokaryotes liu et al 2019 schmidt et al 2016 teeling et al 2012 water collected from each station was prefiltered with 200 µm mesh to exclude mesozooplankton and then filtered through 3 µm collecting pa prokaryotes and 0 2 µm collecting fl prokaryotes polycarbonate pc membranes millipore successively membranes were kept at 80 c until dna extraction samples n 3 for flow cytometry analysis 1 8 ml were also collected at each station they were preserved with 0 5 buffered paraformaldehyde v v final concentration and stored in a 80 c freezer until analysis water temperature salinity and ph were measured using a ysi multiprobe sensor which was calibrated before each sampling water samples n 3 for inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis were prefiltered with gf f membranes and collected in 50

continuous flow nutrient autoanalyzer seal aa3 following the manufacture s methods doc was measured using total organic carbon analyzers shimadzu toc l series utilizing the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method 2 2 incubation experiments setup and sample collections incubation experiments were conducted at selected medium salinity stations s10 and s17 with salinities of 23 and 25 respectively and high salinity stations s15 and s19 with salinities of 29 and 31 respectively fig 1 for incubation experiments surface seawater was prefiltered with 200 µm mesh to exclude larger zooplankton three treatments were setup at each station they were seawater control dinoflagellate treatment inoculated with a carterae and diatom treatment inoculated with t weissflogii at the beginning of the incubation experiments the densities of inoculated a carterae ranged from 1 103 to 1 104 cells ml 1 and the densities of t weissflogii varied from 1 104 to 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 2 a these inoculum concentrations were selected based on natural bloom densities recorded in the previous studies where the highest diatom bloom density was an order of magnitude higher than the dinoflagellate bloom gárate lizárraga et al 2019 seebah et al 2014 the relative abundances of background phytoplankton were low in all treatments table s2 fig s2 experimental densities were analogous to natural blooms where bloom species dominated phytoplankton communities the cell densities of inoculated t weissflogii were 1 15 to 5 39 times higher than that of a carterae at the onset of experiments and we acknowledge a possible bias of different initial inoculum total cell densities when comparing dinoflagellate and diatom results both a carterae and t weissflogii were precultured in the lab using 1 l pc bottles using guillard s f 2 medium at 25 c with a 14 10 light dark cycle hoff and snell 2007 both algal cultures were in the exponential growth phase and acclimated to 29 c before experiments at each station cultures were washed gently through a 5 µm mesh pc membrane millipore with 0 2 µm prefiltered in situ seawater to remove the growth medium fig 1b washed algal cultures were then resuspended gently using a pasteur pipet with 200 µm prefiltered in situ seawater fig 1b both a carterae and t weissflogii were precultured at two salinities 25 and 30 at the stations with salinity near 25 s10 and s17 algae precultured at a salinity of 25 were added at the stations with salinity near 30 s15 and s19 algae precultured at a salinity of 30 were added incubation experiments were performed in 1 l pc bottles these bottles were soaked in 10 hcl nanopure water for 24 h and rinsed 3 times with ultra pure water before the experiments three replicates n 3 were run for each of the three treatments during incubation pc bottles were submerged in a 1 5 m 1 m 0 5 m deckside water bath with flow through ambient surface water maintaining the same temperature as the oceanographic station in situ water column light conditions were simulated with neutral density screening after 48 h of incubation 500 ml of water from each bottle was filtered through 3 and 0 2 µm pc membranes successively membranes were kept at 80 c until dna extraction water samples n 3 for nutrient analyzes were prefiltered through gf f membranes and collected in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tubes after incubation samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected using the methods described above phytoplankton samples 15 ml for cell counts were also collected from incubation bottles before and after the incubation period and preserved with 1 lugol s iodine solution 2 3 flow cytometry analysis of prokaryotic abundance to determine prokaryotic abundance samples were analyzed via beckman coulter cytoflex lx flow cytometer beckman coulter indianapolis in united states for total prokaryotic cell abundance measurement water samples were diluted 10 times using 1 tris edta buffer sigma aldrich molecular grade ph 8 0 nucleic acid stain sybr green i was added to each sample at a final dilution of 1 10 000 and kept in darkness for 15 min at 37 c marie et al 1997 5 µl yellowish green fluorescent beads polyscience warrington pa united states were then added to each sample as an internal standard for autotrophic prokaryotic cell abundance measurement samples were neither diluted nor stained all preprepared samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 0 25 ml s 1 for 1 min the software cytexpert 2 1 beckman coulter indianapolis in united states was used to analyze

planctomycetaceae bin 3 results 3 1 pre hydrographic condition and natural prokaryotic community structure hydrographic conditions varied with different sampling stations during the survey at pre table s1 in general surface water ph 7 75 8 50 and salinity 0 01 31 86 increased from upstream to downstream stations inorganic nutrient levels including silica 0 1890 5 7678 mg si l 1 phosphate 0

coastal water doc concentrations were highly variable among stations ranging from 1 58 to 11 17 mg l 1 heterotrophic prokaryote abundance in surface water ranged from 0 89 to 2 87 106 cells ml 1 according to flow cytometry analysis table s1 the nmds analysis showed a clear spatial variation of prokaryotic communities in the pre seawater fig s1 the fl prokaryotic communities were clustered into two distinct groups which were upstream s2 to s11 and downstream clusters s12 to s20 respectively fig s1a and s1b inorganic nutrient levels were correlated to the upstream cluster p 0 05 and salinity and ph were correlated to the downstream cluster p 0 05 fig s1a the pa prokaryotic communities were clustered into four groups fig s1c silica nitrate and nitrite concentrations were strongly correlated to the cluster composed of s2 s5 and s6 p 0 05 but the rest of the clusters could not be fully explained by water quality variations fig s1c and s1d 3 2 the algal and prokaryotic growth and nutrients change after incubation experiments a carterae and t weissflogii had distinct responses when they were introduced to pre the densities of a carterae remained the same before and after the incubation at s10 but decreased significantly at s17 s15 and s19 p 0 01 fig 2 meanwhile t weissflogii increased significantly at medium salinity stations s10 p 0 01 s17 p 0 05 and showed no significant change at high salinity stations s15 and s19 fig 2 the cell densities of background algae were at least an order of magnitude lower than our algal treatments at the start of the incubation experiments table s2 the relative abundance of inoculated versus background algae showed contrary change pattern in all experiments except the diatom treatment at s19 fig s2 this suggested that the inoculated algae and background algae could be competitors with one another in the dinoflagellate treatments the relative abundance of a carterae only increased at s10 fig s2a at the rest of the incubation stations a carterae were out paced by increasing background diatoms densities fig s2b s2c and s2d in contrast the abundances of t weissflogii were high 95 at all incubation stations they significantly increased at s10 and s17 and out paced background diatoms fig s2a and s2b but t weissflogii significantly decreased at s15 where background dinoflagellates increased fig s2c the concentrations of silica nitrate and nitrite significantly decreased after incubation in the algal treatments when compared to the control fig s3b s3c and s3d based on spearman correlation analyzes the change of silica nitrate ammonium and phosphate concentrations were strongly inversely correlated to the change of t weissflogii cell densities p 0 05 rho 0 7 fig s4b and the decrease of nitrite was strongly positively correlated with the increase of background diatoms in the dinoflagellate treatments p 0 05 rho 0 7 fig s4a thus the decrease of inorganic nutrient concentrations is likely due to the fast growing diatom populations heterotrophic prokaryote abundance increased significantly in dinoflagellate treatments at s10 p 0 01 and s15 p 0 05 and also increased significantly in diatom treatments at s17 p 0 0001 s15 p 0 001 and s19 p 0 001 fig s5 3 3 prokaryotic community composition in diatom and dinoflagellate treatments the ace and shannon s diversity index h for both fl and pa prokaryotes were not significantly different between the control and either algal treatment fig s6 the fl prokaryotic communities did not show clear clustering in the response to the diatom and dinoflagellate treatments except a cluster observed in diatom treatment at s17 fig 3 a b however the pa prokaryote communities were clustered into two groups fig 3c pa prokaryotic composition was strongly influenced by the presence of diatoms but not by the addition of dinoflagellates fig 3c d at s15 planctomycetaceae and stappiaceae became more abundant in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig 4 a at s17 the relative abundance of planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae stappiaceae cryomorphaceae and ns9 marine group significantly increased in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig 4b these results suggest that planctomycetaceae and stappiaceae in the pa prokaryotic community benefited from the diatom cells at the otu level planctomycetaceae was mainly affiliated with e otu2 which was identified as genus sm1a02 family phycisphaeraceae based on the silva database however we further blasted the representative sequence of e otu2 against the nr database and the result showed that it is highly similar with genus gmd16e07 similarity 99 2 ncbi accession no ay162118 which is an unclassified planctomycetaceae zengler et al 2002 fig s7 stappiaceae was mainly composed of e otu12 which was identified as unclassified labrenzia fig s7 dinoflagellates had relatively little impact on the pa prokaryotic community and only the vibrionaceae significantly increased in relative abundance s15 p 0 05 fig 4a 3 4 metagenomic sequencing statistics to further explore the effects of the diatom treatment on the potential function of the pa prokaryotic community a metagenomic approach was employed to analyze pa prokaryote communities in the diatom treatment and control at s17 the numbers of paired end raw reads sequenced within each of the metagenomic samples ranged from 15 7 to 72 4 million resulting in 674 241 1 414 602 orfs table s4 between 26 85 34 02 37 21 45 50 and 0 51 0 61 of the orfs in each sequence library were annotated by the kegg cog and cazy public databases respectively table s4 in total the predicted genes from assembled contigs were assigned to 492 kegg pathways at the third level among these nitrogen metabolism cazymes and atp binding cassette transporters abc transporters were investigated in detail in general the tpm abundances of cazymes and abc transporters showed no significant difference between the diatom and control treatments but nitrogen metabolism was significantly reduced in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig s9 3 5 carbohydrate metabolism of particle attached pa prokaryotic communities in the diatom treatment to compare the major

kinase chea chemotaxis protein methyltransferase cher chemotaxis proteins chex chey mota and motb and flagellar motor switch proteins flig flin and flim fig 7 indicating their strong response to chemical stimuli nine abc transporters were identified from the genome only the abc transporters that have the genes encoding the substrate binding protein permease protein and atp binding protein recovered in the genome were calculated fig 7 among these abc transporters a multiple sugar transport was found which potentially could import nineteen different carbohydrates into the cell fig 7 also one fructose specific phosphotransferase system pts was found in this genome it imports and phosphorylates fructose into fructose 1 phosphate via a fructose specific subunit frub and a phosphoenolpyruvate protein phosphotransferase ptsi and then further phosphorylates into fructose 1 6 bisphosphate via a 1 phosphofructokinase ptsk which eventually involves the central carbohydrate metabolism pathway suggesting its strong ability to import and utilize fructose fig 7 in addition to the fructose specific pts system the gene of ptsn which encodes a type ii enzyme in pts system was found in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 this is a complex and diversified group of phosphotransferase proteins involved in controlling the intake of certain carbohydrates e g glucose and other regulatory functions fig 7 chavarría et al 2012 in addition one sodium dependent dicarboxylate transporter belonging to the solute carrier family 13 was found in the genome in terms of carbohydrate metabolism the genes encoding metabolic pathways common for chemoorganotrophic bacteria such as glycolysis the citrate cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway were all present in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 genome fig 7 this strongly suggests they may be able to utilize complex carbohydrates the genome encoded 1 cbm 11 ghs and 10 gts which were affiliated with 1 9 and 7 cazyme families respectively fig 7 the planctomycetaceae bin p01 was able to use both inorganic nitrate nitrite and ammonia and organic glutamine glutamate and nitrile sources of nitrogen fig 7 notably one gene encoding alkyl hydroperoxide reductase namely ahpc tsa presents in the genome this gene is reported to reduce a wide range of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species alharbi et al 2019 we also scrutinized the vitamin biosynthesis pathways the key genes encoding vitamin b1 b6 b12 and k2 biosynthesis were found in the genome fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 the diatom and dinoflagellate blooms showed different responses to the translocation experiment diatom thalassiosira weissflogii densities increased significantly when they were exposed to ambient water conditions at different pre stations fig 2 whereas dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae densities did not significantly increase this may be due to diatoms generally having higher tolerances to environmental variability relative to dinoflagellates hill et al 2001 litchman 2007 recent omics studies unveiled adaptive mechanisms in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana under shifting environmental conditions including sudden deficiencies in nitrogen and phosphorus chen et al 2018 hockin et al 2012 silicon limitation mock et al 2008 and salinity and light fluctuations kettles et al 2014 employing a range of strategies to cope with various stress factors it is easier for this diatom to acclimate to new environments muhseen et al 2015 as a group diatoms tend to be r strategists quickly assimilating new nutrients and achieving high biomasses in contrast dinoflagellates are usually k strategists blooming slower than diatoms wasmund et al 2017 t weissflogii densities were strongly correlated with a decrease of inorganic nutrients in the incubation experiments spearman correlation fig s4 the highest specific growth rate of t weissflogii recorded in the literature is 1 24 0 025 day 1 garcia et al 2012 which is higher than that of a carterae 0 93 0 13 day 1 li et al 2016 therefore published growth rates for the species in this study support the idea that diatom blooms might be expected to increase more rapidly than the dinoflagellate under the right environmental conditions in addition to the different physiology properties between t weissflogii and a carterae other conditions could also influence the re establishment of the diatom bloom for instance background algae could be competitors to bloom species fig s4 besides in situ seawater conditions could also influence their response to a new environment in the present study we observed that t weissflogii only significantly increased at s10 and s17 where the salinities were around 25 and in situ concentrations of silica and nitrate were relatively high compare to s15 and s19 table s1 this is consistent with previous studies where t weissflogii had higher growth rates at a salinity of 25 compared to rates at 30 garcia et al 2012 and those growth rates had strong positive correlations with nitrate and silica concentrations de la rocha et al 2010 li et al 2017 moreover a long term phytoplankton monitoring study in the pre showed that the proportion of diatoms have progressively increased in the pre over the past two decades due to increasing anthropogenic nitrate inputs cheung et al 2021 considering of the demonstrated ability of diatom blooms to establish and grow and the increasing presence of anthropogenic nutrients in the pre it should not be surprising if diatom blooms are increasing in frequency and intensity in this region 4 2 the diatom bloom had strong effects on the pa prokaryotic community in the present study algal bloom inoculation had a significant influence on the pa prokaryotic community but little impact on the fl prokaryotic community fig 3 other studies have found that algae and pa prokaryotes are coupled in coastal and aquatic systems bachmann et al 2018 fontanez et al 2015 liu et al 2019 rieck et al 2015 rösel and grossart 2012 we showed that the diatom bloom had stronger effects on the pa prokaryotic community compared to the dinoflagellate bloom fig 3c d this could be due in part to the active growth phase of t weissflogii with substantial extracellular polymeric substance eps production gügi et al 2015 the primary source of labile organic matter for surface ocean heterotrophic bacteria is phytoplankton ferrer gonzález et al 2021 and maximum exportation of eps usually occurs in the algal exponential growth phase staats et al 1999 field observations have confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria tend to follow natural algal blooms sperling et al 2017 teeling et al 2012 although a carterae is also an eps producer mandal et al 2011 we speculate that the lack of response of pa prokaryotes in the dinoflagellate treatments may be due to the latter being in an inactive growth phase after inoculation with minimal eps production 4 3 diatom derived carbohydrates and organic nitrogen sources shaped particle attached pa prokaryotic community composition in the diatom treatment environment specific responses of the pa prokaryotic community in the diatom treatment are likely due to their adaptive functionality and underlying genetic properties the pa prokaryotes contain genes enabling a variety of metabolic capabilities which are thought to equip cells to take advantage of patches of organic matter to grow rapidly during blooms luo and moran 2015 therefore the pa prokaryotic community structure is potentially influenced by substrate availability and particle quality bachmann et al 2018 yung et al 2016 in this study we found that the introduction of a diatom bloom shaped pa prokaryotic community composition and altered their carbon and nitrogen metabolic properties the significant increase of prokaryotic cazymes related genes results from the presence of specific carbohydrates produced and released by the diatom some opportunistic pa prokaryotes e g planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae benefit more from these diatom derived carbohydrates than other taxa figs 5 and 6 published studies have shown that thalassiosira is able to extrude myo inositol kroth et al 2008 pullulan dalgic et al 2019 and glycolate schada von borzyskowski et al 2019 in this study the prokaryotic genes iolg susa and glcd which hydrolyse myo inositol pullulan and glycolate respectively were significantly increased in the diatom treatment fig 5 the abundance of planctomycetaceae significantly enhanced in the genes of iolg and cryomorphaceae presence significantly increased the genes glcd and susa fig 6b those prokaryotes may compete against other taxa for carbohydrate use and their increase in abundance in the diatom treatment reflects their competitive strength diatom derived carbohydrates also promote anabolic processes in opportunistic pa prokaryotes for example the relative abundance of planctomycetaceae and cryomorphaceae significantly increased in the mannosyltransferase encoding gene dpm1 fig 6 which is involved in the pathway leading to outer membrane biosynthesis whitfield et al 2020 mannose the substrate of mannosyltransferase has been reported as a crucial component of exudate from the diatom t weissflogii aluwihare and repeta 1999 similarly the relative abundance cryomorphaceae significantly increased in the rhamnosyltransferase encoding gene wbbl fig 6 which is involved in the synthesis of outer cell walls of gram negative bacteria stevenson et al 1994 the substrate rhamnose is a common monosaccharide produced by t weissflogii aluwihare and repeta 1999 corresponding to the increase of wbbl the gene rhaq which encodes the rhamnose import system permease protein also significantly increased fig s11 thus the enrichment of the both abc transporter genes and enzyme encoding genes collectively provided solid evidence that rhamnose was actively transported into the prokaryotes and involved in the biosynthesis process in general planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae all benefited from diatom derived carbohydrates but they appear to specialize on different components of bioreactive organic carbon regarding nitrogen metabolism one glutamine synthetase glna two glutamate dehydrogenases glud1 2 gdha and one carbonic anhydrase cynt were significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment fig s10a organic nitrogen compounds such as glutamine glutamate and cyanate are usually incorporated quickly into proteins by active prokaryotes newsholme et al 2003 palatinszky et al 2015 those organic nitrogen sources are likely derived from the live diatom thalassiosira bender et al 2012 possessing organic nitrogen metabolizing genes the planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae stappiaceae and cryomorphaceae all benefit from diatom derived organic nitrogen sources fig s10b we conclude that organic nitrogen secreted by diatoms attracts and fosters some opportunistic pa prokaryotes thereby shaping the prokaryotic community this conclusion is reinforced by the significantly elevated abc transporter genes that encode glutamate glutamine importing permease proteins glnp peb1a glnh gltk aatm gltl aatp implying that a substantial amount of glutamate glutamine was assimilated by prokaryotes 4 4 mutualistic symbiosis between the planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii facilitated the growth and expansion of the diatom bloom the phycisphaeraceae affiliated with phylum planctomycetes comprised up to 50 of pa prokaryotes in the diatom treatment genome analysis of planctomycetaceae bin p01 suggests that planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii have a close mutualistic association with the diatom providing labile organic matter for the planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange a close physical connection between bacteria and algae is a prerequisite for mutualism de bashan et al 2016 the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 exhibits an intact chemotaxis pathway considered a first step in the attachment of bacteria to algal cells and suggesting an attachment lifestyle sreeramana et al 2006 in this process the receptor kinase chea is stimulated while the stimulatory ligands bind to chemoreceptors at the cell periphery leading to a response at the flagellar motor stock et al 1988 in addition to this well studied chemotaxis mechanism another receptor independent branch of chemotactic signalling linked to sugar uptake through pts was recently discovered neumann et al 2012 this signal emerges from cytoplasmic pts components i e ptsⅰ and frub and transmits directly to the sensory complexes i e chea neumann et al 2012 employing a fructose specific pts the planctomycetaceae bin p01 would be able to accurately locate a diatom cell tracking it along fructose gradients planctomycetes are thought to use phytoplankton released polysaccharides as carbon and energy sources probably by employing a specialized uptake and degradation system boedeker et al 2017 this assumption was supported by our findings that planctomycetaceae bin p01 has many saccharides polyol and lipid abc transporters a fructose specific pts and a sodium dependent transporter for dicarboxylate these transporters are involved in the cellular uptake of carbohydrates produced by t weissflogii baubin et al 2021 gügi et al 2015 notably the multiple sugar abc transporter can potentially uptake nineteen different carbohydrates into the cell many of these sugars e g arabinose glucose mannose rhamnose xylose and cellulose have been reported as major components of the secretions of the diatom t weissflogii gügi et al 2015 thus planctomycetaceae bin p01 is able to import different carbohydrates with high affinity to diatom derived sugars carbohydrate degradation requires the production of ghs some specific ghs genes were identified in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 these are involved in the hydrolysis of the diatom derived carbohydrates for instance gh38 hydrolyzes mannose winchester 1984 and gh9 hydrolyzes cellobiose berghem and pettersson 1973 regarding nitrogen metabolism planctomycetaceae bin p01 is able to utilize organic nitrogen including nitrile glutamine and glutamate notably nitriles are a diverse group of mostly cytotoxic compounds often found in plants egelkamp et al 2017 degrading nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia is not only a detoxification process for both the diatom and bacteria but also provides planctomycetaceae itself carbon and nitrogen sources egelkamp et al 2017 the metabolic properties observed here for planctomycetaceae bin p01 are generally consistent with a previous study where the planctomycetaceae utilized a wide range of organic compounds dedysh and ivanova 2019 but the environmental adaptations in the present study are different and unique to the t weissflogii phycosphere the association of the bacteria with t weissflogii provides many potential benefits to the diatom first planctomycetaceae could provide essential vitamins to their associated phytoplankton the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 contains the key genes encoding the biosynthesis of vitamins b1 b6 b12 and k2 which are all important for the central metabolism of phytoplankton helliwell 2017 for example b12 plays an essential role in the metabolism of amino acids and one carbons while b1 is important for primary carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism bertrand and allen 2012 additionally the diatom is likely to benefit from the bacterial detoxification capabilities because planctomycetaceae bin p01 possesses the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene ahpc tsa which serves as a key antioxidant enzyme and contributes to robust oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance alharbi et al 2019 hydrogen peroxide which is predominantly produced in algal cells during photosynthesis and photorespiration possesses a strong oxidizing potential that can damage a variety of biological molecules petrov and van breusegem 2012 it is therefore an unwelcome by product of normal metabolic processes in aerobic organisms slesak et al 2007 low doses of hydrogen peroxide have been successful in controlling cyanobacteria and brown tide blooms bauzá et al 2014 randhawa et al 2012 however a recent study has shown that heterotrophic bacteria which degrade hydrogen peroxide may protect algae against oxidative stress morris et al 2011 together these results suggest that the close association of the planctomycetaceae to t weissflogii promotes diatom growth and thus perpetuates the re establishment of the bloom 5 conclusion t weissflogii and a carterae populations responded differently when introduced into new environments with the diatom population increasing more than that of the dinoflagellate diatom blooms may have a stronger ability to establish and grow in new locations the introduction of an active algal blooms could be an analog for a pulse of organic matter into a new region or location which can rapidly alter carbon and nitrogen cycling in the water column unlike phyto detritus algal blooms may produce massive amounts of bioreactive organic matter kamalanathan et al 2019 the surge of these carbohydrates and organic nitrogen sources may shape pa prokaryotic community composition our metagenomic analyzes demonstrated that a variety of labile carbohydrates and nitrogen sources were actively transported into the cell and quickly utilized by some opportunistic pa prokaryotes such as the planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae further examination of the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 suggests that the planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii are likely associated in a mutualistic relationship with the diatom providing organic matter for planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange the proposed symbiosis facilitates the growth of the diatom and pa bacteria thus improving the chances of successful inoculation and establishment of an algal bloom given the increasing frequency and severity of estuarine diatom blooms microbial processes that respond to a growing bloom may be responsible for shaping prokaryotic communities declaration of competing

15935,harmful algal blooms habs may quickly travel and inoculate new water bodies via currents and runoff in estuaries the role of in situ prokaryotic communities in the re establishment and growth of inoculated algal blooms remains unknown a novel on board incubation experiment was employed to simulate the sudden surge of algal blooms to new estuarine waters and reveal possible outcomes a dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae and a diatom species thalassiosira weissflogii which had bloomed in the pearl river estuary pre area were cultured to bloom densities and reintroduced back into pre natural seawaters the diatom showed better adaptation ability to the new environment and increased significantly after the incubation simultaneously particle attached pa prokaryotic community structure was strongly influenced by adding of the diatom with some opportunistic prokaryotes significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment whereas the dinoflagellate population did not increase following incubation and their pa prokaryotic community showed no significant differences relative to the control metagenomic analyzes revealed that labile carbohydrates and organic nitrogen produced by the diatom contributed to the surge of certain pa prokaryotes genomic properties of a bacteria strain which is affiliated with genus gmd16e07 planctomycetaceae and comprised up to 50 of pa prokaryotes in the diatom treatment was described here for the first time notably the association of planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii likely represents symbiotic mutualism with the diatom providing organic matter for planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins and detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange therefore the close association between planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii promoted the growth of both populations and eventually facilitated the diatom bloom establishment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bloom population dynamics

and climate change berry et al 2015 cao et al 2017 phlips et al 2015 algae and prokaryotes commonly interact in aquatic systems and algal blooms may alter the prokaryotic community and its ecological functions camarena gómez et al 2021 cui et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated bloom stage specific host specificity in algal associated prokaryotic communities for different algal species thus microbial behavior and succession patterns in phycosphere microenvironments may contribute to algal bloom formation and longevity alavi et al 2001 amin et al 2012 choi et al 2018 green et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 in addition modern omics studies have provided evidence of a linkage between changes in prokaryotic community functional genes and shifting organic matter cycles throughout different bloom stages brussaard et al 2017 durham et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 understanding the interactions between algae and associated prokaryotic communities will help clarify the mechanisms that mediate algal bloom dynamics choi et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ramanan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 the study of algal bacterial relationship is gaining attention often focusing on bloom management and prevention coyne et al 2022 yong et al 2021 however prokaryotic functional profiles and their biogeochemical potential in algal bloom processes remain poorly understood this study aims to examine algal bacterial association under in situ bloom re establishment conditions in estuarine waters planktonic algal blooms may be transported over long distances via currents and runoff paerl et al 2018 for example a toxic dinoflagellate bloomed on the coast of north carolina after the seed population was carried by the gulf stream over 800 km from the source bloom site tester et al 1991 a massive phytoplankton bloom initiated in the great barrier reef lagoon spread 150 km in nine days via a river plume brodie et al 2010 algal bloom expansion could rapidly change local water column physico chemical factors such as turbidity dissolved organic carbon nutrients and dissolved oxygen it may also induce a sudden shift of prokaryotic community structure and function attempts have been made to study prokaryotic community succession during algal blooms in fixed stations berry et al 2017 cui et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 2018 some in situ algal bloom monitoring has confirmed prokaryotic community succession during bloom events raising the possibility that specific prokaryotic populations may occupy transitory ecological niches associated with particular bloom stages choi et al 2018 wemheuer et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 however few studies have examined the impacts of algal bloom phase on the local prokaryotic community this is because it is difficult to precisely predict algal bloom onset and progression in a natural open water system allen et al 2008 stumpf et al 2009 in this study a novel method was employed to simulate the inoculation of estuarine algal blooms to new waters comparative incubation experiments were carried out at four stations in the pearl river estuary pre to unveil the effects of prokaryotic community composition and function changes on the algal bloom re establishment and growth the pre also known as the great bay area is one of the most urbanized and populated estuaries in the world like other estuarine systems harmful algal blooms habs are a recurring problem in the pre with 337 habs mostly dinoflagellates and diatoms reported from 1980 to 2016 li et al 2019 the pre has an annual average discharge of 10 000 cubic meters per second and is subject to monsoon seasonality with a strong northeasterly season in winter and a weak southwesterly season in summer pan et al 2020 the complex energetic circulation and high river discharge at ebb tide can lead to river plumes in which buoyant masses of brackish water travel on top of dense ocean water with a persistent surface lens traveling considerable distances devlin and pan 2018 thus algal blooms formed at pre are likely to be transported to the adjacent outer coastal region within few hours or days to test what happens to the prokaryotic community when the seeds of a bloom are delivered to a coastal region one dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae and one diatom species thalassiosira weissflogii which had bloomed in the pre area were selected and cultured to bloom densities in the lab li et al 2013 lu et al 2014 they were then introduced and incubated in natural seawater at different stations to simulate the quick invasion of algal blooms to different locations in an estuarine system this study aimed to 1 test whether different algal blooms would re establish when they are introduced to new water bodies 2 evaluate the potential effects of the transplanted algal blooms on prokaryotic community abundance composition and function 3 identify the key prokaryotic species that respond to the algal bloom and unveil the interspecies interaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collections this study was carried out from august 18 25th 2020 during a cruise in the pre surface seawater 0 5 m depth was collected from sampling stations indicated in fig 1 a using a 5 l polymethyl methacrylate water sampler the 3 µm pore size was used for distinguishing free living fl from particle attached pa prokaryotes liu et al 2019 schmidt et al 2016 teeling et al 2012 water collected from each station was prefiltered with 200 µm mesh to exclude mesozooplankton and then filtered through 3 µm collecting pa prokaryotes and 0 2 µm collecting fl prokaryotes polycarbonate pc membranes millipore successively membranes were kept at 80 c until dna extraction samples n 3 for flow cytometry analysis 1 8 ml were also collected at each station they were preserved with 0 5 buffered paraformaldehyde v v final concentration and stored in a 80 c freezer until analysis water temperature salinity and ph were measured using a ysi multiprobe sensor which was calibrated before each sampling water samples n 3 for inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis were prefiltered with gf f membranes and collected in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tubes at each station and treatment nutrient concentrations including inorganic forms of nitrate nitrite ammonia phosphate and silicate were determined using a segmented continuous flow nutrient autoanalyzer seal aa3 following the manufacture s methods doc was measured using total organic carbon analyzers shimadzu toc l series utilizing the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method 2 2 incubation experiments setup and sample collections incubation experiments were conducted at selected medium salinity stations s10 and s17 with salinities of 23 and 25 respectively and high salinity stations s15 and s19 with salinities of 29 and 31 respectively fig 1 for incubation experiments surface seawater was prefiltered with 200 µm mesh to exclude larger zooplankton three treatments were setup at each station they were seawater control dinoflagellate treatment inoculated with a carterae and diatom treatment inoculated with t weissflogii at the beginning of the incubation experiments the densities of inoculated a carterae ranged from 1 103 to 1 104 cells ml 1 and the densities of t weissflogii varied from 1 104 to 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 2 a these inoculum concentrations were selected based on natural bloom densities recorded in the previous studies where the highest diatom bloom density was an order of magnitude higher than the dinoflagellate bloom gárate lizárraga et al 2019 seebah et al 2014 the relative abundances of background phytoplankton were low in all treatments table s2 fig s2 experimental densities were analogous to natural blooms where bloom species dominated phytoplankton communities the cell densities of inoculated t weissflogii were 1 15 to 5 39 times higher than that of a carterae at the onset of experiments and we acknowledge a possible bias of different initial inoculum total cell densities when comparing dinoflagellate and diatom results both a carterae and t weissflogii were precultured in the lab using 1 l pc bottles using guillard s f 2 medium at 25 c with a 14 10 light dark cycle hoff and snell 2007 both algal cultures were in the exponential growth phase and acclimated to 29 c before experiments at each station cultures were washed gently through a 5 µm mesh pc membrane millipore with 0 2 µm prefiltered in situ seawater to remove the growth medium fig 1b washed algal cultures were then resuspended gently using a pasteur pipet with 200 µm prefiltered in situ seawater fig 1b both a carterae and t weissflogii were precultured at two salinities 25 and 30 at the stations with salinity near 25 s10 and s17 algae precultured at a salinity of 25 were added at the stations with salinity near 30 s15 and s19 algae precultured at a salinity of 30 were added incubation experiments were performed in 1 l pc bottles these bottles were soaked in 10 hcl nanopure water for 24 h and rinsed 3 times with ultra pure water before the experiments three replicates n 3 were run for each of the three treatments during incubation pc bottles were submerged in a 1 5 m 1 m 0 5 m deckside water bath with flow through ambient surface water maintaining the same temperature as the oceanographic station in situ water column light conditions were simulated with neutral density screening after 48 h of incubation 500 ml of water from each bottle was filtered through 3 and 0 2 µm pc membranes successively membranes were kept at 80 c until dna extraction water samples n 3 for nutrient analyzes were prefiltered through gf f membranes and collected in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tubes after incubation samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected using the methods described above phytoplankton samples 15 ml for cell counts were also collected from incubation bottles before and after the incubation period and preserved with 1 lugol s iodine solution 2 3 flow cytometry analysis of prokaryotic abundance to determine prokaryotic abundance samples were analyzed via beckman coulter cytoflex lx flow cytometer beckman coulter indianapolis in united states for total prokaryotic cell abundance measurement water samples were diluted 10 times using 1 tris edta buffer sigma aldrich molecular grade ph 8 0 nucleic acid stain sybr green i was added to each sample at a final dilution of 1 10 000 and kept in darkness for 15 min at 37 c marie et al 1997 5 µl yellowish green fluorescent beads polyscience warrington pa united states were then added to each sample as an internal standard for autotrophic prokaryotic cell abundance measurement samples were neither diluted nor stained all preprepared samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 0 25 ml s 1 for 1 min the software cytexpert 2 1 beckman coulter indianapolis in united states was used to analyze the flow cytometric data heterotrophic prokaryote abundance was calculated by subtracting the number of autotrophic prokaryotes from total prokaryotic cell abundance in each sample 2 4 genomic dna

and sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform the 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed using the microbial ecology community software mothur following the standard operating procedure described by schloss et al 2009 first tags and primers were trimmed and then sequences with an average quality score below 20 and lengths shorter than 300 bp were removed sequences were then aligned against the silva version 138 reference database chimeras were analyzed using the chimera uchime command and removed high quality sequences were identified using the silva database sequences identified as chloroplasts mitochondria cyanobacteria or unknown were removed the remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at cut off values of 3 singletons were removed using the

table s1 in general surface water ph 7 75 8 50 and salinity 0 01 31 86 increased from upstream to downstream stations inorganic nutrient levels including silica 0 1890 5 7678 mg si l 1 phosphate 0

coastal water doc concentrations were highly variable among stations ranging from 1 58 to 11 17 mg l 1 heterotrophic prokaryote abundance in surface water ranged from 0 89 to 2 87 106 cells ml 1 according to flow cytometry analysis table s1 the nmds analysis showed a clear spatial variation of prokaryotic communities in the pre seawater fig s1 the fl prokaryotic communities were clustered into two distinct groups which were upstream s2 to s11 and downstream clusters s12 to s20 respectively fig s1a and s1b inorganic nutrient levels were correlated to the upstream cluster p 0 05 and salinity and ph were correlated to the downstream cluster p 0 05 fig s1a the pa prokaryotic communities were clustered into four groups fig s1c silica nitrate and nitrite concentrations were strongly correlated to the cluster composed of s2 s5 and s6 p 0 05 but the rest of the clusters could not be fully explained by water quality variations fig s1c and s1d 3 2 the algal and prokaryotic growth and nutrients change after incubation experiments a carterae and t weissflogii had distinct responses when they were introduced to pre the densities of a carterae remained the same before and after the incubation at s10 but decreased significantly at s17 s15 and s19 p 0 01 fig 2 meanwhile t weissflogii increased significantly at medium salinity stations s10 p 0 01 s17 p 0 05 and showed no significant change at high salinity stations s15 and s19 fig 2 the cell densities of background algae were at least an order of magnitude lower than our algal treatments at the start of the incubation experiments table s2 the relative abundance of inoculated versus background algae showed contrary change pattern in all experiments except the diatom treatment at s19 fig s2 this suggested that the inoculated algae and background algae could be competitors with one another in the dinoflagellate treatments the relative abundance of a carterae only increased at s10 fig s2a at the rest of the incubation stations a carterae were out paced by increasing background diatoms densities fig s2b s2c and s2d in contrast the abundances of t weissflogii were high 95 at all incubation stations they significantly increased at s10 and s17 and out paced background diatoms fig s2a and s2b but t weissflogii significantly decreased at s15 where background dinoflagellates increased fig s2c the concentrations of silica nitrate and nitrite significantly decreased after incubation in the algal treatments when compared to the control fig s3b s3c and s3d based on spearman correlation analyzes the change of silica nitrate ammonium and phosphate concentrations were strongly inversely correlated to the change of t weissflogii cell densities p 0 05 rho 0 7 fig s4b and the decrease of nitrite was strongly positively correlated with the increase of background diatoms in the dinoflagellate treatments p 0 05 rho 0 7 fig s4a thus the decrease of inorganic nutrient concentrations is likely due to the fast growing diatom populations heterotrophic prokaryote abundance increased significantly in dinoflagellate treatments at s10 p 0 01 and s15 p 0 05 and also increased significantly in diatom treatments at s17 p 0 0001 s15 p 0 001 and s19 p 0 001 fig s5 3 3 prokaryotic community composition in diatom and dinoflagellate treatments the ace and shannon s diversity index h for both fl and pa prokaryotes were not significantly different between the control and either algal treatment fig s6 the fl prokaryotic communities did not show clear clustering in the response to the diatom and dinoflagellate treatments except a cluster observed in diatom treatment at s17 fig 3 a b however the pa prokaryote communities were clustered into two groups fig 3c pa prokaryotic composition was strongly influenced by the presence of diatoms but not by the addition of dinoflagellates fig 3c d at s15 planctomycetaceae and stappiaceae became more abundant in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig 4 a at s17 the relative abundance of planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae stappiaceae cryomorphaceae and ns9 marine group significantly increased in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig 4b these results suggest that planctomycetaceae and stappiaceae in the pa prokaryotic community benefited from the diatom cells at the otu level planctomycetaceae was mainly affiliated with e otu2 which was identified as genus sm1a02 family phycisphaeraceae based on the silva database however we further blasted the representative sequence of e otu2 against the nr database and the result showed that it is highly similar with genus gmd16e07 similarity 99 2 ncbi accession no ay162118 which is an unclassified planctomycetaceae zengler et al 2002 fig s7 stappiaceae was mainly composed of e otu12 which was identified as unclassified labrenzia fig s7 dinoflagellates had relatively little impact on the pa prokaryotic community and only the vibrionaceae significantly increased in relative abundance s15 p 0 05 fig 4a 3 4 metagenomic sequencing statistics to further explore the effects of the diatom treatment on the potential function of the pa prokaryotic community a metagenomic approach was employed to analyze pa prokaryote communities in the diatom treatment and control at s17 the numbers of paired end raw reads sequenced within each of the metagenomic samples ranged from 15 7 to 72 4 million resulting in 674 241 1 414 602 orfs table s4 between 26 85 34 02 37 21 45 50 and 0 51 0 61 of the orfs in each sequence library were annotated by the kegg cog and cazy public databases respectively table s4 in total the predicted genes from assembled contigs were assigned to 492 kegg pathways at the third level among these nitrogen metabolism cazymes and atp binding cassette transporters abc transporters were investigated in detail in general the tpm abundances of cazymes and abc transporters showed no significant difference between the diatom and control treatments but nitrogen metabolism was significantly reduced in the diatom treatment p 0 05 fig s9 3 5 carbohydrate metabolism of particle attached pa prokaryotic communities in the diatom treatment to compare the major carbohydrate metabolism processes between the diatom and control treatments the predicted orfs in each sample were annotated via the cazymes database we observed that 110 cazymes related genes were significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment table s5 these genes belong to five cazymes families including auxiliary activities aas 4 genes carbohydrate binding modules cbms 7 genes carbohydrate esterases ces 13 genes glycoside hydrolases ghs 30 genes and glycosyl transferases gts 56 genes table s5 to unveil the major carbohydrate metabolism differences of the pa prokaryotic communities between the diatom and the control treatments the top 20 abundant cazymes related genes which were significantly enhanced with fold change over 2 in the diatom treatments were examined in terms of taxonomic compositions fig 5 and 6 a ghs are key enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds of complex carbohydrates five of the top 20 abundant enzyme encoding genes belong to the ghs family which catalyze the hydrolysis of pullulan susa glycosides tc gph inositol iolg peptidoglycan chitodextrins acm and maltose mapa fig 5 planctomycetes which is mainly composed of

enzymes that catalyze the de o or de n acetylation of glycans and substituted saccharides three of the top 20 abundant enzyme encoding genes belong to the ces family which included a

classified as gt2 four as gt4 and one as gt9 fig 5 those gts families constitute enzymes that are involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides all eleven forementioned gts encoding genes were annotated as cell membrane envelope biogenesis in cog pathways table s5 suggesting that the diatom presence could promote pa prokaryotic reproduction regarding the taxonomic classification of these gt related genes planctomycetes un mainly composed of planctomycetaceae contributed higher relative abundance in cruc dpm1 and sqd2 in the diatom treatment relative to the control student s t test p 0 05

diatom treatment relative to the control glycolate is one of the most abundant sources of organic carbon in the ocean and the secretion of which by marine phytoplankton results in an estimated global annual flux of one petagram schada von borzyskowski et al 2019 flavobacteriales un mainly composed of cryomorphaceae fig s8 contributed to a higher relative abundance of the glcd gene in the diatom treatment than the control student s t test p 0 05 fig 6b 3 6 nitrogen metabolism of particle attached pa prokaryotic communities in the diatom treatment four nitrogen metabolism related genes were significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment including one glutamine synthetase encoding gene glna two glutamate dehydrogenases encoding genes glud1 2 and a gene encoding carbonic anhydrase cynt

substrates across membranes twenty nine abc transporter encoding genes annotated as substrate importers were significantly enhanced in diatom treatment student s t test p 0 05 fig s11 substrates

planctomycetaceae one high quality genome bin p01 i e completeness 97 contamination 0 01 evaluated using checkm parks et al 2015 which was affiliated with the family of planctomycetaceae was obtained from metagenomic datasets and further analyzed in detail the abundance of this heterotrophic bacteria was greatly enhanced in the diatom treatment table s6 fig 7 the 16s rrna gene sequence of the planctomycetaceae bin p01 showed 99 7 similarity with planctomycete gmd16e07 ncbi accession no ay162118 1 a representative strain of planctomycetaceae genus gmd16e07 to our knowledge our planctomycetaceae bin p01 is the first genome of genus gmd16e07 the planctomycetaceae bin p01 genome consisted of 24 contigs with a total length of 3 91mbp and 3476 genes were predicted from the genome table s6 the gc content of the chromosomal dna is 65 55 table s6 most genes essential for chemotaxis were identified in the genome they included the genes encoding the chemotaxis family sensor kinase chea chemotaxis protein methyltransferase cher chemotaxis proteins chex chey mota and motb and flagellar motor switch proteins flig flin and flim fig 7 indicating their strong response to chemical stimuli nine abc transporters were identified from the genome only the abc transporters that have the genes encoding the substrate binding protein permease protein and atp binding protein recovered in the genome were calculated fig 7 among these abc transporters a multiple sugar transport was found which potentially could import nineteen different carbohydrates into the cell fig 7 also one fructose specific phosphotransferase system pts was found in this genome it imports and phosphorylates fructose into fructose 1 phosphate via a fructose specific subunit frub and a phosphoenolpyruvate protein phosphotransferase ptsi and then further phosphorylates into fructose 1 6 bisphosphate via a 1 phosphofructokinase ptsk which eventually involves the central carbohydrate metabolism pathway suggesting its strong ability to import and utilize fructose fig 7 in addition to the fructose specific pts system the gene of ptsn which encodes a type ii enzyme in pts system was found in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 this is a complex and diversified group of phosphotransferase proteins involved in controlling the intake of certain carbohydrates e g glucose and other regulatory functions fig 7 chavarría et al 2012 in addition one sodium dependent dicarboxylate transporter belonging to the solute carrier family 13 was found in the genome in terms of carbohydrate metabolism the genes encoding metabolic pathways common for chemoorganotrophic bacteria such as glycolysis the citrate cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway were all present in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 genome fig 7 this strongly suggests they may be able to utilize complex carbohydrates the genome encoded 1 cbm 11 ghs and 10 gts which were affiliated with 1 9 and 7 cazyme families respectively fig 7 the planctomycetaceae bin p01 was able to use both inorganic nitrate nitrite and ammonia and organic glutamine glutamate and nitrile sources of nitrogen fig 7 notably one gene encoding alkyl hydroperoxide reductase namely ahpc tsa presents in the genome this gene is reported to reduce a wide range of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species alharbi et al 2019 we also scrutinized the vitamin biosynthesis pathways the key genes encoding vitamin b1 b6 b12 and k2 biosynthesis were found in the genome fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 the diatom and dinoflagellate blooms showed different responses to the translocation experiment diatom thalassiosira weissflogii densities increased significantly when they were exposed to ambient water conditions at different pre stations fig 2 whereas dinoflagellate amphidinium carterae densities did not significantly increase this may be due to diatoms generally having higher tolerances to environmental variability relative to dinoflagellates hill et al 2001 litchman 2007 recent omics studies unveiled adaptive mechanisms in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana under shifting environmental conditions including sudden deficiencies in nitrogen and phosphorus chen et al 2018 hockin et al 2012 silicon limitation mock et al 2008 and salinity and light fluctuations kettles et al 2014 employing a range of strategies to cope with various stress factors it is easier for this diatom to acclimate to new environments muhseen et al 2015 as a group diatoms tend to be r strategists quickly assimilating new nutrients and achieving high biomasses in contrast dinoflagellates are usually k strategists blooming slower than diatoms wasmund et al 2017 t weissflogii densities were strongly correlated with a decrease of inorganic nutrients in the incubation experiments spearman correlation fig s4 the highest specific growth rate of t weissflogii recorded in the literature is 1 24 0 025 day 1 garcia et al 2012 which is higher than that of a carterae 0 93 0 13 day 1 li et al 2016 therefore published growth rates for the species in this study support the idea that diatom blooms might be expected to increase more rapidly than the dinoflagellate under the right environmental conditions in addition to the different physiology properties between t weissflogii and a carterae other conditions could also influence the re establishment of the diatom bloom for instance background algae could be competitors to bloom species fig s4 besides in situ seawater conditions could also influence their response to a new environment in the present study we observed that t weissflogii only significantly increased at s10 and s17 where the salinities were around 25 and in situ concentrations of silica and nitrate were relatively high compare to s15 and s19 table s1 this is consistent with previous studies where t weissflogii had higher growth rates at a salinity of 25 compared to rates at 30 garcia et al 2012 and those growth rates had strong positive correlations with nitrate and silica concentrations de la rocha et al 2010 li et al 2017 moreover a long term phytoplankton monitoring study in the pre showed that the proportion of diatoms have progressively increased in the pre over the past two decades due to increasing anthropogenic nitrate inputs cheung et al 2021 considering of the demonstrated ability of diatom blooms to establish and grow and the increasing presence of anthropogenic nutrients in the pre it should not be surprising if diatom blooms are increasing in frequency and intensity in this region 4 2 the diatom bloom had strong effects on the pa prokaryotic community in the present study algal bloom inoculation had a significant influence on the pa prokaryotic community but little impact on the fl prokaryotic community fig 3 other studies have found that algae and pa prokaryotes are coupled in coastal and aquatic systems bachmann et al 2018 fontanez et al 2015 liu et al 2019 rieck et al 2015 rösel and grossart 2012 we showed that the diatom bloom had stronger effects on the pa prokaryotic community compared to the dinoflagellate bloom fig 3c d this could be due in part to the active growth phase of t weissflogii with substantial extracellular polymeric substance eps production gügi et al 2015 the primary source of labile organic matter for surface ocean heterotrophic bacteria is phytoplankton ferrer gonzález et al 2021 and maximum exportation of eps usually occurs in the algal exponential growth phase staats et al 1999 field observations have confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria tend to follow natural algal blooms sperling et al 2017 teeling et al 2012 although a carterae is also an eps producer mandal et al 2011 we speculate that the lack of response of pa prokaryotes in the dinoflagellate treatments may be due to the latter being in an inactive growth phase after inoculation with minimal eps production 4 3 diatom derived carbohydrates and organic nitrogen sources shaped particle attached pa prokaryotic community composition in the diatom treatment environment specific responses of the pa prokaryotic community in the diatom treatment are likely due to their adaptive functionality and underlying genetic properties the pa prokaryotes contain genes enabling a variety of metabolic capabilities which are thought to equip cells to take advantage of patches of organic matter to grow rapidly during blooms luo and moran 2015 therefore the pa prokaryotic community structure is potentially influenced by substrate availability and particle quality bachmann et al 2018 yung et al 2016 in this study we found that the introduction of a diatom bloom shaped pa prokaryotic community composition and altered their carbon and nitrogen metabolic properties the significant increase of prokaryotic cazymes related genes results from the presence of specific carbohydrates produced and released by the diatom some opportunistic pa prokaryotes e g planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae benefit more from these diatom derived carbohydrates than other taxa figs 5 and 6 published studies have shown that thalassiosira is able to extrude myo inositol kroth et al 2008 pullulan dalgic et al 2019 and glycolate schada von borzyskowski et al 2019 in this study the prokaryotic genes iolg susa and glcd which hydrolyse myo inositol pullulan and glycolate respectively were significantly increased in the diatom treatment fig 5 the abundance of planctomycetaceae significantly enhanced in the genes of iolg and cryomorphaceae presence significantly increased the genes glcd and susa fig 6b those prokaryotes may compete against other taxa for carbohydrate use and their increase in abundance in the diatom treatment reflects their competitive strength diatom derived carbohydrates also promote anabolic processes in opportunistic pa prokaryotes for example the relative abundance of planctomycetaceae and cryomorphaceae significantly increased in the mannosyltransferase encoding gene dpm1 fig 6 which is involved in the pathway leading to outer membrane biosynthesis whitfield et al 2020 mannose the substrate of mannosyltransferase has been reported as a crucial component of exudate from the diatom t weissflogii aluwihare and repeta 1999 similarly the relative abundance cryomorphaceae significantly increased in the rhamnosyltransferase encoding gene wbbl fig 6 which is involved in the synthesis of outer cell walls of gram negative bacteria stevenson et al 1994 the substrate rhamnose is a common monosaccharide produced by t weissflogii aluwihare and repeta 1999 corresponding to the increase of wbbl the gene rhaq which encodes the rhamnose import system permease protein also significantly increased fig s11 thus the enrichment of the both abc transporter genes and enzyme encoding genes collectively provided solid evidence that rhamnose was actively transported into the prokaryotes and involved in the biosynthesis process in general planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae all benefited from diatom derived carbohydrates but they appear to specialize on different components of bioreactive organic carbon regarding nitrogen metabolism one glutamine synthetase glna two glutamate dehydrogenases glud1 2 gdha and one carbonic anhydrase cynt were significantly enhanced in the diatom treatment fig s10a organic nitrogen compounds such as glutamine glutamate and cyanate are usually incorporated quickly into proteins by active prokaryotes newsholme et al 2003 palatinszky et al 2015 those organic nitrogen sources are likely derived from the live diatom thalassiosira bender et al 2012 possessing organic nitrogen metabolizing genes the planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae stappiaceae and cryomorphaceae all benefit from diatom derived organic nitrogen sources fig s10b we conclude that organic nitrogen secreted by diatoms attracts and fosters some opportunistic pa prokaryotes thereby shaping the prokaryotic community this conclusion is reinforced by the significantly elevated abc transporter genes that encode glutamate glutamine importing permease proteins glnp peb1a glnh gltk aatm gltl aatp implying that a substantial amount of glutamate glutamine was assimilated by prokaryotes 4 4 mutualistic symbiosis between the planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii facilitated the growth and expansion of the diatom bloom the phycisphaeraceae affiliated with phylum planctomycetes comprised up to 50 of pa prokaryotes in the diatom treatment genome analysis of planctomycetaceae bin p01 suggests that planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii have a close mutualistic association with the diatom providing labile organic matter for the planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange a close physical connection between bacteria and algae is a prerequisite for mutualism de bashan et al 2016 the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 exhibits an intact chemotaxis pathway considered a first step in the attachment of bacteria to algal cells and suggesting an attachment lifestyle sreeramana et al 2006 in this process the receptor kinase chea is stimulated while the stimulatory ligands bind to chemoreceptors at the cell periphery leading to a response at the flagellar motor stock et al 1988 in addition to this well studied chemotaxis mechanism another receptor independent branch of chemotactic signalling linked to sugar uptake through pts was recently discovered neumann et al 2012 this signal emerges from cytoplasmic pts components i e ptsⅰ and frub and transmits directly to the sensory complexes i e chea neumann et al 2012 employing a fructose specific pts the planctomycetaceae bin p01 would be able to accurately locate a diatom cell tracking it along fructose gradients planctomycetes are thought to use phytoplankton released polysaccharides as carbon and energy sources probably by employing a specialized uptake and degradation system boedeker et al 2017 this assumption was supported by our findings that planctomycetaceae bin p01 has many saccharides polyol and lipid abc transporters a fructose specific pts and a sodium dependent transporter for dicarboxylate these transporters are involved in the cellular uptake of carbohydrates produced by t weissflogii baubin et al 2021 gügi et al 2015 notably the multiple sugar abc transporter can potentially uptake nineteen different carbohydrates into the cell many of these sugars e g arabinose glucose mannose rhamnose xylose and cellulose have been reported as major components of the secretions of the diatom t weissflogii gügi et al 2015 thus planctomycetaceae bin p01 is able to import different carbohydrates with high affinity to diatom derived sugars carbohydrate degradation requires the production of ghs some specific ghs genes were identified in the planctomycetaceae bin p01 these are involved in the hydrolysis of the diatom derived carbohydrates for instance gh38 hydrolyzes mannose winchester 1984 and gh9 hydrolyzes cellobiose berghem and pettersson 1973 regarding nitrogen metabolism planctomycetaceae bin p01 is able to utilize organic nitrogen including nitrile glutamine and glutamate notably nitriles are a diverse group of mostly cytotoxic compounds often found in plants egelkamp et al 2017 degrading nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia is not only a detoxification process for both the diatom and bacteria but also provides planctomycetaceae itself carbon and nitrogen sources egelkamp et al 2017 the metabolic properties observed here for planctomycetaceae bin p01 are generally consistent with a previous study where the planctomycetaceae utilized a wide range of organic compounds dedysh and ivanova 2019 but the environmental adaptations in the present study are different and unique to the t weissflogii phycosphere the association of the bacteria with t weissflogii provides many potential benefits to the diatom first planctomycetaceae could provide essential vitamins to their associated phytoplankton the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 contains the key genes encoding the biosynthesis of vitamins b1 b6 b12 and k2 which are all important for the central metabolism of phytoplankton helliwell 2017 for example b12 plays an essential role in the metabolism of amino acids and one carbons while b1 is important for primary carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism bertrand and allen 2012 additionally the diatom is likely to benefit from the bacterial detoxification capabilities because planctomycetaceae bin p01 possesses the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene ahpc tsa which serves as a key antioxidant enzyme and contributes to robust oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance alharbi et al 2019 hydrogen peroxide which is predominantly produced in algal cells during photosynthesis and photorespiration possesses a strong oxidizing potential that can damage a variety of biological molecules petrov and van breusegem 2012 it is therefore an unwelcome by product of normal metabolic processes in aerobic organisms slesak et al 2007 low doses of hydrogen peroxide have been successful in controlling cyanobacteria and brown tide blooms bauzá et al 2014 randhawa et al 2012 however a recent study has shown that heterotrophic bacteria which degrade hydrogen peroxide may protect algae against oxidative stress morris et al 2011 together these results suggest that the close association of the planctomycetaceae to t weissflogii promotes diatom growth and thus perpetuates the re establishment of the bloom 5 conclusion t weissflogii and a carterae populations responded differently when introduced into new environments with the diatom population increasing more than that of the dinoflagellate diatom blooms may have a stronger ability to establish and grow in new locations the introduction of an active algal blooms could be an analog for a pulse of organic matter into a new region or location which can rapidly alter carbon and nitrogen cycling in the water column unlike phyto detritus algal blooms may produce massive amounts of bioreactive organic matter kamalanathan et al 2019 the surge of these carbohydrates and organic nitrogen sources may shape pa prokaryotic community composition our metagenomic analyzes demonstrated that a variety of labile carbohydrates and nitrogen sources were actively transported into the cell and quickly utilized by some opportunistic pa prokaryotes such as the planctomycetaceae rhodobacteraceae and cryomorphaceae further examination of the genome of planctomycetaceae bin p01 suggests that the planctomycetaceae and t weissflogii are likely associated in a mutualistic relationship with the diatom providing organic matter for planctomycetaceae and the bacteria supplying vitamins detoxifying nitriles and hydrogen peroxides in exchange the proposed symbiosis facilitates the growth of the diatom and pa bacteria thus improving the chances of successful inoculation and establishment of an algal bloom given the increasing frequency and severity of estuarine diatom blooms microbial processes that respond to a growing bloom may be responsible for shaping prokaryotic communities declaration of competing

15936,in this study micropollutants in wastewater effluents were prioritized by monitoring the composition of influent and effluent wastewater by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms non target screening nts analysis the study shows how important data pre processing and filtering of raw data is to produce reliable nts data for comparison of compounds between many samples 37 wastewater samples analyzed at different times triplicate injections were critical for reducing the number of false positive detections intensity drift corrections within and between batches analyzed months apart made peak intensities comparable across samples adjustment of the feature detection threshold was shown to be important due to large intensity variations for low abundance compounds across batches when the threshold correction cut offs or the filtering of relevant compounds by the occurrence frequency were too stringent a high number of false positive transformation products tps were reported we also showed that matrix effect correction by internal standards can over or under correct the intensity for unknown compounds thus the tic matrix effect correction was shown as an additional tool for a retention time dependent matrix effect correction after these preprocessing and filtering steps we identified 78 prioritized compounds of which 36 were persistent compounds defined as compounds with a reduction in peak intensity between influent and effluent wastewater 50 and 13 compounds were defined as tps because they occurred solely in the effluent samples some examples of persistent compounds are 1 3 diphenylguanidine amisulpride and the human metabolites from losartan verapamil and methadone to our knowledge nine of the identified tps have not been previously described in effluent wastewater the tps were derived from metoprolol fexofenadine deet and losartan the screening of all identified compounds in effluent samples from eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps showed that potential drugs of abuse anti psychotic and anti depressant drugs were predominant in the capital city region whereas the anti epileptic agents and agricultural pesticides were dominant in more rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords non target screening wastewater persistent compounds transformation products 1 introduction in the united states and europe alone the number of substances on the market is believed to be around 100 000 chemicals johnson et al 2020 and many of these enter the wastewater system every day these micropollutants have high diversity originating from different sources such as households pharmaceuticals personal care products pcpps food additives industry production chemicals agricultural pesticides and hospitals pharmaceuticals disinfection chemicals margot et al 2015 rogowska et al 2020 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove complex mixtures of human introduced micropollutants and their transformation products tps improving analytical methods are revealing more and more micropollutants occurring in wastewater effluent not only due to the improved detection sensitivities of the instruments but also because complementary analytical methods are used besides the target screening broader screening approaches are used to identify new sources of micropollutants and their tps the broader screening approaches can be divided into two main classes 1 suspect screening and 2 non target screening nts hug et al 2014 suspect screening starts with a list of suspect compounds prioritizing compounds by possible hits and narrowing down with different confidence steps deeb et al 2017 diamanti et al 2019 nts is starting with unknown compounds prioritizing the compounds by their occurrence and intensity nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2015 and identifying the prioritized compounds at the end hug et al 2014 schollée et al 2018 the drawback of the first approach is that compounds that are not on the initial list are overlooked which would be the case for most tps the drawback of the second approach is that too many compounds are included which makes the data processing time demanding and many non sense compounds are included far into the workflow schollée et al 2015 in both cases workflows are often lacking sufficient pre processing and filtering steps to produce reliable data that can be compared with and between large analytical sequences bader et al 2017 schulze et al 2020 these pre processing steps are especially important for comparing occurrence and the increase decrease in concentrations of compounds between samples beckers et al 2020 schollée et al 2021 this study aimed to prioritize persistent micropollutants and tps by a transparent and reliable nts workflow the prioritization was achieved by nts analysis of 37 influent and effluent wastewater samples that required data synchronization across batches analyzed far apart in time and two different sample matrices to provide reliable data for sample comparison the workflow addresses challenges and provides solutions for 1 instrument drifts intra and inter batch 2 correction for compound and retention time dependent matrix effects and 3 correction of the feature detection thresholds between and within analytical batches by overcoming these challenges persistent micropollutants would show no significant decrease in signal from influent to effluent wastewater furthermore tps could be identified by specific mass shifts e g 15 996 da for oxygen attachment between compounds that are significantly more abundant in effluent wastewater compared to influent wastewater in this study nts prioritization for persistent micropollutants and tps was shown for samples from eight wwtps in denmark 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater samples flow proportional 24 h wastewater samples were collected at eight danish wwtps during summer 2020 three wwtps w1 w2 w3 located in municipalities of copenhagen three w4 w5 w6 in the municipality of odense and two w7 w8 in towns of northern funen locations in fig s1 a total of 12 influent and 25 effluent wastewater samples were collected table 1 influent samples were collected after the grid catchment and just before or after w2 and w8 the sand and fat catchment increments of 100 ml were collected flow proportional by the autosampler stationed at the inlet or outlet of each wwtp increments were immediately transferred into glass containers and stored at 4 ⁰c during the whole 24 h sampling period after sampling the composite 24 h samples between 3 and 5 l were transported to the lab for filtration and sample preparation additional information on the wwtps hydraulic retention time sampling dates and removal efficiency of nutrients is listed in tables s1 and s2 2 2 sample preparation and lc esi qtofms analysis the sample preparation and lchrms analysis of the samples are described elsewhere tisler et al 2021 in brief wastewater samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm glass microfiber filter and enriched 500 times relative enrichment factor ref 500 with an automated multi layer solid phase extraction spe system spe 03 from promochrom technologies ltd the high enrichment factor provided the opportunity to use these samples also for ecotoxicology tests unpublished results due to the additional use for ecotoxicology tests no internal standards could be added to the sample prior to enrichment recovery experiments of 30 target analytes log d 1 to 4 in effluent wastewater showed for 90 of the compounds recoveries 80 with 12 standard deviation n 3 however additional losses during enrichment cannot be excluded for the non target compounds the samples were reconstituted in methanol and analyzed with lchrms using a waters acquity uplc with a waters synapt g2 si quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in positive electrospray ionization mode esi mode the gradient program was as follows initial conditions of 99 eluent a milliq h2o 0 1 fa for 1 min followed by a linear increase to 30 eluent b acetonitrile 0 1 fa in 2 min with a further gradient increase to 99 b over 13 min these conditions were kept for 5 min before switching back to the starting conditions 4 min equilibration time to give a total run time of 25 min per sample the samples were acquired in the data independent acquisition mode called mse in mse for each scan a low energy 0 ev and a high energy mass spectrum ramped energy from 10 to 40 ev are produced for compounds with an insufficient number of identified fragments for identification targeted ms ms analysis was conducted in a later run 20 ev the effluent samples were measured at 10 times dilution ref 50 and the influent samples were diluted 50 times ref 10 the injection volume was 2 µl for all samples the influent batch was measured 6 months before the effluent batch in between several samples of different matrices were run on this instrument 2 3 data processing for target workflow as quality control for nts workflow the same samples were analyzed by target screening however the samples were measured at another time and consecutive effluent batch right before influent batch with the lchrms instrument ten target compounds over a retention time range from 3 8 to 7 8 min were used for evaluation the measured intensities were corrected by internal standards is and quantified by external calibrations the target compounds and their corresponding internal standards are listed in table s3 the linearity and concentration range of the calibration was evaluated by a pre screening for effluent samples ref 50 the calibration points were between 0 05 and 2 µg l 7 calibration points and for the influent samples ref 10 between 0 2 and 10 µg l 7 calibration points the extent of compound degradation was calculated based on the measured concentrations for target screening and based on the peak height itself for the nts workflow 2 4 methods for the nts workflow 2 4 1 data pre processing with unifi and r for nts workflow lchrms data were obtained in continuum mode peak and compound detection were carried out in a retention time window from 1 to 17 min using the unifi software from waters isotope and adduct clustering for h na k and nh4 was done by the unifi software keeping the adduct with the highest peak intensity furthermore a peak height threshold was set where peaks were considered with a response higher than 200 for effluent and a response higher than 600 for influent samples the values were chosen due to practical reasons lower thresholds would result in more than 50 000 compounds per sample which slowed down the processing the peak lists of the precursor compounds were exported as lcs file each sample as one file and processed further using an in house r script https sid erda dk cgi sid ls py share id e618gcdcs6 the detected peaks were matched across samples according to the absolute difference in both m z and rt the group of similar peaks was formed with detected peaks that were no more than 0 01 da and 0 08 min apart groups that did not occur in all replicates were removed from the final list so for compounds to be considered further they needed to occur in 3 out of 3 sample replicates if the resulting group included both blanks and other samples it was removed from further analysis if the sample intensities were not significantly different to those measured in blanks t test with 5 significance level groups containing only one blank remained in the list as long as in a second filtering step the intensity in at least one sample was more than 50 times higher than the blank intensity the final list of compounds was made by merging influent and effluent samples with the same matching algorithm as within the batches 0 01 da and 0 08 min 2 4 2 quality control qc samples for inter and intra batch intensity correction between and within batches drift correction was performed using three sets of quality control qc samples one set for the effluent samples qc effluent consisted of an equal mixture of all 25 effluent samples at ref 50 a second set for the influent samples qc influent consisted of an equal mixture of 12 influent samples at ref 10 and a third set super quality control sqc sample consisted of a 1 1 mixture of the qc effluent and qc influent three sets of qc sqc were needed in this study due to comparison of different matrices two qc as well as comparing samples running in sequences at different times sqc the sqc was analyzed between every eight samples in the analytical sequences in total 7 injections in the influent batch and 9 injections in the effluent batch and used for inter batch correction whereas the qc influent and qc effluent were analyzed between every four samples in their respective batches in total 18 injections in the influent batch and 21 injections in the effluent batch and used for intra batch drift correction a second order polynomial function was fitted with the coefficients a and b to the median peak intensity of all nts compounds in the qc samples over time the time was defined according to injection number n in the same sequence afterwards the intensity i of all compounds in the samples and sqc were corrected icorr according to the median second order polynomial correction by the qc 1 i c o r r i 1 a n 2 b n the corrected intensities of the compounds in the sqcs were used as a test set to validate whether the relative standard deviation between sqc samples was decreasing by the second order polynomial correction however the main purpose of the sqc was the inter batch correction between the effluent samples and the influent samples that had been analyzed six months earlier to compare samples that were analyzed at different times both intensity drift correction and adjustment of the intensity threshold were required see details in results section 2 4 3 matrix effect correction pci tic approach the retention time dependent matrix effect evaluation was conducted by post column infusion pci scaled to the total ion chromatogram tic of the respective sample the feasibility of this approach can be seen in tisler et al 2021 and is explained in short in section s3 internal standard is spike approach in this approach the matrix effect was evaluated by comparing spiked internal standard is peak intensities between samples and blanks as is the compounds gabapentin d4 3 28 min hydroxy atrazine d5 3 5 min venlafaxine d6 4 26 min simazine d10 5 4 min carbamazepine d8 5 78 min atrazine d5 6 62 min isoproturon d6 6 92 min diuron d6 7 06 min and metolachlor d6 9 98 min were used 2 5 nts prioritization and identification 2 5 1 prioritization of persistent micropollutants for nts prioritization of persistent micropollutants 12 influent and effluent sample pairs from the same days of the same wwtps were compared samples from w1 w3 w4 and w6 were used with 3 4 3 and 2 influent and effluent sample pairs respectively compounds were considered to be potentially persistent if they occurred in both influent and effluent samples in the next filtering step the average peak intensity of the 12 influent samples was compared with the average peak intensity of the 12 effluent samples in order to be considered persistent the effluent peak intensity needed to be 50 of the corresponding influent peak intensity 2 5 2 prioritization of tps tp prioritization was carried out using the following strategy the m z values for prioritized compounds detected in influent samples were compared with the m z values for prioritized compounds detected in effluent samples for finding precursor tp pairs with net mass shifts that were characteristic of transformation reactions as net mass shifts the reactions of o 15 995 da o 2h 13 979 da ch2 14 016 da 2o 2h 29 974 da and 2h 2 016 da were considered these reactions were the most common for micropollutants in the literature tisler et al 2019 schollée et al 2015 gulde et al 2016 in addition to de conjugation reactions de acetylation de glucuronidation de sulfonation de amination however no meaningful precursor tp pairs could be detected for de conjugation reactions after finding precursor tp pairs tps were retained for further consideration if they eluted within a 2 min window before the precursor tps corresponding to oxygen net mass shifts were also allowed to elute up to 2 min after the precursor due to the possible formation of less polar n oxides merel et al 2017 2 5 3 retention time prediction model quantitative structure property relationship qspr models were developed to predict retention times of tentatively identified compounds the structures of the compounds were exported from pubchem and the schrodinger software maestro 12 5 2020 3 was used for the calculation of 2d molecular descriptors ligprep application and 3d molecular descriptors qikprep application the 3d structures and descriptors were used in the function autoqsar for building a qspr model with multiple linear regression the software algorithm chose 15 molecular descriptors for building a retention time rt prediction model with r2 0 82 a set of 140 randomly selected wastewater relevant compounds were used for building the model 113 compounds were used as a training set and 27 compounds were used as a test set for validating the qspr model all compounds from the test set were predicted correctly within a retention time window smaller than 2 8 min and 94 of the compounds within a 2 2 min window the prediction can be seen in document si b 2 5 4 identification workflow prioritized compounds were compared with the exact mass of the h adducts of the 11 261 compounds from the water relevant suspect list stoffident norman substance database as well as with the predicted rt 2 5 4 this was conducted by the in house r script an adequate match with the suspect list was considered if any group was less than 0 002 da and 2 2 min apart in m z and rt respectively for further validation of the compound identity the workflow involved manual investigation using unifi software of the peak shape signal to noise 5 and comparison of the fragments in low and high energy modes with compound libraries in massbank stoffident and pubchem as well as in silico fragmentation suggested by unifi 2 6 non target screening workflow the entire nts workflow is shown schematically in fig 1 and consists of steps for pre processing and filtering steps 1 7 quality control step 8 prioritization step 9 and compound identification steps 10 11 producing reproducible nts data starts with creating a sequence where instrument drifts and false positive reported compounds carry over artifact and blank compounds can be removed during data pre processing 1 after the software specific compound detection workflow 2 filtering steps are applied to reduce the number of false positive compounds 3 in the next step 4 the compounds are corrected for instrument drifts within a batch by a polynomial function obtained by fitting intensities from replicate qc samples after batch drift correction compounds were only kept for the next step if the relative standard deviation between sample replicates was 20 5 after matrix effect correction by using the tic profile 6 samples can be reliably compared within the same sequence for comparing samples between batches an inter batch correction is required which is done by correcting for compounds in the same sqc samples 7 not only the intensity but also correction of the threshold is important for avoiding a mismatch between reported compounds in runs with lower or higher instrument sensitivity the success of the correction steps 1 7 was evaluated by comparing nts results with target screening results 8 yielding reliable data that can be compared within and between analytical batches and between samples with very different matrices viz influent and effluent wastewater in the prioritization step 9 samples and compounds were prioritized by identifying persistent compounds less than 50 degradation from influent to effluent sample tp formation only detected in the effluent and also compounds with high intensities in the effluent were considered for samples without available influent from the same days prioritized compounds were matched with a relevant compound database stoffident 10 the suspects were filtered afterwards by a confidence score scheme to aid in compound identification the lowest score 10 points is comparable with confidence level 5 exact mass and the highest score 100 points with confidence level 1 matching analytical standard of the schymanski identification scheme schymanski et al 2014 in between these extremes we included additional points to the conventional score to address the contributions of retention time prediction plausibility check and the ambiguity of compound identification due to other relevant isomers in contrast to the schymanski identification scheme tps with a known core structure but ambiguous sites of modification are ranked higher with scores up to 80 points compared to level 3 as discussed by schymanski et al 2014 sublevels in the scoring system should be defined on a study specific basis depending on the central conclusions of the study we deviated from the usual scheme due to two main reasons firstly in our type of study the difference between identification levels 2a and 3 can be very narrow for example library spectral matches are often seen as unambiguous level 2a but similar compounds with the same core structure would also fit to the same fragments but library spectra are not available for all potential structures secondly our primary objective was to identify the transformation reactions of identified precursor compounds and in this scenario the ability to not unequivocally identify the position of modification did not hamper our central conclusions 3 results and discussion 3 1 workflow evaluation step 1 3 for statistically valuable data in step 1 the samples were analyzed in triplicates and randomized in three sub batches in this study the qc approach for intensity corrections was used instead of is compounds which is a common tool for similar matrices in metabolomics wehrens et al 2016 broadhurst et al 2018 spiking with is compounds would limit the correction to already known compounds and is not applicable to the nts compounds where no physical chemical properties are known furthermore the matrix effect of the samples could increase for nts compounds via a self induced matrix increase caused by the addition of too many is compounds tisler et al 2021 after the compound detection step 2 in step 3 the average efficiency of the triplicate injection filter was evaluated by the qc effluent and qc influent where it showed that 100 of the compounds in a single injection were duplicate filtered to 67 and triplicate filtered to 52 remaining compounds the results are in agreement with bader et al 2016 who showed in an extensive study the importance of analyzing in two or better three replicates to reduce the number of false positive reported compounds in our study by triplicate filter and matching compounds between samples 26 000 compounds were detected for 12 influent samples from six wwtps and 16 000 compounds for 26 effluent samples from eight wwtps another 2200 compounds in the effluent and 1300 compounds in the influent were removed by considering only compounds that are at least 50 times higher intensity in at least one sample compared to the blank for higher relevance compounds were only considered for further evaluation if they were occurring in more than one sample in conclusion after processing steps 1 3 the number of compounds remaining were 16 200 and 8000 for influent and effluent respectively 3 2 workflow evaluation step 4 5 intra batch intensity drift correction the qcs represented 30 to 60 of the compounds detected in each sample fig s4 the equal representation of the qc for all included samples was also demonstrated by a perfect match between the average tic of all samples and the tic from the qc fig s5 effluent qc as an example however due to the dilution factor of mixing different samples unique compounds with small intensities were missing in the qc samples for intensity drift correction compounds were selected which appeared in all qcs of the respective batch influent or effluent by this approach 4400 and 2500 compounds were used for influent and effluent batch correction respectively the 4400 compounds of the qc influent samples showed an average 35 response decrease during the first 137 injections the decrease is very consistent for peaks of different intensities fig s6 until injection 107 and were fitted by a 2nd degree polynomial curve fig s7 after the first 107 injections the intensity changes in the qc influent samples were less consistent fig s6 for some compounds the intensity was still decreasing while others were stable and some were even increasing thus no general trend could be observed for injections between runs 107 and 137 as a result the intensities were only corrected until injection 107 which included the runs of two injections of each of the 12 influent samples thus for the influent samples while it was required for compounds to be detected in three out of three injections the intensity was calculated as an average of only the first two intensity corrected injections for the effluent batch the intensity of the 2500 compounds was consistent with a median relative standard deviation rsd of 6 from injection 8 to 132 figs s6 and s8 a median decrease in peak intensity of 4 was observed by comparing the first four with the last four qc injections the correction by a 2nd order polynomial function was also tested for this dataset the suitability of the correction was evaluated by 3000 compounds in the sqcs the average rsd for all sqc compounds improved from 15 to 6 for influent table s4 and no improvement was observed for the effluent rsd 7 table s5 consequently intra batch correction of the samples was performed only for the influent injections the median improvement for duplicate measurements of all compounds in all influent samples was from 9 to 5 rsd the median rsd intensity of the triplicate measurements of all compounds in all effluent samples was 7 fig s9 this was in agreement with bader et al 2017 who detected in the analysis of more than 14 h runtime peak response stability with rsd lower than 10 in a following step in our study compounds with rsd higher than 20 were removed and were not considered for further data processing it was assumed that these compounds were not relevant e g remaining compounds from the blank or mismatches in the compound detection from the software by these criteria 98 of the effluent compounds and 96 of the influent compounds were considered for further processing 3 3 workflow evaluation step 6 matrix effect correction the enriched samples were measured with ref 10 influent and ref 50 effluent assuming comparable low matrix effects tisler et al 2021 however in chromatographic regions with many compounds eluting at the same time a retention time dependent matrix effect was still detectable this was evaluated by matrix effect profiles based on the tic of the samples tisler et al 2021 nürenberg et al 2015 have shown previously that no correction of the matrix effects can lead to the incorrect conclusion that some compounds have apparently higher concentrations in the effluent than influent the observed matrix effects in our samples always resulted in signal suppression which in most cases was less than 10 for effluent fig 2 lowest graph an exception was a valley starting at 3 2 min and ending at 6 min caused by many co eluting compounds in influent and effluent samples in contrast the influent samples had up to 48 suppression at early retention times 6 min and up to 37 in a later region of the chromatogram from 11 to 16 min the highest discrepancy of 32 between the matrix effects for the influent and effluent samples was observed around 5 2 min and highlights the need for accurate correction of matrix effects in order to accurately compare the data in the influent and effluent matrices the tic matrix effect correction was compared to the correction obtained using is for the samples from w1 in general the matrix effect correction was similar for the tic profile and the six iss fig 2 however venlafaxine d6 showed 10 higher suppression in both influent and effluent after is correction compared to tic matrix effect correction this can be explained by the greater compound specific matrix effect of venlafaxine in comparison to the median of the six pci compounds which were used for scaling the tic matrix effect fig s2 thus using venlafaxine d6 for is correction would overcorrect for many of the nts compounds the opposite can be observed in the influent sample for gabapentin d4 where the correction would be 13 less with this is compared to the tic matrix effect correction due to lower compound specific matrix effects of gabapentin in comparison to the median fig s2 this confirms that the is needs to be selected carefully for compounds where the is structure does not necessarily match the compound structure unlike the usual case in target screening to avoid under or overcorrection in severe matrix effect regions in general the is intensity showed 9 standard deviation evaluated by 15 different blank runs two different samples over time also taking this into account the range of tic and is correction was still in good agreement difference between 0 and 13 a remaining uncorrected matrix effect of up to 20 between influent and effluent seems not to hamper the overall comparison of treatment processes nürenberg et al 2019 3 4 step 7 intensity and threshold correction inter batch correction the influent samples were analyzed 6 months before the effluent samples stored at 20 c during this time for comparing samples which were run at different times intensity and threshold correction is required for evaluation the 3000 compounds which were detected in all sqc samples in both batches were used the sqc peak intensities were lower in the effluent batch than in the influent batch for 95 of the compounds the influent batch effluent batch ratio was between 1 and 5 while less intense compounds typically showed higher variation between the two batches fig 3 the peak intensity was on median 2 9 times higher in the influent sqcs compared to the effluent sqcs fig 3 evaluating the ratio for the suspect compounds detected in sqc 28 out of 31 compounds were in the mean 50 which means between factor 2 3 and 3 6 of the influent effluent ratio for reliable comparison between influent and effluent samples the peak intensities of the effluent samples were therefore divided by a factor of 1 7 5 2 9 as the intensity correction between batches the factor 5 accounts for the additional up concentration of the effluent samples compared to the influent samples in this study ref 50 for effluent samples compared to ref 10 for influent samples to avoid a bias in the peak detection not only the peak intensity was corrected in between batches but also the peak detection threshold due to the higher instrument sensitivity in the influent batch compound intensities could occur above the threshold in the influent samples and not in the effluent samples if the same threshold values were used the difficulty is to select a representative correction factor not to be too strict with the threshold correction due to the high relative variation of the peak intensity for smaller peaks choosing a strict threshold could lead to the appearance of false positive tps or degraded compounds for intensities close to the detection intensity threshold the detection intensity threshold for influent samples was 600 adjusting the effluent threshold by a factor 1 7 would therefore lead to a threshold of 1020 for effluent samples however because of variations in the intensities for small peaks the detection intensity thresholds for effluent samples were set between 600 some compounds were factor 5 less intense in effluent compared to influent but factor 5 more up concentrated in effluent and 3000 some compounds had same intensity in effluent and influent batch but factor 5 more up concentrated in effluent the following correction approaches for the effluent compounds were used to be as close as possible to the truth for nts compounds all compounds were kept if the effluent peak intensity was 1020 which is the detection intensity threshold after median intensity correction with factor 1 7 a compound was further considered to be detected in samples with intensities 1020 until 600 if the compound had a peak intensity 1020 in at least one of the effluent samples this ensures the cut off is not too strict and compounds are not discarded because of variations in the intensity threshold a compound was not further considered in the effluent if the intensity was for all samples below the lowest intensity threshold of 600 3 5 step 8 quality control comparison with target results on removal the workflow from step 1 to 7 was evaluated by comparing the removal of compounds with a target workflow for the target screening the effluent samples were measured directly before the influent samples compared with nts where there were 6 months in between and calibration standards and is compounds were used for quantification a total of ten target compounds were compared in four influent effluent pairs from w 1 w3 w4 and w6 table s3 the mean absolute difference after matrix effect correction between target and nts results was in all cases 10 fig s10 furthermore the matrix effect correction had minor influence on the calculated removal rate fig s10 and table s6 in the individual samples matrix effect correction changed the calculated degradation by up to 12 mostly moving the nts results closer to the target screening data thus the used ref factors were sufficiently low to reduce the matrix effects and the filtering and correction steps of the nts workflow were able to produce comparable data to target screening data using an internal standard calibration approach although the intensity correction between batches showed high variation for individual compounds the median correction factor was sufficient for the target compounds 3 6 step 9 prioritization by nts clustering of real samples 3 6 1 compound prioritization by comparing influent and effluent of four different wwtps compounds occurring in influent and effluent wastewater samples were compared for four wwtps w1 w3 w4 and w6 a compound was only included if it appeared in 2 out of 2 samples from the same wwtp at different days this was important to ensure the relevance of the compounds because the hydraulic retention time of the samples in the wwt process was neglected in the sampling 24 h sampling for influent and effluent started at the same time using these criteria 9755 compounds for influent and 1206 compounds for effluent samples were further processed fig 4 in the influent wastewater 28 of the compounds were similar in all four wwtps fig 4a whereas only 20 of the same compounds were present in all four effluent wastewaters a total of 77 compounds were detected in all influent and effluent samples a simpler overview is shown in fig 4b where compounds which are detected in at least 1 out of 4 wwtps are reported 93 of the compounds detected in influent samples were not detected in the effluent the combined effluent samples showed 43 compounds which were not detected in the influent this was in agreement with literature where around 50 of the effluent compounds are reported as tps in nts approaches schollée et al 2021 nürenberg et al 2019 in the intersection between influent and effluent of fig 4b 715 compounds were detected which can be considered as potential persistent micropollutants a closer look at the intensity of these compounds fig 4c shows that 293 compounds were 90 degraded 257 compounds were 50 degraded and 152 compounds were stable 50 degradation furthermore 10 compounds had higher intensities in the effluent wastewater the focus of this study was the identification of persistent micropollutants as well as tps which are discharged into the aquatic environment thus the 491 compounds only appearing in effluent as well as the 152 compounds with degradation 50 and the 10 compounds with higher intensity in the effluent were prioritized for compound identification in this study 653 compounds in total 3 6 2 tp prioritization the systematic identification of tps can be streamlined by comparing influent and effluent samples over a long sampling period where hydraulic retention time variations in the wwtp are eliminated we evaluated the optimal frequency of compounds occurring in the four days of w3 for a compromise to reduce the number of false positive and false negative annotated tps the evaluation is described in detail in section s6 in summary for the identification of tps in the nts workflow compounds which occurred in 2 out of 4 influents potential precursor were compared with compounds which occurred in 2 out of 4 effluent potential tps samples of w3 on this basis 34 of the effluent compounds were not occurring in the influent and classified as tps the relative amount of 34 effluent compounds classified as tps was smaller than 50 tps described in previous literature nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2021 this could be explainable by the more flexible replicate filtering whereby the probability is higher to find the same compound in both influent and effluent in the next step the tps were prioritized by comparing net mass shifts for potential precursor in influent and potential tp in effluent compounds for tp prioritization the precursor compounds needed to be selected carefully if all 9713 compounds detected in influent samples were used most of the potential reported tps were false positives this was concluded by the missing correlation between the potential precursor and tp in 1 retention time and 2 fragment pattern in most cases the retention time difference between tp and precursor was higher than the acceptable 2 min and no similar fragments between tp and precursor could be detected a similar approach was used by schollée et al 2015 separating potential precursor and tps by a pca and searching for the characteristic mass shifts they experienced similar challenges with too many compounds interferences in ms ms spectra and less meaningful spectra in general another study showed that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal was in agreement with nts compound removal but the representative micropollutant target compounds showed less biodegradation nürenberg et al 2019 thus we assume that the high number of easily biodegradable compounds are natural compounds rather than anthropogenic micropollutants and thus only form a limited number of stable micropollutant tps that are analyzable with lchrms therefore precursor compounds were only considered if they were not removed completely in w3 intersection in fig s13 venn diagram b 782 compounds as potential tps all pre filtered compounds in the effluent wastewater of w3 were considered 402 compounds the net mass shift search for all investigated reactions revealed 50 potential precursor tp pairs thus 50 potential tps were considered for further investigation matching to 32 potential precursor compounds 3 7 step 10 and 11 identification of prioritized compounds 3 7 1 matching with library as a first step the 653 prioritized compounds from section 3 6 1 were compared with the exact mass 0 002 da of compounds in the norman substance database stoffident furthermore the rts needed to be in the range of 2 min 94 confidence level from the predicted rt from the 653 prioritized compounds from the previous chapter 399 were assigned to match with the database however only 190 compounds were left after including predicted rt as a criterion in the identification scheme compounds were further filtered by plausibility checks available literature to assess a potential wwtp discharge can be seen in document si c and ms ms library comparison in total 48 compounds were identified with a confidence score between 75 and 100 document si c identified compounds furthermore the same workflow was used to identify compounds in effluent samples where no matching influent sample was available further 13 compounds could be identified confidence scores between 65 and 80 overall analytical standards were available to confirm the identities of 33 of the 61 compounds 3 7 2 identification of tps by the tp identification described in section 3 6 2 13 additional tps for the high intense precursor compounds losartan los deet fexofenadine fxf and metoprolol mtp could be tentatively identified suggested chemical structures are listed in s7 besides the well known tp los carboxylic acid four additional tps of los could be identified los 2h los 2o 2h los o 2h los 2o 4h an intermediate in the formation of los carboxylic acid could be los 2h ioannidi et al 2022 the identified compound los 2o 2h was also described previously in the literature but as a metabolite in blood katyayan and hui 2019 another identified tp that has not been previously described in wastewater was an isomer of los carboxylic acid suggesting a carbonylation on another functional group suggested structures in s7 the fourth tp was los 2o 4h probably formed by the carbonylated los for mtp two tps were identified mtp o 2h has not been previously detected in wastewater but only in lab experiments rubirola et al 2014 the dehydrogenated tp mtp 2h was newly identified in our study four tps were identified for fxf fxf 2h has been reported previously in wastewater henning et al 2019 fxf o fxf ch2 and fxf ch2 have to our knowledge never been reported before in wastewater the tps derived from deet were deet o which has been reported previously in ozonation experiments li et al 2019 furthermore two compounds were identified with the same fragments as deet and were tentatively identified as tps deet ch2 and deet 2c2h4 for all tps at least two main fragments were identified which were in common with the precursor same fragment or the fragment plus the net mass shift of the reaction in general the confidence score for tps was lower than for the precursors because the structure could not be unambiguously identified mainly due to at least two possibilities for the modified site meaning that the 10 points unique hit score could not be included the retention times for all los and mtp tps were predicted within the 2 min range thus they had a confidence score of 80 the deet tps had the lowest score of 50 due 3 to 4 min deviations from the predicted retention time a special case was fxf which was the only compound out of all 76 suspect compounds where the predicted retention time was more than 4 min off however kept due to the unambiguous identification with analytical standard a reason could be that the training set of the rt prediction document si b was not representing the fxf structure as a result the rt prediction for the fxf tp could not be conducted however the tps showed retention times in the 2 min window of fxf as would be expected from empirical studies for these transformation reactions gulde et al 2016 the fxf tps were assigned to a confidence score of 65 only 15 points instead of 30 points for rt prediction included 3 8 fate of identified stable compounds and tps in the wwtps after data pre processing and identification the fate of the identified compounds in the wwtps was investigated four compounds showed 50 degradation in all wwtps tetroxoprim gabapentin metoprolol acid theobromine but the main focus was on the persistent micropollutants and tps thirty six of the identified compounds were classified as persistent as they had on average 50 peak intensity in the effluent compared to influent fig 5 most of these were precursor compounds but also some human metabolites e g los carboxylic acid verapamil metabolite were in this class the industrial compound 1 3 diphenylguanidine the human metabolite of methadone eddp and the anti psychotic drug amisulpride showed no significant degradation in any of the wwtps 1 3 diphenylguanidine is well known to be ubiquitous in surface waters zahn et al 2019 likely originating from tires in road runoff however to our knowledge its fate has never been reported in wwtps before the absence of degradation of eddp and amisulpride was in agreement with other studies boleda et al 2009 bollmann et al 2016 in addition the peak intensities of 20 compounds were at least two times higher in the effluent than in the corresponding influent sample most of the formed compounds were identified as tps where some are already known to be more toxic than the precursor e g gabapentin lactam henning et al 2018 however the precursor compounds carbamazepine and lamotrigine were also formed which has been attributed previously as cleavage of glucuronide conjugates in the treatment process bollmann et al 2016 the two los metabolites carboxylic acid and los 2h were already detected in the influent because of their formation in the human metabolism ioannidi et al 2022 also fxf ch2 was detected in two influent samples indicating that the compound was produced both before and after the wwtp however the remaining 11 newly identified tps were detected only in effluent samples which strongly suggest that these compounds were formed in the wwtp process the fate of the newly identified tps is shown in detail in fig s14 3 9 relative comparison of identified compounds in wastewater effluent the identified compounds were screened in 25 effluent samples from eight wwtps 4xw1 4xw2 4xw3 4xw4 2xw5 3xw6 2xw7 2xw8 32 compounds were detected in all 25 samples where four of them were the newly identified tps los 2h o2 los 2h o mtp o 2h fxf 2h fig s15 the most intense peaks were fxf antihistamine fxf 2h tapendatol pharmaceutical and drug of abuse and 2 4 diethylamino 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzoic acid industrial metabolite or from sunscreen in all samples in general the compounds were quite evenly distributed between the wwtps exceptions were the unique detection of propylparaben mirtazapin and carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide in w6 n butylbenzenesulfonamide only in all w1 samples and metribuzin only in w8 terbutylazin as well as terbutylazin 2 hydroxy showed a higher occurrence in w7 it was interesting to note the unique detection of amitryptilin antipsychotic chlorprothixene antipsychotic melitracen antidepressant and morphine narcotic in w3 samples a specific source such as a big psychiatric hospital was not definitively identified in this catchment area a comparison of all the detected compounds using a principal component analysis pca fig 6 of auto scaled peak intensities showed that the wwtps from the capital region w1 3 were clustering together as well as the samples from the island of funen w4 8 interestingly the loading plot showed that the six compounds we assigned to potential drugs of abuse methadone methadone tp eddp amphetamine morphine tapentadol ritalinic acid were associated to the samples from the capital region in the score plot a similar clustering towards the capital region could be seen for the antipsychotic and antidepressant compounds as well as for the four chemicals assigned to cosmetic ingredients on the other hand the three epileptic agents carbamazepine gabapentin lamotrigine plus their two tps were assigned to the more rural area of funen no general trend could be observed for the class of herbicide compounds 6 compounds fig 6 but metribuzin was reported previously as a herbicide detected in rural areas hu et al 2017 which was also observed here 73 herb in fig 6 among the other compound classes no specific clustering could be observed 4 conclusion the nts workflow presented in this study shows a solution for achieving comparable data across samples analyzed at different times and in different matrices this approach can be used for prioritizing and identifying persistent compounds and tps in wastewater intra batch intensity drifts inter batch threshold variation and matrix effects are important correction steps for the comparison of a high number of different samples analyzed at different times the obtained screening data can be used for retrospective analysis samples analyzed in the future and processed with the same workflow can be added to the sample comparison therefore the preparation and preservation of a stable sqc sample is crucial which needs to be included in each batch for comparable analysis the nts workflow shows how the differences and treatment efficiencies between different wwtps can be characterized by unknown compounds nts prioritization by comparing influent and effluent samples reveals persistent compounds and tps the wastewater composition can reflect the different consumer patterns potential drugs of abuse anti psychotic and anti depressant drugs were predominant in the capital region whereas antiepileptic drugs and agricultural pesticides were predominant in

15936,in this study micropollutants in wastewater effluents were prioritized by monitoring the composition of influent and effluent wastewater by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms non target screening nts analysis the study shows how important data pre processing and filtering of raw data is to produce reliable nts data for comparison of compounds between many samples 37 wastewater samples analyzed at different times triplicate injections were critical for reducing the number of false positive detections intensity drift corrections within and between batches analyzed months apart made peak intensities comparable across samples adjustment of the feature detection threshold was shown to be important due to large intensity variations for low abundance compounds across batches when the threshold correction cut offs or the filtering of relevant compounds by the occurrence frequency were too stringent a high number of false positive transformation products tps were reported we also showed that matrix effect correction by internal standards can over or under correct the intensity for unknown compounds thus the tic matrix effect correction was shown as an additional tool for a retention time dependent matrix effect correction after these preprocessing and filtering steps we identified 78 prioritized compounds of which 36 were persistent compounds defined as compounds with a reduction in peak intensity between influent and effluent wastewater 50 and 13 compounds were defined as tps because they occurred solely in the effluent samples some examples of persistent compounds are 1 3 diphenylguanidine amisulpride and the human metabolites from losartan verapamil and methadone to our knowledge nine of the identified tps have not been previously described in effluent wastewater the tps were derived from metoprolol fexofenadine deet and losartan the screening of all identified compounds in effluent samples from eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps showed that potential drugs of abuse anti psychotic and anti depressant drugs were predominant in the capital city region whereas the anti epileptic agents and agricultural pesticides were dominant in more rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords non target screening wastewater persistent compounds transformation products 1 introduction in the united states and europe alone the number of substances on the market is believed to be around 100 000 chemicals johnson et al 2020 and many of these enter the wastewater system every day these micropollutants have high diversity originating from different sources such as households pharmaceuticals personal care products pcpps food additives industry production chemicals agricultural pesticides and hospitals pharmaceuticals disinfection chemicals margot et al 2015 rogowska et al 2020 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to remove complex mixtures of human introduced micropollutants and their transformation products tps improving analytical methods are revealing more and more micropollutants occurring in wastewater effluent not only due to the improved detection sensitivities of the instruments but also because complementary analytical methods are used besides the target screening broader screening approaches are used to identify new sources of micropollutants and their tps the broader screening approaches can be divided into two main classes 1 suspect screening and 2 non target screening nts hug et al 2014 suspect screening starts with a list of suspect compounds prioritizing compounds by possible hits and narrowing down with different confidence steps deeb et al 2017 diamanti et al 2019 nts is starting with unknown compounds prioritizing the compounds by their occurrence and intensity nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2015 and identifying the prioritized compounds at the end hug et al 2014 schollée et al 2018 the drawback of the first approach is that compounds that are not on the initial list are overlooked which would be the case for most tps the drawback of the second approach is that too many compounds are included which makes the data processing time demanding and many non sense compounds are included far into the workflow schollée et al 2015 in both cases workflows are often lacking sufficient pre processing and filtering steps to produce reliable data that can be compared with and between large analytical sequences bader et al 2017 schulze et al 2020 these pre processing steps are especially important for comparing occurrence and the increase decrease in concentrations of compounds between samples beckers et al 2020 schollée et al 2021 this study aimed to prioritize persistent micropollutants and tps by a transparent and reliable nts workflow the prioritization was achieved by nts analysis of 37 influent and effluent wastewater samples that required data synchronization across batches analyzed far apart in time and two different sample matrices to provide reliable data for sample comparison the workflow addresses challenges and provides solutions for 1 instrument drifts intra and inter batch 2 correction for compound and retention time dependent matrix effects and 3 correction of the feature detection thresholds between and within analytical batches by overcoming these challenges persistent micropollutants would show no significant decrease in signal from influent to effluent wastewater furthermore tps could be identified by specific mass shifts e g 15 996 da for oxygen attachment between compounds that are significantly more abundant in effluent wastewater compared to influent wastewater in this study nts prioritization for persistent micropollutants and tps was shown for samples from eight wwtps in denmark 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater samples flow proportional 24 h wastewater samples were collected at eight danish wwtps during summer 2020 three wwtps w1 w2 w3 located in municipalities of copenhagen three w4 w5 w6 in the municipality of odense and two w7 w8 in towns of northern funen locations in fig s1 a total of 12 influent and 25 effluent wastewater samples were collected table 1 influent samples were collected after the grid catchment and just before or after w2 and w8 the sand and fat catchment increments of 100 ml were collected flow proportional by the autosampler stationed at the inlet or outlet of each wwtp increments were immediately transferred into glass containers and stored at 4 ⁰c during the whole 24 h sampling period after sampling the composite 24 h samples between 3 and 5 l were transported to the lab for filtration and sample preparation additional information on the wwtps hydraulic retention time sampling dates and removal efficiency of nutrients is listed in tables s1 and s2 2 2 sample preparation and lc esi qtofms analysis the sample preparation and lchrms analysis of the samples are described elsewhere tisler et al 2021 in brief wastewater samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm glass microfiber filter and enriched 500 times relative enrichment factor ref 500 with an automated multi layer solid phase extraction spe system spe 03 from promochrom technologies ltd the high enrichment factor provided the opportunity to use these samples also for ecotoxicology tests unpublished results due to the additional use for ecotoxicology tests no internal standards could be added to the sample prior to enrichment recovery experiments of 30 target analytes log d 1 to 4 in effluent wastewater showed for 90 of the compounds recoveries 80 with 12 standard deviation n 3 however additional losses during enrichment cannot be excluded for the non target compounds the samples were reconstituted in methanol and analyzed with lchrms using a waters acquity uplc with a waters synapt g2 si quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer in positive electrospray ionization mode esi mode the gradient program was as follows initial conditions of 99 eluent a milliq h2o 0 1 fa for 1 min followed by a linear increase to 30 eluent b acetonitrile 0 1 fa in 2 min with a further gradient increase to 99 b over 13 min these conditions were kept for 5 min before switching back to the starting conditions 4 min equilibration time to give a total run time of 25 min per sample the samples were acquired in the data independent acquisition mode called mse in mse for each scan a low energy 0 ev and a high energy mass spectrum ramped energy from 10 to 40 ev are produced for compounds with an insufficient number of identified fragments for identification targeted ms ms analysis was conducted in a later run 20 ev the effluent samples were measured at 10 times dilution ref 50 and the influent samples were diluted 50 times ref 10 the injection volume was 2 µl for all samples the influent batch was measured 6 months before the effluent batch in between several samples of different matrices were run on this instrument 2 3 data processing for target workflow as quality control for nts workflow the same samples were analyzed by target screening however the samples were measured at another time and consecutive effluent batch right before influent batch with the lchrms instrument ten target compounds over a retention time range from 3 8 to 7 8 min were used for evaluation the measured intensities were corrected by internal standards is and quantified by external calibrations the target compounds and their corresponding internal standards are listed in table s3 the linearity and concentration range of the calibration was evaluated by a pre screening for effluent samples ref 50 the calibration points were between 0 05 and 2 µg l 7 calibration points and for the influent samples ref 10 between 0 2 and 10 µg l 7 calibration points the extent of compound degradation was calculated based on the measured concentrations for target screening and based on the peak height itself for the nts workflow 2 4 methods for the nts workflow 2 4 1 data pre processing with unifi and r for nts workflow lchrms data were obtained in continuum mode peak and compound detection were carried out in a retention time window from 1 to 17 min using the unifi software from waters isotope and adduct clustering for h na k and nh4 was done by the unifi software keeping the adduct with the highest peak intensity furthermore a peak height threshold was set where peaks were considered with a response higher than 200 for effluent and a response higher than 600 for influent samples the values were chosen due to practical reasons lower thresholds would result in more than 50 000 compounds per sample which slowed down the processing the peak lists of the precursor compounds were exported as lcs file each sample as one file and processed further using an in house r script https sid erda dk cgi sid ls py share id e618gcdcs6 the detected peaks were matched across samples according to the absolute difference in both m z and rt the group of similar peaks was formed with detected peaks that were no more than 0 01 da and 0 08 min apart groups that did not occur in all replicates were removed from the final list so for compounds to be considered further they needed to occur in 3 out of 3 sample replicates if the resulting group included both blanks and other samples it was removed from further analysis if the sample intensities were not significantly different to those measured in blanks t test with 5 significance level groups containing only one blank remained in the list as long as in a second filtering step the intensity in at least one sample was more than 50 times higher than the blank intensity the final list of compounds was made by merging influent and effluent samples with the same matching algorithm as within the batches 0 01 da and 0 08 min 2 4 2 quality control qc samples for inter and intra batch intensity correction between and within batches drift correction was performed using three sets of quality control qc samples one set for the effluent samples qc effluent consisted of an equal mixture of all 25 effluent samples at ref 50 a second set for the influent samples qc influent consisted of an equal mixture of 12 influent samples at ref 10 and a third set super quality control sqc sample consisted of a 1 1 mixture of the qc effluent and qc influent three sets of qc sqc were needed in this study due to comparison of different matrices two qc as well as comparing samples running in sequences at different times sqc the sqc was analyzed between every eight samples in the analytical sequences in total 7 injections in the influent batch and 9 injections in the effluent batch and used for inter batch correction whereas the qc influent and qc effluent were analyzed between every four samples in their respective batches in total 18 injections in the influent batch and 21 injections in the effluent batch and used for intra batch drift correction a second order polynomial function was fitted with the coefficients a and b to the median peak intensity of all nts compounds in the qc samples over time the time was defined according to injection number n in the same sequence afterwards the intensity i of all compounds in the samples and sqc were corrected icorr according to the median second order polynomial correction by the qc 1 i c o r r i 1 a n 2 b n the corrected intensities of the compounds in the sqcs were used as a test set to validate whether the relative standard deviation between sqc samples was decreasing by the second order polynomial correction however the main purpose of the sqc was the inter batch correction between the effluent samples and the influent samples that had been analyzed six months earlier to compare samples that were analyzed at different times both intensity drift correction and adjustment of the intensity threshold were required see details in results section 2 4 3 matrix effect correction pci tic approach the retention time dependent matrix effect evaluation was conducted by post column infusion pci scaled to the total ion chromatogram tic of the respective sample the feasibility of this approach can be seen in tisler et al 2021 and is explained in short in section s3 internal standard is spike approach in this approach the matrix effect was evaluated by comparing spiked internal standard is peak intensities between samples and blanks as is the compounds gabapentin d4 3 28 min hydroxy atrazine d5 3 5 min venlafaxine d6 4 26 min simazine d10 5 4 min carbamazepine d8 5 78 min atrazine d5 6 62 min isoproturon d6 6 92 min diuron d6 7 06 min and metolachlor d6 9 98 min were used 2 5 nts prioritization and identification 2 5 1 prioritization of persistent micropollutants for nts prioritization of persistent micropollutants 12 influent and effluent sample pairs from the same days of the same wwtps were compared samples from w1 w3 w4 and w6 were used with 3 4 3 and 2 influent and effluent sample pairs respectively compounds were considered to be potentially persistent if they occurred in both influent and effluent samples in the next filtering step the average peak intensity of the 12 influent samples was compared with the average peak intensity of the 12 effluent samples in order to be considered persistent the effluent peak intensity needed to be 50 of the corresponding influent peak intensity 2 5 2 prioritization of tps tp prioritization was carried out using the following strategy the m z values for prioritized compounds detected in influent samples were compared with the m z values for prioritized compounds detected in effluent samples for finding precursor tp pairs with net mass shifts that were characteristic of transformation reactions as net mass shifts the reactions of o 15 995 da o 2h 13 979 da ch2 14 016 da 2o 2h 29 974 da and 2h 2 016 da were considered these reactions were the most common for micropollutants in the literature tisler et al 2019 schollée et al 2015 gulde et al 2016 in addition to de conjugation reactions de acetylation de glucuronidation de sulfonation de amination however no meaningful precursor tp pairs could be detected for de conjugation reactions after finding precursor tp pairs tps were retained for further consideration if they eluted within a 2 min window before the precursor tps corresponding to oxygen net mass shifts were also allowed to elute up to 2 min after the precursor due to the possible formation of less polar n oxides merel et al 2017 2 5 3 retention time prediction model quantitative structure property relationship qspr models were developed to predict retention times of tentatively identified compounds the structures of the compounds were exported from pubchem and the schrodinger software maestro 12 5 2020 3 was used for the calculation of 2d molecular descriptors ligprep application and 3d molecular descriptors qikprep application the 3d structures and descriptors were used in the function autoqsar for building a qspr model with multiple linear regression the software algorithm chose 15 molecular descriptors for building a retention time rt prediction model with r2 0 82 a set of 140 randomly selected wastewater relevant compounds were used for building the model 113 compounds were used as a training set and 27 compounds were used as a test set for validating the qspr model all compounds from the test set were predicted correctly within a retention time window smaller than 2 8 min and 94 of the compounds within a 2 2 min window the prediction can be seen in document si b 2 5 4 identification workflow prioritized compounds were compared with the exact mass of the h adducts of the 11 261 compounds from the water relevant suspect list stoffident norman substance database as well as with the predicted rt 2 5 4 this was conducted by the in house r script an adequate match with the suspect list was considered if any group was less than 0 002 da and 2 2 min apart in m z and rt respectively for further validation of the compound identity the workflow involved manual investigation using unifi software of the peak shape signal to noise 5 and comparison of the fragments in low and high energy modes with compound libraries in massbank stoffident and pubchem as well as in silico fragmentation suggested by unifi 2 6 non target screening workflow the entire nts workflow is shown schematically in fig 1 and consists of steps for pre processing and filtering steps 1 7 quality control step 8 prioritization step 9 and compound identification steps 10 11 producing reproducible nts data starts with creating a sequence where instrument drifts and false positive reported compounds carry over artifact and blank compounds can be removed during data pre processing 1 after the software specific compound detection workflow 2 filtering steps are applied to reduce the number of false positive compounds 3 in the next step 4 the compounds are corrected for instrument drifts within a batch by a polynomial function obtained by fitting intensities from replicate qc samples after batch drift correction compounds were only kept for the next step if the relative standard deviation between sample replicates was 20 5 after matrix effect correction by using the tic profile 6 samples can be reliably compared within the same sequence for comparing samples between batches an inter batch correction is required which is done by correcting for compounds in the same sqc samples 7 not only the intensity but also correction of the threshold is important for avoiding a mismatch between reported compounds in runs with lower or higher instrument sensitivity the success of the correction steps 1 7 was evaluated by comparing nts results with target screening results 8 yielding reliable data that can be compared within and between analytical batches and between samples with very different matrices viz influent and effluent wastewater in the prioritization step 9 samples and compounds were prioritized by identifying persistent compounds less than 50 degradation from influent to effluent sample tp formation only detected in the effluent and also compounds with high intensities in the effluent were considered for samples without available influent from the same days prioritized compounds were matched with a relevant compound database stoffident 10 the suspects were filtered afterwards by a confidence score scheme to aid in compound identification the lowest score 10 points is comparable with confidence level 5 exact mass and the highest score 100 points with confidence level 1 matching analytical standard of the schymanski identification scheme schymanski et al 2014 in between these extremes we included additional points to the conventional score to address the contributions of retention time prediction plausibility check and the ambiguity of compound identification due to other relevant isomers in contrast to the schymanski identification scheme tps with a known core structure but ambiguous sites of modification are ranked higher with scores up to 80 points compared to level 3 as discussed by schymanski et al 2014 sublevels in the scoring system should be defined on a study specific basis depending on the central conclusions of the study we deviated from the usual scheme due to two main reasons firstly in our type of study the difference between identification levels 2a and 3 can be very narrow for example library spectral matches are often seen as unambiguous level 2a but similar compounds with the same core structure would also fit to the same fragments but library spectra are not available for all potential structures secondly our primary objective was to identify the transformation reactions of identified precursor compounds and in this scenario the ability to not unequivocally identify the position of modification did not hamper our central conclusions 3 results and discussion 3 1 workflow evaluation step 1 3 for statistically valuable data in step 1 the samples were analyzed in triplicates and randomized in three sub batches in this study the qc approach for intensity corrections was used instead of is compounds which is a common tool for similar matrices in metabolomics wehrens et al 2016 broadhurst et al 2018 spiking with is compounds would limit the correction to already known compounds and is not applicable to the nts compounds where no physical chemical properties are known furthermore the matrix effect of the samples could increase for nts compounds via a self induced matrix increase caused by the addition of too many is compounds tisler et al 2021 after the compound detection step 2 in step 3 the average efficiency of the triplicate injection filter was evaluated by the qc effluent and qc influent where it showed that 100 of the compounds in a single injection were duplicate filtered to 67 and triplicate filtered to 52 remaining compounds the results are in agreement with bader et al 2016 who showed in an extensive study the importance of analyzing in two or better three replicates to reduce the number of false positive reported compounds in our study by triplicate filter and matching compounds between samples 26 000 compounds were detected for 12 influent samples from six wwtps and 16 000 compounds for 26 effluent samples from eight wwtps another 2200 compounds in the effluent and 1300 compounds in the influent were removed by considering only compounds that are at least 50 times higher intensity in at least one sample compared to the blank for higher relevance compounds were only considered for further evaluation if they were occurring in more than one sample in conclusion after processing steps 1 3 the number of compounds remaining were 16 200 and 8000 for influent and effluent respectively 3 2 workflow evaluation step 4 5 intra batch intensity drift correction the qcs represented 30 to 60 of the compounds detected in each sample fig s4 the equal representation of the qc for all included samples was also demonstrated by a perfect match between the average tic of all samples and the tic from the qc fig s5 effluent qc as an example however due to the dilution factor of mixing different samples unique compounds with small intensities were missing in the qc samples for intensity drift correction compounds were selected which appeared in all qcs of the respective batch influent or effluent by this approach 4400 and 2500 compounds were used for influent and effluent batch correction respectively the 4400 compounds of the qc influent samples showed an average 35 response decrease during the first 137 injections the decrease is very consistent for peaks of different intensities fig s6 until injection 107 and were fitted by a 2nd degree polynomial curve fig s7 after the first 107 injections the intensity changes in the qc influent samples were less consistent fig s6 for some compounds the intensity was still decreasing while others were stable and some were even increasing thus no general trend could be observed for injections between runs 107 and 137 as a result the intensities were only corrected until injection 107 which included the runs of two injections of each of the 12 influent samples thus for the influent samples while it was required for compounds to be detected in three out of three injections the intensity was calculated as an average of only the first two intensity corrected injections for the effluent batch the intensity of the 2500 compounds was consistent with a median relative standard deviation rsd of 6 from injection 8 to 132 figs s6 and s8 a median decrease in peak intensity of 4 was observed by comparing the first four with the last four qc injections the correction by a 2nd order polynomial function was also tested for this dataset the suitability of the correction was evaluated by 3000 compounds in the sqcs the average rsd for all sqc compounds improved from 15 to 6 for influent table s4 and no improvement was observed for the effluent rsd 7 table s5 consequently intra batch correction of the samples was performed only for the influent injections the median improvement for duplicate measurements of all compounds in all influent samples was from 9 to 5 rsd the median rsd intensity of the triplicate measurements of all compounds in all effluent samples was 7 fig s9 this was in agreement with bader et al 2017 who detected in the analysis of more than 14 h runtime peak response stability with rsd lower than 10 in a following step in our study compounds with rsd higher than 20 were removed and were not considered for further data processing it was assumed that these compounds were not relevant e g remaining compounds from the blank or mismatches in the compound detection from the software by these criteria 98 of the effluent compounds and 96 of the influent compounds were considered for further processing 3 3 workflow evaluation step 6 matrix effect correction the enriched samples were measured with ref 10 influent and ref 50 effluent assuming comparable low matrix effects tisler et al 2021 however in chromatographic regions with many compounds eluting at the same time a retention time dependent matrix effect was still detectable this was evaluated by matrix effect profiles based on the tic of the samples tisler et al 2021 nürenberg et al 2015 have shown previously that no correction of the matrix effects can lead to the incorrect conclusion that some compounds have apparently higher concentrations in the effluent than influent the observed matrix effects in our samples always resulted in signal suppression which in most cases was less than 10 for effluent fig 2 lowest graph an exception was a valley starting at 3 2 min and ending at 6 min caused by many co eluting compounds in influent and effluent samples in contrast the influent samples had up to 48 suppression at early retention times 6 min and up to 37 in a later region of the chromatogram from 11 to 16 min the highest discrepancy of 32 between the matrix effects for the influent and effluent samples was observed around 5 2 min and highlights the need for accurate correction of matrix effects in order to accurately compare the data in the influent and effluent matrices the tic matrix effect correction was compared to the correction obtained using is for the samples from w1 in general the matrix effect correction was similar for the tic profile and the six iss fig 2 however venlafaxine d6 showed 10 higher suppression in both influent and effluent after is correction compared to tic matrix effect correction this can be explained by the greater compound specific matrix effect of venlafaxine in comparison to the median of the six pci compounds which were used for scaling the tic matrix effect fig s2 thus using venlafaxine d6 for is correction would overcorrect for many of the nts compounds the opposite can be observed in the influent sample for gabapentin d4 where the correction would be 13 less with this is compared to the tic matrix effect correction due to lower compound specific matrix effects of gabapentin in comparison to the median fig s2 this confirms that the is needs to be selected carefully for compounds where the is structure does not necessarily match the compound structure unlike the usual case in target screening to avoid under or overcorrection in severe matrix effect regions in general the is intensity showed 9 standard deviation evaluated by 15 different blank runs two different samples over time also taking this into account the range of tic and is correction was still in good agreement difference between 0 and 13 a remaining uncorrected matrix effect of up to 20 between influent and effluent seems not to hamper the overall comparison of treatment processes nürenberg et al 2019 3 4 step 7 intensity and threshold correction inter batch correction the influent samples were analyzed 6 months before the effluent samples stored at 20 c during this time for comparing samples which were run at different times intensity and threshold correction is required for evaluation the 3000 compounds which were detected in all sqc samples in both batches were used the sqc peak intensities were lower in the effluent batch than in the influent batch for 95 of the compounds the influent batch effluent batch ratio was between 1 and 5 while less intense compounds typically showed higher variation between the two batches fig 3 the peak intensity was on median 2 9 times higher in the influent sqcs compared to the effluent sqcs fig 3 evaluating the ratio for the suspect compounds detected in sqc 28 out of 31 compounds were in the mean 50 which means between factor 2 3 and 3 6 of the influent effluent ratio for reliable comparison between influent and effluent samples the peak intensities of the effluent samples were therefore divided by a factor of 1 7 5 2 9 as the intensity correction between batches the factor 5 accounts for the additional up concentration of the effluent samples compared to the influent samples in this study ref 50 for effluent samples compared to ref 10 for influent samples to avoid a bias in the peak detection not only the peak intensity was corrected in between batches but also the peak detection threshold due to the higher instrument sensitivity in the influent batch compound intensities could occur above the threshold in the influent samples and not in the effluent samples if the same threshold values were used the difficulty is to select a representative correction factor not to be too strict with the threshold correction due to the high relative variation of the peak intensity for smaller peaks choosing a strict threshold could lead to the appearance of false positive tps or degraded compounds for intensities close to the detection intensity threshold the detection intensity threshold for influent samples was 600 adjusting the effluent threshold by a factor 1 7 would therefore lead to a threshold of 1020 for effluent samples however because of variations in the intensities for small peaks the detection intensity thresholds for effluent samples were set between 600 some compounds were factor 5 less intense in effluent compared to influent but factor 5 more up concentrated in effluent and 3000 some compounds had same intensity in effluent and influent batch but factor 5 more up concentrated in effluent the following correction approaches for the effluent compounds were used to be as close as possible to the truth for nts compounds all compounds were kept if the effluent peak intensity was 1020 which is the detection intensity threshold after median intensity correction with factor 1 7 a compound was further considered to be detected in samples with intensities 1020 until 600 if the compound had a peak intensity 1020 in at least one of the effluent samples this ensures the cut off is not too strict and compounds are not discarded because of variations in the intensity threshold a compound was not further considered in the effluent if the intensity was for all samples below the lowest intensity threshold of 600 3 5 step 8 quality control comparison with target results on removal the workflow from step 1 to 7 was evaluated by comparing the removal of compounds with a target workflow for the target screening the effluent samples were measured directly before the influent samples compared with nts where there were 6 months in between and calibration standards and is compounds were used for quantification a total of ten target compounds were compared in four influent effluent pairs from w 1 w3 w4 and w6 table s3 the mean absolute difference after matrix effect correction between target and nts results was in all cases 10 fig s10 furthermore the matrix effect correction had minor influence on the calculated removal rate fig s10 and table s6 in the individual samples matrix effect correction changed the calculated degradation by up to 12 mostly moving the nts results closer to the target screening data thus the used ref factors were sufficiently low to reduce the matrix effects and the filtering and correction steps of the nts workflow were able to produce comparable data to target screening data using an internal standard calibration approach although the intensity correction between batches showed high variation for individual compounds the median correction factor was sufficient for the target compounds 3 6 step 9 prioritization by nts clustering of real samples 3 6 1 compound prioritization by comparing influent and effluent of four different wwtps compounds occurring in influent and effluent wastewater samples were compared for four wwtps w1 w3 w4 and w6 a compound was only included if it appeared in 2 out of 2 samples from the same wwtp at different days this was important to ensure the relevance of the compounds because the hydraulic retention time of the samples in the wwt process was neglected in the sampling 24 h sampling for influent and effluent started at the same time using these criteria 9755 compounds for influent and 1206 compounds for effluent samples were further processed fig 4 in the influent wastewater 28 of the compounds were similar in all four wwtps fig 4a whereas only 20 of the same compounds were present in all four effluent wastewaters a total of 77 compounds were detected in all influent and effluent samples a simpler overview is shown in fig 4b where compounds which are detected in at least 1 out of 4 wwtps are reported 93 of the compounds detected in influent samples were not detected in the effluent the combined effluent samples showed 43 compounds which were not detected in the influent this was in agreement with literature where around 50 of the effluent compounds are reported as tps in nts approaches schollée et al 2021 nürenberg et al 2019 in the intersection between influent and effluent of fig 4b 715 compounds were detected which can be considered as potential persistent micropollutants a closer look at the intensity of these compounds fig 4c shows that 293 compounds were 90 degraded 257 compounds were 50 degraded and 152 compounds were stable 50 degradation furthermore 10 compounds had higher intensities in the effluent wastewater the focus of this study was the identification of persistent micropollutants as well as tps which are discharged into the aquatic environment thus the 491 compounds only appearing in effluent as well as the 152 compounds with degradation 50 and the 10 compounds with higher intensity in the effluent were prioritized for compound identification in this study 653 compounds in total 3 6 2 tp prioritization the systematic identification of tps can be streamlined by comparing influent and effluent samples over a long sampling period where hydraulic retention time variations in the wwtp are eliminated we evaluated the optimal frequency of compounds occurring in the four days of w3 for a compromise to reduce the number of false positive and false negative annotated tps the evaluation is described in detail in section s6 in summary for the identification of tps in the nts workflow compounds which occurred in 2 out of 4 influents potential precursor were compared with compounds which occurred in 2 out of 4 effluent potential tps samples of w3 on this basis 34 of the effluent compounds were not occurring in the influent and classified as tps the relative amount of 34 effluent compounds classified as tps was smaller than 50 tps described in previous literature nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2021 this could be explainable by the more flexible replicate filtering whereby the probability is higher to find the same compound in both influent and effluent in the next step the tps were prioritized by comparing net mass shifts for potential precursor in influent and potential tp in effluent compounds for tp prioritization the precursor compounds needed to be selected carefully if all 9713 compounds detected in influent samples were used most of the potential reported tps were false positives this was concluded by the missing correlation between the potential precursor and tp in 1 retention time and 2 fragment pattern in most cases the retention time difference between tp and precursor was higher than the acceptable 2 min and no similar fragments between tp and precursor could be detected a similar approach was used by schollée et al 2015 separating potential precursor and tps by a pca and searching for the characteristic mass shifts they experienced similar challenges with too many compounds interferences in ms ms spectra and less meaningful spectra in general another study showed that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal was in agreement with nts compound removal but the representative micropollutant target compounds showed less biodegradation nürenberg et al 2019 thus we assume that the high number of easily biodegradable compounds are natural compounds rather than anthropogenic micropollutants and thus only form a limited number of stable micropollutant tps that are analyzable with lchrms therefore precursor compounds were only considered if they were not removed completely in w3 intersection in fig s13 venn diagram b 782 compounds as potential tps all pre filtered compounds in the effluent wastewater of w3 were considered 402 compounds the net mass shift search for all investigated reactions revealed 50 potential precursor tp pairs thus 50 potential tps were considered for further investigation matching to 32 potential precursor compounds 3 7 step 10 and 11 identification of prioritized compounds 3 7 1 matching with library as a first step the 653 prioritized compounds from section 3 6 1 were compared with the exact mass 0 002 da of compounds in the norman substance database stoffident furthermore the rts needed to be in the range of 2 min 94 confidence level from the predicted rt from the 653 prioritized compounds from the previous chapter 399 were assigned to match with the database however only 190 compounds were left after including predicted rt as a criterion in the identification scheme compounds were further filtered by plausibility checks available literature to assess a potential wwtp discharge can be seen in document si c and ms ms library comparison in total 48 compounds were identified with a confidence score between 75 and 100 document si c identified compounds furthermore the same workflow was used to identify compounds in effluent samples where no matching influent sample was available further 13 compounds could be identified confidence scores between 65 and 80 overall analytical standards were available to confirm the identities of 33 of the 61 compounds 3 7 2 identification of tps by the tp identification described in section 3 6 2 13 additional tps for the high intense precursor compounds losartan los deet fexofenadine fxf and metoprolol mtp could be tentatively identified suggested chemical structures are listed in s7 besides the well known tp los carboxylic acid four additional tps of los could be identified los 2h los 2o 2h los o 2h los 2o 4h an intermediate in the formation of los carboxylic acid could be los 2h ioannidi et al 2022 the identified compound los 2o 2h was also described previously in the literature but as a metabolite in blood katyayan and hui 2019 another identified tp that has not been previously described in wastewater was an isomer of los carboxylic acid suggesting a carbonylation on another functional group suggested structures in s7 the fourth tp was los 2o 4h probably formed by the carbonylated los for mtp two tps were identified mtp o 2h has not been previously detected in wastewater but only in lab experiments rubirola et al 2014 the dehydrogenated tp mtp 2h was newly identified in our study four tps were identified for fxf fxf 2h has been reported previously in wastewater henning et al 2019 fxf o fxf ch2 and fxf ch2 have to our knowledge never been reported before in wastewater the tps derived from deet were deet o which has been reported previously in ozonation experiments li et al 2019 furthermore two compounds were identified with the same fragments as deet and were tentatively identified as tps deet ch2 and deet 2c2h4 for all tps at least two main fragments were identified which were in common with the precursor same fragment or the fragment plus the net mass shift of the reaction in general the confidence score for tps was lower than for the precursors because the structure could not be unambiguously identified mainly due to at least two possibilities for the modified site meaning that the 10 points unique hit score could not be included the retention times for all los and mtp tps were predicted within the 2 min range thus they had a confidence score of 80 the deet tps had the lowest score of 50 due 3 to 4 min deviations from the predicted retention time a special case was fxf which was the only compound out of all 76 suspect compounds where the predicted retention time was more than 4 min off however kept due to the unambiguous identification with analytical standard a reason could be that the training set of the rt prediction document si b was not representing the fxf structure as a result the rt prediction for the fxf tp could not be conducted however the tps showed retention times in the 2 min window of fxf as would be expected from empirical studies for these transformation reactions gulde et al 2016 the fxf tps were assigned to a confidence score of 65 only 15 points instead of 30 points for rt prediction included 3 8 fate of identified stable compounds and tps in the wwtps after data pre processing and identification the fate of the identified compounds in the wwtps was investigated four compounds showed 50 degradation in all wwtps tetroxoprim gabapentin metoprolol acid theobromine but the main focus was on the persistent micropollutants and tps thirty six of the identified compounds were classified as persistent as they had on average 50 peak intensity in the effluent compared to influent fig 5 most of these were precursor compounds but also some human metabolites e g los carboxylic acid verapamil metabolite were in this class the industrial compound 1 3 diphenylguanidine the human metabolite of methadone eddp and the anti psychotic drug amisulpride showed no significant degradation in any of the wwtps 1 3 diphenylguanidine is well known to be ubiquitous in surface waters zahn et al 2019 likely originating from tires in road runoff however to our knowledge its fate has never been reported in wwtps before the absence of degradation of eddp and amisulpride was in agreement with other studies boleda et al 2009 bollmann et al 2016 in addition the peak intensities of 20 compounds were at least two times higher in the effluent than in the corresponding influent sample most of the formed compounds were identified as tps where some are already known to be more toxic than the precursor e g gabapentin lactam henning et al 2018 however the precursor compounds carbamazepine and lamotrigine were also formed which has been attributed previously as cleavage of glucuronide conjugates in the treatment process bollmann et al 2016 the two los metabolites carboxylic acid and los 2h were already detected in the influent because of their formation in the human metabolism ioannidi et al 2022 also fxf ch2 was detected in two influent samples indicating that the compound was produced both before and after the wwtp however the remaining 11 newly identified tps were detected only in effluent samples which strongly suggest that these compounds were formed in the wwtp process the fate of the newly identified tps is shown in detail in fig s14 3 9 relative comparison of identified compounds in wastewater effluent the identified compounds were screened in 25 effluent samples from eight wwtps 4xw1 4xw2 4xw3 4xw4 2xw5 3xw6 2xw7 2xw8 32 compounds were detected in all 25 samples where four of them were the newly identified tps los 2h o2 los 2h o mtp o 2h fxf 2h fig s15 the most intense peaks were fxf antihistamine fxf 2h tapendatol pharmaceutical and drug of abuse and 2 4 diethylamino 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzoic acid industrial metabolite or from sunscreen in all samples in general the compounds were quite evenly distributed between the wwtps exceptions were the unique detection of propylparaben mirtazapin and carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide in w6 n butylbenzenesulfonamide only in all w1 samples and metribuzin only in w8 terbutylazin as well as terbutylazin 2 hydroxy showed a higher occurrence in w7 it was interesting to note the unique detection of amitryptilin antipsychotic chlorprothixene antipsychotic melitracen antidepressant and morphine narcotic in w3 samples a specific source such as a big psychiatric hospital was not definitively identified in this catchment area a comparison of all the detected compounds using a principal component analysis pca fig 6 of auto scaled peak intensities showed that the wwtps from the capital region w1 3 were clustering together as well as the samples from the island of funen w4 8 interestingly the loading plot showed that the six compounds we assigned to potential drugs of abuse methadone methadone tp eddp amphetamine morphine tapentadol ritalinic acid were associated to the samples from the capital region in the score plot a similar clustering towards the capital region could be seen for the antipsychotic and antidepressant compounds as well as for the four chemicals assigned to cosmetic ingredients on the other hand the three epileptic agents carbamazepine gabapentin lamotrigine plus their two tps were assigned to the more rural area of funen no general trend could be observed for the class of herbicide compounds 6 compounds fig 6 but metribuzin was reported previously as a herbicide detected in rural areas hu et al 2017 which was also observed here 73 herb in fig 6 among the other compound classes no specific clustering could be observed 4 conclusion the nts workflow presented in this study shows a solution for achieving comparable data across samples analyzed at different times and in different matrices this approach can be used for prioritizing and identifying persistent compounds and tps in wastewater intra batch intensity drifts inter batch threshold variation and matrix effects are important correction steps for the comparison of a high number of different samples analyzed at different times the obtained screening data can be used for retrospective analysis samples analyzed in the future and processed with the same workflow can be added to the sample comparison therefore the preparation and preservation of a stable sqc sample is crucial which needs to be included in each batch for comparable analysis the nts workflow shows how the differences and treatment efficiencies between different wwtps can be characterized by unknown compounds nts prioritization by comparing influent and effluent samples reveals persistent compounds and tps the wastewater composition can reflect the different consumer patterns potential drugs of abuse anti psychotic and anti depressant drugs were predominant in the capital region whereas antiepileptic drugs and agricultural pesticides were predominant in

15937,the rapid emergence of deep learning long short term memory lstm technique presents a promising solution to algal bloom forecasting however the discontinuous and non stationary processes within algal dynamics still largely limit the functions of lstms to overcome this challenge an advanced time frequency wavelet analysis wa technique was introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy of lstms herein the novel hybrid approach named wlstm successfully decreased the algal forecasting inaccuracy of classic lstms by 41 8 in lake mendota wisconsin usa with powerful one step ahead predictions at hourly daily and monthly time resolutions r 2 0 976 0 878 and 0 814 respectively in addition the wlstm outperformed the other two widely used algal forecasting approaches deep neural network dnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model represented by average 72 and 85 decrease in root mean square error respectively furthermore the wlstm was implemented in an experimentally fertilized lake lake tuesday michigan for a multi step forecasting examination it satisfactorily forecasted the algal fluctuations involving substantial peak and extreme values average r 2 0 900 and presented accurate judgment outcomes to their bloom levels with high accuracy 95 on average this work highlighted the utility of deep learning approaches in effective early warning for algal blooms and demonstrated an important direction for improving the adaptability of conventional deep learning approaches to the aquatic problems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bloom forecasting deep learning long short term memory lstm wavelet analysis 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs have increased worldwide especially in the regions that are under the intense influence of climate change and human activities paerl and scott 2010 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 xiao et al 2019a such a hab event occurring in aquatic habitat may cause critical environmental issues through toxic production and high biomass accumulation posing great risks to the ecosystem health and water security heisler et al 2008 zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 the problems arising from habs have become a globally major concern anderson et al 2002 hallegraeff 1993 modeling techniques to proactively predict in situ algal dynamics are important for local hab management a powerful model can be both beneficial in formulating strategies for the habs inhibition and in early planning to mitigate negative impacts from a bloom event that is impending or already underway coad et al 2014 glibert et al 2010 nevertheless considering the complex disturbances of external environments and the non linear and non stationary nature of algal dynamics li et al 2015 zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 the forecasting of algal blooms remains a challenging work particularly for the traditional statistical models based on a priori form lacking self adaptability e g linear regression autoregressive moving average models ömer faruk 2010 zhang 2003 machine learning is well known to be useful in approximating complicated real world observations zhong et al 2021 popular algorithms including the neural networks deng et al 2021 hadjisolomou et al 2021 support vector regressions gonzález vilas et al 2014 he et al 2020 random forests harris and graham 2017 segura et al 2017 and gradient boost machines xia et al 2020 have been widely applied in hab predictions recently given the algorithmic advancements in machine learning the emergence of deep learning techniques such as the long short term memory lstm has received increasing attention in the modeling domain of time series as an advanced recurrent network the state of the art lstm is capable of automatically discovering the underlying temporal dependencies of sequence data through multiple hidden information processing layers while avoiding the gradient vanishing and gradient exploding problems in the recurrent training process deng 2014 nourani and behfar 2021 it was observed that this progress in lstms improved the prediction of non linear algal blooms huang et al 2021 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 however pure data driven approaches are often inadequate to cope with the highly varying periodicity of algal dynamics i e non stationarity wang et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 in practice an appropriate data pre processing procedure for the input time series is often needed which plays an important role in utilizing algorithmic advantages of modeling approaches cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 in recent decades the highly developed wavelet analysis wa has appeared to be practical in addressing the non stationary difficulty nourani et al 2014 the wa is an advanced time frequency analysis technique that overcame the drawbacks of classic fourier analysis which requires stationary and linear time series data labat 2005 comparatively wa is robust to the noisy components and can provide multiple time scale presentations for the observed signals which is useful for the interpretation of non stationary information in a time series analysis daubechies 1990 labat 2005 li et al 2015 nourani and behfar 2021 it was shown that the input signal data decomposed by wa could contain more details and could largely benefit the learning of original signals by empirical models kisi and cimen 2011 nourani et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 therefore in this study we hypothesized that the hybrid of the deep learning lstm algorithm and the time frequency wa technique namely the wavelet lstm wlstm would increase the modeling capacity to capture algal dynamics and thus enhance the forecasting performance of classic lstms therefore the main objective of this work was to explore the algal bloom forecasting by the hybrid wlstm approach to achieve the goal 1 the proposed wlstm was developed and validated for one step forecasting of daily algal dynamics in lake mendota wisconsin 2 considering the wide temporal variabilities of algal dynamics the validation was simultaneously conducted at hourly and monthly time resolutions 3 in addition to the conventional lstm the wlstm was also cross compared with two other state of the art hab forecasting approaches at hourly daily and monthly resolution levels i e deep neural network dnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model 4 to further test its robustness and serviceability under extreme and frequent bloom conditions the wlstm was implemented in an experimentally fertilized lake lake tuesday michigan for a multi step forecasting examination the hybrid wlstm approach could serve as a reliable and cost effective hab forecasting tool for water management in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 monitoring data of algal dynamics in the lake mendota and the lake tuesday the location of lake mendota is near madison city southern wisconsin usa fig 1 it is a main drainage lake of the yahara watershed with a highly developed shoreline of 33 8 km and a surface area of 39 61 km2 as a eutrophic lake it has frequently experienced intense phytoplankton blooms over the past decades neal 1987 in 1995 lake mendota was added to the north temperate lakes long term ecological research ntl lter https lter limnology wisc edu project and has been continuously monitored at a regular frequency every 2 weeks during the ice free season march to september every 6 weeks during the ice covered season since then in addition an instrumented buoy with multiple limnological sensors was deployed on lake mendota which started to provide high resolution 1 min monitoring information from 2006 such as the chlorophyll concentration turbidity conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen as shown in table 1 mean monthly cyanobacterial dynamics for a 23 year period january 1995 to november 2018 were derived from the lter monitored data magnuson et al 2020a and were quantified as a natural unit using cell biomass mg l hourly and daily average values of chlorophyll concentration from 01 apr 2020 were calculated from the original high resolution data magnuson et al 2020b measured with a multi parameter analyzer ysi exo2 yellow springs instrument inc usa and were reported as relative fluorescence units rfu for further development of forecast models lake tuesday is located in the upper peninsula michigan usa fig 1 it is a relatively small and shallow lake in oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions before the whole lake manipulation from 2013 to 2015 a fertilization experiment was conducted there pace et al 2021a in this experiment the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus were gradually added to the lake each year from mid may to early september to cause algal blooms meanwhile the high frequency chlorophyll fluorometer hydrolab ds5x hydrolab inc u s a was deployed in this lake to continuously collect chlorophyll a chl a concentrations ug l at 5 minute intervals similar to the lake mendota daily averaged chl a dynamics were calculated based on the source monitored data pace et al 2021b and formed the modeling dataset for the lake tuesday table 1 additionally to determine the outbreak conditions of algal blooms in lake tuesday two chl a thresholds related to the health based drinking water supplies were adopted 1 μg l and 12 μg l as defined by the alert level framework of the world health organization world health organization 2021 the first threshold corresponds to the alert level i representing an early stage of blooms and the second threshold corresponds to the alert level ii representing the heavy stage of bloom situation 2 2 wlstm model development 2 2 1 the deep learning algorithm lstm network the lstm network is a special form of recurrent neural network rnn which is a variant of a deep neural network that can learn temporal dependency from sequential data using loop structure in the lstm memory blocks are introduced to replace the hidden neurons for connecting hidden layers fig 2 each memory block consists of a memory cell c an input gate i a forget gate f and an output gate o by either updating or removing previously accumulated information to the memory cell through three control gates the lstm can well learn the remote dependencies and overcome the gradient exploding and vanishing issues in the backpropagation of conventional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the learning process and internal structure of the lstm memory block was presented in fig 2a more algorithmic details and demonstrations were in the supporting information text s1 and fig 2b showed a basic architecture of lstm network modeled on the sequential inputs to improve the overall performance in deep learning a standard technique of model ensemble was applied in the lstm network where multiple independent models with the same structure were trained and their predictions were combined dietterich 2000 fig 2c showed an illustration of the ensemble of lstm networks 2 2 2 the time frequency analysis technique discrete wavelet transformation wavelet transformation wt is a useful mathematical tool in signal theory after fourier transformation which overcomes the limitations of fourier transformation in analyzing non stationary time series labat 2005 by decomposing the main time series into time frequency space to obtain several sub series the wt can effectively extract specific time and frequency features from the original series simultaneously to achieve this task the sub series are generally derived from a template known as the mother wavelet in which these decomposed wavelets are scaled and translated according to the mother wavelet yet the calculation of scale and translation parameters at every possible position requires substantial computation work for a wt e g continuous wavelet transformation cwt herein the discrete wavelet transformation dwt considerably reduces the computational complexities to apply wt as its scale and position are usually based on powers of two called dyadic scales and positions cannas et al 2006 the dwt of series f t is often conducted as follows 1 w f j k j k z f t ψ j k t 2 ψ j k t a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j t b 0 k a 0 1 b 0 0 where j and k are the integers controlling the decomposition level and translation respectively a 0 is the constant scale factor of decomposition usually is 2 b 0 is the constant position factor of translation usually is 1 ψ j k t is the wavelet function ψ t is the mother wavelet and w f j k are the dwt coefficients then a low frequency approximation sub series an and some high frequency detail sub series d1 d2 dn can be obtained by repetitively passing the approximation coefficients through the low pass filter and the high pass filter at each decomposition level till the preset level is reached 2 2 3 hybrid architecture of wlstm model the hybrid wlstm model was developed by combining the wavelet transformation and lstm network fig 3 the wlstm modeling mainly has three stages 1 the dwt of the original series of algal dynamics 2 the input and forecasting of each sub series using the ensembled lstm method individually 3 and the re composition of individual output series for the final forecasted results 2 2 4 model training and prediction to appropriately train the deep learning lstm modules within the wlstm structure our modeling procedure included two phases a calibration and b prediction in the calibration phase the first 80 of series data were used to construct the networks to avoid over fitting problems the constructing data were randomly divided into 70 training set and 30 testing set for conducting cross validation in which the networks were trained and tested respectively after the cross validation was complete the model and parameters that performed best on the testing set would be retained for conducting the ensembling we repeated this procedure multiple times with each time performed on a different random train test split of the constructing data and then averaged the outputs dietterich 2000 in the prediction phase predictions were made on new datasets based on the calibrated models we implemented both the first 80 of series data i e the entire constructing data and the remaining 20 of series data the unused data to finally evaluate the model performances on in sample and out of sample datasets respectively while in the case of lake tuesday 2013 and 2014 data were used for constructing and 2015 data for out of sample prediction we implemented our lstm network using the deep learning framework of pytorch paszke et al 2017 for computational efficiency a grid search scheme based on mini batch stochastic gradient optimization was used for tuning the network hyperparameters see tables s1 s2 we trained an ensemble of 15 lstm models according to our prior experiment on the effect of ensemble number on lstm performance see fig s1 in this study the daubechies 4 db4 was applied as a mother wavelet to decompose the original main series into 3 levels due to its wide acceptance and high efficiency nourani et al 2014 the dwt procedures were accomplished in the matlab software using the wavelet toolbox 2 3 the other time series forecasting approaches for comparison dnn and arima for comparison purposes the classical deep learning approach the deep neural network dnn i e multi layer feed forward network with back propagation algorithm and the traditional univariate time series prediction approach the autoregressive integrated moving average arima models were also developed and tested detailed information about the two approaches were in supporting information text s2 to conduct this the dnn network was trained based on mini batch stochastic gradient optimization using a grid search procedure with the sklearn library in python 3 8 software pedregosa et al 2019 and the combinations of model hyperparameters scored the lowest testing loss were lastly selected see also tables s1 s2 we also trained an ensemble of 15 dnn models using the same technique as the lstm for the arima approach models were constructed using the auto arima function of package forecast in r environment hyndman and khandakar 2008 via three iterative steps of model identification parameter estimation and model checking 2 4 data processing in this study the inputs of deep learning models were recomposed from the raw time series s we used the first three data points sn sn 1 sn 2 of s to forecast the data points with the time lags of d sn 2 d see text s3 in the supporting information for more details the time lag d was set to 1 2 and 3 respectively depending on the case studied for wlstm modeling the raw time series s was replaced by the decomposed sub series accordingly i e an d1 d2 dn fig 3 to facilitate the training of lstm and dnn models the input data were pre normalized the normalization was denoted by 3 x i x i x x s d where the x i is the normalized value of observed x i x and x s d are the mean and standard deviation of the observed data respectively 2 5 model assessments to measure the deviation of predicted values from the observed values the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used and calculated as 4 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 5 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 6 n r m s e r m s e y m a x y m i n where n is the total number of data points y i and y i are the i th predicted and observed values y is the mean of y i y m a x and y m i n are the maxima and minima of y i the predicted values were also used to judge the algal bloom alert levels in lake tuesday therefore to evaluate the performance on classification the accuracy overall accurate rate tpr true positive rate and tnr true negative rate were applied based

lstm firstly the wlstm approach was developed and verified on the daily algal dynamics in lake mendota wisconsin the monitored daily average algal dynamics of lake mendota was shown in fig 4 a apr 1 to nov 6 2020 in detail the annual algal growth presented a common downward trend with main peaks concentrated in the first three months i e mid spring to early summer in this non stationary signal mode although the use of the lstm model successfully learned algal variations in the calibration phase the latter prediction showed unsatisfactory forecasting results fig 5 b as indicated by the calculated r2 rmse and nrmse in table 2 furthermore it can also be seen from fig 5b that several sharp changes occurred around the 40th and 80th day causing large simulation errors to the lstm model despite it achieving high overall calibration performance when coupled with the time frequency wavelet algorithm the performance of the wlstm model significantly improved with an increase of 10 to 57 compared to the original lstm model table 2 fig 5b table s3 the wavelet decomposition of daily original algal series s usefully produced an approximation coefficient a3 and three levels of detailed coefficients d1 d3 shown in fig 4b 4e compared with the main series the general trend and major peaks of s were identified by the low frequency sub series a3 while its more subtle characteristics were simultaneously captured and presented in the high frequency sub series level by level from d1 to d3 moreover the apparent simulation errors along with the sudden boost or cut of the algal population in the lstm model were well diminished and smoothed by the hybrid wlstm method fig 5b noticeably further validation both proved better forecasting performance of the wlstm approach at both hourly and monthly time resolutions as compared to the lstm approach table 2 fig 5 especially in the long term monthly validation case fig 5c the performance of wlstms achieved approximately 3 to 6 times higher accuracy than the conventional lstm in terms of r2 statistic 0 858 vs 0 278 in calibration and 0 814 vs 0 036 in prediction respectively moreover the wlstm presented more accurate predictions of the extreme situations that frequently occurred in monthly algal time series fig 5c with around 60 reduction in the forecasting error table s3 in addition the highest forecasting accuracy of wlstm was reached at the finest hourly resolution shown by its biggest r2 0 991 and 0 976 smallest rmse 0 116 and 0 052 rfu and lowest nrmse 0 020 and 0 027 all of these evidences indicated that the developed hybrid wlstm method can reliably forecast the algal dynamics on multiple time scales ranging from hours to months 3 2 comparisons of the hybrid wlstm and other time series forecasting approaches the hybrid wlstm and the other two widely used time series forecasting approaches dnn and arima were also cross compared based on the algal dynamics in the lake mendota table 2 table s3 the detailed performance of the calibration and prediction via dnn and arima was shown in fig s2 for the dnn approach the best forecasting was achieved at the hourly resolution with highly satisfactory rmse and nrmse values which is consistent with the wlstm and lstm approaches but still the hourly forecasting performance of dnn dropped by 30 to 90 as compared to wlstm in terms of rmse and nrmse interestingly although the dnn models performed better than lstm at the monthly resolution r2 values of 0 161 it was still largely worse than the wlstm approach with r2 value of 0 858 and performed poorly in predicting the extreme values fig s2c as for the arima approach all models presented the lowest performance among the three cases studied table 2 showing its limitation in coping with non stationary and complicated forecasting problems of algal dynamics furthermore the recommended arima structure of ar order p differencing degree d and ma order q were the arima 3 1 2 arima 0 1 0 and arima 4 0 2 corresponding to the hourly daily and monthly models respectively please see text s4 this indicated that the arima required a longer time series than the other three deep learning network based approaches to construct a forecasting model generally the wlstm technique showed huge advantages over the conventional neural network and the statistical arima method 3 3 further application of the hybrid wlstm in an experimental fertilized lake to test its robustness and serviceability we further applied the hybrid wlstm approach in a lake with experimental fertilization lake tuesday fig 6 in this lake the excessive nutrient loads apparently triggered the algal over proliferations in which the daily chl a concentrations exceeded the early bloom stage threshold all year round i e alert level i 1 μg l in addition the large and variational fluctuations of algal dynamics can be observed there ranging from 7 4 to 34 4 ug l of chl a much higher than that of an unmanipulated lake such as the lake mendota with chl a maximumly ranged from 0 1 to 14 3 mg l fig 5c table 1 leading to an increase of mutation and extreme points within the time series fig 6 satisfactory simulations of the algal dynamics were observed in the three wlstm models with an output time lag of 1 2 and 3 days respectively figs 6 7 table 3 table s3 among three models the optimal performance was obtained using the forecasting interval of 1 day as revealed by the highest values of r2 in calibration 0 987 and prediction 0 971 nevertheless it should also be noticed that models for the longer intervals of 2 and 3 days both achieved satisfactory results which was valuable for the flexible deployment of forecasting work furthermore no clear behavior of model overestimation or underestimation on the peak or extreme values was observed and all wlstm models successfully forecasted 217 100 exceedances of the level i threshold in the calibration phase and 109 100 in the prediction phase figs 6 7 for the exceedances of level ii an average accuracy rate of 92 5 was accomplished with tpr 93 1 t p r 95 1 and tnr 59 3 t n r 82 8 overall the hybrid wlstm technique showed a high power in forecasting algal bloom events of the next multiple time steps 4 discussion firstly our results revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence based algorithms lstm wlstm and dnn in the habs forecast as compared to the traditional linear arima model due to various environmental impacts such as climatic status xiao et al 2019b 2019a hydrological condition cha et al 2017 park et al 2015 and nutritional level beaulieu et al 2013 heisler et al 2008 the dynamics of algal growth were usually shown as a shifty and step by step process characterized by irregular or time limited time series that was considered to be non linear and non stationary li et al 2015 yu et al 2020 in our study the evaluations of arima models e g monthly r 2 0 27 table 2 indicate that this complicated time series data is too challenging for the traditional methods which are often shown to be poor to address hab forecasting problems he et al 2020 ömer faruk 2010 xiao et al 2017 fortunately the robust performance of deep learning approaches lstm wlstm and dnn presents promising solutions to this modeling predicament table 2 in fact given the rapid development of such computational intelligence approaches in the ecological field they have been gradually proven to be well suited to cope with the complex and real world aquatic dataset filled with uncertainties alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 kouadri et al 2021 rousso et al 2020 especially due to the useful characteristics e g the self learning of sequence dependencies and the efficient structure of gate units the lstm approach has been widely suggested to be useful to reliably handle the non linear hab dynamics cho et al 2018 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 however out of our expectation the increscent temporal variations and non stationary oscillations in algal time series still posed great forecasting difficulties to the advanced lstm structures its prediction r 2 decreased largely from 0 958 hourly to 0 615 daily and 0 036 monthly even lower than the conventional multi layered network table 2 as we anticipated the incorporation of the time frequency wt technique significantly enhanced the lstm approach table 2 fig 5 compared to the individual lstm the forecasting errors of algal dynamics by the hybrid wlstm were reduced at all three resolutions with an average decrease of 24 44 and 55 in terms of rmse respectively specifically the wt in the wlstm structure functioned as a powerful pre processing tool that could remove most of the irregular and noisy components from the raw series and extract its cyclic signals with expeditious dyadic decompositions cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 the extracted sub series present multi timescale specialties of the original series periodically or quasi periodically facilitating and promoting the algorithmic advantages of lstm in processing series data furthermore the parallel forecasting process of these sub series could significantly reduce the error accumulations by the lstm recursive strategy du et al 2018 this is why in the present study the wlstm technique can lead to significant increases in the lstm and outperform the other techniques in algal dynamics prediction table 2 table s3 more interestingly the wlstm model was also observed to be intensively powerful in simulating peak and extreme values with algal dynamics figs 5b 5c figs s2b s2c table s3 typically it is difficult for a data driven model to accurately predict extreme situations since this type of model would tend to treat extreme values as outliers before carrying out their normal predictions song et al 2021 however due to the robust resistance and smoothing capability of wt to the irregular signals the inclusion of extreme components in decomposed input sub series can be substantiallydecreased this not only reduces the probability that wt coupled models detect the original outliers and thus disrupt the normal prediction but also again could lead to a great fitting increase in the well transformed mutations or extreme points du et al 2018 nourani et al 2014 as the hab occurrences are usually accompanied by sharp changes in algal biomass dynamics the low forecasting error to extreme value is especially useful for the reliable judgment of hab events for instance for the eutrophic water in which high biomass habs frequently occur the lake tuesday here our wlstm satisfactorily forecasted the highly dynamic process of algal blooms fig 6 and presented accurate judgment outcomes to its bloom levels based on the predicted values table 3 such progress made in habs models can provide not only more reliable support for the managers but also a better interpretation of this phenomenon in scientific research cross comparison between the time resolution showed that the greatest forecasting improvement of hab dynamics by wlstm was in the largest resolution monthly such outcomes on the one hand were partially contributed by the unsatisfactory predictions of lstm models based on a monthly dataset compared to the short term time series in relatively fine time resolutions such as hourly and daily the long term monthly series not only vary over a wide scale of time frequencies but could be easily contaminated by intensive cross periodic oscillations and noises namely highly non stationary li et al 2015 it is evident that the computation intelligence methods still exhibit drawbacks to respond to this circumstance though they own high capability and flexibility in modeling sequential processes cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 wang et al 2013 nevertheless on the other hand it is also reported that the underlying periodicity pattern is more dominant in the larger time scale series than in smaller ones nourani et al 2014 thus by decomposing main time series into time frequency space the latent modes of periodicity components that existed in such series can be detected and fed to the lstm to further improve hab forecasting at a large monthly resolution this is not alone in the literature reported by nourani and behfar 2021 their wlstm approach presented analogous modeling results for the runoff sediment process closed to our time series patterns of algal dynamics this again indicates that the wlstm technique could be useful for developing multi temporal scale hab prediction models we also tested the multi step predictability of hybrid wlstm models in another fertilized lake lake tuesday along with the increase of time lags from 1 day to 3 days the forecasting accuracy by the wlstm approach gradually decreased from 0 971 to 0 843 in terms of prediction r 2 the similar phenomenon appeared in many lstm based models for instance based on the 12 year time series of six water quality parameters liang et al 2020 observed a roughly 50 drop in the performance of lstm when making predictions for chl a dynamics with the time lag increased from 1 day to 31 days zheng et al 2021 and shan et al 2022 also found that the forecasting power of lstms reduced in the next multiple time steps 1 h to 12 days where the rmse of chl a predictions enlarged by an average of 1 5 to 2 times this indicated that the autocorrelation structure of algal time series could gradually dispel with the increase of time lag consequently leading to adverse impacts on the overall modeling accuracy shamshirband et al 2019 in addition it showed the benefits of automatic capture of long temporal information via lstm recurrent chains which may not successfully work to improve the performance but increase the convergence complexity if the lag time of prediction task is too long yang et al 2019 therefore despite a model with multi step predictability which would be valuable for the practical deployments selecting an appropriate time lag is still an important concern for the hab forecasting using wlstm 5 conclusion in this work we developed a promising hybrid hab forecasting approach wlstm combining the wavelet analysis technique wt with a deep learning model lstm which a performed better than the state of the art time series tools including lstm dnn and arima b robustly predicted algal dynamics at the hourly daily monthly resolutions c showed powerful multi step ahead predictability and had high overall judgment accuracy to the extreme algal bloom situations over alert thresholds therefore the hybrid approach could be a practical and useful tool for the early warning and management of algal blooms however the current research mainly focused on the hybrid use of discrete wavelet transformation and conventional structured lstms in future research more effective time frequency analysis techniques and more advanced deep learning models will be explored to further improve the

15937,the rapid emergence of deep learning long short term memory lstm technique presents a promising solution to algal bloom forecasting however the discontinuous and non stationary processes within algal dynamics still largely limit the functions of lstms to overcome this challenge an advanced time frequency wavelet analysis wa technique was introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy of lstms herein the novel hybrid approach named wlstm successfully decreased the algal forecasting inaccuracy of classic lstms by 41 8 in lake mendota wisconsin usa with powerful one step ahead predictions at hourly daily and monthly time resolutions r 2 0 976 0 878 and 0 814 respectively in addition the wlstm outperformed the other two widely used algal forecasting approaches deep neural network dnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model represented by average 72 and 85 decrease in root mean square error respectively furthermore the wlstm was implemented in an experimentally fertilized lake lake tuesday michigan for a multi step forecasting examination it satisfactorily forecasted the algal fluctuations involving substantial peak and extreme values average r 2 0 900 and presented accurate judgment outcomes to their bloom levels with high accuracy 95 on average this work highlighted the utility of deep learning approaches in effective early warning for algal blooms and demonstrated an important direction for improving the adaptability of conventional deep learning approaches to the aquatic problems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal bloom forecasting deep learning long short term memory lstm wavelet analysis 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs have increased worldwide especially in the regions that are under the intense influence of climate change and human activities paerl and scott 2010 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 xiao et al 2019a such a hab event occurring in aquatic habitat may cause critical environmental issues through toxic production and high biomass accumulation posing great risks to the ecosystem health and water security heisler et al 2008 zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 the problems arising from habs have become a globally major concern anderson et al 2002 hallegraeff 1993 modeling techniques to proactively predict in situ algal dynamics are important for local hab management a powerful model can be both beneficial in formulating strategies for the habs inhibition and in early planning to mitigate negative impacts from a bloom event that is impending or already underway coad et al 2014 glibert et al 2010 nevertheless considering the complex disturbances of external environments and the non linear and non stationary nature of algal dynamics li et al 2015 zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 the forecasting of algal blooms remains a challenging work particularly for the traditional statistical models based on a priori form lacking self adaptability e g linear regression autoregressive moving average models ömer faruk 2010 zhang 2003 machine learning is well known to be useful in approximating complicated real world observations zhong et al 2021 popular algorithms including the neural networks deng et al 2021 hadjisolomou et al 2021 support vector regressions gonzález vilas et al 2014 he et al 2020 random forests harris and graham 2017 segura et al 2017 and gradient boost machines xia et al 2020 have been widely applied in hab predictions recently given the algorithmic advancements in machine learning the emergence of deep learning techniques such as the long short term memory lstm has received increasing attention in the modeling domain of time series as an advanced recurrent network the state of the art lstm is capable of automatically discovering the underlying temporal dependencies of sequence data through multiple hidden information processing layers while avoiding the gradient vanishing and gradient exploding problems in the recurrent training process deng 2014 nourani and behfar 2021 it was observed that this progress in lstms improved the prediction of non linear algal blooms huang et al 2021 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 however pure data driven approaches are often inadequate to cope with the highly varying periodicity of algal dynamics i e non stationarity wang et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 in practice an appropriate data pre processing procedure for the input time series is often needed which plays an important role in utilizing algorithmic advantages of modeling approaches cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 in recent decades the highly developed wavelet analysis wa has appeared to be practical in addressing the non stationary difficulty nourani et al 2014 the wa is an advanced time frequency analysis technique that overcame the drawbacks of classic fourier analysis which requires stationary and linear time series data labat 2005 comparatively wa is robust to the noisy components and can provide multiple time scale presentations for the observed signals which is useful for the interpretation of non stationary information in a time series analysis daubechies 1990 labat 2005 li et al 2015 nourani and behfar 2021 it was shown that the input signal data decomposed by wa could contain more details and could largely benefit the learning of original signals by empirical models kisi and cimen 2011 nourani et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 therefore in this study we hypothesized that the hybrid of the deep learning lstm algorithm and the time frequency wa technique namely the wavelet lstm wlstm would increase the modeling capacity to capture algal dynamics and thus enhance the forecasting performance of classic lstms therefore the main objective of this work was to explore the algal bloom forecasting by the hybrid wlstm approach to achieve the goal 1 the proposed wlstm was developed and validated for one step forecasting of daily algal dynamics in lake mendota wisconsin 2 considering the wide temporal variabilities of algal dynamics the validation was simultaneously conducted at hourly and monthly time resolutions 3 in addition to the conventional lstm the wlstm was also cross compared with two other state of the art hab forecasting approaches at hourly daily and monthly resolution levels i e deep neural network dnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model 4 to further test its robustness and serviceability under extreme and frequent bloom conditions the wlstm was implemented in an experimentally fertilized lake lake tuesday michigan for a multi step forecasting examination the hybrid wlstm approach could serve as a reliable and cost effective hab forecasting tool for water management in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 monitoring data of algal dynamics in the lake mendota and the lake tuesday the location of lake mendota is near madison city southern wisconsin usa fig 1 it is a main drainage lake of the yahara watershed with a highly developed shoreline of 33 8 km and a surface area of 39 61 km2 as a eutrophic lake it has frequently experienced intense phytoplankton blooms over the past decades neal 1987 in 1995 lake mendota was added to the north temperate lakes long term ecological research ntl lter https lter limnology wisc edu project and has been continuously monitored at a regular frequency every 2 weeks during the ice free season march to september every 6 weeks during the ice covered season since then in addition an instrumented buoy with multiple limnological sensors was deployed on lake mendota which started to provide high resolution 1 min monitoring information from 2006 such as the chlorophyll concentration turbidity conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen as shown in table 1 mean monthly cyanobacterial dynamics for a 23 year period january 1995 to november 2018 were derived from the lter monitored data magnuson et al 2020a and were quantified as a natural unit using cell biomass mg l hourly and daily average values of chlorophyll concentration from 01 apr 2020 were calculated from the original high resolution data magnuson et al 2020b measured with a multi parameter analyzer ysi exo2 yellow springs instrument inc usa and were reported as relative fluorescence units rfu for further development of forecast models lake tuesday is located in the upper peninsula michigan usa fig 1 it is a relatively small and shallow lake in oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions before the whole lake manipulation from 2013 to 2015 a fertilization experiment was conducted there pace et al 2021a in this experiment the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus were gradually added to the lake each year from mid may to early september to cause algal blooms meanwhile the high frequency chlorophyll fluorometer hydrolab ds5x hydrolab inc u s a was deployed in this lake to continuously collect chlorophyll a chl a concentrations ug l at 5 minute intervals similar to the lake mendota daily averaged chl a dynamics were calculated based on the source monitored data pace et al 2021b and formed the modeling dataset for the lake tuesday table 1 additionally to determine the outbreak conditions of algal blooms in lake tuesday two chl a thresholds related to the health based drinking water supplies were adopted 1 μg l and 12 μg l as defined by the alert level framework of the world health organization world health organization 2021 the first threshold corresponds to the alert level i representing an early stage of blooms and the second threshold corresponds to the alert level ii representing the heavy stage of bloom situation 2 2 wlstm model development 2 2 1 the deep learning algorithm lstm network the lstm network is a special form of recurrent neural network rnn which is a variant of a deep neural network that can learn temporal dependency from sequential data using loop structure in the lstm memory blocks are introduced to replace the hidden neurons for connecting hidden layers fig 2 each memory block consists of a memory cell c an input gate i a forget gate f and an output gate o by either updating or removing previously accumulated information to the memory cell through three control gates the lstm can well learn the remote dependencies and overcome the gradient exploding and vanishing issues in the backpropagation of conventional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the learning process and internal structure of the lstm memory block was presented in fig 2a more algorithmic details and demonstrations were in the supporting information text s1 and fig 2b showed a basic architecture of lstm network modeled on the sequential inputs to improve the overall performance in deep learning a standard technique of model ensemble was applied in the lstm network where multiple independent models with the same structure were trained and their predictions were combined dietterich 2000 fig 2c showed an illustration of the ensemble of lstm networks 2 2 2 the time frequency analysis technique discrete wavelet transformation wavelet transformation wt is a useful mathematical tool in signal theory after fourier transformation which overcomes the limitations of fourier transformation in analyzing non stationary time series labat 2005 by decomposing the main time series into time frequency space to obtain several sub series the wt can effectively extract specific time and frequency features from the original series simultaneously to achieve this task the sub series are generally derived from a template known as the mother wavelet in which these decomposed wavelets are scaled and translated according to the mother wavelet yet the calculation of scale and translation parameters at every possible position requires substantial computation work for a wt e g continuous wavelet transformation cwt herein the discrete wavelet transformation dwt considerably reduces the computational complexities to apply wt as its scale and position are usually based on powers of two called dyadic scales and positions cannas et al 2006 the dwt of series f t is often conducted as follows 1 w f j k j k z f t ψ j k t 2 ψ j k t a 0 j 2 ψ a 0 j t b 0 k a 0 1 b 0 0 where j and k are the integers controlling the decomposition level and translation respectively a 0 is the constant scale factor of decomposition usually is 2 b 0 is the constant position factor of translation usually is 1 ψ j k t is the wavelet function ψ t is the mother wavelet and w f j k are the dwt coefficients then a low frequency approximation sub series an and some high frequency detail sub series d1 d2 dn can be obtained by repetitively passing the approximation coefficients through the low pass filter and the high pass filter at each decomposition level till the preset level is reached 2 2 3 hybrid architecture of wlstm model the hybrid wlstm model was developed by combining the wavelet transformation and lstm network fig 3 the wlstm modeling mainly has three stages 1 the dwt of the original series of algal dynamics 2 the input and forecasting of each sub series using the ensembled lstm method individually 3 and the re composition of individual output series for the final forecasted results 2 2 4 model training and prediction to appropriately train the deep learning lstm modules within the wlstm structure our modeling procedure included two phases a calibration and b prediction in the calibration phase the first 80 of series data were used to construct the networks to avoid over fitting problems the constructing data were randomly divided into 70 training set and 30 testing set for conducting cross validation in which the networks were trained and tested respectively after the cross validation was complete the model and parameters that performed best on the testing set would be retained for conducting the ensembling we repeated this procedure multiple times with each time performed on a different random train test split of the constructing data and then averaged the outputs dietterich 2000 in the prediction phase predictions were made on new datasets based on the calibrated models we implemented both the first 80 of series data i e the entire constructing data and the remaining 20 of series data the unused data to finally evaluate the model performances on in sample and out of sample datasets respectively while in the case of lake tuesday 2013 and 2014 data were used for constructing and 2015 data for out of sample prediction we implemented our lstm network using the deep learning framework of pytorch paszke et al 2017 for computational efficiency a grid search scheme based on mini batch stochastic gradient optimization was used for tuning the network hyperparameters see tables s1 s2 we trained an ensemble of 15 lstm models according to our prior experiment on the effect of ensemble number on lstm performance see fig s1 in this study the daubechies 4 db4 was applied as a mother wavelet to decompose the original main series into 3 levels due to its wide acceptance and high efficiency nourani et al 2014 the dwt procedures were accomplished in the matlab software using the wavelet toolbox 2 3 the other time series forecasting approaches for comparison dnn and arima for comparison purposes the classical deep learning approach the deep neural network dnn i e multi layer feed forward network with back propagation algorithm and the traditional univariate time series prediction approach the autoregressive integrated moving average arima models were also developed and tested detailed information about the two approaches were in supporting information text s2 to conduct this the dnn network was trained based on mini batch stochastic gradient optimization using a grid search procedure with the sklearn library in python 3 8 software pedregosa et al 2019 and the combinations of model hyperparameters scored the lowest testing loss were lastly selected see also tables s1 s2 we also trained an ensemble of 15 dnn models using the same technique as the lstm for the arima approach models were constructed using the auto arima function of package forecast in r environment hyndman and khandakar 2008 via three iterative steps of model identification parameter estimation and model checking 2 4 data processing in this study the inputs of deep learning models were recomposed from the raw time series s we used the first three data points sn sn 1 sn 2 of s to forecast the data points with the time lags of d sn 2 d see text s3 in the supporting information for more details the time lag d was set to 1 2 and 3 respectively depending on the case studied for wlstm modeling the raw time series s was replaced by the decomposed sub series accordingly i e an d1 d2 dn fig 3 to facilitate the training of lstm and dnn models the input data were pre normalized the normalization was denoted by 3 x i x i x x s d where the x i is the normalized value of observed x i x and x s d are the mean and standard deviation of the observed data respectively 2 5 model assessments to measure the deviation of predicted values from the observed values the correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used and calculated as 4 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y y i 2 5 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 6 n r m s e r m s e y m a x y m i n where n is the total number of data points y i and y i are the i th predicted and observed values y is the mean of y i y m a x and y m i n are the maxima and minima of y i the predicted values were also used to judge the algal bloom alert levels in lake tuesday therefore to evaluate the performance on classification the accuracy overall accurate rate tpr true positive rate and tnr true negative rate were applied based on the confusion matrix defined as 7 a c c u r a c y t r u e p o s i t i v e s t r u e n e g a t i v e s n 8 tpr t r u e p o s i t i v e s t r u e p o s i t i v e s f a l s e n e g a t i v e s 9 tnr t

lstm firstly the wlstm approach was developed and verified on the daily algal dynamics in lake mendota wisconsin the monitored daily average algal dynamics of lake mendota was shown in fig 4 a apr 1 to nov 6 2020 in detail the annual algal growth presented a common downward trend with main peaks concentrated in the first three months i e mid spring to early summer in this non stationary signal mode although the use of the lstm model successfully learned algal variations in the calibration phase the latter prediction showed unsatisfactory forecasting results fig 5 b as indicated by the calculated r2 rmse and nrmse in table 2 furthermore it can also be seen from fig 5b that several sharp changes occurred around the 40th and 80th day causing large simulation errors to the lstm model despite it achieving high overall calibration performance when coupled with the time frequency wavelet algorithm the performance of the wlstm model significantly improved with an increase of 10 to 57 compared to the original lstm model table 2 fig 5b table s3 the wavelet decomposition of daily original algal series s usefully produced an approximation coefficient a3 and three levels of detailed coefficients d1 d3 shown in fig 4b 4e compared with the main series the general trend and major peaks of s were identified by the low frequency sub series a3 while its more subtle characteristics were simultaneously captured and presented in the high frequency sub series level by level from d1 to d3 moreover the apparent simulation errors along with the sudden boost or cut of the algal population in the lstm model were well diminished and smoothed by the hybrid wlstm method fig 5b noticeably further validation both proved better forecasting performance of the wlstm approach at both hourly and monthly time resolutions as compared to the lstm approach table 2 fig 5 especially in the long term monthly validation case fig 5c the performance of wlstms achieved approximately 3 to 6 times higher accuracy than the conventional lstm in terms of r2 statistic 0 858 vs 0 278 in calibration and 0 814 vs 0 036 in prediction respectively moreover the wlstm presented more accurate predictions of the extreme situations that frequently occurred in monthly algal time series fig 5c with around 60 reduction in the forecasting error table s3 in addition the highest forecasting accuracy of wlstm was reached at the finest hourly resolution shown by its biggest r2 0 991 and 0 976 smallest rmse 0 116 and 0 052 rfu and lowest nrmse 0 020 and 0 027 all of these evidences indicated that the developed hybrid wlstm method can reliably forecast the algal dynamics on multiple time scales ranging from hours to months 3 2 comparisons of the hybrid wlstm and other time series forecasting approaches the hybrid wlstm and the other two widely used time series forecasting approaches dnn and arima were also cross compared based on the algal dynamics in the lake mendota table 2 table s3 the detailed performance of the calibration and prediction via dnn and arima was shown in fig s2 for the dnn approach the best forecasting was achieved at the hourly resolution with highly satisfactory rmse and nrmse values which is consistent with the wlstm and lstm approaches but still the hourly forecasting performance of dnn dropped by 30 to 90 as compared to wlstm in terms of rmse and nrmse interestingly although the dnn models performed better than lstm at the monthly resolution r2 values of 0 161 it was still largely worse than the wlstm approach with r2 value of 0 858 and performed poorly in predicting the extreme values fig s2c as for the arima approach all models presented the lowest performance among the three cases studied table 2 showing its limitation in coping with non stationary and complicated forecasting problems of algal dynamics furthermore the recommended arima structure of ar order p differencing degree d and ma order q were the arima 3 1 2 arima 0 1 0 and arima 4 0 2 corresponding to the hourly daily and monthly models respectively please see text s4 this indicated that the arima required a longer time series than the other three deep learning network based approaches to construct a forecasting model generally the wlstm technique showed huge advantages over the conventional neural network and the statistical arima method 3 3 further application of the hybrid wlstm in an experimental fertilized lake to test its robustness and serviceability we further applied the hybrid wlstm approach in a lake with experimental fertilization lake tuesday fig 6 in this lake the excessive nutrient loads apparently triggered the algal over proliferations in which the daily chl a concentrations exceeded the early bloom stage threshold all year round i e alert level i 1 μg l in addition the large and variational fluctuations of algal dynamics can be observed there ranging from 7 4 to 34 4 ug l of chl a much higher than that of an unmanipulated lake such as the lake mendota with chl a maximumly ranged from 0 1 to 14 3 mg l fig 5c table 1 leading to an increase of mutation and extreme points within the time series fig 6 satisfactory simulations of the algal dynamics were observed in the three wlstm models with an output time lag of 1 2 and 3 days respectively figs 6 7 table 3 table s3 among three models the optimal performance was obtained using the forecasting interval of 1 day as revealed by the highest values of r2 in calibration 0 987 and prediction 0 971 nevertheless it should also be noticed that models for the longer intervals of 2 and 3 days both achieved satisfactory results which was valuable for the flexible deployment of forecasting work furthermore no clear behavior of model overestimation or underestimation on the peak or extreme values was observed and all wlstm models successfully forecasted 217 100 exceedances of the level i threshold in the calibration phase and 109 100 in the prediction phase figs 6 7 for the exceedances of level ii an average accuracy rate of 92 5 was accomplished with tpr 93 1 t p r 95 1 and tnr 59 3 t n r 82 8 overall the hybrid wlstm technique showed a high power in forecasting algal bloom events of the next multiple time steps 4 discussion firstly our results revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence based algorithms lstm wlstm and dnn in the habs forecast as compared to the traditional linear arima model due to various environmental impacts such as climatic status xiao et al 2019b 2019a hydrological condition cha et al 2017 park et al 2015 and nutritional level beaulieu et al 2013 heisler et al 2008 the dynamics of algal growth were usually shown as a shifty and step by step process characterized by irregular or time limited time series that was considered to be non linear and non stationary li et al 2015 yu et al 2020 in our study the evaluations of arima models e g monthly r 2 0 27 table 2 indicate that this complicated time series data is too challenging for the traditional methods which are often shown to be poor to address hab forecasting problems he et al 2020 ömer faruk 2010 xiao et al 2017 fortunately the robust performance of deep learning approaches lstm wlstm and dnn presents promising solutions to this modeling predicament table 2 in fact given the rapid development of such computational intelligence approaches in the ecological field they have been gradually proven to be well suited to cope with the complex and real world aquatic dataset filled with uncertainties alizadeh et al 2018 kargar et al 2020 kouadri et al 2021 rousso et al 2020 especially due to the useful characteristics e g the self learning of sequence dependencies and the efficient structure of gate units the lstm approach has been widely suggested to be useful to reliably handle the non linear hab dynamics cho et al 2018 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 however out of our expectation the increscent temporal variations and non stationary oscillations in algal time series still posed great forecasting difficulties to the advanced lstm structures its prediction r 2 decreased largely from 0 958 hourly to 0 615 daily and 0 036 monthly even lower than the conventional multi layered network table 2 as we anticipated the incorporation of the time frequency wt technique significantly enhanced the lstm approach table 2 fig 5 compared to the individual lstm the forecasting errors of algal dynamics by the hybrid wlstm were reduced at all three resolutions with an average decrease of 24 44 and 55 in terms of rmse respectively specifically the wt in the wlstm structure functioned as a powerful pre processing tool that could remove most of the irregular and noisy components from the raw series and extract its cyclic signals with expeditious dyadic decompositions cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 the extracted sub series present multi timescale specialties of the original series periodically or quasi periodically facilitating and promoting the algorithmic advantages of lstm in processing series data furthermore the parallel forecasting process of these sub series could significantly reduce the error accumulations by the lstm recursive strategy du et al 2018 this is why in the present study the wlstm technique can lead to significant increases in the lstm and outperform the other techniques in algal dynamics prediction table 2 table s3 more interestingly the wlstm model was also observed to be intensively powerful in simulating peak and extreme values with algal dynamics figs 5b 5c figs s2b s2c table s3 typically it is difficult for a data driven model to accurately predict extreme situations since this type of model would tend to treat extreme values as outliers before carrying out their normal predictions song et al 2021 however due to the robust resistance and smoothing capability of wt to the irregular signals the inclusion of extreme components in decomposed input sub series can be substantiallydecreased this not only reduces the probability that wt coupled models detect the original outliers and thus disrupt the normal prediction but also again could lead to a great fitting increase in the well transformed mutations or extreme points du et al 2018 nourani et al 2014 as the hab occurrences are usually accompanied by sharp changes in algal biomass dynamics the low forecasting error to extreme value is especially useful for the reliable judgment of hab events for instance for the eutrophic water in which high biomass habs frequently occur the lake tuesday here our wlstm satisfactorily forecasted the highly dynamic process of algal blooms fig 6 and presented accurate judgment outcomes to its bloom levels based on the predicted values table 3 such progress made in habs models can provide not only more reliable support for the managers but also a better interpretation of this phenomenon in scientific research cross comparison between the time resolution showed that the greatest forecasting improvement of hab dynamics by wlstm was in the largest resolution monthly such outcomes on the one hand were partially contributed by the unsatisfactory predictions of lstm models based on a monthly dataset compared to the short term time series in relatively fine time resolutions such as hourly and daily the long term monthly series not only vary over a wide scale of time frequencies but could be easily contaminated by intensive cross periodic oscillations and noises namely highly non stationary li et al 2015 it is evident that the computation intelligence methods still exhibit drawbacks to respond to this circumstance though they own high capability and flexibility in modeling sequential processes cannas et al 2006 nourani et al 2014 wang et al 2013 nevertheless on the other hand it is also reported that the underlying periodicity pattern is more dominant in the larger time scale series than in smaller ones nourani et al 2014 thus by decomposing main time series into time frequency space the latent modes of periodicity components that existed in such series can be detected and fed to the lstm to further improve hab forecasting at a large monthly resolution this is not alone in the literature reported by nourani and behfar 2021 their wlstm approach presented analogous modeling results for the runoff sediment process closed to our time series patterns of algal dynamics this again indicates that the wlstm technique could be useful for developing multi temporal scale hab prediction models we also tested the multi step predictability of hybrid wlstm models in another fertilized lake lake tuesday along with the increase of time lags from 1 day to 3 days the forecasting accuracy by the wlstm approach gradually decreased from 0 971 to 0 843 in terms of prediction r 2 the similar phenomenon appeared in many lstm based models for instance based on the 12 year time series of six water quality parameters liang et al 2020 observed a roughly 50 drop in the performance of lstm when making predictions for chl a dynamics with the time lag increased from 1 day to 31 days zheng et al 2021 and shan et al 2022 also found that the forecasting power of lstms reduced in the next multiple time steps 1 h to 12 days where the rmse of chl a predictions enlarged by an average of 1 5 to 2 times this indicated that the autocorrelation structure of algal time series could gradually dispel with the increase of time lag consequently leading to adverse impacts on the overall modeling accuracy shamshirband et al 2019 in addition it showed the benefits of automatic capture of long temporal information via lstm recurrent chains which may not successfully work to improve the performance but increase the convergence complexity if the lag time of prediction task is too long yang et al 2019 therefore despite a model with multi step predictability which would be valuable for the practical deployments selecting an appropriate time lag is still an important concern for the hab forecasting using wlstm 5 conclusion in this work we developed a promising hybrid hab forecasting approach wlstm combining the wavelet analysis technique wt with a deep learning model lstm which a performed better than the state of the art time series tools including lstm dnn and arima b robustly predicted algal dynamics at the hourly daily monthly resolutions c showed powerful multi step ahead predictability and had high overall judgment accuracy to the extreme algal bloom situations over alert thresholds therefore the hybrid approach could be a practical and useful tool for the early warning and management of algal blooms however the current research mainly focused on the hybrid use of discrete wavelet transformation and conventional structured lstms in future research more effective time frequency analysis techniques and more advanced deep learning models will be explored to further improve the

15938,estuarine wetlands which typically store large amounts of phosphorus p are experiencing increased salinity as well as changed environmental factors caused by rising sea levels in this study the seasonal dynamics of p speciation availability and biogeochemical couplings with iron fe sulfur s in soil and porewater were measured in a low salinity estuarine wetland using in situ high resolution diffusive gradients in thin films dgt and dialysis hr peeper techniques the diffusion kinetics and resupply capacity of p from the soil phase to solution were simulated using a dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model the transition from freshwater to brackish wetlands reduced soil p pools and shifted to more recalcitrant speciation the concentration of dgt labile p across the soil water profiles ranged from 0 002 to 0 039 mean 0 015 mg l 1 which increased with increasing salinity in both the field and mesocosm experiments the distributions of labile and soluble p showed high heterogeneity across the profiles and there were some sharp peak values below the soil water interface swi which significantly increased the concentration and lability of p the strong coupling between labile p and fe s provided direct evidence for the coexistence of iron reduction ir and sulfate reduction sr in the estuary while ir might predominate in p mobilization in the brackish environment because of higher labile fe concentrations and stronger fe p couplings the diffusion fluxes of p were positive at both sites demonstrating that the kinetics of p were from the soils to the overlying water higher r and k 1 values fitted in the difs model implied that a stronger resupply capacity and desorption rate and thus faster remobilization kinetics of p occurred with increasing salinity our findings indicated that increased salinity even at low levels can alter the desorption rate and resupply capacity of soil p in estuarine wetlands and accelerate p remobilization and release by regulating the ir and sr processes thereby leading to the deterioration of water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal p loading iron sulfur phosphorus coupling dgt hr peeper difs model saltwater intrusion estuarine wetland 1 introduction phosphorus p is not only an essential element for plant productivity but also a key driver of water eutrophication estuarine wetlands as sources sinks and converters of p play a critical role in the global and regional p cycle and budget balance p cycling in estuarine systems is a complex biogeochemical process that is coupled with organic matter decomposition the iron fe sulfur s cycle and metal cation exchange braun et al 2019 the iron reduction ir and sulfate reduction sr are two of the main processes involved in organic matter mineralization which are accompanied by inorganic p regeneration resulting in high soluble p in porewater flores alsina et al 2016 pan et al 2020 in general the oxidation of soluble fe accelerates the formation of fe3 oxyhydroxides feooh on the soil surface which can adsorb and sequester p through electrostatic adsorption and complexation of functional groups queiroz et al 2020 however these feooh will be reduced to fe2 under anaerobic conditions which aggravates the release of p into the water jordan et al 2008 in addition this process is also regulated by sr under anaerobic conditions so4 2 is reduced to s2 and precipitated as fes or fes2 which prevents the binding of p and fe2 and facilitates the mobilization and release of soluble p flores alsina et al 2016 consequently depending on soil water environmental conditions fe s p cycling is dynamic and understanding this process and its regulatory mechanism on p im mobilization under the scenario of global change is of great significance for evaluating p biogeochemical processes and balancing regional p budgets the global mean sea level is estimated to rise 0 28 1 01 m by 2100 relative to 1995 2014 due to increasing global surface temperatures ipcc 2021 sea level rise in conjunction with reduced river runoff will lead to the migration of saltwater upstream in estuaries which is accompanied by salinization of original freshwater wetlands and landscapes knowles 2002 salinization significantly increases the salinity ionic strength so4 2 and cl and ph which ultimately regulates p dissolution and mineralization by changing osmotic pressure and the quantity and quality of organic substrates tully et al 2019 previous studies have observed that salinity stress play a primary role in regulating soil p dynamics hartzell et al 2017 hu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 found that high salinity 42 9 13 3 ppt reduced the alkaline phosphatase activity in river sediments but increased the content of naoh soluble p resulting in a low p regeneration ability however noe et al 2013 observed that long term salinification enhanced the net p mineralization and turnover rates in freshwater forested wetlands by accelerating plant stress and senescence in addition steinmuller and chambers 2018 found that different wetland types responded differently to salinity with a 15 ppt salinity increase significantly increasing porewater p concentrations in cypress dome 8 fold while no effect was observed in the mineral marsh previous studies mainly focused on soil p pools and stocks based on controlled laboratory experiments which were obtained by ex situ measurements with low resolution typically at the centimeter level there has been relatively little attention on p mobilization and its biogeochemical couplings with fe s at the soil water interface swi in estuarine wetlands due to the lack of high resolution in situ detection technologies the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt an in situ and dynamical passive sampling technique has been widely applied in determining available elements in soil water and sediment which can overcome the disadvantages of large interference and error in ex situ active sampling davison and zhang 2012 hummel et al 2021 to date existing research on p mobilization using dgt devices has been concentrated chiefly in eutrophic lakes reservoirs chen et al 2019 flores alsina et al 2016 norgbey et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 or several polluted river estuarines pan et al 2020 sun et al 2016 which have usually ignored subtropical estuaries with varied salinities the min river estuary one of the largest and most productive estuaries in southeast china suffers from different degrees of saltwater intrusion and surface water eutrophication due to global sea level rise and upstream nutrient loading hu et al 2017 sun et al 2015 due to the confluence of runoff and tides this estuary has small salinity changes from freshwater to brackish published results have revealed that low level salinity increases could alter soil microbial community structure tong et al 2017 soil carbon mineralization luo et al 2019 and phosphatase activity hu et al 2020 along this estuarine gradient however how small salinity changes affect p mobilization and its biogeochemical couplings with the fe s cycle is still not fully understood the objectives were to 1 evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in labile soluble p fe and s in soil water profiles based on in situ and experimental mesocosms 2 reveal the diffusive fluxes and remobilization kinetics of p across the swi using the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model and 3 clarify the main mechanisms and controlling factors of p remobilization under low salinity scenarios we hypothesized that small changes in salinity have large effects on p mobilization kinetics at the swi in estuarine wetlands by decoupling the fe p s cycle enhancing p availability and resupply capacity and ultimately accelerating p mobilization and release 2 materials and methods 2 1 site delineation the experiment was conducted in the min river estuary fig s1 which has a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and rainy summers fig s2 to elucidate the effects of low salinity changes the wetlands were divided into tidal freshwater 0 5 ppt and brackish 0 5 5 ppt wetlands along the estuarine gradient their water levels were mainly regulated by tidal cycles luo et al 2019 tong et al 2017 tides were regular semidiurnal tide over a 24 hour cycle and there was normally 20 150 cm of tidal water above the soil surface at high tide tong et al 2017 in order to isolate the effects of salinity the two sites had similar vegetation native cyperus malaccensis tides and soil conditions the growth period of c malaccensis was from may to november and its belowground biomass at brackish site 4 03 0 64 mg cm 3 was markedly higher than that at freshwater site 1 66 0 59 mg cm 3 while the aboveground biomass showing the opposite trend bai et al 2021 detailed information about the study area has been presented in previous studies hu et al 2020 tong et al 2017 2 2 preparation deployment and measurement of dgt and hr peeper probes in this study a new flat double sided dgt device consisting of a mixed binding gel incorporated with zr oxide zro chelex agi zro ca was employed which provides a powerful tool for simultaneously measuring in situ high resolution millimeter distribution information of labile p fe fe2 and s s2 wang et al 2019 hr peeper is based on diffusion equilibrium which allows soluble ions in porewater to exchange materials through the membrane and reach equilibrium after a period the hr peeper consists of 36 chambers of the same volume 400 μl and vertical resolution 5 mm both sides of which are covered with a nitrate fiber film 0 45 μm the chamber is prepacked with deionized water all dgt probes and hr peeper were assembled according to ding et al 2015 and the probes underwent deoxygenation with n2 for more than 16 h before deployment the field experiment was performed at two distinct periods of the year namely january dormant period and june growing period the hr peeper and dgt probes were assembled back to back and then deployed to two wetlands during high tide the probes were inserted 10 12 cm into the soil leaving 2 3 cm in overlying water effective length 15 cm after 24 h of dgt deployment 48 h for hr peeper the probes were carefully retrieved and cleaned with deionized water and kept moist until they reached the laboratory for two dimensional 2d analysis the probes were disassembled and scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi canon 5600f then the grayscale intensity of the scanned images was converted using imagej software http rsb info nih gov ij afterward the zro ca dgt gels were sectioned into strips at 2 mm intervals and the dgt labile fe in subsamples was eluted with 1 0 m hno3 solution ding et al 2016 for hr peeper analysis the solution was immediately extracted from each chamber the concentrations of labile soluble p and fe in solution sampled by hr peeper and dgt probes were measured by the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively 2 3 experimental mesocosms to exclude the possible interference of other factors the effects of a gradual salinity increase were further simulated through laboratory controlled mesocosms briefly during the early growing season native c malaccensis communities with even growth rates were selected in freshwater wetlands then a series of pvc buckets 25 cm in diameter and 35 cm in height was used to sample the soil column including plants in triplicate and the water near the sample plot was also collected the soil column was brought back to the laboratory and precultured for 1 month then 500 ml of preprepared saline solution artificial sea salt concentration 0 ck 2 5 ppt was added to each treatment 5 cm above the interface and the actual salinity was subject to the initial concentration after addition on the 90 th day of incubation both dgt and hr peeper probes were set and measured in each treatment according to the method in section 2 2 and the environmental factors were recorded simultaneously 2 4 soil and water analysis on each sampling date surface soils 0 10 cm triplicate were collected using a columnar sampler and at a depth consistent

according to eq 5 ding et al 2015 5 f d j w j s d w δ c d g t δ x w x 0 φ d s δ c d g t δ x s x 0 where jw and js represent the diffusive fluxes from water and soil to the swi respectively dw and ds are the diffusion coefficients in the water and soil respectively φ is the soil porosity moreover the horizontal heterogeneity index at each depth of the 2d profiles was calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean ding et al 2015 2 5 2 difs modeling the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model simulates the diffusion kinetics of analytes from the solid phase to the solution phase harper et al 2000 the concentration ratio r of dgt to hr peeper reflects the resupply capacity of analytes from the solid phase to solution as shown by eq 6 6 r c dgt c peeper where c dgt and c peeper represent the concentrations of labile p and soluble reactive phosphorus srp measured by dgt and hr peeper mg l 1 respectively r values ranged from 0 to 1 the distribution coefficient k d and response

rate constants d 1 respectively a detailed description of the difs model can be found in harper et al 2000 3 results 3 1 soil and water physiochemical properties salinity in the overlying water ranged from 0 3 0 2 ppt at freshwater sites to 5 1 1 5 ppt at brackish sites which was significantly higher in the dormant period than in the growing period table 1 the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the overlying water of the brackish sites were higher than those of the freshwater sites and were significantly higher in the dormant period than in the growing period brackish wetlands have higher soil ph and ec than freshwater wetlands while som tc and tn concentrations and the c n ratio are lower soil tfe concentration of the brackish sites was significantly higher than that of freshwater in both periods moreover the concentrations of soil tfe fe2 and fe3 at both sites were approximately 3 10 fold higher in the growing period than in the dormant period 3 2 soil p speciation and availability higher soil tp range 452 3 742 0 mg kg 1 and ip range 251 7 436 4 mg kg 1 concentrations were observed at freshwater sites than at brackish sites and significant differences were found during the dormant period fig 1 no significant differences were observed for soil op range 49 6 441 7 mg kg 1 concentrations across all sites and periods soil naoh p range 89 3 185 9 mg kg 1 concentrations decreased while hcl p range 101 8 164 3 mg kg 1 concentrations increased with increasing salinity 3 3 two dimensional distributions of dgt labile p and s high resolution 2d distributions of labile p and s in soil water profiles displayed remarkable spatiotemporal dynamics and its overall high concentration and variation were observed at brackish sites especially during the dormant period fig 2 specifically the mean concentration of labile p increased from 0 002 growth and 0 014 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 0 007 growth and 0 039 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively the mean concentration of labile s increased from 0 003 growth and 0 036 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 0 087 growth and 0 189 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively moreover higher labile p and s concentrations were recorded during the dormant period than the growing period at both sites overall the consistency and magnitude of labile p and s varied across profiles fig 2 generally labile p and s hotspots appeared in deeper zones at brackish sites and in the middle zones at freshwater sites at the freshwater site during the dormant period there were some small dots with significantly enhanced p concentrations up to 0 2 mg l 1 near the swi and at the bottom of the profile labile p showed a similar spatial variation trend with that of labile s at freshwater sites labile p and s concentrations had no significant vertical variation along profiles during the growing period moreover labile p exhibits high horizontal heterogeneity at both sites with an average of more than 0 5 the highest is close to 2 5 and is mainly distributed near the swi fig s3 3 4 one dimensional distributions of dgt labile p fe and s overall labile fe concentrations across profiles increased from 0 13 growth and 1 52 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 3 23 growth and 11 14 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively fig 3 a during the growing period the concentrations of labile fe and s increased rapidly from the swi to depths of 20 mm then decreased and remained relatively stable at freshwater sites fig 3a however the labile p profiles exhibited irregular patterns or fluctuated with depth during the dormant period the labile p fe and s vertical profiles exhibited the characteristics of first increasing from depths of 20 mm and then decreasing rapidly and stabilizing below 70 mm at freshwater sites fig 3b at the brackish site the concentrations of labile p fe and s first increase abruptly from approximately 50 mm and then peak at 70 mm followed by a decrease or remain stable during the growing period fig 3c the distributions of labile p fe and s exhibited strong variation with depth during the dormant period at brackish sites and they gradually increased from the swi to deeper depths fig 3d moreover the concentrations of labile p and fe s in the soil water profiles showed a consistent trend fig s4 there were significant positive correlations between labile p and fe s at most sites and periods except the freshwater sites during the growing period the correlation coefficient r showed that the correlation between labile p and fe s was higher at the brackish site and dormant period than at the freshwater site and growing period 3 5 vertical variations in srp and soluble fe the vertical distributions of srp and soluble fe measured by hr peeper probes are shown in fig 4 srp concentrations showed a changing trend similar to soluble fe especially at freshwater sites figs 4a b both srp and soluble fe increased slightly with increasing depth at freshwater sites during the growing period but a strong peak appeared at depths of 135 mm with concentrations of 0 092 mg l 1 and 0 763 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of srp and fe had no significant vertical variation along the soil depth during the dormant period at freshwater sites but several hotspots appeared at 20 mm 90 mm 115 mm and 145 mm respectively strong variations in the vertical profiles of both srp and fe were observed at the brackish sites in both periods figs 4c d specifically there was an increasing trend from the swi to deeper depths of the profiles for both srp and fe during the growing period there was also an increasing trend for soluble fe from 50 mm to 90 mm which then remained relatively stable during the dormant periods however the distributions of srp profiles exhibited irregular and relatively stable patterns with depth during the dormant period overall higher srp and soluble fe in the profiles were observed in brackish sites and during the dormant period compared with the freshwater sites and growing period respectively 3 6 diffusion fluxes of p fe and s across the swi the diffusion fluxes of p across the swi were positive from soil to the overlying water at different sites and periods and were significantly higher at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites fig 5 there were clear positive diffusion fluxes of fe at the freshwater sites and they were higher in the growing period than in the dormant period significant positive fe fluxes were also observed at the brackish sites during the dormant period but were negative from overlying water to soil during the growing periods the diffusion flux of s is negative at the freshwater sites during both periods while it is strong positive at the brackish sites during the dormant periods overall the diffusion fluxes of p fe and s are from soil to overlying water release throughout the period and higher fluxes were observed in brackish sites 3 7 release kinetics of p by the difs model the kinetic parameters of labile p release from soils were derived using the difs model table 2 higher r values were observed at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites and were generally higher in the dormant period than in the growing period t c values ranged from 2 49 106 s to 9 99 106 s which were lower at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites additionally both k 1 and k 1 of the brackish wetlands were higher than those of freshwater wetlands furthermore the fitting curves of the r value of p in both the freshwater and brackish wetlands showed an initial abrupt increase over the deployment time and reached a distinct peak at approximately 0 7 1 0 h fig 6 after reaching the peak the r curve shows a continuous decline and the growing period has a relatively stronger decline than during the dormant period 3 8 changes in p fe and s in experimental mesocosms the concentration of labile p across profiles displayed an overall increase with increasing salinity with means of 0 022 ck 0 025 2 ppt and 0 046 5 ppt mg l 1 respectively figs 7 a c generally labile p hotspots appeared mainly at deep depths of the profiles in all treatments strong variations in the vertical distributions of labile s were also observed figs 7d f for the ck treatment higher labile s below the swi was found with increasing depth in the soils under the 2 ppt and 5 ppt salinity treatments the labile s distributions exhibited the characteristics of first decreasing from the overlying water 20 mm to the swi and then valleys at 30 mm followed by an increase or fluctuation with depth it is worth noting that positive relationships were established between p and fe in different treatments while the correlations between p and s gradually weakened with increasing salinity fig 8 moreover soil orp generally decreased with soil depth in all treatments with higher magnitudes observed in response to the saltwater addition although the difference was not statistically significant fig s5 overall the concentration and heterogeneity of labile p fe and s across profiles at 5 ppt salinity treatments were greater than those at ck and the coupling between p and s decreased with increasing salinity the srp and soluble fe concentrations displayed significantly different vertical distributions among the different treatments fig 9 for the ck treatment srp and soluble fe first increased rapidly from the swi to depths of 30 mm and then decreased or fluctuated with depth the distributions of srp and soluble fe in the 2 ppt treatments first increased from the swi then peaked at 30 mm followed by a sharp decrease and remained stable at 5 ppt the concentrations of srp and soluble fe first remained stable then increased from depths of 50 mm to 90 mm and then decreased slowly overall the srp concentrations showed a changing trend similar to that of soluble fe and higher values were found with increasing salinity especially for soluble fe 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of p in estuarine wetlands although freshwater and brackish wetlands are functionally similar differences in salinity and solute concentrations particularly so4 2 and cl lead to significant differences in biogeochemical processes weston et al 2014 in this study the transition from freshwater to brackish wetlands reduced soil tp ip and naoh p concentrations but promoted op and hcl p concentrations fig 1 in particular the larger reduction in naoh p concentrations was generally accompanied by a rapid increase in hcl p concentration in soils with salinity these findings provide strong evidence that low levels of salinity increase can also significantly regulate p speciation and transformation which is accompanied by a decrease in soil p pools and a shift toward more recalcitrant speciation in the brackish wetlands high so4 2 concentrations table 1 facilitate decomposition and mineralization of organic matter through sr 53so4 2 ch2o 106 nh3 16h3po4 106hco3 16nh4 53hs hpo4 2 39h rozan et al 2002 which stimulates the production and release of p into the overlying water coincidentally increased salinity raised the ph value table 1 which could aggravate soil p loss especially for naoh p in brackish wetlands due to high soil ph tending to have low p affinity and adsorption capacity with fe and al oxides braun et al 2019 moreover soil microbes and their associated soil microbe interactions can drive soil p transformation and the composition of p forms fraser et al 2017 stout et al 2014 our previous studies have found that salinization decreased phosphatase activity and the relative abundance of the phod harboring bacterial gene community e g streptomyces cupriavidus and bradyrhizobium hu et al 2020 that can affect soil organic p mineralization thereby regulating p speciation and availability bergkemper et al 2016 the concentration of srp and labile p across the swi ranged from 0 031 to 0 142 mean 0 087 mg l 1 and from 0 002 to 0 039 mean 0 015 mg l 1 respectively which differed significantly between salinities and confirmed that salinity can increase the availability of p and facilitate its rapid release from the soil the srp concentrations were nearly identical to those reported in the jiulong river estuary 0 075 mg l 1 pan et al 2019 and taihu lake 0 085 mg l 1 chen et al 2019 but significantly lower than the concentrations observed in the jiuxi river 0 75 mg l 1 pan et al 2020 and chaohu lake 0 32 mg l 1 yu et al 2019 this discrepancy might be related to their unique loading histories salinity range and other site specific factors such as temperature water depth and soil texture chen et al 2019 flores alsina et al 2016 jordan et al 2008 the distributions of srp and labile p showed high heterogeneity in both sites fig s3 and higher concentrations were generally observed at deeper depths figs 2 4 suggesting an active layer of p distribution across the profiles on the one hand this is closely related to the root distribution of c malaccensis with root exudates and the decomposition of litter residues providing a large amount of p with increasing depth on the other hand the decomposition of organic matter deplete oxygen in the underlying soil thereby facilitating the release of redox dependent p from the soil wu and wang 2017 furthermore there were some sharp peak values below the swi which significantly increased the concentration of p and enhanced the lability of soil p storage and release for example several hotspots of srp concentration in freshwater wetlands occurred at depths of 20 mm 90 mm and 145 mm which enhanced the average srp concentration by 30 50 fig 4 these hotspots may reflect high activity in labile p pools caused by roots of c malaccensis especially the root tips which represent bioavailability components and ineluctably regulate the overall metabolism of the p cycle yu et al 2019 despite the spatial variation soil p dynamics also showed obvious seasonal characteristics specifically srp and labile p concentrations in both salinities were higher in the dormant period 0 130 and 0 026 mg l 1 respectively than in the growing period 0 043 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively plant biomass especially belowground roots have different oxygen secretion capacities between the growing and dormant periods which regulate soil p retention and mobilization by altering the rhizosphere soil redox potential yu and kuzyakov 2021 our team previous results showed that soil oxidation reduction potential was consistently negative range 159 6 8 8 mv to 138 5 14 1 mv during the freshwater brackish transition and not statistically significant differences were observed across different salinities and seasons bai et al 2021 meanwhile the belowground biomass and root oxygen loss potential indicated by root fe3 plaque content 81 2 5 3 μmol fe g 1 to 134 5 5 4 μmol fe g 1 increased significantly more in the growing period than in the dormant period bai et al 2021 the increased fe3 concentrations table 1 also indicated that more fe3 is immobilized as fe3 oxides in the growing period altogether the increased root oxygen loss and fe3 oxides in the growing period accelerated the uptake and retention of p due to the high affinity and adsorption capacity which may be a key reason for the decrease of srp and labile p observed in the growing period figs 2 4 moreover during the growing period strong seasonal precipitation significantly reduces salinity and exacerbates leaching table 1 fig s2 which combined with plant uptake of nutrients results in low p concentrations in soil and porewater 4 2 biogeochemical fe and s concentrations and their effects on p mobilization numerous studies have revealed that the reductive dissolution of feooh is the primary mechanism regulating p mobilization and transformation in lake and freshwater soils chen et al 2019 ding et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 however in coastal environments saltwater intrusions and associated sr may also regulate p cycling by fe2 removal from porewater due to the formation and precipitation of solid fes and fes2 rozan et al 2002 it is noteworthy that the cycles of ir and sr are closely related in estuarine soils and may coexist or one process dominates during anaerobic organic matter mineralization while these processes have not been clearly distinguished in freshwater and brackish wetlands in the current study both field and mesocosm results revealed that the concentrations of labile fe and s in saltwater environments were significantly higher than those in freshwater furthermore the simultaneous release of fe and s from soil to water fig 5 was also observed in the brackish wetlands these results indicate that the ir and sr processes and their products are highly dependent on saltwater intrusion due to a significant increase in salinity and associated parameters e g so4 2 the coupling between labile p and fe in both the field and mesocosm fig s4 provides further supporting evidence that the remobilization of p is predominantly driven by fe redox cycling for instance lower soil orp in saline environment fig s5 accelerates the remobilization and release of soil p by stimulating the reductive dissolution of feooh queiroz et al 2020 which is in line with the higher concentrations of labile p observed under saltwater treatment figs 7d f moreover a positive correlation existed between labile p and s at most sites and periods fig s4 suggesting that the sr was also responsible for the retention and release of p to the overlying water this implies that soluble fe and s coexist in estuarine environments regardless of the heterogeneity which was also detected in other coastal and marine sediments ma et al 2017 pan et al 2020 rozan et al 2002 however it is of note that the average concentration of labile fe at all sites and periods was approximately 50 fold higher than that of labile s fig 2 indicating that the concentration of labile s in the soil was low more importantly experimental mesocosms without the interference of other factors revealed that the relationships between labile p and s were significantly decoupled with increasing salinity fig 8 these results revealed that although ir and sr coexist under anaerobic conditions ir might be the dominant pathway controlling p behavior in the estuarine environment in the fe reduction dominated systems the reductive dissolution of feooh is a key process to regulate the mobilization and resupply of p and fe is not effectively precipitated as fes which leads to coupled p and fe moreover it should be noted that there is no labile p fe and labile p s coupling in freshwater wetlands during the growing period although fe and s have consistent trends fig 3 this indicates that fe and p decoupled during the growing period and that changes in labile p concentration in soil water profiles were sensitive to plant growth and uptake in summary the experimental observations in this study together with previous reports confirm that ir and sr coexist in controlling p mobilization in estuarine wetlands and that ir is dominant because of the higher labile fe concentrations and tighter fe p coupling at different salinities 4 3 diffusion flux and resupply kinetics of p across the swi apparent diffusion flux can assess whether the soil is a source or sink of p based on the concentration gradient at the swi ding et al 2015 in this study the fluxes of p were positive across sites and periods which demonstrated that the diffusion of p from soil toward water was occurring furthermore the diffusion flux of p varied from 0 48 ng cm 2 d 1 to 5 09 ng cm 2 d 1 with an average of 2 80 ng cm 2 d 1 which was remarkably lower than that of dongting lake 9 ng cm 2 d 1 gao et al 2016 hongze lake 17 2 79 3 ng cm 2 d 1 yao et al 2016 tianbao reservoir 8 ng cm 2 d 1 norgbey et al 2020 and hongfeng reservoir 22 ng cm 2 d 1 chen et al 2019 but higher than that of the jiuxi river china 58 ng cm 2 d 1 pan et al 2020 in deep reservoirs and lakes anoxic or anaerobic environments and the associated reductive dissolution of fe bound p and sr stimulate the release of p and thus higher p diffusion chen et al 2019 it should be noted that the diffusion flux of p at the brackish sites 4 28 ng cm 2 d 1 was significantly higher than that at the freshwater sites 1 31 ng cm 2 d 1 fig 5 which further confirmed the promoting effect of strong sr and ir on p mobilization and release in brackish environments estuarine brackish wetlands have high salinity and associated high concentrations of fe s and organic matter table 1 which are accompanied by the coprecipitation of fe and s resulting in rapid remobilization and release of p similarly there were also clear positive diffusion fluxes of fe and s at brackish sites during the dormant period but inverse diffusion during the growing period the mean fluxes of fe and s at the brackish sites were significantly higher than those at the freshwater sites which was consistent with the high tfe fe3 and so4 2 concentrations table 1 this indicated that a mass of fe and s were released from the soil into overlying water at the brackish sites especially during the dormant period depending on high salinity as well as other parameters such as ph caused by low precipitation studies by luo et al 2019 have reported that saltwater intrusion can alter the main pathways of organic carbon mineralization such as ir to sr by changing the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in porewater these findings suggest that intense p fe and s diffusion and pollution might occur in brackish wetlands during the dormant periods leading to eutrophication and water quality deterioration in estuaries and surrounding waters however the diffusion flux of labile s is negative in the freshwater wetlands during both the growing and dormant periods which provides supportive evidence for weak sr and its products in freshwater to further illustrate the ability of soil to resupply p to solution the kinetics of p release from soils were calculated based on the difs model harper et al 2000 menezes blackburn et al 2019 the r are higher in the brackish wetlands mean 0 287 than in the freshwater wetlands mean 0 084 suggesting that brackish soils have high p reactive and resupply capacity which could readily release p into overlying water the t c reflects the adsorption desorption kinetics of soil and solution which is higher in the freshwater wetlands than in brackish wetlands the k d in the freshwater wetlands mean 2164 1 cm3 g 1 were nearly equal to those in the brackish wetlands mean 2044 4 cm3 g 1 which were both high and indicated a large soil p pool in estuarine wetlands notably brackish soils had higher values of k 1 parameters in comparison to freshwater soils and were accompanied by an increasing trend from dormancy to growth the high r and k 1 corresponded with the low t c in brackish wetlands indicating that there was a rapid kinetic remobilization of p from the soil pool to porewater the results might be attributed to the fact that the high salinity and so4 2 concentration of brackish wetlands especially during the dormant periods table 1 accelerate the mobilization of p from soil to overlying water by promoting the release of fe bound p this was consistent with higher labile and p diffusion fluxes as well as lower concentrations of naoh p observed in brackish soils figs 1 5 however the freshwater soils recorded low r but high t c values meaning that these soils have a slow p resupply capacity to the porewater moreover the time dependence curves of r values for p simulated by difs provide further information on the capacity and kinetics of p resupply from soil pools menezes blackburn et al 2019 in this case the r curve generally increased sharply and peaked at short intervals less than 1 h and then declined markedly with deployment time fig 6 the freshwater and brackish soils have similar r curve shapes even under different periods as previously stated harper et al 2000 this r curve belongs to the slow to intermediate resupply rate showing that the soil p resupply capacity changes greatly with dgt deployment time this rapid change was attributed partly to the intense gradient diffusion of p from the soil to the porewater at the beginning and then the labile p pools were consecutively depleted resulting in a limited resupply yuan et al 2021 it is worth noting that in both freshwater and brackish soils the change in the r curve with time in the dormant period is smaller than that in the growing period demonstrating a higher soil p resupply capacity during the dormant period this can also be clearly seen by the high values of r and k 1 during the dormant period table 2 in the dormant period high salinity and so4 2 coupled with strong organic matter decomposition stimulate the release of p through sr and ir as previously mentioned 4 4 implications and future works in situ high resolution dgt hr peeper difs techniques provide good insight for studying the microscopic mechanism of p fe s couplings mobilization and p diffusion kinetics in estuarine wetlands to recap our results indicated that increased salinity even at low levels may be a key factor regulating soil p speciation and availability promoting p remobilization and release in estuarine wetlands the transition from freshwater to brackish environments accompanied by high salinity and ph and large concentrations of so4 2 cl and fe3 significantly reduced the soil p pool shifting soil p toward a more stable speciation moreover higher labile p fe and s concentrations across the swi were also observed in brackish wetlands than in freshwater which showed a consistent trend and clearly confirmed that the decoupling of fe bound p was the primary mechanism of p release furthermore the difs model simulated the high r and k 1 and low t c in brackish wetlands suggesting that these soils have a rapid p kinetic remobilization and resupply capacity to the porewater especially during the dormant period these findings have important implications for improving the understanding of p speciation availability and remobilization kinetics in estuarine wetlands and provide a basis for modeling p cycling when saltwater intrusion into freshwater wetlands is caused by predictable sea level rise overall these findings support our initial hypothesis that small changes in salinity have large effects on p mobilization in estuarine wetlands by driving ir and sr decoupling p and fe binding and ultimately releasing p fig 10 however when the data are extended to regional or global scales some site specific environmental factors and uncertainties need to be considered first the biogeochemical cycling of subtropical estuarine wetlands was most likely affected by the alternation of freshwater and saltwater therefore to precisely assess the soil p dynamics in the intertidal zone of the min river estuary the hydrological conditions should be further investigated during sampling periods second it should be noted that plant communities play a key role in soil p retention and mobilization saltwater intrusion reduces aboveground biomass increases the decomposition rate of organic matter and thus limits p retention and accumulation conversely increased belowground biomass roots could enhance the lability of p on a fine scale by altering the rhizosphere soil redox potential which acted as a potential high activity p pool and accounted for an important portion of the p cycle in wetland systems consequently the biogeochemical behavior of p in estuaries has obvious uncertainties due to seawater intrusion climate change and plant regulation which might induce short or long term changes in environmental factors further modulating p release and retention future studies should focus on how these spatial temporal or site specific coupling changes affect p biogeochemical behaviors which is beneficial for better understanding the controlling mechanisms as well as scientific management of p in subtropical estuarine wetlands 5 conclusions in the present study we found that soil p pools decreased while srp and labile p increased along the salinity gradient in the estuarine wetland which confirmed that salinity can enhance the lability of soil p and facilitate its rapid resupply and release from the soil the coupling between labile p and fe in both the field and mesocosm provides further supporting evidence that ir might be the dominant pathway controlling p behavior by the reductive dissolution of feooh although ir and sr might coexist in the estuarine environment in both salinities the higher difs fitted r and k 1 but lower t c and k 1 combined with smoother r curves in the dormant period suggested a larger soil labile p pool and faster diffusion kinetics and resupply rate from the soil to the overlying water which exacerbated the internal p loading of estuarine wetlands during the dormant period moreover our findings initially indicated that plant communities might be key drivers of regulating soil p cycling at different periods by altering biomass aboveground and belowground and rhizosphere redox potential we emphasize that it is necessary to identify distinct p cycling mechanisms in estuarine salinity systems with different hydrological conditions and plant communities strengthen the investigation and evaluation of internal p loading in estuarine waters and enhance the capacity of water purification and

15938,estuarine wetlands which typically store large amounts of phosphorus p are experiencing increased salinity as well as changed environmental factors caused by rising sea levels in this study the seasonal dynamics of p speciation availability and biogeochemical couplings with iron fe sulfur s in soil and porewater were measured in a low salinity estuarine wetland using in situ high resolution diffusive gradients in thin films dgt and dialysis hr peeper techniques the diffusion kinetics and resupply capacity of p from the soil phase to solution were simulated using a dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model the transition from freshwater to brackish wetlands reduced soil p pools and shifted to more recalcitrant speciation the concentration of dgt labile p across the soil water profiles ranged from 0 002 to 0 039 mean 0 015 mg l 1 which increased with increasing salinity in both the field and mesocosm experiments the distributions of labile and soluble p showed high heterogeneity across the profiles and there were some sharp peak values below the soil water interface swi which significantly increased the concentration and lability of p the strong coupling between labile p and fe s provided direct evidence for the coexistence of iron reduction ir and sulfate reduction sr in the estuary while ir might predominate in p mobilization in the brackish environment because of higher labile fe concentrations and stronger fe p couplings the diffusion fluxes of p were positive at both sites demonstrating that the kinetics of p were from the soils to the overlying water higher r and k 1 values fitted in the difs model implied that a stronger resupply capacity and desorption rate and thus faster remobilization kinetics of p occurred with increasing salinity our findings indicated that increased salinity even at low levels can alter the desorption rate and resupply capacity of soil p in estuarine wetlands and accelerate p remobilization and release by regulating the ir and sr processes thereby leading to the deterioration of water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal p loading iron sulfur phosphorus coupling dgt hr peeper difs model saltwater intrusion estuarine wetland 1 introduction phosphorus p is not only an essential element for plant productivity but also a key driver of water eutrophication estuarine wetlands as sources sinks and converters of p play a critical role in the global and regional p cycle and budget balance p cycling in estuarine systems is a complex biogeochemical process that is coupled with organic matter decomposition the iron fe sulfur s cycle and metal cation exchange braun et al 2019 the iron reduction ir and sulfate reduction sr are two of the main processes involved in organic matter mineralization which are accompanied by inorganic p regeneration resulting in high soluble p in porewater flores alsina et al 2016 pan et al 2020 in general the oxidation of soluble fe accelerates the formation of fe3 oxyhydroxides feooh on the soil surface which can adsorb and sequester p through electrostatic adsorption and complexation of functional groups queiroz et al 2020 however these feooh will be reduced to fe2 under anaerobic conditions which aggravates the release of p into the water jordan et al 2008 in addition this process is also regulated by sr under anaerobic conditions so4 2 is reduced to s2 and precipitated as fes or fes2 which prevents the binding of p and fe2 and facilitates the mobilization and release of soluble p flores alsina et al 2016 consequently depending on soil water environmental conditions fe s p cycling is dynamic and understanding this process and its regulatory mechanism on p im mobilization under the scenario of global change is of great significance for evaluating p biogeochemical processes and balancing regional p budgets the global mean sea level is estimated to rise 0 28 1 01 m by 2100 relative to 1995 2014 due to increasing global surface temperatures ipcc 2021 sea level rise in conjunction with reduced river runoff will lead to the migration of saltwater upstream in estuaries which is accompanied by salinization of original freshwater wetlands and landscapes knowles 2002 salinization significantly increases the salinity ionic strength so4 2 and cl and ph which ultimately regulates p dissolution and mineralization by changing osmotic pressure and the quantity and quality of organic substrates tully et al 2019 previous studies have observed that salinity stress play a primary role in regulating soil p dynamics hartzell et al 2017 hu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 found that high salinity 42 9 13 3 ppt reduced the alkaline phosphatase activity in river sediments but increased the content of naoh soluble p resulting in a low p regeneration ability however noe et al 2013 observed that long term salinification enhanced the net p mineralization and turnover rates in freshwater forested wetlands by accelerating plant stress and senescence in addition steinmuller and chambers 2018 found that different wetland types responded differently to salinity with a 15 ppt salinity increase significantly increasing porewater p concentrations in cypress dome 8 fold while no effect was observed in the mineral marsh previous studies mainly focused on soil p pools and stocks based on controlled laboratory experiments which were obtained by ex situ measurements with low resolution typically at the centimeter level there has been relatively little attention on p mobilization and its biogeochemical couplings with fe s at the soil water interface swi in estuarine wetlands due to the lack of high resolution in situ detection technologies the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt an in situ and dynamical passive sampling technique has been widely applied in determining available elements in soil water and sediment which can overcome the disadvantages of large interference and error in ex situ active sampling davison and zhang 2012 hummel et al 2021 to date existing research on p mobilization using dgt devices has been concentrated chiefly in eutrophic lakes reservoirs chen et al 2019 flores alsina et al 2016 norgbey et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 or several polluted river estuarines pan et al 2020 sun et al 2016 which have usually ignored subtropical estuaries with varied salinities the min river estuary one of the largest and most productive estuaries in southeast china suffers from different degrees of saltwater intrusion and surface water eutrophication due to global sea level rise and upstream nutrient loading hu et al 2017 sun et al 2015 due to the confluence of runoff and tides this estuary has small salinity changes from freshwater to brackish published results have revealed that low level salinity increases could alter soil microbial community structure tong et al 2017 soil carbon mineralization luo et al 2019 and phosphatase activity hu et al 2020 along this estuarine gradient however how small salinity changes affect p mobilization and its biogeochemical couplings with the fe s cycle is still not fully understood the objectives were to 1 evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in labile soluble p fe and s in soil water profiles based on in situ and experimental mesocosms 2 reveal the diffusive fluxes and remobilization kinetics of p across the swi using the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model and 3 clarify the main mechanisms and controlling factors of p remobilization under low salinity scenarios we hypothesized that small changes in salinity have large effects on p mobilization kinetics at the swi in estuarine wetlands by decoupling the fe p s cycle enhancing p availability and resupply capacity and ultimately accelerating p mobilization and release 2 materials and methods 2 1 site delineation the experiment was conducted in the min river estuary fig s1 which has a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and rainy summers fig s2 to elucidate the effects of low salinity changes the wetlands were divided into tidal freshwater 0 5 ppt and brackish 0 5 5 ppt wetlands along the estuarine gradient their water levels were mainly regulated by tidal cycles luo et al 2019 tong et al 2017 tides were regular semidiurnal tide over a 24 hour cycle and there was normally 20 150 cm of tidal water above the soil surface at high tide tong et al 2017 in order to isolate the effects of salinity the two sites had similar vegetation native cyperus malaccensis tides and soil conditions the growth period of c malaccensis was from may to november and its belowground biomass at brackish site 4 03 0 64 mg cm 3 was markedly higher than that at freshwater site 1 66 0 59 mg cm 3 while the aboveground biomass showing the opposite trend bai et al 2021 detailed information about the study area has been presented in previous studies hu et al 2020 tong et al 2017 2 2 preparation deployment and measurement of dgt and hr peeper probes in this study a new flat double sided dgt device consisting of a mixed binding gel incorporated with zr oxide zro chelex agi zro ca was employed which provides a powerful tool for simultaneously measuring in situ high resolution millimeter distribution information of labile p fe fe2 and s s2 wang et al 2019 hr peeper is based on diffusion equilibrium which allows soluble ions in porewater to exchange materials through the membrane and reach equilibrium after a period the hr peeper consists of 36 chambers of the same volume 400 μl and vertical resolution 5 mm both sides of which are covered with a nitrate fiber film 0 45 μm the chamber is prepacked with deionized water all dgt probes and hr peeper were assembled according to ding et al 2015 and the probes underwent deoxygenation with n2 for more than 16 h before deployment the field experiment was performed at two distinct periods of the year namely january dormant period and june growing period the hr peeper and dgt probes were assembled back to back and then deployed to two wetlands during high tide the probes were inserted 10 12 cm into the soil leaving 2 3 cm in overlying water effective length 15 cm after 24 h of dgt deployment 48 h for hr peeper the probes were carefully retrieved and cleaned with deionized water and kept moist until they reached the laboratory for two dimensional 2d analysis the probes were disassembled and scanned at a resolution of 600 dpi canon 5600f then the grayscale intensity of the scanned images was converted using imagej software http rsb info nih gov ij afterward the zro ca dgt gels were sectioned into strips at 2 mm intervals and the dgt labile fe in subsamples was eluted with 1 0 m hno3 solution ding et al 2016 for hr peeper analysis the solution was immediately extracted from each chamber the concentrations of labile soluble p and fe in solution sampled by hr peeper and dgt probes were measured by the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively 2 3 experimental mesocosms to exclude the possible interference of other factors the effects of a gradual salinity increase were further simulated through laboratory controlled mesocosms briefly during the early growing season native c malaccensis communities with even growth rates were selected in freshwater wetlands then a series of pvc buckets 25 cm in diameter and 35 cm in height was used to sample the soil column including plants in triplicate and the water near the sample plot was also collected the soil column was brought back to the laboratory and precultured for 1 month then 500 ml of preprepared saline solution artificial sea salt concentration 0 ck 2 5 ppt was added to each treatment 5 cm above the interface and the actual salinity was subject to the initial concentration after addition on the 90 th day of incubation both dgt and hr peeper probes were set and measured in each treatment according to the method in section 2 2 and the environmental factors were recorded simultaneously 2 4 soil and water analysis on each sampling date surface soils 0 10 cm triplicate were collected using a columnar sampler and at a depth consistent

rate constants d 1 respectively a detailed description of the difs model can be found in harper et al 2000 3 results 3 1 soil and water physiochemical properties salinity in the overlying water ranged from 0 3 0 2 ppt at freshwater sites to 5 1 1 5 ppt at brackish sites which was significantly higher in the dormant period than in the growing period table 1 the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in the overlying water of the brackish sites were higher than those of the freshwater sites and were significantly higher in the dormant period than in the growing period brackish wetlands have higher soil ph and ec than freshwater wetlands while som tc and tn concentrations and the c n ratio are lower soil tfe concentration of the brackish sites was significantly higher than that of freshwater in both periods moreover the concentrations of soil tfe fe2 and fe3 at both sites were approximately 3 10 fold higher in the growing period than in the dormant period 3 2 soil p speciation and availability higher soil tp range 452 3 742 0 mg kg 1 and ip range 251 7 436 4 mg kg 1 concentrations were observed at freshwater sites than at brackish sites and significant differences were found during the dormant period fig 1 no significant differences were observed for soil op range 49 6 441 7 mg kg 1 concentrations across all sites and periods soil naoh p range 89 3 185 9 mg kg 1 concentrations decreased while hcl p range 101 8 164 3 mg kg 1 concentrations increased with increasing salinity 3 3 two dimensional distributions of dgt labile p and s high resolution 2d distributions of labile p and s in soil water profiles displayed remarkable spatiotemporal dynamics and its overall high concentration and variation were observed at brackish sites especially during the dormant period fig 2 specifically the mean concentration of labile p increased from 0 002 growth and 0 014 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 0 007 growth and 0 039 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively the mean concentration of labile s increased from 0 003 growth and 0 036 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 0 087 growth and 0 189 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively moreover higher labile p and s concentrations were recorded during the dormant period than the growing period at both sites overall the consistency and magnitude of labile p and s varied across profiles fig 2 generally labile p and s hotspots appeared in deeper zones at brackish sites and in the middle zones at freshwater sites at the freshwater site during the dormant period there were some small dots with significantly enhanced p concentrations up to 0 2 mg l 1 near the swi and at the bottom of the profile labile p showed a similar spatial variation trend with that of labile s at freshwater sites labile p and s concentrations had no significant vertical variation along profiles during the growing period moreover labile p exhibits high horizontal heterogeneity at both sites with an average of more than 0 5 the highest is close to 2 5 and is mainly distributed near the swi fig s3 3 4 one dimensional distributions of dgt labile p fe and s overall labile fe concentrations across profiles increased from 0 13 growth and 1 52 dormancy mg l 1 in the freshwater sites to 3 23 growth and 11 14 dormancy mg l 1 in the brackish sites respectively fig 3 a during the growing period the concentrations of labile fe and s increased rapidly from the swi to depths of 20 mm then decreased and remained relatively stable at freshwater sites fig 3a however the labile p profiles exhibited irregular patterns or fluctuated with depth during the dormant period the labile p fe and s vertical profiles exhibited the characteristics of first increasing from depths of 20 mm and then decreasing rapidly and stabilizing below 70 mm at freshwater sites fig 3b at the brackish site the concentrations of labile p fe and s first increase abruptly from approximately 50 mm and then peak at 70 mm followed by a decrease or remain stable during the growing period fig 3c the distributions of labile p fe and s exhibited strong variation with depth during the dormant period at brackish sites and they gradually increased from the swi to deeper depths fig 3d moreover the concentrations of labile p and fe s in the soil water profiles showed a consistent trend fig s4 there were significant positive correlations between labile p and fe s at most sites and periods except the freshwater sites during the growing period the correlation coefficient r showed that the correlation between labile p and fe s was higher at the brackish site and dormant period than at the freshwater site and growing period 3 5 vertical variations in srp and soluble fe the vertical distributions of srp and soluble fe measured by hr peeper probes are shown in fig 4 srp concentrations showed a changing trend similar to soluble fe especially at freshwater sites figs 4a b both srp and soluble fe increased slightly with increasing depth at freshwater sites during the growing period but a strong peak appeared at depths of 135 mm with concentrations of 0 092 mg l 1 and 0 763 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of srp and fe had no significant vertical variation along the soil depth during the dormant period at freshwater sites but several hotspots appeared at 20 mm 90 mm 115 mm and 145 mm respectively strong variations in the vertical profiles of both srp and fe were observed at the brackish sites in both periods figs 4c d specifically there was an increasing trend from the swi to deeper depths of the profiles for both srp and fe during the growing period there was also an increasing trend for soluble fe from 50 mm to 90 mm which then remained relatively stable during the dormant periods however the distributions of srp profiles exhibited irregular and relatively stable patterns with depth during the dormant period overall higher srp and soluble fe in the profiles were observed in brackish sites and during the dormant period compared with the freshwater sites and growing period respectively 3 6 diffusion fluxes of p fe and s across the swi the diffusion fluxes of p across the swi were positive from soil to the overlying water at different sites and periods and were significantly higher at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites fig 5 there were clear positive diffusion fluxes of fe at the freshwater sites and they were higher in the growing period than in the dormant period significant positive fe fluxes were also observed at the brackish sites during the dormant period but were negative from overlying water to soil during the growing periods the diffusion flux of s is negative at the freshwater sites during both periods while it is strong positive at the brackish sites during the dormant periods overall the diffusion fluxes of p fe and s are from soil to overlying water release throughout the period and higher fluxes were observed in brackish sites 3 7 release kinetics of p by the difs model the kinetic parameters of labile p release from soils were derived using the difs model table 2 higher r values were observed at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites and were generally higher in the dormant period than in the growing period t c values ranged from 2 49 106 s to 9 99 106 s which were lower at the brackish sites than at freshwater sites additionally both k 1 and k 1 of the brackish wetlands were higher than those of freshwater wetlands furthermore the fitting curves of the r value of p in both the freshwater and brackish wetlands showed an initial abrupt increase over the deployment time and reached a distinct peak at approximately 0 7 1 0 h fig 6 after reaching the peak the r curve shows a continuous decline and the growing period has a relatively stronger decline than during the dormant period 3 8 changes in p fe and s in experimental mesocosms the concentration of labile p across profiles displayed an overall increase with increasing salinity with means of 0 022 ck 0 025 2 ppt and 0 046 5 ppt mg l 1 respectively figs 7 a c generally labile p hotspots appeared mainly at deep depths of the profiles in all treatments strong variations in the vertical distributions of labile s were also observed figs 7d f for the ck treatment higher labile s below the swi was found with increasing depth in the soils under the 2 ppt and 5 ppt salinity treatments the labile s distributions exhibited the characteristics of first decreasing from the overlying water 20 mm to the swi and then valleys at 30 mm followed by an increase or fluctuation with depth it is worth noting that positive relationships were established between p and fe in different treatments while the correlations between p and s gradually weakened with increasing salinity fig 8 moreover soil orp generally decreased with soil depth in all treatments with higher magnitudes observed in response to the saltwater addition although the difference was not statistically significant fig s5 overall the concentration and heterogeneity of labile p fe and s across profiles at 5 ppt salinity treatments were greater than those at ck and the coupling between p and s decreased with increasing salinity the srp and soluble fe concentrations displayed significantly different vertical distributions among the different treatments fig 9 for the ck treatment srp and soluble fe first increased rapidly from the swi to depths of 30 mm and then decreased or fluctuated with depth the distributions of srp and soluble fe in the 2 ppt treatments first increased from the swi then peaked at 30 mm followed by a sharp decrease and remained stable at 5 ppt the concentrations of srp and soluble fe first remained stable then increased from depths of 50 mm to 90 mm and then decreased slowly overall the srp concentrations showed a changing trend similar to that of soluble fe and higher values were found with increasing salinity especially for soluble fe 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of p in estuarine wetlands although freshwater and brackish wetlands are functionally similar differences in salinity and solute concentrations particularly so4 2 and cl lead to significant differences in biogeochemical processes weston et al 2014 in this study the transition from freshwater to brackish wetlands reduced soil tp ip and naoh p concentrations but promoted op and hcl p concentrations fig 1 in particular the larger reduction in naoh p concentrations was generally accompanied by a rapid increase in hcl p concentration in soils with salinity these findings provide strong evidence that low levels of salinity increase can also significantly regulate p speciation and transformation which is accompanied by a decrease in soil p pools and a shift toward more recalcitrant speciation in the brackish wetlands high so4 2 concentrations table 1 facilitate decomposition and mineralization of organic matter through sr 53so4 2 ch2o 106 nh3 16h3po4 106hco3 16nh4 53hs hpo4 2 39h rozan et al 2002 which stimulates the production and release of p into the overlying water coincidentally increased salinity raised the ph value table 1 which could aggravate soil p loss especially for naoh p in brackish wetlands due to high soil ph tending to have low p affinity and adsorption capacity with fe and al oxides braun et al 2019 moreover soil microbes and their associated soil microbe interactions can drive soil p transformation and the composition of p forms fraser et al 2017 stout et al 2014 our previous studies have found that salinization decreased phosphatase activity and the relative abundance of the phod harboring bacterial gene community e g streptomyces cupriavidus and bradyrhizobium hu et al 2020 that can affect soil organic p mineralization thereby regulating p speciation and availability bergkemper et al 2016 the concentration of srp and labile p across the swi ranged from 0 031 to 0 142 mean 0 087 mg l 1 and from 0 002 to 0 039 mean 0 015 mg l 1 respectively which differed significantly between salinities and confirmed that salinity can increase the availability of p and facilitate its rapid release from the soil the srp concentrations were nearly identical to those reported in the jiulong river estuary 0 075 mg l 1 pan et al 2019 and taihu lake 0 085 mg l 1 chen et al 2019 but significantly lower than the concentrations observed in the jiuxi river 0 75 mg l 1 pan et al 2020 and chaohu lake 0 32 mg l 1 yu et al 2019 this discrepancy might be related to their unique loading histories salinity range and other site specific factors such as temperature water depth and soil texture chen et al 2019 flores alsina et al 2016 jordan et al 2008 the distributions of srp and labile p showed high heterogeneity in both sites fig s3 and higher concentrations were generally observed at deeper depths figs 2 4 suggesting an active layer of p distribution across the profiles on the one hand this is closely related to the root distribution of c malaccensis with root exudates and the decomposition of litter residues providing a large amount of p with increasing depth on the other hand the decomposition of organic matter deplete oxygen in the underlying soil thereby facilitating the release of redox dependent p from the soil wu and wang 2017 furthermore there were some sharp peak values below the swi which significantly increased the concentration of p and enhanced the lability of soil p storage and release for example several hotspots of srp concentration in freshwater wetlands occurred at depths of 20 mm 90 mm and 145 mm which enhanced the average srp concentration by 30 50 fig 4 these hotspots may reflect high activity in labile p pools caused by roots of c malaccensis especially the root tips which represent bioavailability components and ineluctably regulate the overall metabolism of the p cycle yu et al 2019 despite the spatial variation soil p dynamics also showed obvious seasonal characteristics specifically srp and labile p concentrations in both salinities were higher in the dormant period 0 130 and 0 026 mg l 1 respectively than in the growing period 0 043 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively plant biomass especially belowground roots have different oxygen secretion capacities between the growing and dormant periods which regulate soil p retention and mobilization by altering the rhizosphere soil redox potential yu and kuzyakov 2021 our team previous results showed that soil oxidation reduction potential was consistently negative range 159 6 8 8 mv to 138 5 14 1 mv during the freshwater brackish transition and not statistically significant differences were observed across different salinities and seasons bai et al 2021 meanwhile the belowground biomass and root oxygen loss potential indicated by root fe3 plaque content 81 2 5 3 μmol fe g 1 to 134 5 5 4 μmol fe g 1 increased significantly more in the growing period than in the dormant period bai et al 2021 the increased fe3 concentrations table 1 also indicated that more fe3 is immobilized as fe3 oxides in the growing period altogether the increased root oxygen loss and fe3 oxides in the growing period accelerated the uptake and retention of p due to the high affinity and adsorption capacity which may be a key reason for the decrease of srp and labile p observed in the growing period figs 2 4 moreover during the growing period strong seasonal precipitation significantly reduces salinity and exacerbates leaching table 1 fig s2 which combined with plant uptake of nutrients results in low p concentrations in soil and porewater 4 2 biogeochemical fe and s concentrations and their effects on p mobilization numerous studies have revealed that the reductive dissolution of feooh is the primary mechanism regulating p mobilization and transformation in lake and freshwater soils chen et al 2019 ding et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 however in coastal environments saltwater intrusions and associated sr may also regulate p cycling by fe2 removal from porewater due to the formation and precipitation of solid fes and fes2 rozan et al 2002 it is noteworthy that the cycles of ir and sr are closely related in estuarine soils and may coexist or one process dominates during anaerobic organic matter mineralization while these processes have not been clearly distinguished in freshwater and brackish wetlands in the current study both field and mesocosm results revealed that the concentrations of labile fe and s in saltwater environments were significantly higher than those in freshwater furthermore the simultaneous release of fe and s from soil to water fig 5 was also observed in the brackish wetlands these results indicate that the ir and sr processes and their products are highly dependent on saltwater intrusion due to a significant increase in salinity and associated parameters e g so4 2 the coupling between labile p and fe in both the field and mesocosm fig s4 provides further supporting evidence that the remobilization of p is predominantly driven by fe redox cycling for instance lower soil orp in saline environment fig s5 accelerates the remobilization and release of soil p by stimulating the reductive dissolution of feooh queiroz et al 2020 which is in line with the higher concentrations of labile p observed under saltwater treatment figs 7d f moreover a positive correlation existed between labile p and s at most sites and periods fig s4 suggesting that the sr was also responsible for the retention and release of p to the overlying water this implies that soluble fe and s coexist in estuarine environments regardless of the heterogeneity which was also detected in other coastal and marine sediments ma et al 2017 pan et al 2020 rozan et al 2002 however it is of note that the average concentration of labile fe at all sites and periods was approximately 50 fold higher than that of labile s fig 2 indicating that the concentration of labile s in the soil was low more importantly experimental mesocosms without the interference of other factors revealed that the relationships between labile p and s were significantly decoupled with increasing salinity fig 8 these results revealed that although ir and sr coexist under anaerobic conditions ir might be the dominant pathway controlling p behavior in the estuarine environment in the fe reduction dominated systems the reductive dissolution of feooh is a key process to regulate the mobilization and resupply of p and fe is not effectively precipitated as fes which leads to coupled p and fe moreover it should be noted that there is no labile p fe and labile p s coupling in freshwater wetlands during the growing period although fe and s have consistent trends fig 3 this indicates that fe and p decoupled during the growing period and that changes in labile p concentration in soil water profiles were sensitive to plant growth and uptake in summary the experimental observations in this study together with previous reports confirm that ir and sr coexist in controlling p mobilization in estuarine wetlands and that ir is dominant because of the higher labile fe concentrations and tighter fe p coupling at different salinities 4 3 diffusion flux and resupply kinetics of p across the swi apparent diffusion flux can assess whether the soil is a source or sink of p based on the concentration gradient at the swi ding et al 2015 in this study the fluxes of p were positive across sites and periods which demonstrated that the diffusion of p from soil toward water was occurring furthermore the diffusion flux of p varied from 0 48 ng cm 2 d 1 to 5 09 ng cm 2 d 1 with an average of 2 80 ng cm 2 d 1 which was remarkably lower than that of dongting lake 9 ng cm 2 d 1 gao et al 2016 hongze lake 17 2 79 3 ng cm 2 d 1 yao et al 2016 tianbao reservoir 8 ng cm 2 d 1 norgbey et al 2020 and hongfeng reservoir 22 ng cm 2 d 1 chen et al 2019 but higher than that of the jiuxi river china 58 ng cm 2 d 1 pan et al 2020 in deep reservoirs and lakes anoxic or anaerobic environments and the associated reductive dissolution of fe bound p and sr stimulate the release of p and thus higher p diffusion chen et al 2019 it should be noted that the diffusion flux of p at the brackish sites 4 28 ng cm 2 d 1 was significantly higher than that at the freshwater sites 1 31 ng cm 2 d 1 fig 5 which further confirmed the promoting effect of strong sr and ir on p mobilization and release in brackish environments estuarine brackish wetlands have high salinity and associated high concentrations of fe s and organic matter table 1 which are accompanied by the coprecipitation of fe and s resulting in rapid remobilization and release of p similarly there were also clear positive diffusion fluxes of fe and s at brackish sites during the dormant period but inverse diffusion during the growing period the mean fluxes of fe and s at the brackish sites were significantly higher than those at the freshwater sites which was consistent with the high tfe fe3 and so4 2 concentrations table 1 this indicated that a mass of fe and s were released from the soil into overlying water at the brackish sites especially during the dormant period depending on high salinity as well as other parameters such as ph caused by low precipitation studies by luo et al 2019 have reported that saltwater intrusion can alter the main pathways of organic carbon mineralization such as ir to sr by changing the concentrations of so4 2 and cl in porewater these findings suggest that intense p fe and s diffusion and pollution might occur in brackish wetlands during the dormant periods leading to eutrophication and water quality deterioration in estuaries and surrounding waters however the diffusion flux of labile s is negative in the freshwater wetlands during both the growing and dormant periods which provides supportive evidence for weak sr and its products in freshwater to further illustrate the ability of soil to resupply p to solution the kinetics of p release from soils were calculated based on the difs model harper et al 2000 menezes blackburn et al 2019 the r are higher in the brackish wetlands mean 0 287 than in the freshwater wetlands mean 0 084 suggesting that brackish soils have high p reactive and resupply capacity which could readily release p into overlying water the t c reflects the adsorption desorption kinetics of soil and solution which is higher in the freshwater wetlands than in brackish wetlands the k d in the freshwater wetlands mean 2164 1 cm3 g 1 were nearly equal to those in the brackish wetlands mean 2044 4 cm3 g 1 which were both high and indicated a large soil p pool in estuarine wetlands notably brackish soils had higher values of k 1 parameters in comparison to freshwater soils and were accompanied by an increasing trend from dormancy to growth the high r and k 1 corresponded with the low t c in brackish wetlands indicating that there was a rapid kinetic remobilization of p from the soil pool to porewater the results might be attributed to the fact that the high salinity and so4 2 concentration of brackish wetlands especially during the dormant periods table 1 accelerate the mobilization of p from soil to overlying water by promoting the release of fe bound p this was consistent with higher labile and p diffusion fluxes as well as lower concentrations of naoh p observed in brackish soils figs 1 5 however the freshwater soils recorded low r but high t c values meaning that these soils have a slow p resupply capacity to the porewater moreover the time dependence curves of r values for p simulated by difs provide further information on the capacity and kinetics of p resupply from soil pools menezes blackburn et al 2019 in this case the r curve generally increased sharply and peaked at short intervals less than 1 h and then declined markedly with deployment time fig 6 the freshwater and brackish soils have similar r curve shapes even under different periods as previously stated harper et al 2000 this r curve belongs to the slow to intermediate resupply rate showing that the soil p resupply capacity changes greatly with dgt deployment time this rapid change was attributed partly to the intense gradient diffusion of p from the soil to the porewater at the beginning and then the labile p pools were consecutively depleted resulting in a limited resupply yuan et al 2021 it is worth noting that in both freshwater and brackish soils the change in the r curve with time in the dormant period is smaller than that in the growing period demonstrating a higher soil p resupply capacity during the dormant period this can also be clearly seen by the high values of r and k 1 during the dormant period table 2 in the dormant period high salinity and so4 2 coupled with strong organic matter decomposition stimulate the release of p through sr and ir as previously mentioned 4 4 implications and future works in situ high resolution dgt hr peeper difs techniques provide good insight for studying the microscopic mechanism of p fe s couplings mobilization and p diffusion kinetics in estuarine wetlands to recap our results indicated that increased salinity even at low levels may be a key factor regulating soil p speciation and availability promoting p remobilization and release in estuarine wetlands the transition from freshwater to brackish environments accompanied by high salinity and ph and large concentrations of so4 2 cl and fe3 significantly reduced the soil p pool shifting soil p toward a more stable speciation moreover higher labile p fe and s concentrations across the swi were also observed in brackish wetlands than in freshwater which showed a consistent trend and clearly confirmed that the decoupling of fe bound p was the primary mechanism of p release furthermore the difs model simulated the high r and k 1 and low t c in brackish wetlands suggesting that these soils have a rapid p kinetic remobilization and resupply capacity to the porewater especially during the dormant period these findings have important implications for improving the understanding of p speciation availability and remobilization kinetics in estuarine wetlands and provide a basis for modeling p cycling when saltwater intrusion into freshwater wetlands is caused by predictable sea level rise overall these findings support our initial hypothesis that small changes in salinity have large effects on p mobilization in estuarine wetlands by driving ir and sr decoupling p and fe binding and ultimately releasing p fig 10 however when the data are extended to regional or global scales some site specific environmental factors and uncertainties need to be considered first the biogeochemical cycling of subtropical estuarine wetlands was most likely affected by the alternation of freshwater and saltwater therefore to precisely assess the soil p dynamics in the intertidal zone of the min river estuary the hydrological conditions should be further investigated during sampling periods second it should be noted that plant communities play a key role in soil p retention and mobilization saltwater intrusion reduces aboveground biomass increases the decomposition rate of organic matter and thus limits p retention and accumulation conversely increased belowground biomass roots could enhance the lability of p on a fine scale by altering the rhizosphere soil redox potential which acted as a potential high activity p pool and accounted for an important portion of the p cycle in wetland systems consequently the biogeochemical behavior of p in estuaries has obvious uncertainties due to seawater intrusion climate change and plant regulation which might induce short or long term changes in environmental factors further modulating p release and retention future studies should focus on how these spatial temporal or site specific coupling changes affect p biogeochemical behaviors which is beneficial for better understanding the controlling mechanisms as well as scientific management of p in subtropical estuarine wetlands 5 conclusions in the present study we found that soil p pools decreased while srp and labile p increased along the salinity gradient in the estuarine wetland which confirmed that salinity can enhance the lability of soil p and facilitate its rapid resupply and release from the soil the coupling between labile p and fe in both the field and mesocosm provides further supporting evidence that ir might be the dominant pathway controlling p behavior by the reductive dissolution of feooh although ir and sr might coexist in the estuarine environment in both salinities the higher difs fitted r and k 1 but lower t c and k 1 combined with smoother r curves in the dormant period suggested a larger soil labile p pool and faster diffusion kinetics and resupply rate from the soil to the overlying water which exacerbated the internal p loading of estuarine wetlands during the dormant period moreover our findings initially indicated that plant communities might be key drivers of regulating soil p cycling at different periods by altering biomass aboveground and belowground and rhizosphere redox potential we emphasize that it is necessary to identify distinct p cycling mechanisms in estuarine salinity systems with different hydrological conditions and plant communities strengthen the investigation and evaluation of internal p loading in estuarine waters and enhance the capacity of water purification and

15939,the ecological risk of microplastics mps usually depends on their environmental behavior however few studies focused on the impact of hydrodynamic perturbations on the fate of mps in hyporheic zone this study chose quartz sand 250 425 μm as simulated porous medium to investigate the transport of 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics psnps under hydrodynamic factors including flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min flow orientations up flow down flow and horizontal flow and water saturations 50 80 and 100 as well as different salinities and temperatures the breakthrough curves btcs and retained profiles rps of psnps were compared and analyzed by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory due to the small size and moderate density of psnps as well as high flow rates the flow orientation exhibited little effect on the psnp transport however high flow rate low salinity high water saturation and low temperature would facilitate the mobility of psnps the increase in salinity from zero to 35 psu practical salinity units caused the compression of electrical double layer and weakened the electrostatic repulsion between psnps and sands which dramatically decreased the penetration rate from 100 to zero especially the lower energy barrier of psnps psnps at 3 5 and 35 psu 16 45 kbt and zero respectively facilitated the adsorption of psnps on sand via ripening mechanism due to the strong adsorption of psnps by sand at high salinity the effect of flow rate on psnp transport was more pronounced at low salinity the mobility of psnps at 0 035 psu was enhanced by 41 4 75 3 as the flow rate increased from 0 5 to 2 0 ml min which was contributed from the reversible deposition in lower secondary energy minimum depth at low salinity and the stronger hydrodynamic drag force generated by the high flow rate however the sufficient molecular diffusion at low flow rate promoted the occupation of psnps on adsorption sites in addition the penetration rate of psnps decreased by 25 0 as the water saturation decreased from 100 to 50 indicating that the film straining at the air water interface would hinder the transport of psnps finally temperature increase impeded the penetration of psnps by 6 26 23 1 via blocking mechanism our results suggest that low salinity high flow river systems may be at greater risk of mps contamination due to enhanced vertical transport

finally accumulated in the human wang et al 2021 although rising researches have studied the risk and toxicity of mps to biota and human the studies about their transport in different environments are still limited therefore it is very crucial to investigate and predict the environmental behavior and fate of mps in different media including in the key hyporheic zone hyporheic zone is an active ecotone for connecting surface water and groundwater and plays a key role in maintaining the ecological balance of benthic animals in the aquatic environment battin et al 2016 the significant functions of hyporheic zone in bidirectional transport of nutrients providing habitats for biota and protecting biodiversity are all related to the hydraulic perturbations in this area merill and tonjes 2014 meanwhile this zone is also a potential risk area for pollutant retention and entering into the benthic food web due to the lower seepage velocity frei et al 2019 the hyporheic zone has ecological fragility under the influence of hydrodynamics thus it is very crucial to understand and predict the retention and behavior of pollutants in this zone with different hydrodynamics for further assessment of the related ecological risk porous media such as soils or quartz sands have been used to simulate the transport of different pollutants in the hyporheic zone jiang et al 2019 lotts and hester 2020 frei et al 2019 demonstrated that riverbed sediments of up to 0 6 m i e the hyporheic zone can be an accumulation area for mps of smaller size 50 μm and pointed out that hyporheic exchange is a potential mechanism for smaller plastic particles to enter an underlying aquifer and thus contaminate the groundwater similarly a field stream study by drummond et al 2020 indicates that in streambed sediments hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate i e deposition retention and long term accumulation of all plastic particles smaller than 100 μm irrespective of polymer type to date researches have reported the transport of micro nanoplastics in porous media and its influencing factors such as the properties of micro nanoplastics chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 the properties of porous media he et al 2020 hou et al 2020 and hydrochemical conditions dong et al 2021 tan et al 2021 moreover the transport of mps in different porous media is also affected by different environmental factors alimi et al 2018 however hydraulic conditions including flow rate flow orientation and saturation are seldom involved in the aforementioned studies in fact groundwater extraction flood and ebb variation seasonal alteration and sea level changes all alter the hydrodynamic properties of water flow in hyporheic zone which always dominate the transport of pollutants and microorganisms in porous media ning et al 2021 studies have reported that the high velocity of pore water decreased the collision time between many particulate pollutants e g engineered nanoparticles lu et al 2021 colloids chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 microbial pathogens ren et al 2020 etc and porous media leading to a lower deposition rate coefficient thus scouring of pollutants by hydrodynamic forces at high flow rate heavily promotes the release and transport depth of pollutants in porous media hydrodynamic dispersion is considered as the major transport process of pollutants in porous media when the medium is unsaturated the hydrodynamic dispersion is greatly affected by water saturation zhuang et al 2021 therefore water saturation could also change the behavior of particles in porous media unsaturated conditions inhibited the transport of many particulate pollutants such as graphene oxide dong et al 2016 silica colloids qin et al 2020 polyethylene particles wu et al 2021 etc furthermore the research by zhuang et al 2005 highlighted the importance of surface properties of particulate pollutants for their permeation in unsaturated porous media compared with hydrophobic silica colloids amphiphilic latex particles exhibited a greater retention in unsaturated sands zhuang et al 2005 however the transport of tio2 nanoparticles and multi walled carbon nanotubes has been reported to be insensitive to changes in the moisture content of porous media fang et al 2013 mekonen et al 2014 moreover the effect of gravity on colloids would also remarkably change in different flow orientations chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 hence it is essential to study the transport of mps in porous media with different hydraulic conditions to simulate the filed environment under the influence of rainfall or tides of different intensities hyporheic zones in various water environments e g ocean estuary surface water groundwater etc usually have anisotropic heterogeneity in the properties of fluid and porous medium e g ionic strength flow rate flow orientation water saturation and temperature therefore the main purpose of this study is to investigate the transport and retention of nano scale polystyrene particles in quartz sand under different hydraulic conditions including flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min flow orientations up flow down flow and horizontal flow and water saturations 50 80 and 100 the breakthrough curves btcs and retained profiles rps of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps were obtained through column experiments in addition the impacts of salinity gradients 0 0 035 0 35 3 5 and 35 psu practical salinity units and temperatures 4 and 25 c were simultaneously studied finally the interaction energy attachment efficiency and deposition rates were calculated based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory and colloidal filtration theory respectively to reveal the underlying mechanisms of hydraulics affecting the vertical transport of psnps the results of this study will provide useful information for predicting and controlling the potential risk of nanoplastics in hyporheic zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of nanoplastics and porous media psnps 100 nm were purchased from tianjin saierqun technology the used influent concentration in this study was kept at 10 mg l which was diluted from the stock solution to ensure even dispersion the solutions were prepared before the experiment with ultrasonication the physical dimensions and morphologies of psnps in solution were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem 450 fei usa fig s5 meanwhile the psnps were identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig s4 according to the manufacturer s instructions and the ftir spectrum the used nanoplastics in this study are plain polystyrene without any coating groups the zeta potentials zp and hydrodynamic diameters dh of psnps and quartz sands under different conditions were determined by using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk according to previous studies dong et al 2018 he et al 2020 2018 the concentration of psnps was determined by a uv spectrophotometry uv 5200 metash china with a wavelength of 290 nm detailed measurement protocols were listed in the supplementary materials sm quartz sand with a diameter of 250 425 μm was selected as the model porous medium which was provided by kemiou factory tianjin china with a purity of 99 0 sio2 the ftir spectrum and sem images of the quartz sand were provided in sm fig s4 and s6 to remove metal oxides and other impurities from the grain surface the quartz sand was first immersed in hydrogen peroxide 30 for 72 h and rinsed with deionized water until the ph returned to neutral and then the clean sand was oven dried at 105 c overnight after that the sand was cooled to room temperature and used for transport experiments 2 2 transport experiments the quartz sand was wet packed into a cylindrical glass column 10 cm long and 1 6 cm inner diameter with vibration to minimize any layering or air entrapment the final porosity of the packed columns was approximately 43 4 determined by the pycnometer method two stainless steel screens with a diameter of 150 μm were placed on the both ends of column to avoid sand loss and promote the uniform distribution of solutions several peristaltic pumps bt100l lead fluid china were used to maintain different hydraulic conditions the psnp transport in quartz sand was firstly investigated under water saturation condition with different flow orientations vertical up flow vertical down flow and horizontal flow and flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min meanwhile in order to clarify the impact of salinity alteration the influent psnp solutions with different salinity gradients 0 0 035 0 35 3 5 and 35 psu were prepared with sodium chloride to simulate the environment of freshwater 0 035 psu estuary 0 35 and 3 5 psu and marine 35 psu respectively all saturation experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c with a total of forty five treatments each of which was conducted with three replicates in the unsaturated experiments two peristaltic pumps at inlet and outlet of the column were used to achieve different water saturations s w including 50 80 and 100 as described in a previous study lyu et al 2018 once the target s w reached the two pumps were immediately set to the same flow rate to keep the unsaturated conditions the column weight was also regularly measured to determine the actual s w according to the results of saturated experiments the influence of flow rates 1 0 and 2 0 ml min and temperature 25 and 4 c was also studied all unsaturated experiments were carried out with a constant salinity gradient 0 035 psu and in a vertical downward flow orientation so a total of twelve treatments were conducted in the unsaturated condition with three replicates per treatment all experiment treatments are presented in table s2 in each treatment the transport of a nonreactive tracer nabr 0 01 mol l was used to determine column performance and hydrodynamic conditions after packing the columns were equilibrated by using over 10 pore volumes pv of background solutions and then 3 pv suspensions of psnps in different background solutions were injected to the column following by 5 pv background solutions to release the psnps which were not retained in column he et al 2020 2018 the concentrations of psnps in effluent were measured every 2 min with a uv spectrophotometry uv 5200 metash china at a wavelength of 290 nm to yield the btcs in tests after the transport experiments the retentive psnps in the quartz sand were determined in the vertical flow conditions the quartz sand was immediately divided into 5 equal segments with a height of 2 cm in the horizontal flow conditions each sand segment was immediately divided into two parts with up and down section and then deionized water with 0 1 tween 20 10 ml was added to each portion and ultrasonicated for 5 min to desorb and re suspend the psnps after that a uv spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 290 nm was applied to measure the concentrations of psnps in the upper layer solutions which were employed to yield the rps 2 3 calculation methods according to the classical colloid filtration theory cft the attachment and deposition of psnps onto the grain surface in different experiments were quantitatively compared the dimensionless attachment efficiency α the single collector removal efficiency η 0 and the deposition rate k d were calculated based on the mass recovery m r as reported by many previous studies zhao et al 2021 in addition the classic dlvo theory was employed to calculate the surface interaction energies between the two interaction pairs psnps psnps particle particle and psnps sands particle plate in porous media respectively the detailed cft and dlvo calculations and results are provided in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps under different conditions the sem images of the psnps adsorbed on the quartz sand are shown in fig 1 suggesting the used psnps basically have a regular spherical and uniform size as shown in table s1 in the sm the detected dh of psnps in ultrapure water was 100 0 3 4 nm as the solution salinity increased from 0 035 to 35 psu the dh values increased from 109 8 1 5 nm to 198 6 15 5 nm indicating a salinity dependent enhancement of psnp aggregation fig 2 according to the dlvo theory an increase in salinity reduces the electrostatic repulsion so that the van der waals attraction dominates the interactions between nanoplastics leading to the homogeneous aggregation of psnps dong et al 2018 it also notices that at 0 035 psu the dh of psnps at 4 c was smaller than that at 25 c suggesting a weaker brownian motion at low temperature under all experimental conditions the zps of psnps and quartz sand were negatively charged table s1 indicating that the interactions of psnps psnps and psnps sands were mutually exclusive as the salinity increased from zero to 35 psu the zp absolute values of psnps gradually decreased from 44 9 0 8 mv to 12 8 0 4 mv implying that the electrostatic repulsion between psnps was weakened xu et al 2018 in addition the zp absolute value of psnps at 4 c was higher than that at 25 c reflecting that psnps were more stable at low temperature 3 2 effects of salinity under saturated condition previous studies have reported that the salinity may seriously affect the stability and mobility of plastic particles thereby influencing their transport in porous media li et al 2021a wu et al 2019 in this study the btcs of psnps in saturated porous media under different salinities are presented in fig 3 the mass percentages of psnps passed through the columns meff at 0 psu were very high ranging from 78 5 to 100 with the increase of salinity the meff values decreased significantly in most cases and the lowest value was zero this marked decrease may be attributed to the changed dh and zp of psnps caused by the alteration of salinity the increase of salinity compressed the electrical double layer of psnps and lowered the negative charged surface charge and then decreased the collided distance between psnps in that case the dominant interaction between psnps altered from repulsive force to attractive force and the psnps tended to aggregate with each other thereby increasing their dh table s1 the enhanced dh of psnp further increased the probability of being trapped in the pore throats of the medium due to the larger size beryani et al 2020 on the other hand according to dlvo theory the decreased absolute value of surface potentials of psnps and quartz sand caused by the increasing salinity from zero to 35 psu simultaneously reduced the energy barrier of the interactions between psnps psnps from 53 10 kbt to zero and psnps sands from 93 28 kbt to zero fig s2 the decreased energy barrier means van der waals attraction prevailed which resulted in the instability and aggregation of psnps and the adsorption of psnps on grain surface especially under favorable condition 35 psu the interactions between psnps psnps and psnps sands were basically negative and energy barrier disappeared fig s2 indicating that the psnps were extremely unstable in the quartz sand column similar observation has also been reported previously wu et al 2019 in that case brownian motion was sufficient to overcome the energy barrier resulting in permanent deposition of psnps on grain surface this suggested that high salinity strongly weakened the stability of psnps making them more likely to be trapped in porous media dong et al 2018 hence the increased salinity may markedly lower the mobility of psnps in saturated porous media through enhancing their dh and zp in addition a similar trend of the effluent concentration increasing with the passing of time without tailing were observed at 0 035 and 0 35 psu in most cases such similar shape may be attributable to the blocking mechanism fig 2 according to the calculated dlvo interaction energy fig s2 the unfavorable conditions of lower salinities could induce a higher negative potential of psnps thereby increasing the energy barrier between psnps and psnps and being adverse to their mutual contact once the front psnps occupied all the limited adsorption sites on grain surface the following psnps would no longer touch with the deposited psnps but passed through the porous media therefore the btc plateau appeared with time increasing at lower salinity suggesting a blocking phenomenon babakhani et al 2017 different from the blocking mechanism a ripening mechanism fig 2 occurred at higher salinities 3 5 and 35 psu in which the penetration rates of psnps were markedly lowered from 9 41 to zero table s2 as reported by elimelech et al 1995 colloidal suspensions are usually considered very stable if the energy barrier exceeds 20 kt however the energy barrier of psnps psnps at 3 5 and 35 psu were 16 45 kbt and zero respectively these indicated that the psnps were prone to be attached after contact with each other in the absence of energy barrier or under low energy barrier condition as mentioned before high salinities decreased the electrostatic repulsion and interfered with the stability of psnps these are all accounted for the ripening mechanism because the attached psnps could perform as additional adsorption sites for the following psnps and then form multiple layers adsorption on grain surface babakhani et al 2017 similar results have been found in previous studies with high salinities nearly 600 mmol l and 8 5 mol l nacl dong et al 2018 magal et al 2011 the rps of psnps in saturated porous media under different salinities are presented in fig 4 as expected the change trend of recovery rate of rps was opposite to that of btcs table s2 due to the high mobility of psnps at 0 psu their retention rates were close to zero in most cases psnps were retained at the entrance of sand column and then the retention rates gradually decreased with the transport distance fig 4 however at high salinity a high retention of psnps was observed in each sand column suggesting that flow rate and flow orientation would also determine the retention and distribution of psnps in porous media 3 3 effects of flow rate under saturated condition the transport of psnps in saturated quartz sand at different flow rates are also shown in fig 3 the influence of flow rate on the transport of psnps was more significant at low salinity but not at high salinity the decrease of flow rate delayed the outflow of psnps especially in the case of higher penetration rates at 0 psu in addition the low flow rate led to a sloping upward shape of the btcs at 0 psu indicating the blocking mechanism at low flow rate the molecular diffusion of psnps was more sufficient which would increase their contact with sand particles and facilitate the occupation of adsorption sites syngouna et al 2017 on the contrary the highest flow rate of 2 0 ml min resulted in a high meff at low salinity table s2 this facilitating effect caused by high flow rate on pollutant transport has been commonly reported in previous researches chen et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2019 firstly high flow rate could reduce the residence time of psnps on grain surface and decrease their interaction chances li et al 2021a secondly owing to the lower secondary energy minimum depth at a low salinity fig s2 the deposited psnps may be re entrained by the stronger hydrodynamic drag force generated from the high flow rate and then flowed out of the column dunphy guzman et al 2006 also reported that the aggregated psnps could be broken up to small size by the shear force caused by high flow rate resulting in easier transport in the pore throat of porous media it should be noted that the middle flow rate of 1 0 ml min led to the highest breakthrough rate at lower salinity fig 3 this may be due to the fact that the fluid flows more disordered at higher flow rates and the collision makes psnps more easily deposited on the grain surface hou et al 2020 however in the case of low penetration rates the effect of flow rate on the release of psnps from grain surface at two high salinities 3 5 and 35 psu was not obvious this may be attributed to the strong colloidal attraction force and adhesive force between psnps and sand caused by the high ionic strength which may play a much important role than the drag force caused by water flow leading to psnps irreversibly captured in the primary energy minimum zhao et al 2020 the agglomerates with larger size formed by the aggregation of plastics at high salinity will also be trapped in pore throats which would not be easily washed away by water flow it is worth noting that the rps of psnps at 0 5 and 1 0 ml min with different salinities exhibited a hyperexponential distribution fig 4 which may be driven by the colloidal polydispersivity bedrikovetsky et al 2019 and strong secondary minimum attraction under favorable deposition conditions johnson 2020 both drivers could further decrease the deposition rate of psnps from the entrance moreover the physical straining may be also accounted for the exponential distribution of particles in porous media under low ionic strength conditions yuan and shapiro 2010 different from low medium rates the rps at high flow rate showed a non monotonic distribution and the psnp retention fluctuated with distance although most of psnps were deposited at the entrance a small rps peak appeared in the middle area as the transport distance increased fig 4 similar reports have pointed out that the deposition in secondary energy minimum is reversible which made a few psnps deposited on grain surface could be desorbed by the stronger hydrodynamic force generated from high flow rates and then the re migrated psnps could be captured by the nanoscale surface roughness on sand or be blocked in pore throats torkzaban and bradford 2016 yao et al 2014 in addition straining and irreversible attachment by primary minima interactions would increase the retention of psnps li et al 2004 sang et al 2013 moreover the ripening appeared at high ionic strength may also increase the deposition rate of psnps babakhani et al 2017 3 4 effects of flow orientation under saturated condition as an important hydraulic factor the alteration of flow orientation may also affect the transport of psnps in saturated quartz sand previous studies have found that the penetration rates of particles were generally lower under vertically upward flow than that under vertically downward flow chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 whereas the lowest penetration rate were observed under horizontal flow li and ghoshal 2016 these results suggested that the gravity oriented flow may enhance the dynamic dispersivity of the suspended particles and prevent them from being adsorbed to the sites by great hydrodynamic drag force jiang et al 2016 however the alteration of flow orientation had little effect on the breakthrough curves of psnps in the present study fig 3 previous studies also found that there was no significant difference in the transport of latex particle under the vertical and horizontal flow li and ghoshal 2016 several reasons may contribute to this insensitivity of psnp transport to flow orientation firstly the gravitational settling is positively correlated with particle density in the present study the density of polystyrene microspheres is close to the water which means that gravity will not have a great effect on their breakthrough rate li et al 2015 moreover according to the report of ma et al 2011 for colloids with diameter less than 0 5 μm the gravity change caused by the flow orientation upward and downward flow had a negligible effect on their breakthrough which is consistent with our results in addition the flow rates used in this study were much higher than those in other studies james and chrysikopoulos 2011 so the effect of gravity would be more negligible when compared to the strong hydrodynamic force caused by high flow rate different from the btcs flow orientations have a certain impact on the rps of psnps in sand column fig 4 the retention of psnps in the bottom was higher than that in the top under the horizontal flow although the effect of gravity was weaker than the hydrodynamic force caused by horizontal flow a few psnps would still settle down by gravity and finally deposit in the bottom under the vertical orientations the effect of gravity was negligible when compared to the hydrodynamic force caused by high flow rate which may account for the little difference between the retention curves 3 5 effects of water saturation few studies have focused on the transport of particles under unsaturated conditions hence the psnp transport in quartz sand columns was carried out under three water saturations including unsaturated conditions sw 50 and 80 and saturated condition sw 100 the btcs and rps of psnps are provided in figs 5 and 6 respectively the change trend of btcs seemed to be consistent in unsaturated and saturated conditions exhibiting a kind of blocking pattern moreover flow rate had little effect on the btcs of psnp transport under unsaturated condition as shown in table s2 the meff values of btcs decreased from 84 7 to 59 7 as the water saturation decreased from 100 to 50 which indicates that the decrease of water saturation may impede the penetration of psnps in sand column this inhibition caused by unsaturated conditions on the transport of different particles in porous media has been reported in previous studies qin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 different from the saturated conditions the results of all unsaturated experiments did not conform to the colloidal filtration theory that is the α and k d values of the group with a larger meff did not decrease but increased table s2 because the traditional cft only considers the interactions between colloids and medium under favorable conditions its prediction under unfavorable condition is often quite different from the result of actual penetration rasmuson et al 2017 this suggests that other mechanisms such as hydrophobic and capillary forces which also disrupted psnp transport may be account for the attachment and deposition of psnps in unsaturated sand o connor et al 2019 as a dynamic physical barrier the bubbles occurred in unsaturated quartz sands may have resistance to water flow due to interfacial tension forming jamin effect liu et al 2021 moreover gas phase can physically constrain colloid movement through regions of thin water films wan and tokunaga 1997 due to the non dlvo interactions capillary and hydrophobic force the film straining fig 2 at the air water interface awi could provide more retention sites for colloids lazouskaya et al 2011 apart from this the physicochemical deposition at the solid water interface swi and the capture in small pore throat at the solid liquid gas interface by physical constraints maybe also contribute to the retention wan and tokunaga 1997 it should be noted that these retention mechanisms mainly depended on the thickness of water film and the diameter of nanoparticles when the thickness is greater than the diameter deposition occurs at swi whereas capture may appear at awi and three phase interface when the thickness is less than the diameter wan and tokunaga 1997 moreover the rps of psnps showed a more steeply decline trend at the column entrance under unsaturated conditions and more psnps were deposited at the beginning fig 6 this finding may be attributed to that the uneven water film in the longitudinal orientation caused by gravity which further resulted in the heterogeneity of the unsaturated grain surface bradford and torkzaban 2008 given that the thickness of water film at the column entrance was thinner more psnp adsorption sites were provided by awi at the entrance thereby increasing the retention of psnps other factors also altered the effect of water saturation on the transport of psnps in table s2 the meff of btcs under unsaturated conditions increased about 2 69 11 9 with the increase in flow rate the strong drag force produced by high flow rate maybe weaken the interfacial tension resistance of bubbles between the collectors thereby reducing the retention of psnps on the unsaturated grain surface bradford and torkzaban 2008 however the meff values of saturated column slightly decreased as the temperature increased from 4 to 25 c since the contact area between water flow and porous media in saturated column is larger than that in unsaturated column the increase of flow rate would cause a more disordered flow which would aggravate the collision of psnps with each other and deposit in saturated column thereby weakening the enhanced effect of high flow rate hou et al 2020 3 6 effects of temperature under unsaturated condition the transport and retention of psnps in unsaturated column under different temperatures 4 and 25 c were also investigated as mentioned before the btcs exhibited a shape of blocking mechanism as the value of c c0 gradually increased with transport distance fig 5 although the increased temperature decreased the meff of psnps in both unsaturated and saturated sand columns to some degrees 6 26 23 1 table s2 the differences between the shapes of btcs under unsaturated conditions at 4 and 25 c were smaller suggesting that the temperature may have little influence on the transport mechanism of psnps when the temperature increased from 4 to 25 c the zp of quartz sand did not change much while the zp of psnps increased from 47 3 2 4 mv to 43 0 1 3 mv the less negative zp of psnps at 25 c means that a high temperature will weaken the electrostatic double layer repulsion between psnps and collectors wang et al 2017 thus the deposition rates k d of psnps on grain surface increased with the increase of temperature as shown in table s2 in agreement with previous studies alimi et al 2021 sasidharan et al 2017 the single collector contact efficiency η 0 calculated in this work increased with the increasing temperature because the diffusion coefficient would be larger at higher temperature and the particle distribution would be more geographically dispersed in this case the mass transfer rate of psnps from solution to grain surface would also be higher leading to higher deposition rate alimi et al 2021 cui et al 2019 previous studies have shown that high temperature enhanced the random brownian motion and particle kinetic energy of many particles e g graphene oxide mineral fines nanoplastics etc which further facilitated the collision frequency and particle aggregation thus impeding the psnp transport wang et al 2018 due to the stronger molecular diffusion of nanoparticles with smaller size the inhibiting effect of high temperature on transport would be more notable cui et al 2019 however in this study the dh of psnps just slightly increased at 25 c when compared with 4 c table s1 suggesting the aggregation of psnps at high temperature was not obvious even so the increased temperature still changed the electrokinetic properties of psnp surface weakening the energy barrier of psnps sands from 102 1 to 87 68 kbt fig s2 and promoting the adsorption and deposition of psnps on grain surface sasidharan et al 2017 in addition the increased temperature could decrease the permeability of sand making the particles more difficult to break through the pore throats of medium zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 the rps of psnps in the column exhibited an exponential distribution at both 4 and 25 c and the retention of psnps decreased with the transport distance conforming the colloid filtration theory once again 4 conclusion in this study the effects of hydrodynamic factors flow rate flow orientation and water saturation as well as fluid physicochemical properties salinity and temperature on the transport and retention of psnps in porous media were investigated expect for the flow orientation all factors affected the mobility of psnps the increase in salinity exacerbated the aggregation of psnps and the higher the salinity the larger the size of psnps and the more negative the zeta potentials making them easier to attach to and be captured by saturated quartz sand owing to the change in dlvo interactions at different salinities the key mechanisms governing the transport of psnps were blocking mechanism at low salinity and ripening mechanism at high salinity meanwhile salinity also altered the impact of flow rate on psnp transport at low salinity the increasing flow rate promoted transport by enhancing desorption of psnps while at high salinity the strong colloidal attraction and adhesion between psnps and sand would overcome the hydrodynamic force leading to a low penetration rate the increase of temperature is conducive to the deposition of psnps but will not change their retention mechanism in porous media in unsaturated conditions the film straining led to retention of some psnps at awi hindering the transport of psnps although hydrodynamic force generated by high flow rate weakened this inhibitory effect our results suggested that the freshwater systems with low salinity and high flow rate would may face a greater potential risk of mps pollution the influence of river hydrodynamics on mps release in the hyporheic zone and groundwater safety deserves further attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15939,the ecological risk of microplastics mps usually depends on their environmental behavior however few studies focused on the impact of hydrodynamic perturbations on the fate of mps in hyporheic zone this study chose quartz sand 250 425 μm as simulated porous medium to investigate the transport of 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics psnps under hydrodynamic factors including flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min flow orientations up flow down flow and horizontal flow and water saturations 50 80 and 100 as well as different salinities and temperatures the breakthrough curves btcs and retained profiles rps of psnps were compared and analyzed by derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory due to the small size and moderate density of psnps as well as high flow rates the flow orientation exhibited little effect on the psnp transport however high flow rate low salinity high water saturation and low temperature would facilitate the mobility of psnps the increase in salinity from zero to 35 psu practical salinity units caused the compression of electrical double layer and weakened the electrostatic repulsion between psnps and sands which dramatically decreased the penetration rate from 100 to zero especially the lower energy barrier of psnps psnps at 3 5 and 35 psu 16 45 kbt and zero respectively facilitated the adsorption of psnps on sand via ripening mechanism due to the strong adsorption of psnps by sand at high salinity the effect of flow rate on psnp transport was more pronounced at low salinity the mobility of psnps at 0 035 psu was enhanced by 41 4 75 3 as the flow rate increased from 0 5 to 2 0 ml min which was contributed from the reversible deposition in lower secondary energy minimum depth at low salinity and the stronger hydrodynamic drag force generated by the high flow rate however the sufficient molecular diffusion at low flow rate promoted the occupation of psnps on adsorption sites in addition the penetration rate of psnps decreased by 25 0 as the water saturation decreased from 100 to 50 indicating that the film straining at the air water interface would hinder the transport of psnps finally temperature increase impeded the penetration of psnps by 6 26 23 1 via blocking mechanism our results suggest that low salinity high flow river systems may be at greater risk of mps contamination due to enhanced vertical transport capability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics porous media hydrodynamic factors water saturation 1 introduction microplastics mps are regarded as emerging pollutants with a diameter less than 5 mm which have attracted increasing attention worldwide gigault et al 2018 due to wide application and low recycling rate almost 1 15 to 2 41 million tonnes of plastic waste were discharged from inland into the ocean via rivers every year lebreton et al 2017 currently mps have been detected in the ocean fresh water soil and even in the sludge of wastewater treatment plants with the concentration of mps as high as 170 900 items kg lares et al 2018 once mps enter the biota they may affect the biological function of biota not only by their own physical properties but also due to the released toxic additives andrady 2011 owing to the unique properties mps also adsorbed other pollutants and played a significant role in carrier effects leading to complex stresses to animals plants and humans li et al 2021b especially mps have been confirmed to have an abundance of antibiotic resistance genes 103 times higher than those in water thereby altering the environmental process and effect of co existed pollutants in seawater urbanized rivers soil and sewage treatment plants ling et al 2021 lu et al 2019 and even mps may transfer through the food chain finally accumulated in the human wang et al 2021 although rising researches have studied the risk and toxicity of mps to biota and human the studies about their transport in different environments are still limited therefore it is very crucial to investigate and predict the environmental behavior and fate of mps in different media including in the key hyporheic zone hyporheic zone is an active ecotone for connecting surface water and groundwater and plays a key role in maintaining the ecological balance of benthic animals in the aquatic environment battin et al 2016 the significant functions of hyporheic zone in bidirectional transport of nutrients providing habitats for biota and protecting biodiversity are all related to the hydraulic perturbations in this area merill and tonjes 2014 meanwhile this zone is also a potential risk area for pollutant retention and entering into the benthic food web due to the lower seepage velocity frei et al 2019 the hyporheic zone has ecological fragility under the influence of hydrodynamics thus it is very crucial to understand and predict the retention and behavior of pollutants in this zone with different hydrodynamics for further assessment of the related ecological risk porous media such as soils or quartz sands have been used to simulate the transport of different pollutants in the hyporheic zone jiang et al 2019 lotts and hester 2020 frei et al 2019 demonstrated that riverbed sediments of up to 0 6 m i e the hyporheic zone can be an accumulation area for mps of smaller size 50 μm and pointed out that hyporheic exchange is a potential mechanism for smaller plastic particles to enter an underlying aquifer and thus contaminate the groundwater similarly a field stream study by drummond et al 2020 indicates that in streambed sediments hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate i e deposition retention and long term accumulation of all plastic particles smaller than 100 μm irrespective of polymer type to date researches have reported the transport of micro nanoplastics in porous media and its influencing factors such as the properties of micro nanoplastics chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 the properties of porous media he et al 2020 hou et al 2020 and hydrochemical conditions dong et al 2021 tan et al 2021 moreover the transport of mps in different porous media is also affected by different environmental factors alimi et al 2018 however hydraulic conditions including flow rate flow orientation and saturation are seldom involved in the aforementioned studies in fact groundwater extraction flood and ebb variation seasonal alteration and sea level changes all alter the hydrodynamic properties of water flow in hyporheic zone which always dominate the transport of pollutants and microorganisms in porous media ning et al 2021 studies have reported that the high velocity of pore water decreased the collision time between many particulate pollutants e g engineered nanoparticles lu et al 2021 colloids chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 microbial pathogens ren et al 2020 etc and porous media leading to a lower deposition rate coefficient thus scouring of pollutants by hydrodynamic forces at high flow rate heavily promotes the release and transport depth of pollutants in porous media hydrodynamic dispersion is considered as the major transport process of pollutants in porous media when the medium is unsaturated the hydrodynamic dispersion is greatly affected by water saturation zhuang et al 2021 therefore water saturation could also change the behavior of particles in porous media unsaturated conditions inhibited the transport of many particulate pollutants such as graphene oxide dong et al 2016 silica colloids qin et al 2020 polyethylene particles wu et al 2021 etc furthermore the research by zhuang et al 2005 highlighted the importance of surface properties of particulate pollutants for their permeation in unsaturated porous media compared with hydrophobic silica colloids amphiphilic latex particles exhibited a greater retention in unsaturated sands zhuang et al 2005 however the transport of tio2 nanoparticles and multi walled carbon nanotubes has been reported to be insensitive to changes in the moisture content of porous media fang et al 2013 mekonen et al 2014 moreover the effect of gravity on colloids would also remarkably change in different flow orientations chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 hence it is essential to study the transport of mps in porous media with different hydraulic conditions to simulate the filed environment under the influence of rainfall or tides of different intensities hyporheic zones in various water environments e g ocean estuary surface water groundwater etc usually have anisotropic heterogeneity in the properties of fluid and porous medium e g ionic strength flow rate flow orientation water saturation and temperature therefore the main purpose of this study is to investigate the transport and retention of nano scale polystyrene particles in quartz sand under different hydraulic conditions including flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min flow orientations up flow down flow and horizontal flow and water saturations 50 80 and 100 the breakthrough curves btcs and retained profiles rps of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps were obtained through column experiments in addition the impacts of salinity gradients 0 0 035 0 35 3 5 and 35 psu practical salinity units and temperatures 4 and 25 c were simultaneously studied finally the interaction energy attachment efficiency and deposition rates were calculated based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory and colloidal filtration theory respectively to reveal the underlying mechanisms of hydraulics affecting the vertical transport of psnps the results of this study will provide useful information for predicting and controlling the potential risk of nanoplastics in hyporheic zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of nanoplastics and porous media psnps 100 nm were purchased from tianjin saierqun technology the used influent concentration in this study was kept at 10 mg l which was diluted from the stock solution to ensure even dispersion the solutions were prepared before the experiment with ultrasonication the physical dimensions and morphologies of psnps in solution were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem 450 fei usa fig s5 meanwhile the psnps were identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir fig s4 according to the manufacturer s instructions and the ftir spectrum the used nanoplastics in this study are plain polystyrene without any coating groups the zeta potentials zp and hydrodynamic diameters dh of psnps and quartz sands under different conditions were determined by using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk according to previous studies dong et al 2018 he et al 2020 2018 the concentration of psnps was determined by a uv spectrophotometry uv 5200 metash china with a wavelength of 290 nm detailed measurement protocols were listed in the supplementary materials sm quartz sand with a diameter of 250 425 μm was selected as the model porous medium which was provided by kemiou factory tianjin china with a purity of 99 0 sio2 the ftir spectrum and sem images of the quartz sand were provided in sm fig s4 and s6 to remove metal oxides and other impurities from the grain surface the quartz sand was first immersed in hydrogen peroxide 30 for 72 h and rinsed with deionized water until the ph returned to neutral and then the clean sand was oven dried at 105 c overnight after that the sand was cooled to room temperature and used for transport experiments 2 2 transport experiments the quartz sand was wet packed into a cylindrical glass column 10 cm long and 1 6 cm inner diameter with vibration to minimize any layering or air entrapment the final porosity of the packed columns was approximately 43 4 determined by the pycnometer method two stainless steel screens with a diameter of 150 μm were placed on the both ends of column to avoid sand loss and promote the uniform distribution of solutions several peristaltic pumps bt100l lead fluid china were used to maintain different hydraulic conditions the psnp transport in quartz sand was firstly investigated under water saturation condition with different flow orientations vertical up flow vertical down flow and horizontal flow and flow rates 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ml min meanwhile in order to clarify the impact of salinity alteration the influent psnp solutions with different salinity gradients 0 0 035 0 35 3 5 and 35 psu were prepared with sodium chloride to simulate the environment of freshwater 0 035 psu estuary 0 35 and 3 5 psu and marine 35 psu respectively all saturation experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c with a total of forty five treatments each of which was conducted with three replicates in the unsaturated experiments two peristaltic pumps at inlet and outlet of the column were used to achieve different water saturations s w including 50 80 and 100 as described in a previous study lyu et al 2018 once the target s w reached the two pumps were immediately set to the same flow rate to keep the unsaturated conditions the column weight was also regularly measured to determine the actual s w according to the results of saturated experiments the influence of flow rates 1 0 and 2 0 ml min and temperature 25 and 4 c was also studied all unsaturated experiments were carried out with a constant salinity gradient 0 035 psu and in a vertical downward flow orientation so a total of twelve treatments were conducted in the unsaturated condition with three replicates per treatment all experiment treatments are presented in table s2 in each treatment the transport of a nonreactive tracer nabr 0 01 mol l was used to determine column performance and hydrodynamic conditions after packing the columns were equilibrated by using over 10 pore volumes pv of background solutions and then 3 pv suspensions of psnps in different background solutions were injected to the column following by 5 pv background solutions to release the psnps which were not retained in column he et al 2020 2018 the concentrations of psnps in effluent were measured every 2 min with a uv spectrophotometry uv 5200 metash china at a wavelength of 290 nm to yield the btcs in tests after the transport experiments the retentive psnps in the quartz sand were determined in the vertical flow conditions the quartz sand was immediately divided into 5 equal segments with a height of 2 cm in the horizontal flow conditions each sand segment was immediately divided into two parts with up and down section and then deionized water with 0 1 tween 20 10 ml was added to each portion and ultrasonicated for 5 min to desorb and re suspend the psnps after that a uv spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 290 nm was applied to measure the concentrations of psnps in the upper layer solutions which were employed to yield the rps 2 3 calculation methods according to the classical colloid filtration theory cft the attachment and deposition of psnps onto the grain surface in different experiments were quantitatively compared the dimensionless attachment efficiency α the single collector removal efficiency η 0 and the deposition rate k d were calculated based on the mass recovery m r as reported by many previous studies zhao et al 2021 in addition the classic dlvo theory was employed to calculate the surface interaction energies between the two interaction pairs psnps psnps particle particle and psnps sands particle plate in porous media respectively the detailed cft and dlvo calculations and results are provided in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps under different conditions the sem images of the psnps adsorbed on the quartz sand are shown in fig 1 suggesting the used psnps basically have a regular spherical and uniform size as shown in table s1 in the sm the detected dh of psnps in ultrapure water was 100 0 3 4 nm as the solution salinity increased from 0 035 to 35 psu the dh values increased from 109 8 1 5 nm to 198 6 15 5 nm indicating a salinity dependent enhancement of psnp aggregation fig 2 according to the dlvo theory an increase in salinity reduces the electrostatic repulsion so that the van der waals attraction dominates the interactions between nanoplastics leading to the homogeneous aggregation of psnps dong et al 2018 it also notices that at 0 035 psu the dh of psnps at 4 c was smaller than that at 25 c suggesting a weaker brownian motion at low temperature under all experimental conditions the zps of psnps and quartz sand were negatively charged table s1 indicating that the interactions of psnps psnps and psnps sands were mutually exclusive as the salinity increased from zero to 35 psu the zp absolute values of psnps gradually decreased from 44 9 0 8 mv to 12 8 0 4 mv implying that the electrostatic repulsion between psnps was weakened xu et al 2018 in addition the zp absolute value of psnps at 4 c was higher than that at 25 c reflecting that psnps were more stable at low temperature 3 2 effects of salinity under saturated condition previous studies have reported that the salinity may seriously affect the stability and mobility of plastic particles thereby influencing their transport in porous media li et al 2021a wu et al 2019 in this study the btcs of psnps in saturated porous media under different salinities are presented in fig 3 the mass percentages of psnps passed through the columns meff at 0 psu were very high ranging from 78 5 to 100 with the increase of salinity the meff values decreased significantly in most cases and the lowest value was zero this marked decrease may be attributed to the changed dh and zp of psnps caused by the alteration of salinity the increase of salinity compressed the electrical double layer of psnps and lowered the negative charged surface charge and then decreased the collided distance between psnps in that case the dominant interaction between psnps altered from repulsive force to attractive force and the psnps tended to aggregate with each other thereby increasing their dh table s1 the enhanced dh of psnp further increased the probability of being trapped in the pore throats of the medium due to the larger size beryani et al 2020 on the other hand according to dlvo theory the decreased absolute value of surface potentials of psnps and quartz sand caused by the increasing salinity from zero to 35 psu simultaneously reduced the energy barrier of the interactions between psnps psnps from 53 10 kbt to zero and psnps sands from 93 28 kbt to zero fig s2 the decreased energy barrier means van der waals attraction prevailed which resulted in the instability and aggregation of psnps and the adsorption of psnps on grain surface especially under favorable condition 35 psu the interactions between psnps psnps and psnps sands were basically negative and energy barrier disappeared fig s2 indicating that the psnps were extremely unstable in the quartz sand column similar observation has also been reported previously wu et al 2019 in that case brownian motion was sufficient to overcome the energy barrier resulting in permanent deposition of psnps on grain surface this suggested that high salinity strongly weakened the stability of psnps making them more likely to be trapped in porous media dong et al 2018 hence the increased salinity may markedly lower the mobility of psnps in saturated porous media through enhancing their dh and zp in addition a similar trend of the effluent concentration increasing with the passing of time without tailing were observed at 0 035 and 0 35 psu in most cases such similar shape may be attributable to the blocking mechanism fig 2 according to the calculated dlvo interaction energy fig s2 the unfavorable conditions of lower salinities could induce a higher negative potential of psnps thereby increasing the energy barrier between psnps and psnps and being adverse to their mutual contact once the front psnps occupied all the limited adsorption sites on grain surface the following psnps would no longer touch with the deposited psnps but passed through the porous media therefore the btc plateau appeared with time increasing at lower salinity suggesting a blocking phenomenon babakhani et al 2017 different from the blocking mechanism a ripening mechanism fig 2 occurred at higher salinities 3 5 and 35 psu in which the penetration rates of psnps were markedly lowered from 9 41 to zero table s2 as reported by elimelech et al 1995 colloidal suspensions are usually considered very stable if the energy barrier exceeds 20 kt however the energy barrier of psnps psnps at 3 5 and 35 psu were 16 45 kbt and zero respectively these indicated that the psnps were prone to be attached after contact with each other in the absence of energy barrier or under low energy barrier condition as mentioned before high salinities decreased the electrostatic repulsion and interfered with the stability of psnps these are all accounted for the ripening mechanism because the attached psnps could perform as additional adsorption sites for the following psnps and then form multiple layers adsorption on grain surface babakhani et al 2017 similar results have been found in previous studies with high salinities nearly 600 mmol l and 8 5 mol l nacl dong et al 2018 magal et al 2011 the rps of psnps in saturated porous media under different salinities are presented in fig 4 as expected the change trend of recovery rate of rps was opposite to that of btcs table s2 due to the high mobility of psnps at 0 psu their retention rates were close to zero in most cases psnps were retained at the entrance of sand column and then the retention rates gradually decreased with the transport distance fig 4 however at high salinity a high retention of psnps was observed in each sand column suggesting that flow rate and flow orientation would also determine the retention and distribution of psnps in porous media 3 3 effects of flow rate under saturated condition the transport of psnps in saturated quartz sand at different flow rates are also shown in fig 3 the influence of flow rate on the transport of psnps was more significant at low salinity but not at high salinity the decrease of flow rate delayed the outflow of psnps especially in the case of higher penetration rates at 0 psu in addition the low flow rate led to a sloping upward shape of the btcs at 0 psu indicating the blocking mechanism at low flow rate the molecular diffusion of psnps was more sufficient which would increase their contact with sand particles and facilitate the occupation of adsorption sites syngouna et al 2017 on the contrary the highest flow rate of 2 0 ml min resulted in a high meff at low salinity table s2 this facilitating effect caused by high flow rate on pollutant transport has been commonly reported in previous researches chen et al 2018 ibrahim et al 2019 firstly high flow rate could reduce the residence time of psnps on grain surface and decrease their interaction chances li et al 2021a secondly owing to the lower secondary energy minimum depth at a low salinity fig s2 the deposited psnps may be re entrained by the stronger hydrodynamic drag force generated from the high flow rate and then flowed out of the column dunphy guzman et al 2006 also reported that the aggregated psnps could be broken up to small size by the shear force caused by high flow rate resulting in easier transport in the pore throat of porous media it should be noted that the middle flow rate of 1 0 ml min led to the highest breakthrough rate at lower salinity fig 3 this may be due to the fact that the fluid flows more disordered at higher flow rates and the collision makes psnps more easily deposited on the grain surface hou et al 2020 however in the case of low penetration rates the effect of flow rate on the release of psnps from grain surface at two high salinities 3 5 and 35 psu was not obvious this may be attributed to the strong colloidal attraction force and adhesive force between psnps and sand caused by the high ionic strength which may play a much important role than the drag force caused by water flow leading to psnps irreversibly captured in the primary energy minimum zhao et al 2020 the agglomerates with larger size formed by the aggregation of plastics at high salinity will also be trapped in pore throats which would not be easily washed away by water flow it is worth noting that the rps of psnps at 0 5 and 1 0 ml min with different salinities exhibited a hyperexponential distribution fig 4 which may be driven by the colloidal polydispersivity bedrikovetsky et al 2019 and strong secondary minimum attraction under favorable deposition conditions johnson 2020 both drivers could further decrease the deposition rate of psnps from the entrance moreover the physical straining may be also accounted for the exponential distribution of particles in porous media under low ionic strength conditions yuan and shapiro 2010 different from low medium rates the rps at high flow rate showed a non monotonic distribution and the psnp retention fluctuated with distance although most of psnps were deposited at the entrance a small rps peak appeared in the middle area as the transport distance increased fig 4 similar reports have pointed out that the deposition in secondary energy minimum is reversible which made a few psnps deposited on grain surface could be desorbed by the stronger hydrodynamic force generated from high flow rates and then the re migrated psnps could be captured by the nanoscale surface roughness on sand or be blocked in pore throats torkzaban and bradford 2016 yao et al 2014 in addition straining and irreversible attachment by primary minima interactions would increase the retention of psnps li et al 2004 sang et al 2013 moreover the ripening appeared at high ionic strength may also increase the deposition rate of psnps babakhani et al 2017 3 4 effects of flow orientation under saturated condition as an important hydraulic factor the alteration of flow orientation may also affect the transport of psnps in saturated quartz sand previous studies have found that the penetration rates of particles were generally lower under vertically upward flow than that under vertically downward flow chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 whereas the lowest penetration rate were observed under horizontal flow li and ghoshal 2016 these results suggested that the gravity oriented flow may enhance the dynamic dispersivity of the suspended particles and prevent them from being adsorbed to the sites by great hydrodynamic drag force jiang et al 2016 however the alteration of flow orientation had little effect on the breakthrough curves of psnps in the present study fig 3 previous studies also found that there was no significant difference in the transport of latex particle under the vertical and horizontal flow li and ghoshal 2016 several reasons may contribute to this insensitivity of psnp transport to flow orientation firstly the gravitational settling is positively correlated with particle density in the present study the density of polystyrene microspheres is close to the water which means that gravity will not have a great effect on their breakthrough rate li et al 2015 moreover according to the report of ma et al 2011 for colloids with diameter less than 0 5 μm the gravity change caused by the flow orientation upward and downward flow had a negligible effect on their breakthrough which is consistent with our results in addition the flow rates used in this study were much higher than those in other studies james and chrysikopoulos 2011 so the effect of gravity would be more negligible when compared to the strong hydrodynamic force caused by high flow rate different from the btcs flow orientations have a certain impact on the rps of psnps in sand column fig 4 the retention of psnps in the bottom was higher than that in the top under the horizontal flow although the effect of gravity was weaker than the hydrodynamic force caused by horizontal flow a few psnps would still settle down by gravity and finally deposit in the bottom under the vertical orientations the effect of gravity was negligible when compared to the hydrodynamic force caused by high flow rate which may account for the little difference between the retention curves 3 5 effects of water saturation few studies have focused on the transport of particles under unsaturated conditions hence the psnp transport in quartz sand columns was carried out under three water saturations including unsaturated conditions sw 50 and 80 and saturated condition sw 100 the btcs and rps of psnps are provided in figs 5 and 6 respectively the change trend of btcs seemed to be consistent in unsaturated and saturated conditions exhibiting a kind of blocking pattern moreover flow rate had little effect on the btcs of psnp transport under unsaturated condition as shown in table s2 the meff values of btcs decreased from 84 7 to 59 7 as the water saturation decreased from 100 to 50 which indicates that the decrease of water saturation may impede the penetration of psnps in sand column this inhibition caused by unsaturated conditions on the transport of different particles in porous media has been reported in previous studies qin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 different from the saturated conditions the results of all unsaturated experiments did not conform to the colloidal filtration theory that is the α and k d values of the group with a larger meff did not decrease but increased table s2 because the traditional cft only considers the interactions between colloids and medium under favorable conditions its prediction under unfavorable condition is often quite different from the result of actual penetration rasmuson et al 2017 this suggests that other mechanisms such as hydrophobic and capillary forces which also disrupted psnp transport may be account for the attachment and deposition of psnps in unsaturated sand o connor et al 2019 as a dynamic physical barrier the bubbles occurred in unsaturated quartz sands may have resistance to water flow due to interfacial tension forming jamin effect liu et al 2021 moreover gas phase can physically constrain colloid movement through regions of thin water films wan and tokunaga 1997 due to the non dlvo interactions capillary and hydrophobic force the film straining fig 2 at the air water interface awi could provide more retention sites for colloids lazouskaya et al 2011 apart from this the physicochemical deposition at the solid water interface swi and the capture in small pore throat at the solid liquid gas interface by physical constraints maybe also contribute to the retention wan and tokunaga 1997 it should be noted that these retention mechanisms mainly depended on the thickness of water film and the diameter of nanoparticles when the thickness is greater than the diameter deposition occurs at swi whereas capture may appear at awi and three phase interface when the thickness is less than the diameter wan and tokunaga 1997 moreover the rps of psnps showed a more steeply decline trend at the column entrance under unsaturated conditions and more psnps were deposited at the beginning fig 6 this finding may be attributed to that the uneven water film in the longitudinal orientation caused by gravity which further resulted in the heterogeneity of the unsaturated grain surface bradford and torkzaban 2008 given that the thickness of water film at the column entrance was thinner more psnp adsorption sites were provided by awi at the entrance thereby increasing the retention of psnps other factors also altered the effect of water saturation on the transport of psnps in table s2 the meff of btcs under unsaturated conditions increased about 2 69 11 9 with the increase in flow rate the strong drag force produced by high flow rate maybe weaken the interfacial tension resistance of bubbles between the collectors thereby reducing the retention of psnps on the unsaturated grain surface bradford and torkzaban 2008 however the meff values of saturated column slightly decreased as the temperature increased from 4 to 25 c since the contact area between water flow and porous media in saturated column is larger than that in unsaturated column the increase of flow rate would cause a more disordered flow which would aggravate the collision of psnps with each other and deposit in saturated column thereby weakening the enhanced effect of high flow rate hou et al 2020 3 6 effects of temperature under unsaturated condition the transport and retention of psnps in unsaturated column under different temperatures 4 and 25 c were also investigated as mentioned before the btcs exhibited a shape of blocking mechanism as the value of c c0 gradually increased with transport distance fig 5 although the increased temperature decreased the meff of psnps in both unsaturated and saturated sand columns to some degrees 6 26 23 1 table s2 the differences between the shapes of btcs under unsaturated conditions at 4 and 25 c were smaller suggesting that the temperature may have little influence on the transport mechanism of psnps when the temperature increased from 4 to 25 c the zp of quartz sand did not change much while the zp of psnps increased from 47 3 2 4 mv to 43 0 1 3 mv the less negative zp of psnps at 25 c means that a high temperature will weaken the electrostatic double layer repulsion between psnps and collectors wang et al 2017 thus the deposition rates k d of psnps on grain surface increased with the increase of temperature as shown in table s2 in agreement with previous studies alimi et al 2021 sasidharan et al 2017 the single collector contact efficiency η 0 calculated in this work increased with the increasing temperature because the diffusion coefficient would be larger at higher temperature and the particle distribution would be more geographically dispersed in this case the mass transfer rate of psnps from solution to grain surface would also be higher leading to higher deposition rate alimi et al 2021 cui et al 2019 previous studies have shown that high temperature enhanced the random brownian motion and particle kinetic energy of many particles e g graphene oxide mineral fines nanoplastics etc which further facilitated the collision frequency and particle aggregation thus impeding the psnp transport wang et al 2018 due to the stronger molecular diffusion of nanoparticles with smaller size the inhibiting effect of high temperature on transport would be more notable cui et al 2019 however in this study the dh of psnps just slightly increased at 25 c when compared with 4 c table s1 suggesting the aggregation of psnps at high temperature was not obvious even so the increased temperature still changed the electrokinetic properties of psnp surface weakening the energy barrier of psnps sands from 102 1 to 87 68 kbt fig s2 and promoting the adsorption and deposition of psnps on grain surface sasidharan et al 2017 in addition the increased temperature could decrease the permeability of sand making the particles more difficult to break through the pore throats of medium zhang et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 the rps of psnps in the column exhibited an exponential distribution at both 4 and 25 c and the retention of psnps decreased with the transport distance conforming the colloid filtration theory once again 4 conclusion in this study the effects of hydrodynamic factors flow rate flow orientation and water saturation as well as fluid physicochemical properties salinity and temperature on the transport and retention of psnps in porous media were investigated expect for the flow orientation all factors affected the mobility of psnps the increase in salinity exacerbated the aggregation of psnps and the higher the salinity the larger the size of psnps and the more negative the zeta potentials making them easier to attach to and be captured by saturated quartz sand owing to the change in dlvo interactions at different salinities the key mechanisms governing the transport of psnps were blocking mechanism at low salinity and ripening mechanism at high salinity meanwhile salinity also altered the impact of flow rate on psnp transport at low salinity the increasing flow rate promoted transport by enhancing desorption of psnps while at high salinity the strong colloidal attraction and adhesion between psnps and sand would overcome the hydrodynamic force leading to a low penetration rate the increase of temperature is conducive to the deposition of psnps but will not change their retention mechanism in porous media in unsaturated conditions the film straining led to retention of some psnps at awi hindering the transport of psnps although hydrodynamic force generated by high flow rate weakened this inhibitory effect our results suggested that the freshwater systems with low salinity and high flow rate would may face a greater potential risk of mps pollution the influence of river hydrodynamics on mps release in the hyporheic zone and groundwater safety deserves further attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare
