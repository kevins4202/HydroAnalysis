69 micropollutants monitoring data at 18 dwtps for three years the molecular structure which contains physicochemical characteristics was embedded as a fixed length vector that is advantageous for data driven analysis and machine learning first the molecular structure of the micropollutants was converted to a sequence of tokens using the simplified molecular input line entry system smiles pair encoding tokenizer a frequency based tokenization method it was then compressed into fixed length vectors using an autoencoder trained on various molecular structures within the chemical entities of biological interest to validate the proposed models a binary classification of micropollutant treatability was performed using the embedded molecular structure of micropollutants with various external features such as concentration season and the presence of specific drinking water treatment processes by machine learning the accuracy of the developed model for the 69 micropollutants in this study was 0 86 and the molecular structure was determined to be the most important feature furthermore an accuracy of 0 71 was obtained in external validation for pharmaceuticals and personal care products

harmful threat to human health and ecological communities even at low concentrations in drinking water antoniadou et al 2021 john et al 2022 joseph et al 2019 kung et al 2018 rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 however this is difficult due to the increase in the number of emerging contaminants and the high cost of analyzing trace levels of micropollutants the hydraulic models such as swat modflow and hydrus are used to predict the water quality of the soil water system in addition the specific models were developed to predict pollutants removal in water treatment plants worm et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 however these previously developed models are normally applied to the specific targeted individual chemical only and cannot be used universally for other types of chemicals in recent years there have been multiple attempts to predict the water quality or removal of pollutants in water treatment plants through machine learning by applying field monitoring data farhi et al 2021 and good prediction results have been reported for basic water pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus wang et al 2022 however there have been no studies on the prediction of the occurrence or removal of emerging micropollutants in aquatic environments using machine learning instead various commercial and non commercial software packages alogps kowwin marvinsketch and sparc have been developed to predict chemical characteristics such as the n octanol water partition coefficient kow of chemicals hydrophobicity and acid dissociation constant pka of micropollutants based on their molecular structure which is known as the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar bennett et al 2009 tetko and bruneau 2004 furthermore there are studies on the development of models to predict the toxicity of chemicals such as pesticides to fish embryos or daphnia magna based on qsar klüver et al 2016 wang et al 2020 these studies enable the prediction of physicochemical properties based on molecular structure and micropollutant treatability in water treatment however despite the higher hydrophobicity of micropollutants the higher treatability in water treatment plants is widely known fu et al 2019 kim et al 2020 and there has been no case of predicting such a treatability based on molecular structure therefore in this study we attempt to develop embedded molecular structure models that predict micropollutant treatability removal rate 0 9 in drinking water treatment plants dwtps based on various micropollutant monitoring data and an autoencoder this is the first study to develop a model for predicting micropollutant treatability in dwtps and the first to develop an autoencoder based embedded molecular structure model for micropollutant treatability

instrumental analysis of the target micropollutant compound groups are shown in the supplementary information figs s1 s6 prior to pretreatment the internal standards were spiked into the filtered raw

during pretreatment was assessed by running blank samples in every batch of samples and the detected concentrations were less than the loq 2 2 micropollutant treatability prediction by machine learning 2 2 1 overview of the micropollutant treatability prediction model this study proposes a machine learning based model to predict whether a specific micropollutant will be treated in a dwtp micropollutant treatability was defined as a removal rate of 0 9 after treatment which appears to be reasonable even considering the measurement error as a reduction of 1 on the log scale in particular the concentration of micropollutants are often low and close the lower limit of detection and in this case the removal rate is often inaccurate so the removal rate was not targeted several features were also used to predict the treatability of each micropollutant which had a significant influence on water treatment efficiency in previous studies such as the point of dwtp site season concentration in raw water craw activated carbon treatment in water treatment process or not ac and ozone treatment in water treatment process or not o3 boyd et al 2003 choo and oh 2020 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2021 2020 padhye et al 2014 the coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are commonly performed in dwtps especially in south korea therefore these treatment processes were not selected as features but considered as default value in our model development in addition detailed operating conditions could act as major features but operating conditions are diverse and it was unable to collect them in this study so operating conditions were excluded as the types of micropollutants are diverse and new substances can be created over time simply predicting the micropollutant treatability of the observed pollutant itself is of limited utility if molecular structure is used as a factor it will be easy to predict the treatability of new substances however the molecular structure is a three dimensional expression and can be affected by environment as result calculating the three dimensional molecular structure poses another challenge frisch et al 2016 therefore smiles has been commonly used as representation of molecular structure in qsar models bennett et al 2009 tetko and bruneau 2004 despite being a simplified string with inconsistent length therefore frequency based tokenization which is used to learn millions of words in natural language processing was utilized subsequently using an autoencoder the molecular structure expressed as a sequence of tokens was represented as a fixed length vector consequently the proposed system can embed any type of micropollutant as a vector of the same standard through tokenization and autoencoding processes 2 2 2 molecular structure embedding the first step of the proposed system is to convert the micropollutants into token sequences the smiles pair encoding spe tokenizer li and fourches 2021 which finds high frequency tokens based on a given list of compounds was used notably tokens are determined by the training process and may differ from the previously known atomic or molecular units in this study approximately 126k compounds from the chemical entities of biological interest chebi which are molecular entities focused on small chemical compounds de matos et al 2009 were used to train the spe tokenizer the tokenized smiles of the 69 micropollutants are presented in table s2 token sequences were then converted into fixed length vectors through an autoencoder using an mlp fig 1 the detailed hyperparameters are listed in table s3 the dimensions of the encoder decoder vector and encoded vector were selected by grid search considering the accuracy of each data set for autoencoder training fig s7 the autoencoders were trained with 126k tokenized smiles by using an spe tokenizer spe chebi however when developing an autoencoder based on chebi data there is a limit to reducing the dimension of the encoded vector therefore the autoencoder which is trained using the smiles of 69 micropollutants was also developed spe 69 although not universal for the encoded vector with fewer dimensions the autoencoder training and encoding of the smiles after tokenization of smiles in atomic units with the atom level tokenizer from li and fourches 2021 were also performed atom chebi and atom 69 respectively 2 2 3 treatability prediction of micropollutants to validate molecular structure embedding a binary classification model that estimates the treatability of micropollutants was constructed the concentration of raw water craw was used μg l season ac and o3 were converted to 1 dimensional binary variables site was converted to a 1 dimensional vector by normalizing site number table s1 into 0 1 value e g r1 0 17 r2 1 17 and r18 17 17 consequently a 5 dimensional vector molecular structure embedded vector which is a concatenation of all input features was used as the input of the micropollutant treatability classifier mlp was also used as a classifier detailed structures and hyperparameters are listed in table s4 the schematic process for the development of the micropollutant treatability prediction model from monitoring to classifier mlp is presented in fig 2 because the molecular structure was embedded in four ways atom chebi atom 69 spe chebi and spe 69 four classifiers were developed based on each embedded vector atom chebi mlp atom 69 mlp spe chebi mlp and spe 69 mlp accuracy recall precision and f1 score were used as the classification evaluation metrics farhi et al 2021 to evaluate the performance of the models in this study and three years of monitoring field data at 18 dwtps were used among four different models a sensitivity analysis was performed for spe chebi mlp model which was shown the lowest standard deviation in internal data set table 2 and the highest accuracy in external data set table 3 to evaluate the importance of each input feature in addition there is no significant decrease in accuracy even when site and season are excluded fig 4 and these two are very site specific features therefore the models that excluded season and site were finally selected as universal models and used to verify the model s scalability using an external test set for unknown micropollutants for this all available domestic and foreign field micropollutants data in dwtps were used ppcp monitoring data from dwtps in the nakdong river basin kim et al 2020 dwtps near taihu lake in china lin et al 2016 dwtps in taiwan pai et al 2020 and the dtwp near lake erie in north america kim and homan 2020 were used as external test sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and concentration of micropollutants table 1 presents the detection concentration and treatability information of 69 micropollutants during the study period the mean concentrations of the target chemicals in raw water ranged from 0 0001 µg l to 0 9903 µg l with the detection frequencies of btrs bths nnis pfass opfrs pesticides and phthalates ranging from 91 to 100 86 to 100 69 to 100 2 to 100 22 to 100 3 to 94 and 3 to 17 respectively and 29 for vocs as shown in fig 3 in raw water the highest concentrations are observed for phthalates btrs pesticides bths opfrs nnis and pfas in order of decreasing concentrations meanwhile in treated water concentrations ranged from not detected nd to 2 0637 µg l with the lowest concentrations observed for phthalates pesticides and neonicotinoids which may be related to their high removal efficiencies in dwtps elfikrie et al 2020 kim et al 2021 webb et al 2020 opfrs and pfass showed relatively high concentrations in treated water compared to raw water concentrations implying poor removal efficiencies choo and oh 2020 sim et al 2021 in contrast chloromethane had the highest concentrations in both raw 0 9903 µg l and treated waters 2 0637 µg l which could be a result of source water chlorination treatment resulting in a reaction between chlorine and organic matter in water antoniou et al 2006 baytak et al 2008 ikem 2010 3 2 effects of the tokenizer autoencoder on the classification evaluation metrics the results of the autoencoder training and selection according to the tokenizer and smiles data are shown in fig s7 and table s3 in the case of the autoencoder the number of units had a considerable influence however in the case of the binary classification model development there was no significant difference in classification performance when 200 or more units were used based on 2 3 hidden layers table s4 the evaluation metrics of mlp based on the four autoencoders are listed in table 2 atom chebi mlp atom 69 mlp spe chebi mlp and spe 69 mlp had accuracies of 0 8659 0 0146 0 8618 0 0091 0 8579 0 0040 and 0 8488 0 0061 respectively and there was no significant difference depending on the tokenizer and autoencoder other classification performance indicators such as recall precision and f1 score also showed similar values for accuracy confirming that all four models showed high performance as binary classifiers as the dimension of the encoded smiles vector obtained through the atomic level tokenizer is larger than the dimension of the encoded smiles vector obtained through the spe tokenizer better performance can be expected for internal micropollutants however as the standard deviation is larger than that of the spe tokenizer bases the model can show a more stable performance when there are fewer dimensions in the input vectors consequently the molecular structure embedded classification models for predicting micropollutant treatability in dwtps showed stable classification performance through autoencoders from the tokenized smiles using the spe tokenizer however whether 126k chebi or 69 micropollutants were used for autoencoder training did not result in a significant difference in classification performance 3 3 importance of each feature on micropollutant treatability fig 4 a and table s5 show the feature sensitivity analysis by comparing the accuracy and other classification evaluation metrics of the spe chebi mlps trained after excluding specific features violin plots between actual data and predicted from the trained spe chebi mlps from sensitivity analysis are also presented in fig 4 b as a result of comparing the accuracy by excluding features the accuracy tended to decrease as the features were excluded it was confirmed that the decrease in accuracy was statistically significant when season site craw and smiles were excluded among them smiles is the most important feature and if smiles is excluded our model does not work as a classification model this shows molecular structure is the most important for treatability of micropollutant among various features when ac or o3 was excluded the accuracy did not decrease significantly which appears to be because ac or o3 are less significant than the other features in prediction nevertheless when both features are excluded it can be seen that the accuracy is significantly reduced therefore both features can be considered effective for better prediction separately the accuracy was markedly lower when site was excluded than when ac and o3 were excluded meaning that site cannot simply be replaced by ac and o3 these differences suggest that there are site specific effects on micropollutant treatability therefore to improve the predictive performance it is necessary to identify and incorporate site specific features that affect the treatment of micropollutants in dwtps although such features could not be collected during the monitoring in this study nevertheless it could be confirmed that all features used in this study are important in predicting micropollutant treatability and the most important feature is molecular structure smiles thus a general model with a high level of predictability can be obtained even by excluding features that are unclear or too individual such as season and site 3 4 external validation through ppcp monitoring data from other studies excluding season and site it is easy to perform external validation based on monitoring data at water treatment plants in other water systems table s6 presents the external validation results of the ppcp monitoring data from other studies the classification evaluation metrics are presented in table 3 except for the metrics for the data from erie lake table 3 shows that the classification performance of the models obtained based on the encoder trained by 69 micropollutants atom 69 mlp and spe 69 mlp was relatively lower than that of the models obtained based on the encoder trained by chebi data atom chebi mlp and spe chebi mlp this means that even if the autoencoder showed high accuracy when trained with 69 micropollutants the features could not be extracted well when ppcps were applied in contrast the autoencoder obtained using chebi data appears to extract the features derived from the molecular structure of ppcps well although the accuracy is relatively low and the dimension of the encoded vector is larger than that of the encoder from 69 micropollutants in addition when comparing the classification metrics from chebi spe mlp to the values from chebi 69 mlp the accuracy and f1 score are relatively high thus when the spe tokenizer is used the feature extraction from the autoencoder through tokenized smiles is made in a vector of a smaller dimension making it easier to train and predict micropollutant treatability even for new combinations of tokens new micropollutants however for the data of lake erie none of the four models worked as binary classifiers because the water treatment plant is an ultrafiltration membrane system kim and homan 2020 the current model in this study was a data driven based on the monitoring data from 18 dwtps that employed processes such as coagulation sedimentation disinfection activated carbon and ozonation therefore this developed model may not be suitable for dtwps that use a membrane filtration system which also means that the membrane filtration system can treat micropollutants that are difficult to treat with conventional dwtps specifically in membrane filtration systems the pore size of the membrane and the molecular size of contaminants are important factors affecting the removal efficiency yang et al 2017 therefore a large amount of data in the case where the membrane system is applied is required to additionally train the treatability of the case where the membrane system is introduced thus it was confirmed that the model obtained in this study could predict the treatability of various micropollutants however it is necessary to train the model by adding data on various micropollutants and treatment systems to expand the impacts of advanced water treatment and improve prediction performance 4 conclusions with the increase in chemicals in daily life extensive monitoring of micropollutants in dwtps is required to prevent human exposure to micropollutants in drinking water if a model is developed to predict the removal of micropollutants in dwtps according to their molecular structure it would be easier to select micropollutants to focus on including new micropollutants this study is the first attempt to develop a model based on the molecular structure of micropollutants using machine learning to predict the treatability of micropollutants in dwtps using the field monitoring data of 69 micropollutants the embedded molecular structure models were developed in this study using autoencoders trained with tokenized smiles and validated with external monitoring data consequently there was no significant difference in the classification performance between tokenizers and autoencoders however in the external validation the combination of the spe tokenizer trained using the smiles of 126k chebi and the autoencoder trained using these tokenized 126k smiles showed the highest classification performance these results indicate that the features of the molecular structure were well extracted through the spe tokenizer and the chebi based autoencoder therefore the mlp was also well trained for the micropollutant treatability prediction based on the features of the molecular structure even though smiles representation does not fully reflect the actual molecular structure in the environment our model demonstrates promising results in predicting the treatability of micropollutants in dwtps using smiles for the first time in particular the predictability of new micropollutants is also suggested through the external validation however the current model only based on monitoring data from conventional dwtps with activated carbon or ozonation added and it doesn t incorporate detailed operating techniques or conditions that could affect site specific effects moreover it should be noted that our model may be difficult to obtain accurate prediction for micropollutants that do not have a similar structure to the ones included in the training data additionally the range of concentration in raw water for reliable prediction remains indistinct to mitigate these limitations further studies based on diverse monitoring data are still needed credit author statement jin kyu kang conceptualization investigation model

replicate water samples spiked with target compounds the loqs of btrs bths nnis opfrs vocs pfass phthalates and pesticides were 0 0004 0 0091 µg l 0 00037 0 00301 µg l 0 000046 0 000093 µg l 0 00072 0

during pretreatment was assessed by running blank samples in every batch of samples and the detected concentrations were less than the loq 2 2 micropollutant treatability prediction by machine learning 2 2 1 overview of the micropollutant treatability prediction model this study proposes a machine learning based model to predict whether a specific micropollutant will be treated in a dwtp micropollutant treatability was defined as a removal rate of 0 9 after treatment which appears to be reasonable even considering the measurement error as a reduction of 1 on the log scale in particular the concentration of micropollutants are often low and close the lower limit of detection and in this case the removal rate is often inaccurate so the removal rate was not targeted several features were also used to predict the treatability of each micropollutant which had a significant influence on water treatment efficiency in previous studies such as the point of dwtp site season concentration in raw water craw activated carbon treatment in water treatment process or not ac and ozone treatment in water treatment process or not o3 boyd et al 2003 choo and oh 2020 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2021 2020 padhye et al 2014 the coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are commonly performed in dwtps especially in south korea therefore these treatment processes were not selected as features but considered as default value in our model development in addition detailed operating conditions could act as major features but operating conditions are diverse and it was unable to collect them in this study so operating conditions were excluded as the types of micropollutants are diverse and new substances can be created over time simply predicting the micropollutant treatability of the observed pollutant itself is of limited utility if molecular structure is used as a factor it will be easy to predict the treatability of new substances however the molecular structure is a three dimensional expression and can be affected by environment as result calculating the three dimensional molecular structure poses another challenge frisch et al 2016 therefore smiles has been commonly used as representation of molecular structure in qsar models bennett et al 2009 tetko and bruneau 2004 despite being a simplified string with inconsistent length therefore frequency based tokenization which is used to learn millions of words in natural language processing was utilized subsequently using an autoencoder the molecular structure expressed as a sequence of tokens was represented as a fixed length vector consequently the proposed system can embed any type of micropollutant as a vector of the same standard through tokenization and autoencoding processes 2 2 2 molecular structure embedding the first step of the proposed system is to convert the micropollutants into token sequences the smiles pair encoding spe tokenizer li and fourches 2021 which finds high frequency tokens based on a given list of compounds was used notably tokens are determined by the training process and may differ from the previously known atomic or molecular units in this study approximately 126k compounds from the chemical entities of biological interest chebi which are molecular entities focused on small chemical compounds de matos et al 2009 were used to train the spe tokenizer the tokenized smiles of the 69 micropollutants are presented in table s2 token sequences were then converted into fixed length vectors through an autoencoder using an mlp fig 1 the detailed hyperparameters are listed in table s3 the dimensions of the encoder decoder vector and encoded vector were selected by grid search considering the accuracy of each data set for autoencoder training fig s7 the autoencoders were trained with 126k tokenized smiles by using an spe tokenizer spe chebi however when developing an autoencoder based on chebi data there is a limit to reducing the dimension of the encoded vector therefore the autoencoder which is trained using the smiles of 69 micropollutants was also developed spe 69 although not universal for the encoded vector with fewer dimensions the autoencoder training and encoding of the smiles after tokenization of smiles in atomic units with the atom level tokenizer from li and fourches 2021 were also performed atom chebi and atom 69 respectively 2 2 3 treatability prediction of micropollutants to validate molecular structure embedding a binary classification model that estimates the treatability of micropollutants was constructed the concentration of raw water craw was used μg l season ac and o3 were converted to 1 dimensional binary variables site was converted to a 1 dimensional vector by normalizing site number table s1 into 0 1 value e g r1 0 17 r2 1 17 and r18 17 17 consequently a 5 dimensional vector molecular structure embedded vector which is a concatenation of all input features was used as the input of the micropollutant treatability classifier mlp was also used as a classifier detailed structures and hyperparameters are listed in table s4 the schematic process for the development of the micropollutant treatability prediction model from monitoring to classifier mlp is presented in fig 2 because the molecular structure was embedded in four ways atom chebi atom 69 spe chebi and spe 69 four classifiers were developed based on each embedded vector atom chebi mlp atom 69 mlp spe chebi mlp and spe 69 mlp accuracy recall precision and f1 score were used as the classification evaluation metrics farhi et al 2021 to evaluate the performance of the models in this study and three years of monitoring field data at 18 dwtps were used among four different models a sensitivity analysis was performed for spe chebi mlp model which was shown the lowest standard deviation in internal data set table 2 and the highest accuracy in external data set table 3 to evaluate the importance of each input feature in addition there is no significant decrease in accuracy even when site and season are excluded fig 4 and these two are very site specific features therefore the models that excluded season and site were finally selected as universal models and used to verify the model s scalability using an external test set for unknown micropollutants for this all available domestic and foreign field micropollutants data in dwtps were used ppcp monitoring data from dwtps in the nakdong river basin kim et al 2020 dwtps near taihu lake in china lin et al 2016 dwtps in taiwan pai et al 2020 and the dtwp near lake erie in north america kim and homan 2020 were used as external test sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and concentration of micropollutants table 1 presents the detection concentration and treatability information of 69 micropollutants during the study period the mean concentrations of the target chemicals in raw water ranged from 0 0001 µg l to 0 9903 µg l with the detection frequencies of btrs bths nnis pfass opfrs pesticides and phthalates ranging from 91 to 100 86 to 100 69 to 100 2 to 100 22 to 100 3 to 94 and 3 to 17 respectively and 29 for vocs as shown in fig 3 in raw water the highest concentrations are observed for phthalates btrs pesticides bths opfrs nnis and pfas in order of decreasing concentrations meanwhile in treated water concentrations ranged from not detected nd to 2 0637 µg l with the lowest concentrations observed for phthalates pesticides and neonicotinoids which may be related to their high removal efficiencies in dwtps elfikrie et al 2020 kim et al 2021 webb et al 2020 opfrs and pfass showed relatively high concentrations in treated water compared to raw water concentrations implying poor removal efficiencies choo and oh 2020 sim et al 2021 in contrast chloromethane had the highest concentrations in both raw 0 9903 µg l and treated waters 2 0637 µg l which could be a result of source water chlorination treatment resulting in a reaction between chlorine and organic matter in water antoniou et al 2006 baytak et al 2008 ikem 2010 3 2 effects of the tokenizer autoencoder on the classification evaluation metrics the results of the autoencoder training and selection according to the tokenizer and smiles data are shown in fig s7 and table s3 in the case of the autoencoder the number of units had a considerable influence however in the case of the binary classification model development there was no significant difference in classification performance when 200 or more units were used based on 2 3 hidden layers table s4 the evaluation metrics of mlp based on the four autoencoders are listed in table 2 atom chebi mlp atom 69 mlp spe chebi mlp and spe 69 mlp had accuracies of 0 8659 0 0146 0 8618 0 0091 0 8579 0 0040 and 0 8488 0 0061 respectively and there was no significant difference depending on the tokenizer and autoencoder other classification performance indicators such as recall precision and f1 score also showed similar values for accuracy confirming that all four models showed high performance as binary classifiers as the dimension of the encoded smiles vector obtained through the atomic level tokenizer is larger than the dimension of the encoded smiles vector obtained through the spe tokenizer better performance can be expected for internal micropollutants however as the standard deviation is larger than that of the spe tokenizer bases the model can show a more stable performance when there are fewer dimensions in the input vectors consequently the molecular structure embedded classification models for predicting micropollutant treatability in dwtps showed stable classification performance through autoencoders from the tokenized smiles using the spe tokenizer however whether 126k chebi or 69 micropollutants were used for autoencoder training did not result in a significant difference in classification performance 3 3 importance of each feature on micropollutant treatability fig 4 a and table s5 show the feature sensitivity analysis by comparing the accuracy and other classification evaluation metrics of the spe chebi mlps trained after excluding specific features violin plots between actual data and predicted from the trained spe chebi mlps from sensitivity analysis are also presented in fig 4 b as a result of comparing the accuracy by excluding features the accuracy tended to decrease as the features were excluded it was confirmed that the decrease in accuracy was statistically significant when season site craw and smiles were excluded among them smiles is the most important feature and if smiles is excluded our model does not work as a classification model this shows molecular structure is the most important for treatability of micropollutant among various features when ac or o3 was excluded the accuracy did not decrease significantly which appears to be because ac or o3 are less significant than the other features in prediction nevertheless when both features are excluded it can be seen that the accuracy is significantly reduced therefore both features can be considered effective for better prediction separately the accuracy was markedly lower when site was excluded than when ac and o3 were excluded meaning that site cannot simply be replaced by ac and o3 these differences suggest that there are site specific effects on micropollutant treatability therefore to improve the predictive performance it is necessary to identify and incorporate site specific features that affect the treatment of micropollutants in dwtps although such features could not be collected during the monitoring in this study nevertheless it could be confirmed that all features used in this study are important in predicting micropollutant treatability and the most important feature is molecular structure smiles thus a general model with a high level of predictability can be obtained even by excluding features that are unclear or too individual such as season and site 3 4 external validation through ppcp monitoring data from other studies excluding season and site it is easy to perform external validation based on monitoring data at water treatment plants in other water systems table s6 presents the external validation results of the ppcp monitoring data from other studies the classification evaluation metrics are presented in table 3 except for the metrics for the data from erie lake table 3 shows that the classification performance of the models obtained based on the encoder trained by 69 micropollutants atom 69 mlp and spe 69 mlp was relatively lower than that of the models obtained based on the encoder trained by chebi data atom chebi mlp and spe chebi mlp this means that even if the autoencoder showed high accuracy when trained with 69 micropollutants the features could not be extracted well when ppcps were applied in contrast the autoencoder obtained using chebi data appears to extract the features derived from the molecular structure of ppcps well although the accuracy is relatively low and the dimension of the encoded vector is larger than that of the encoder from 69 micropollutants in addition when comparing the classification metrics from chebi spe mlp to the values from chebi 69 mlp the accuracy and f1 score are relatively high thus when the spe tokenizer is used the feature extraction from the autoencoder through tokenized smiles is made in a vector of a smaller dimension making it easier to train and predict micropollutant treatability even for new combinations of tokens new micropollutants however for the data of lake erie none of the four models worked as binary classifiers because the water treatment plant is an ultrafiltration membrane system kim and homan 2020 the current model in this study was a data driven based on the monitoring data from 18 dwtps that employed processes such as coagulation sedimentation disinfection activated carbon and ozonation therefore this developed model may not be suitable for dtwps that use a membrane filtration system which also means that the membrane filtration system can treat micropollutants that are difficult to treat with conventional dwtps specifically in membrane filtration systems the pore size of the membrane and the molecular size of contaminants are important factors affecting the removal efficiency yang et al 2017 therefore a large amount of data in the case where the membrane system is applied is required to additionally train the treatability of the case where the membrane system is introduced thus it was confirmed that the model obtained in this study could predict the treatability of various micropollutants however it is necessary to train the model by adding data on various micropollutants and treatment systems to expand the impacts of advanced water treatment and improve prediction performance 4 conclusions with the increase in chemicals in daily life extensive monitoring of micropollutants in dwtps is required to prevent human exposure to micropollutants in drinking water if a model is developed to predict the removal of micropollutants in dwtps according to their molecular structure it would be easier to select micropollutants to focus on including new micropollutants this study is the first attempt to develop a model based on the molecular structure of micropollutants using machine learning to predict the treatability of micropollutants in dwtps using the field monitoring data of 69 micropollutants the embedded molecular structure models were developed in this study using autoencoders trained with tokenized smiles and validated with external monitoring data consequently there was no significant difference in the classification performance between tokenizers and autoencoders however in the external validation the combination of the spe tokenizer trained using the smiles of 126k chebi and the autoencoder trained using these tokenized 126k smiles showed the highest classification performance these results indicate that the features of the molecular structure were well extracted through the spe tokenizer and the chebi based autoencoder therefore the mlp was also well trained for the micropollutant treatability prediction based on the features of the molecular structure even though smiles representation does not fully reflect the actual molecular structure in the environment our model demonstrates promising results in predicting the treatability of micropollutants in dwtps using smiles for the first time in particular the predictability of new micropollutants is also suggested through the external validation however the current model only based on monitoring data from conventional dwtps with activated carbon or ozonation added and it doesn t incorporate detailed operating techniques or conditions that could affect site specific effects moreover it should be noted that our model may be difficult to obtain accurate prediction for micropollutants that do not have a similar structure to the ones included in the training data additionally the range of concentration in raw water for reliable prediction remains indistinct to mitigate these limitations further studies based on diverse monitoring data are still needed credit author statement jin kyu kang conceptualization investigation model

14766,we present results from a series of laboratory column studies investigating the impacts of infiltration dynamics and the addition of a soil carbon amendment wood mulch or almond shells on water quality during infiltration for flood managed aquifer recharge flood mar recent studies suggest that nitrate removal could be enhanced during infiltration for mar through the application of a wood chip permeable reactive barrier prb however less is understood about how other readily available carbon sources such as almond shells could be used as a prb material and how carbon amendments could impact other solutes such as trace metals here we show that the presence of a carbon amendment increases nitrate removal relative to native soil and that there is greater nitrate removal in association with longer fluid retention times slower infiltration rates almond shells promoted more efficient nitrate removal than wood mulch or native soil but also promoted the mobilization of geogenic trace metals mn fe and as during experiments almond shells in a prb likely enhanced nitrate removal and trace metal cycling by releasing labile carbon promoting reducing conditions and providing habitat for microbial communities the composition of which shifted in response these results suggest that limiting the amount of bioavailable carbon released by a carbon rich prb may be preferred where geogenic trace metals are common in soils given the dual threats to groundwater supplies and quality worldwide incorporating a suitable carbon source into the soil for managed infiltration projects could help to generate co benefits and avoid undesirable results graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 motivation and context more than 2 billion people worldwide face water stress and are increasingly reliant on groundwater to meet demand wada et al 2010 managed aquifer recharge mar is a suite of techniques that can replenish groundwater supplies by collecting and infiltrating excess surface water into underlying aquifers bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 dillon et al 2006 mar strategies include dedicated infiltration basins injection wells and stream bank filtration doussan et al 1998 pavelic et al 2006 more recently flood managed aquifer recharge flood mar has been of particular interest in california where precipitation is highly seasonal and varies year by year major rivers tend to flood periodically and there is abundant agricultural land on which infiltration can occur dahlke et al 2018a o geen et al 2015 flood mar uses excess water from high magnitude winter flows in major rivers for recharge on open and working lands to simultaneously enhance groundwater recharge and manage flood waters there are several potential benefits to implementing flood mar including flood risk reduction flood plain reclamation aquifer replenishment drought preparedness subsidence mitigation and climate change adaptation marr et al 2018 field and modeling studies suggest that there is abundant surface water i e high magnitude stream flow available for on farm flooding and that many crops are resilient to inundation dahlke et al 2018b kocis and dahlke 2017 however questions remain about the hydrogeologic and geochemical consequences of using flood mar as a water management strategy particularly the potential impacts of flood mar on water quality during flood mar contaminants can be introduced from the infiltrating water past agricultural practices or leaching of geogenic contaminants from soils exner et al 2014 fakhreddine et al 2021 because many proposed flood mar projects are on active or historical agricultural land nitrogen contamination is of particular concern bachand et al 2014 katz 2020 nitrogen is the most ubiquitous nonpoint source groundwater contaminant worldwide and is well known to pose ecological and human health risks burri et al 2019 van drecht et al 2003 in addition long transport pathways and the legacy of past practices can result in nitrogen contamination that takes decades to occur or be recognized böhlke et al 2002 jessen et al 2017 sebilo et al 2013 van meter et al 2016 nitrogen cycling during infiltration is complex and involves many pathways including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation annamox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra chen et al 2014 hellman et al 2019 li et al 2017 lloréns et al 2021 sebilo et al 2013 of these pathways denitrification is of particular interest because it results in net quasi permanent removal of nitrogen from the system long et al 2013 shan et al 2016 during denitrification no3 is converted to n2 gas with no2 no and n2o as intermediate products and typically requires an abundance of nitrate anaerobic conditions and the presence of an electron donor often in the form of organic carbon korom 1992 carbon amendments in soils can enhance nitrogen removal during infiltration by stimulating denitrification beganskas et al 2018 gorski et al 2020 grau martínez et al 2018 nordström and herbert 2018 pensky et al 2022 traditional carbon amendment materials include wood chips alfalfa biochar and other organic carbon rich substrates addy et al 2016 gorski et al 2019 pensky et al 2022 schmidt et al 2012 in regions where almond trees are abundant almond shells could also be an effective low cost soil carbon amendment while carbon amendments can aid in removal of nitrate they could also contribute to the mobilization and cycling of geogenic trace metals associated with shallow soils and aquifers high amounts of doc will consume available oxygen and drive to anoxic environments that facilitate the release of trace contaminants such as manganese mn iron fe and arsenic as borch et al 2010 the release of reduced mn and fe has been observed in previous mar projects that used carbon reactive barriers valhondo et al 2015 2014 additionally arsenic poses a particular risk due to its naturally occurring ubiquity in soils and sediments and high toxicity at trace concentrations with a world health organization who recommended limit of 10 ug l fakhreddine et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 world health organization 2017 under anoxic conditions the reductive dissolution of geogenic fe oxyhydr oxides can cause the concomitant release of adsorbed as fendorf et al 2010 arsenic contamination has been documented in mar projects most notably in aquifer storage and recovery operations using injection wells fakhreddine et al 2021 2015 but could potentially be of concern for flood mar systems if conditions were consistently saturated and remained highly reducing for extended periods of time while many studies have demonstrated that carbon amendments enhance denitrification fewer studies have investigated concurrent nitrogen and trace metal cycling when applying a carbon amendment for managed recharge additionally few studies have assessed almond shells specifically as a soil carbon amendment for the present study we collected intact soil cores from a pilot flood mar site and conducted flow through experiments to quantify the relationship between infiltration rates nitrogen cycling and trace metal cycling in the presence or absence of a carbon amendment wood mulch almond shells additionally we instrumented the field site in order to measure infiltration rates and dynamics in the field by investigating how different carbon amendments influence concurrent nitrogen and trace metal cycling under the hydrogeologic conditions observed in the field this work seeks to elucidate how flood mar may impact both water supply and quality and how carbon amendments could enhance benefits and or mobilize contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site three intact soil cores were collected from teichert ranch an active vineyard in california s central valley in wilton ca located adjacent to the cosumnes river fig 1 a this site is part of a 3 2 106 m2 785 acre pilot flood mar project testing the conditions and processes associated with diversion and infiltration of up to 7 4 106 m3 6000 acre feet of water per year the field site was also instrumented to measure infiltration rates section s1 1 2 2 column experimental design intact soil cores were collected with a custom built hammer coring system and transported back to the lab for flow through experiments section s1 2 soil cores were collected at one site using 10 cm internal diameter id polyvinylchloride pvc tubes 100 cm in length the cores were tested in the same tubes in order to maintain the layering structure and microbial habitat and ecology at the field site micro sampling ports were installed using ceramic 0 15 μm pore size rhizon samplers for pore water collection during experiments soil carbon amendments described in section s1 3 were placed in capsules plumbed in line with the columns upstream of inflow fig 1b 1c capsules were 30 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter and filled with a 1 1 mixture of wood mulch and native soil by volume wm a 1 1 mixture of almond shells and native soil by volume alm or native soil from the site ns as a control a solution of local tap water table s2 and nitrate was pre mixed with an initial concentration of no3 n init 10 mg l and applied for the first 120 days of the experiments an initial no3 n of 10 mg l was selected because it is the maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 n in drinking water in california but lower no3 n is anticipated during flood mar using flows from major rivers no3 n init was raised to 20 mg l for the final 30 days of the experiments in order to assess the potential impact of higher nitrate load on the fraction of nitrate removed under otherwise similar infiltration conditions the influent water was pumped in an upward flow direction first through the soil amendment capsule and then through an inverted soil core using a peristaltic pump water was pumped upward through inverted cores to test a wide range of controlled flow rates under saturated conditions without introducing air further described in section s1 4 prior to sampling core hydraulic properties were determined using darcy experiments and breakthrough tracer tests with an inert nacl tracer for each core described in sections s1 5 s2 1 table s1 tests of the three core treatments were run concurrently and continuously for 150 days with temporal results reported as the number of days since core saturation infiltration days id the infiltration rate was held relatively constant for periods of 6 to 22 days at different rates to determine its influence on doc no3 and metal cycling periods with similar flow rates were repeated to test for hysteresis infiltration rates were started at 0 2 0 3 m day volume area time and increased to 1 3 m day at intervals of 0 3 m day and then decreased back down to 0 3 m day at intervals of 0 3 m day fig s3 every 1 2 days infiltration rates were measured volumetrically and fluid samples were collected from each core for each infiltration rate the system was allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hours before sampling and a minimum of 3 daily samples were collected at each rate for purposes of presentation and discussion we divide the experiment into 7 infiltration periods during which infiltration rates were relatively constant table 1 2 3 fluid sampling and analysis influent and effluent samples were collected from each column and pore fluids were extracted from the carbon amendment capsule and at soil depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm along each column on the same schedule fluid samples were analyzed for concentrations of selected nitrogen species no3 no2 nh4 dissolved organic carbon doc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva stable isotopes of no3 δ15n and δ18o and metals as fe and mn samples were filtered at 0 2 µm and stored at 4 c prior to analysis detailed fluid sampling and analytical techniques are described in detail in the supplemental information s1 7 2 4 dna extraction and phylogenetic sequencing methods for microbial analysis of soil samples were similar to those applied in earlier studies e g beganskas et al 2018 briefly soil dna was extracted with a powersoil dna isolation kit qiagen the qubit 4 fluorometer invitrogen was used to quantify dna extracts pct amplicons 550 bp were generated from pcrs with soil dna and 16s rrna gene primers targeting the v4 and v5 variable regions phylogenetic sequencing methods are further described in the supplemental information section s1 8 3 experimental results and interpretations 3 1 variations in organic carbon in pore fluid concentrations of doc in pore fluid varied between treatments with depth and over time during the first infiltration period ip 1 doc concentrations were higher in effluent from the carbon amended columns than in the native soil with concentrations up to 10 9 mg l and 4 64 mg l in the alm and wm effluent respectively compared to a maximum of 2 50 mg l in the ns effluent figs 2 a 3 a c during this time elevated doc in the carbon amended columns was particularly notable in fluid samples collected from the prb capsule with average doc concentrations of 4 18 0 71 mg l in the wm prb and 16 0 7 1 mg l in the alm prb fig 3b c in contrast during ip 1 in the ns column average doc concentrations were 0 55 0 54 mg l within the control prb capsule and 1 24 0 77 mg l in the effluent fig 3a concentrations of doc in fluids in the carbon amended columns decreased with time during the experiments resulting in modest increases in doc concentration within both the prb capsules and in effluent from the wm and alm columns after ip 1 figure s6 d f during the remainder of the test ip 2 to ip 7 id 35 to id 150 doc values ranged from 1 49 to 3 22 mg l in the alm effluent 1 51 to 3 58 mg l in the wm effluent and 1 09 to 1 99 mg l in the ns effluent fig 2a the nature of the doc measured also changed over time particularly in the native soil suva values of fluids collected from ns column were highest at the beginning of the test during ip1 up to 112 l mg m and decreased over time fig 3d in the wm and alm columns suva values were lower ranging from 0 6 to 30 1 l mg m and were lowest in the alm column fig 3e f during the remainder of the test id 36 to 150 suva values were similar for all treatments ranging from 3 1 to 6 4 l mg m 3 2 nitrogen transformations in pore fluid there were substantial differences in nitrogen transformations between the three treatments with depth and at varying infiltration rates at the slowest infiltration rates 0 2 0 4 m day ips 1 2 and 6 there were reductions of no3 n with depth in all three columns in the ns column the concentration of no3 n in the effluent was as low as 6 18 mg l with an average of 8 78 1 57 mg l figs 2b 4 a however at higher infiltration rates there were no apparent reductions in no3 n with depth in the ns column figs 2b 4d in both the wm and alm columns there were reductions of no3 n at all infiltration rates with a higher fraction of no3 n removed at lower infiltration rates and the majority of removal occurring within the prb capsules figs 2b 5 a with influent no3 n 10 mg l no3 n in the wm effluent ranged from nd no detect to 6 05 mg l at slower infiltration rates 0 4 m day fig 4b and 2 82 to 7 97 mg l at more rapid infiltration rates 0 4 m day fig 4e when influent no3 n was increased to 20 mg l ip 7 effluent no3 n from the wm column ranged from 15 2 to 8 7 mg l fig 2b the alm treatment resulted in the most consistent and efficient nitrate removal with the majority of removal occurring within the prb capsule at infiltration rates 1 3 m day and influent no3 n 10 mg l there was no detected no3 n from the alm prb capsule or any soil depth figs 2b 4c fig 5a at infiltration rates 1 3 m day no3 n in the alm effluent ranged from 0 90 to 1 40 mg l comprising a removal of 86 to 91 when the influent no3 n was increased to 20 mg l no3 n in the alm effluent was less consistent ranging from 0 41 to 13 5 mg l removal of 39 to 98 over the full experiment both carbon amended columns wm and alm had significantly higher nitrate load no3 n l reduction compared to native soil and the alm column had significantly higher no3 n l reduction than did the wm column table s7 in the ns column there was no change in no2 n with depth and no no2 n detected in the ns effluent fig 2c in the wm column effluent no2 n was elevated on the majority of infiltration days with typical values of 1 to 2 mg l in the alm column effluent no2 n increased during ip 3 when the infiltration rate was 0 6 m day concentrations of no2 n in the alm effluent ranged from 1 89 to 3 79 mg l at the most rapid infiltration rates during ip 4 no2 n began decreasing in the alm column during ip 5 in association with a decrease in infiltration rate when influent no2 n was increased to 20 mg l no2 n in the effluent of the alm column increased to a maximum of 2 34 mg l nitrite is a short lived intermediate product created during denitrification and thus finding elevated no2 n during periods having elevated influent nitrate loads suggests that nitrite production may be more rapid than consumption at least temporarily there was substantially more nh4 n in the effluent of the carbon amended columns than in the native soil effluent with an average of 0 24 0 15 mg l from the alm column 0 13 0 09 mg l from the wm column and 0 09 0 07 mg l from the ns column compared to an average of 0 07 0 05 mg l in the influent fig s7 higher ammonium generation in the carbon amended columns could be the result of dnra which is a more prevalent nitrogen transformation pathway when c n ratios are higher as they are in the wm and alm prb materials fig s11 nordström et al 2021 nordström and herbert 2018 however changes in nh4 n were much smaller in magnitude than changes observed for both no3 n and no2 n suggesting that the presence of a carbon amendment did not impact pathways resulting in generation of ammonium as substantially as those involving nitrate and nitrite 3 3 trace metals in pore fluid there were notable increases in dissolved mn concentrations in pore fluids for all three treatments particularly during the first half of the experiments fig 6 a effluent from the ns treatment had elevated mn concentrations during the first three infiltration periods with flow rates of 0 2 to 0 5 m day id 3 to id 51 with a maximum mn 1 46 mg l but there was little or no elevation in mn during later flow periods both of the carbon amended columns saw elevated mn in effluent relative to the ns control particularly for the alm treatment figs 6a 7 a in the wm column mn peaked at 5 02 mg l on id 36 then decreased to an average of 1 68 1 41 mg l for the rest of the test mn in effluent from the alm column peaked on id 48 at mn 7 77 mg l then decreased for the rest of the test with an average mn 2 84 2 31 mg l there was an increase in dissolved fe in the pore fluid effluent from the alm column but not in the ns or with minor exceptions wc columns figs 6b 7b fe in effluent from the alm column was initially 1 mg l increased to a maximum of 4 05 mg l on id 51 then decreased to non detect levels after id 114 similar to fe there was little to no dissolved as observed in the effluent of the ns or wm columns but as was ubiquitous in effluent from the alm column figs 6c 7c as in the alm effluent was generally 10 20 µg l through ip 1 3 average 14 7 1 65 ug l then decreased during ip 4 6 average 11 5 5 86 ug l and ip 7 2 07 0 45 ug l fig 8 concentrations of as in the alm column also varied with depth with the highest as observed at 40 and 60 cm depths particularly at the beginning of the test and lower as at greater depths and in effluent in aggregate and in data from all sampling days the alm effluent had significantly higher trace metal mn fe and as loads than did either the wm effluent or ns effluent table s8 3 4 trace metals in soils concentrations of mn in soil samples collected after infiltration were lower than concentrations of mn in soil samples collected from the field site before infiltration and were lowest in soils from the carbon amended columns fig 9 a concentrations of fe in all soil samples were high ranging from 1 0 to 6 3 and post infiltration results were mixed ns samples were slightly elevated median wm samples were lower and median alm samples were more elevated but variable fig 9b concentrations of as were usually lower in soil samples collected after infiltration than in soils collected before infiltration and were lowest in the almond shell column fig 9c it is likely that the decreases in mn and as in the soils following infiltration were due to leaching with more trace metals leached from soils amended with carbon than from the native soil and variability in soil fe in the column samples after infiltration may result irregular leaching and net transport from the capsule 3 5 shifts in soil microbiology following infiltration within the samples collected from the same field site before the experiments the 11 most abundant phyla comprised 94 of total sequences fig 10 a the three most abundant phyla prior to infiltration were actinobacteriota 22 7 proteobacteria 20 6 and firmicutes 14 1 in samples collected after infiltration there were decreases in the relative abundance of actinobacteriota and firmicutes however all samples collected after infiltration had increases in the relative abundance of proteobacteria with the highest increases found in soils from the column below the alm treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 24 5 in the ns column 26 4 in the wm column and 48 1 in the alm column microbes within the phylum proteobacteria are of particular interest because they include families responsible for nitrogen fixation and capable of utilizing the denitrification pathway ji et al 2015 zumft 1997 within the phylum proteobacteria the most abundant families were identified for each column before and after infiltration fig 10b in soils collected before infiltration the three most abundant proteobacteria families were nitrosomonadaceae 3 0 xanthobacteraceae 2 4 and sphingomonadaceae 1 4 following infiltration the three most abundant proteobacteria families were nitrosomonadaceae 4 7 xanthobacteraceae 2 1 and enterobacteriaceae 1 3 in the ns soils comamonadaceae 3 7 xanthobacteraceae 3 5 and nitrosomonadaceae 3 2 in the wm soils and hydrogenophilaceae 10 3 xanthomonadaceae 8 2 and comamonadaceae 4 2 in the alm soils additionally nmds analyses indicate that the microbial communities were notably different following infiltration and between treatments fig s9 with native soil being the least different and soil below the alm treatment being the most different 4 discussion and implications 4 1 linkages between carbon amendments and water quality the presence of a carbon rich soil amendment significantly increased nitrate removal and trace metal addition relative to the native soil tables s4 s5 across all infiltration days the wm and alm treatments removed a higher fraction of nitrate than seen in native soil fig 5b in particular the alm column saw 100 nitrate removal even at flow rates up to 1 m day and inflowing n loads up to 10 g m2 day however the alm column also saw the highest increases in trace metals concentrations in pore fluids mn fe as the presence of a carbon amendment likely enhanced denitrification and trace metal mobilization through three primary mechanisms releasing labile carbon promoting reducing conditions and providing habitat for microbial communities the effluents from both the wm and alm columns had significantly higher doc loads than the native soil over the duration of the tests table s8 during the first 12 days of the tests this difference was particularly pronounced with the alm treatment having the highest concentrations of doc followed by the wm treatment the addition of high amounts of doc from the wm and alm treatments likely facilitated the development of anoxic reducing conditions which facilitated the consumption of nitrate and the release of mn and fe additionally the carbon amendments likely released much higher amounts of doc than measured since some doc must have been consumed by reducing dissolved oxygen no3 mn oxides and fe oxyhydr oxides by the time the water in the prb was sampled the total amount of doc released by the carbon amendments can be estimated by considering the redox reactions for aerobic respiration denitrification manganese reduction and iron reduction section s1 9 for example during infiltration period 7 when the amount of influent nitrate was highest it would have taken 8 mg l doc release by the wm treatment and 20 mg l doc released by the alm treatment in order to achieve the geochemical transformations measured from the influent to the outflow table s5 while these doc values are higher than those measured table s6 the almond shells and wood mulch are likely producing at least that much carbon but it s being consumed by the time the fluid reaches the first sampling point the prb outlet previous studies measured long term doc releases from wood chip amendments up to 40 mg l and subsequent high nitrate removal rates greenan et al 2009 robertson 2010 in addition leaching experiments with the carbon materials used in this study that are underway show up to 1500 mg l of doc released from almond shells and up to 250 mg l of doc released from wood mulch when in contact with low ionic milliq water for 1 24 h pers comms a serrano the large amount of doc leached from the almond shells is consistent with strong indications of reducing conditions in soils of the underlying alm column figs 2 4 6 the nature of doc compounds can also influence impacts on water quality with more humic recalcitrant forms of doc being less bioavailable to microbes carrying out nitrogen and trace metal cycling kleber 2010 porcal et al 2009 lower suva values in fluid samples collected from the wm and alm columns indicate that there was less humic matter meaning that the doc was less recalcitrant and more bioavailable compared to doc in the ns column weishaar et al 2003 the wm and alm columns had similar suva values but yielded substantially different geochemical results figs 2 5 and 6 previous studies have found that almond shells include a significant fraction of water soluble fermentable sugars such as sucrose and fructose whereas wood mulch leaches more hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds abusallout and hua 2017 holtman et al 2015 future work to understand differences in doc released from candidate carbon sources should explore the nature of specific organic compounds in solution during infiltration soil samples collected from below the alm treatment following the flow experiment contained a significantly different microbial community compared to that seen both before flow and after flow with other treatments figs 10 and s9 the alm soils had the highest increase in relative abundance of proteobacteria a phylum known for denitrification ji et al 2015 zumft 1997 among proteobacteria there were elevated abundances of hydrogenophilaceae comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae hydrogenophilaceae is a family of bacteria known to be sulfur reducers and found commonly in reducing environments such as water treatment digesters and hot springs orlygsson and krisstjansson 2014 comamonadaceae is a family of bacteria containing facultative organotrophs that degrade carbon and also can be responsible for denitrification chu and wang 2017 hahn et al 2010 nakatsu et al 2006 xanthomonadaceae are known to participate in the nitrogen cycle as well including nitrate reduction baskaran et al 2020 the increase in the relative abundance of these families suggests that the almond shells promote more microbial reduction of carbon nitrogen and trace metals along with more reducing conditions these results suggest that when considering the addition of a carbon amendment the nature and quantity of carbon added is important for understanding and anticipating water quality impacts in the present study wood mulch and almond shells had similar weight percentages of carbon fig s12 but the almond shell treatment was associated with more nitrate removal and greater trace metal addition these findings also add to a growing body of literature demonstrating that carbon amendments can enhance nitrate removal but can also facilitate the mobilization of redox sensitive elements hellman et al 2022 2019 valhondo et al 2020 2015 2014 4 2 linkages between infiltration dynamics and water quality all treatments in this study showed a decrease in the fraction of nitrate removed as the flow rate and corresponding inflowing nitrate load increased fig 5 the rate at which the fraction of nitrate removal decreased was dependent on the treatment type with the almond shell and wood mulch amended columns removing significantly more nitrate even when the inflowing nitrate loads approached 15 g no3 n m2 day fig 5a slower infiltration rates favor development of anoxic conditions in the shallow subsurface which favors nitrate removal processes like denitrification importantly slower infiltration rates increase the residence time of the influent water in the subsurface which allows more time for microbial processing however high inflowing nitrate concentrations can overwhelm the microbial capacity for denitrification even with longer retention times resulting in a smaller fraction of nitrate being removed there is evidence for active denitrification within the prb capsules and in the soils below both the wood mulch and almond shell treatments both prb treated columns had elevated nitrite which is generated as an intermediate product along the denitrification pathway for flow rates 0 7 m day for the almond shell treatment and 0 3 m day for the wood mulch treatment fig 2 when the inflowing nitrate load is low with low concentration and or slow flow rate complete denitrification is possible and intermediate nitrite is depleted as quickly as it is produced however as the inflowing nitrate load increases the delivery of nitrate overwhelms the capacity of soil microbes to keep up with all steps in the denitrification process resulting in a standing stock on nitrite despite relatively rapid processing while the infiltration rate appeared to be a primary control on the extent of nitrate removal for a given prb treatment infiltration rate was not as strong of a control on trace metal cycling the release of trace metals was much more strongly correlated with the presence of a carbon amendment the carbon amendment type and the history of past infiltration fig 6 tables s10 s11 the type of carbon amendment had the most notable impact on trace metal release with the alm effluent having significantly higher loads of mn fe and as compared to the wm or ns columns table s5 however the concentration of trace metals in the column effluent generally increased the most during the first 50 60 days of flow then decreased regardless of the change in infiltration rate this apparently hysteretic behavior fig 7 is likely a consequence of the trace metals being geogenic rather than introduced with the fluids providing a limited pool of mobile trace metals in the soils that is depleted over time it is also unlikely that the carbon amendment materials wood mulch and almond shells were the sources of the trace metals as both the wood mulch and almond shells had significantly lower metal mn fe and as concentrations than the soils fig s12 table s9 this result is encouraging for the long term application of carbon amendments during mar because after an initial pulse of trace metal release metal loading should decrease in addition oxic conditions are likely to occur deeper within the vadose zone and in many shallow aquifers böhlke et al 2002 fryar et al 2000 pabich et al 2001 which should limit trace metal mobility and subsequent transport ying et al 2017 4 3 implications for managed recharge field studies results from this study suggest that there are tradeoffs between nitrate removal and metals mobilization during managed recharge as such care should be taken when applying a carbon amendment for mar operations with considerations of water quality targets and potential infiltration rates at infiltration rates measured at teichert ranch 0 01 0 2 m day si section s2 2 native soil wood mulch and almond shells all promote nitrate removal however using almond shells as a soil carbon amendment might also enhance leaching from soils of geogenic trace metals mn fe and as by promoting strongly reducing conditions in this study the influence of soil leaching decreases over time and with depth distance with the lowest trace metal concentrations in pore waters found at the end of flow experiments figs 7 and 8 at an operating flood mar site that experiences periodic inundation and drying highly reducing conditions are likely to be short lived with the shallowest soil being saturated days or a few weeks following a rain event then draining and becoming more oxic over time additionally oxic conditions are expected to dominate as water flows through the vadose zone underlying an infiltration basin providing opportunities for the readsorption of metals that were initially mobilized if the primary concerns at a managed recharge project site are nitrate concentrations and there is periodic wetting and drying of the system a very labile carbon source such as almond shells may be the most appropriate periodic wetting drying cycles will allow the temporary development of suboxic conditions that promote nitrate removal while also preventing the development of highly reducing conditions that lead to trace metal release this has been demonstrated in sequential managed aquifer recharge technologies smart which utilize sequential treatment zones characterized by carbon rich reducing zones followed by carbon depleted oxic zones to address multiple redox sensitive contaminants hellauer et al 2018 2017 regnery et al 2016 however if a managed recharge project is expected to have consistently saturated conditions then wood mulch or a limited application of almond shells may be a preferable amendment additionally adding somewhat less bioavailable carbon may be preferred where trace contaminants such as arsenic are present at high concentrations in shallow soils in the present study wood mulch promoted considerable nitrate removal but did not lead to as strong reducing conditions and associated trace metal release compared to almond shells this study helps to motivate additional work to better understand the mechanisms by which different carbon sources impact water quality during managed recharge including the nature of doc compounds so that mar systems can be optimized to provide maximum water supply and quality benefits 5 summary and conclusions experimental results from this study demonstrate the benefits of applying a carbon amendment during flood mar and illustrate the complexity in relationships between infiltration rates water chemistry soil microbial ecology and the nature of the applied carbon source of the two carbon amendments tested almond shells promoted more efficient nitrate removal than did wood mulch but also resulted in greater release of trace metals from soils under some conditions as a result wood mulch or a smaller quantity of almond shells may be a preferred soil amendment for managed recharge where consistently saturated conditions are expected and or where geogenic trace metals in the soil are a concern the amount of geogenic metals released during infiltration for mar ultimately depends on the amount and form of reactive metal compounds associated with soil grains once the soil reservoir of mobile metals is depleted geogenic metals should be less of a concern for ongoing mar operations given the dual threats to groundwater supply and quality that water stressed regions worldwide are facing incorporating a soil carbon source into the design of managed recharge projects should be considered as a means to generate multiple benefits for associated

14766,we present results from a series of laboratory column studies investigating the impacts of infiltration dynamics and the addition of a soil carbon amendment wood mulch or almond shells on water quality during infiltration for flood managed aquifer recharge flood mar recent studies suggest that nitrate removal could be enhanced during infiltration for mar through the application of a wood chip permeable reactive barrier prb however less is understood about how other readily available carbon sources such as almond shells could be used as a prb material and how carbon amendments could impact other solutes such as trace metals here we show that the presence of a carbon amendment increases nitrate removal relative to native soil and that there is greater nitrate removal in association with longer fluid retention times slower infiltration rates almond shells promoted more efficient nitrate removal than wood mulch or native soil but also promoted the mobilization of geogenic trace metals mn fe and as during experiments almond shells in a prb likely enhanced nitrate removal and trace metal cycling by releasing labile carbon promoting reducing conditions and providing habitat for microbial communities the composition of which shifted in response these results suggest that limiting the amount of bioavailable carbon released by a carbon rich prb may be preferred where geogenic trace metals are common in soils given the dual threats to groundwater supplies and quality worldwide incorporating a suitable carbon source into the soil for managed infiltration projects could help to generate co benefits and avoid undesirable results graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 motivation and context more than 2 billion people worldwide face water stress and are increasingly reliant on groundwater to meet demand wada et al 2010 managed aquifer recharge mar is a suite of techniques that can replenish groundwater supplies by collecting and infiltrating excess surface water into underlying aquifers bouwer 2002 dillon 2005 dillon et al 2006 mar strategies include dedicated infiltration basins injection wells and stream bank filtration doussan et al 1998 pavelic et al 2006 more recently flood managed aquifer recharge flood mar has been of particular interest in california where precipitation is highly seasonal and varies year by year major rivers tend to flood periodically and there is abundant agricultural land on which infiltration can occur dahlke et al 2018a o geen et al 2015 flood mar uses excess water from high magnitude winter flows in major rivers for recharge on open and working lands to simultaneously enhance groundwater recharge and manage flood waters there are several potential benefits to implementing flood mar including flood risk reduction flood plain reclamation aquifer replenishment drought preparedness subsidence mitigation and climate change adaptation marr et al 2018 field and modeling studies suggest that there is abundant surface water i e high magnitude stream flow available for on farm flooding and that many crops are resilient to inundation dahlke et al 2018b kocis and dahlke 2017 however questions remain about the hydrogeologic and geochemical consequences of using flood mar as a water management strategy particularly the potential impacts of flood mar on water quality during flood mar contaminants can be introduced from the infiltrating water past agricultural practices or leaching of geogenic contaminants from soils exner et al 2014 fakhreddine et al 2021 because many proposed flood mar projects are on active or historical agricultural land nitrogen contamination is of particular concern bachand et al 2014 katz 2020 nitrogen is the most ubiquitous nonpoint source groundwater contaminant worldwide and is well known to pose ecological and human health risks burri et al 2019 van drecht et al 2003 in addition long transport pathways and the legacy of past practices can result in nitrogen contamination that takes decades to occur or be recognized böhlke et al 2002 jessen et al 2017 sebilo et al 2013 van meter et al 2016 nitrogen cycling during infiltration is complex and involves many pathways including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation annamox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra chen et al 2014 hellman et al 2019 li et al 2017 lloréns et al 2021 sebilo et al 2013 of these pathways denitrification is of particular interest because it results in net quasi permanent removal of nitrogen from the system long et al 2013 shan et al 2016 during denitrification no3 is converted to n2 gas with no2 no and n2o as intermediate products and typically requires an abundance of nitrate anaerobic conditions and the presence of an electron donor often in the form of organic carbon korom 1992 carbon amendments in soils can enhance nitrogen removal during infiltration by stimulating denitrification beganskas et al 2018 gorski et al 2020 grau martínez et al 2018 nordström and herbert 2018 pensky et al 2022 traditional carbon amendment materials include wood chips alfalfa biochar and other organic carbon rich substrates addy et al 2016 gorski et al 2019 pensky et al 2022 schmidt et al 2012 in regions where almond trees are abundant almond shells could also be an effective low cost soil carbon amendment while carbon amendments can aid in removal of nitrate they could also contribute to the mobilization and cycling of geogenic trace metals associated with shallow soils and aquifers high amounts of doc will consume available oxygen and drive to anoxic environments that facilitate the release of trace contaminants such as manganese mn iron fe and arsenic as borch et al 2010 the release of reduced mn and fe has been observed in previous mar projects that used carbon reactive barriers valhondo et al 2015 2014 additionally arsenic poses a particular risk due to its naturally occurring ubiquity in soils and sediments and high toxicity at trace concentrations with a world health organization who recommended limit of 10 ug l fakhreddine et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 world health organization 2017 under anoxic conditions the reductive dissolution of geogenic fe oxyhydr oxides can cause the concomitant release of adsorbed as fendorf et al 2010 arsenic contamination has been documented in mar projects most notably in aquifer storage and recovery operations using injection wells fakhreddine et al 2021 2015 but could potentially be of concern for flood mar systems if conditions were consistently saturated and remained highly reducing for extended periods of time while many studies have demonstrated that carbon amendments enhance denitrification fewer studies have investigated concurrent nitrogen and trace metal cycling when applying a carbon amendment for managed recharge additionally few studies have assessed almond shells specifically as a soil carbon amendment for the present study we collected intact soil cores from a pilot flood mar site and conducted flow through experiments to quantify the relationship between infiltration rates nitrogen cycling and trace metal cycling in the presence or absence of a carbon amendment wood mulch almond shells additionally we instrumented the field site in order to measure infiltration rates and dynamics in the field by investigating how different carbon amendments influence concurrent nitrogen and trace metal cycling under the hydrogeologic conditions observed in the field this work seeks to elucidate how flood mar may impact both water supply and quality and how carbon amendments could enhance benefits and or mobilize contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site three intact soil cores were collected from teichert ranch an active vineyard in california s central valley in wilton ca located adjacent to the cosumnes river fig 1 a this site is part of a 3 2 106 m2 785 acre pilot flood mar project testing the conditions and processes associated with diversion and infiltration of up to 7 4 106 m3 6000 acre feet of water per year the field site was also instrumented to measure infiltration rates section s1 1 2 2 column experimental design intact soil cores were collected with a custom built hammer coring system and transported back to the lab for flow through experiments section s1 2 soil cores were collected at one site using 10 cm internal diameter id polyvinylchloride pvc tubes 100 cm in length the cores were tested in the same tubes in order to maintain the layering structure and microbial habitat and ecology at the field site micro sampling ports were installed using ceramic 0 15 μm pore size rhizon samplers for pore water collection during experiments soil carbon amendments described in section s1 3 were placed in capsules plumbed in line with the columns upstream of inflow fig 1b 1c capsules were 30 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter and filled with a 1 1 mixture of wood mulch and native soil by volume wm a 1 1 mixture of almond shells and native soil by volume alm or native soil from the site ns as a control a solution of local tap water table s2 and nitrate was pre mixed with an initial concentration of no3 n init 10 mg l and applied for the first 120 days of the experiments an initial no3 n of 10 mg l was selected because it is the maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 n in drinking water in california but lower no3 n is anticipated during flood mar using flows from major rivers no3 n init was raised to 20 mg l for the final 30 days of the experiments in order to assess the potential impact of higher nitrate load on the fraction of nitrate removed under otherwise similar infiltration conditions the influent water was pumped in an upward flow direction first through the soil amendment capsule and then through an inverted soil core using a peristaltic pump water was pumped upward through inverted cores to test a wide range of controlled flow rates under saturated conditions without introducing air further described in section s1 4 prior to sampling core hydraulic properties were determined using darcy experiments and breakthrough tracer tests with an inert nacl tracer for each core described in sections s1 5 s2 1 table s1 tests of the three core treatments were run concurrently and continuously for 150 days with temporal results reported as the number of days since core saturation infiltration days id the infiltration rate was held relatively constant for periods of 6 to 22 days at different rates to determine its influence on doc no3 and metal cycling periods with similar flow rates were repeated to test for hysteresis infiltration rates were started at 0 2 0 3 m day volume area time and increased to 1 3 m day at intervals of 0 3 m day and then decreased back down to 0 3 m day at intervals of 0 3 m day fig s3 every 1 2 days infiltration rates were measured volumetrically and fluid samples were collected from each core for each infiltration rate the system was allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hours before sampling and a minimum of 3 daily samples were collected at each rate for purposes of presentation and discussion we divide the experiment into 7 infiltration periods during which infiltration rates were relatively constant table 1 2 3 fluid sampling and analysis influent and effluent samples were collected from each column and pore fluids were extracted from the carbon amendment capsule and at soil depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm along each column on the same schedule fluid samples were analyzed for concentrations of selected nitrogen species no3 no2 nh4 dissolved organic carbon doc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva stable isotopes of no3 δ15n and δ18o and metals as fe and mn samples were filtered at 0 2 µm and stored at 4 c prior to analysis detailed fluid sampling and analytical techniques are described in detail in the supplemental information s1 7 2 4 dna extraction and phylogenetic sequencing methods for microbial analysis of soil samples were similar to those applied in earlier studies e g beganskas et al 2018 briefly soil dna was extracted with a powersoil dna isolation kit qiagen the qubit 4 fluorometer invitrogen was used to quantify dna extracts pct amplicons 550 bp were generated from pcrs with soil dna and 16s rrna gene primers targeting the v4 and v5 variable regions phylogenetic sequencing methods are further described in the supplemental information section s1 8 3 experimental results and interpretations 3 1 variations in organic carbon in pore fluid concentrations of doc in pore fluid varied between treatments with depth and over time during the first infiltration period ip 1 doc concentrations were higher in effluent from the carbon amended columns than in the native soil with concentrations up to 10 9 mg l and 4 64 mg l in the alm and wm effluent respectively compared to a maximum of 2 50 mg l in the ns effluent figs 2 a 3 a c during this time elevated doc in the carbon amended columns was particularly notable in fluid samples collected from the prb capsule with average doc concentrations of 4 18 0 71 mg l in the wm prb and 16 0 7 1 mg l in the alm prb fig 3b c in contrast during ip 1 in the ns column average doc concentrations were 0 55 0 54 mg l within the control prb capsule and 1 24 0 77 mg l in the effluent fig 3a concentrations of doc in fluids in the carbon amended columns decreased with time during the experiments resulting in modest increases in doc concentration within both the prb capsules and in effluent from the wm and alm columns after ip 1 figure s6 d f during the remainder of the test ip 2 to ip 7 id 35 to id 150 doc values ranged from 1 49 to 3 22 mg l in the alm effluent 1 51 to 3 58 mg l in the wm effluent and 1 09 to 1 99 mg l in the ns effluent fig 2a the nature of the doc measured also changed over time particularly in the native soil suva values of fluids collected from ns column were highest at the beginning of the test during ip1 up to 112 l mg m and decreased over time fig 3d in the wm and alm columns suva values were lower ranging from 0 6 to 30 1 l mg m and were lowest in the alm column fig 3e f during the remainder of the test id 36 to 150 suva values were similar for all treatments ranging from 3 1 to 6 4 l mg m 3 2 nitrogen transformations in pore fluid there were substantial differences in nitrogen transformations between the three treatments with depth and at varying infiltration rates at the slowest infiltration rates 0 2 0 4 m day ips 1 2 and 6 there were reductions of no3 n with depth in all three columns in the ns column the concentration of no3 n in the effluent was as low as 6 18 mg l with an average of 8 78 1 57 mg l figs 2b 4 a however at higher infiltration rates there were no apparent reductions in no3 n with depth in the ns column figs 2b 4d in both the wm and alm columns there were reductions of no3 n at all infiltration rates with a higher fraction of no3 n removed at lower infiltration rates and the majority of removal occurring within the prb capsules figs 2b 5 a with influent no3 n 10 mg l no3 n in the wm effluent ranged from nd no detect to 6 05 mg l at slower infiltration rates 0 4 m day fig 4b and 2 82 to 7 97 mg l at more rapid infiltration rates 0 4 m day fig 4e when influent no3 n was increased to 20 mg l ip 7 effluent no3 n from the wm column ranged from 15 2 to 8 7 mg l fig 2b the alm treatment resulted in the most consistent and efficient nitrate removal with the majority of removal occurring within the prb capsule at infiltration rates 1 3 m day and influent no3 n 10 mg l there was no detected no3 n from the alm prb capsule or any soil depth figs 2b 4c fig 5a at infiltration rates 1 3 m day no3 n in the alm effluent ranged from 0 90 to 1 40 mg l comprising a removal of 86 to 91 when the influent no3 n was increased to 20 mg l no3 n in the alm effluent was less consistent ranging from 0 41 to 13 5 mg l removal of 39 to 98 over the full experiment both carbon amended columns wm and alm had significantly higher nitrate load no3 n l reduction compared to native soil and the alm column had significantly higher no3 n l reduction than did the wm column table s7 in the ns column there was no change in no2 n with depth and no no2 n detected in the ns effluent fig 2c in the wm column effluent no2 n was elevated on the majority of infiltration days with typical values of 1 to 2 mg l in the alm column effluent no2 n increased during ip 3 when the infiltration rate was 0 6 m day concentrations of no2 n in the alm effluent ranged from 1 89 to 3 79 mg l at the most rapid infiltration rates during ip 4 no2 n began decreasing in the alm column during ip 5 in association with a decrease in infiltration rate when influent no2 n was increased to 20 mg l no2 n in the effluent of the alm column increased to a maximum of 2 34 mg l nitrite is a short lived intermediate product created during denitrification and thus finding elevated no2 n during periods having elevated influent nitrate loads suggests that nitrite production may be more rapid than consumption at least temporarily there was substantially more nh4 n in the effluent of the carbon amended columns than in the native soil effluent with an average of 0 24 0 15 mg l from the alm column 0 13 0 09 mg l from the wm column and 0 09 0 07 mg l from the ns column compared to an average of 0 07 0 05 mg l in the influent fig s7 higher ammonium generation in the carbon amended columns could be the result of dnra which is a more prevalent nitrogen transformation pathway when c n ratios are higher as they are in the wm and alm prb materials fig s11 nordström et al 2021 nordström and herbert 2018 however changes in nh4 n were much smaller in magnitude than changes observed for both no3 n and no2 n suggesting that the presence of a carbon amendment did not impact pathways resulting in generation of ammonium as substantially as those involving nitrate and nitrite 3 3 trace metals in pore fluid there were notable increases in dissolved mn concentrations in pore fluids for all three treatments particularly during the first half of the experiments fig 6 a effluent from the ns treatment had elevated mn concentrations during the first three infiltration periods with flow rates of 0 2 to 0 5 m day id 3 to id 51 with a maximum mn 1 46 mg l but there was little or no elevation in mn during later flow periods both of the carbon amended columns saw elevated mn in effluent relative to the ns control particularly for the alm treatment figs 6a 7 a in the wm column mn peaked at 5 02 mg l on id 36 then decreased to an average of 1 68 1 41 mg l for the rest of the test mn in effluent from the alm column peaked on id 48 at mn 7 77 mg l then decreased for the rest of the test with an average mn 2 84 2 31 mg l there was an increase in dissolved fe in the pore fluid effluent from the alm column but not in the ns or with minor exceptions wc columns figs 6b 7b fe in effluent from the alm column was initially 1 mg l increased to a maximum of 4 05 mg l on id 51 then decreased to non detect levels after id 114 similar to fe there was little to no dissolved as observed in the effluent of the ns or wm columns but as was ubiquitous in effluent from the alm column figs 6c 7c as in the alm effluent was generally 10 20 µg l through ip 1 3 average 14 7 1 65 ug l then decreased during ip 4 6 average 11 5 5 86 ug l and ip 7 2 07 0 45 ug l fig 8 concentrations of as in the alm column also varied with depth with the highest as observed at 40 and 60 cm depths particularly at the beginning of the test and lower as at greater depths and in effluent in aggregate and in data from all sampling days the alm effluent had significantly higher trace metal mn fe and as loads than did either the wm effluent or ns effluent table s8 3 4 trace metals in soils concentrations of mn in soil samples collected after infiltration were lower than concentrations of mn in soil samples collected from the field site before infiltration and were lowest in soils from the carbon amended columns fig 9 a concentrations of fe in all soil samples were high ranging from 1 0 to 6 3 and post infiltration results were mixed ns samples were slightly elevated median wm samples were lower and median alm samples were more elevated but variable fig 9b concentrations of as were usually lower in soil samples collected after infiltration than in soils collected before infiltration and were lowest in the almond shell column fig 9c it is likely that the decreases in mn and as in the soils following infiltration were due to leaching with more trace metals leached from soils amended with carbon than from the native soil and variability in soil fe in the column samples after infiltration may result irregular leaching and net transport from the capsule 3 5 shifts in soil microbiology following infiltration within the samples collected from the same field site before the experiments the 11 most abundant phyla comprised 94 of total sequences fig 10 a the three most abundant phyla prior to infiltration were actinobacteriota 22 7 proteobacteria 20 6 and firmicutes 14 1 in samples collected after infiltration there were decreases in the relative abundance of actinobacteriota and firmicutes however all samples collected after infiltration had increases in the relative abundance of proteobacteria with the highest increases found in soils from the column below the alm treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 24 5 in the ns column 26 4 in the wm column and 48 1 in the alm column microbes within the phylum proteobacteria are of particular interest because they include families responsible for nitrogen fixation and capable of utilizing the denitrification pathway ji et al 2015 zumft 1997 within the phylum proteobacteria the most abundant families were identified for each column before and after infiltration fig 10b in soils collected before infiltration the three most abundant proteobacteria families were nitrosomonadaceae 3 0 xanthobacteraceae 2 4 and sphingomonadaceae 1 4 following infiltration the three most abundant proteobacteria families were nitrosomonadaceae 4 7 xanthobacteraceae 2 1 and enterobacteriaceae 1 3 in the ns soils comamonadaceae 3 7 xanthobacteraceae 3 5 and nitrosomonadaceae 3 2 in the wm soils and hydrogenophilaceae 10 3 xanthomonadaceae 8 2 and comamonadaceae 4 2 in the alm soils additionally nmds analyses indicate that the microbial communities were notably different following infiltration and between treatments fig s9 with native soil being the least different and soil below the alm treatment being the most different 4 discussion and implications 4 1 linkages between carbon amendments and water quality the presence of a carbon rich soil amendment significantly increased nitrate removal and trace metal addition relative to the native soil tables s4 s5 across all infiltration days the wm and alm treatments removed a higher fraction of nitrate than seen in native soil fig 5b in particular the alm column saw 100 nitrate removal even at flow rates up to 1 m day and inflowing n loads up to 10 g m2 day however the alm column also saw the highest increases in trace metals concentrations in pore fluids mn fe as the presence of a carbon amendment likely enhanced denitrification and trace metal mobilization through three primary mechanisms releasing labile carbon promoting reducing conditions and providing habitat for microbial communities the effluents from both the wm and alm columns had significantly higher doc loads than the native soil over the duration of the tests table s8 during the first 12 days of the tests this difference was particularly pronounced with the alm treatment having the highest concentrations of doc followed by the wm treatment the addition of high amounts of doc from the wm and alm treatments likely facilitated the development of anoxic reducing conditions which facilitated the consumption of nitrate and the release of mn and fe additionally the carbon amendments likely released much higher amounts of doc than measured since some doc must have been consumed by reducing dissolved oxygen no3 mn oxides and fe oxyhydr oxides by the time the water in the prb was sampled the total amount of doc released by the carbon amendments can be estimated by considering the redox reactions for aerobic respiration denitrification manganese reduction and iron reduction section s1 9 for example during infiltration period 7 when the amount of influent nitrate was highest it would have taken 8 mg l doc release by the wm treatment and 20 mg l doc released by the alm treatment in order to achieve the geochemical transformations measured from the influent to the outflow table s5 while these doc values are higher than those measured table s6 the almond shells and wood mulch are likely producing at least that much carbon but it s being consumed by the time the fluid reaches the first sampling point the prb outlet previous studies measured long term doc releases from wood chip amendments up to 40 mg l and subsequent high nitrate removal rates greenan et al 2009 robertson 2010 in addition leaching experiments with the carbon materials used in this study that are underway show up to 1500 mg l of doc released from almond shells and up to 250 mg l of doc released from wood mulch when in contact with low ionic milliq water for 1 24 h pers comms a serrano the large amount of doc leached from the almond shells is consistent with strong indications of reducing conditions in soils of the underlying alm column figs 2 4 6 the nature of doc compounds can also influence impacts on water quality with more humic recalcitrant forms of doc being less bioavailable to microbes carrying out nitrogen and trace metal cycling kleber 2010 porcal et al 2009 lower suva values in fluid samples collected from the wm and alm columns indicate that there was less humic matter meaning that the doc was less recalcitrant and more bioavailable compared to doc in the ns column weishaar et al 2003 the wm and alm columns had similar suva values but yielded substantially different geochemical results figs 2 5 and 6 previous studies have found that almond shells include a significant fraction of water soluble fermentable sugars such as sucrose and fructose whereas wood mulch leaches more hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds abusallout and hua 2017 holtman et al 2015 future work to understand differences in doc released from candidate carbon sources should explore the nature of specific organic compounds in solution during infiltration soil samples collected from below the alm treatment following the flow experiment contained a significantly different microbial community compared to that seen both before flow and after flow with other treatments figs 10 and s9 the alm soils had the highest increase in relative abundance of proteobacteria a phylum known for denitrification ji et al 2015 zumft 1997 among proteobacteria there were elevated abundances of hydrogenophilaceae comamonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae hydrogenophilaceae is a family of bacteria known to be sulfur reducers and found commonly in reducing environments such as water treatment digesters and hot springs orlygsson and krisstjansson 2014 comamonadaceae is a family of bacteria containing facultative organotrophs that degrade carbon and also can be responsible for denitrification chu and wang 2017 hahn et al 2010 nakatsu et al 2006 xanthomonadaceae are known to participate in the nitrogen cycle as well including nitrate reduction baskaran et al 2020 the increase in the relative abundance of these families suggests that the almond shells promote more microbial reduction of carbon nitrogen and trace metals along with more reducing conditions these results suggest that when considering the addition of a carbon amendment the nature and quantity of carbon added is important for understanding and anticipating water quality impacts in the present study wood mulch and almond shells had similar weight percentages of carbon fig s12 but the almond shell treatment was associated with more nitrate removal and greater trace metal addition these findings also add to a growing body of literature demonstrating that carbon amendments can enhance nitrate removal but can also facilitate the mobilization of redox sensitive elements hellman et al 2022 2019 valhondo et al 2020 2015 2014 4 2 linkages between infiltration dynamics and water quality all treatments in this study showed a decrease in the fraction of nitrate removed as the flow rate and corresponding inflowing nitrate load increased fig 5 the rate at which the fraction of nitrate removal decreased was dependent on the treatment type with the almond shell and wood mulch amended columns removing significantly more nitrate even when the inflowing nitrate loads approached 15 g no3 n m2 day fig 5a slower infiltration rates favor development of anoxic conditions in the shallow subsurface which favors nitrate removal processes like denitrification importantly slower infiltration rates increase the residence time of the influent water in the subsurface which allows more time for microbial processing however high inflowing nitrate concentrations can overwhelm the microbial capacity for denitrification even with longer retention times resulting in a smaller fraction of nitrate being removed there is evidence for active denitrification within the prb capsules and in the soils below both the wood mulch and almond shell treatments both prb treated columns had elevated nitrite which is generated as an intermediate product along the denitrification pathway for flow rates 0 7 m day for the almond shell treatment and 0 3 m day for the wood mulch treatment fig 2 when the inflowing nitrate load is low with low concentration and or slow flow rate complete denitrification is possible and intermediate nitrite is depleted as quickly as it is produced however as the inflowing nitrate load increases the delivery of nitrate overwhelms the capacity of soil microbes to keep up with all steps in the denitrification process resulting in a standing stock on nitrite despite relatively rapid processing while the infiltration rate appeared to be a primary control on the extent of nitrate removal for a given prb treatment infiltration rate was not as strong of a control on trace metal cycling the release of trace metals was much more strongly correlated with the presence of a carbon amendment the carbon amendment type and the history of past infiltration fig 6 tables s10 s11 the type of carbon amendment had the most notable impact on trace metal release with the alm effluent having significantly higher loads of mn fe and as compared to the wm or ns columns table s5 however the concentration of trace metals in the column effluent generally increased the most during the first 50 60 days of flow then decreased regardless of the change in infiltration rate this apparently hysteretic behavior fig 7 is likely a consequence of the trace metals being geogenic rather than introduced with the fluids providing a limited pool of mobile trace metals in the soils that is depleted over time it is also unlikely that the carbon amendment materials wood mulch and almond shells were the sources of the trace metals as both the wood mulch and almond shells had significantly lower metal mn fe and as concentrations than the soils fig s12 table s9 this result is encouraging for the long term application of carbon amendments during mar because after an initial pulse of trace metal release metal loading should decrease in addition oxic conditions are likely to occur deeper within the vadose zone and in many shallow aquifers böhlke et al 2002 fryar et al 2000 pabich et al 2001 which should limit trace metal mobility and subsequent transport ying et al 2017 4 3 implications for managed recharge field studies results from this study suggest that there are tradeoffs between nitrate removal and metals mobilization during managed recharge as such care should be taken when applying a carbon amendment for mar operations with considerations of water quality targets and potential infiltration rates at infiltration rates measured at teichert ranch 0 01 0 2 m day si section s2 2 native soil wood mulch and almond shells all promote nitrate removal however using almond shells as a soil carbon amendment might also enhance leaching from soils of geogenic trace metals mn fe and as by promoting strongly reducing conditions in this study the influence of soil leaching decreases over time and with depth distance with the lowest trace metal concentrations in pore waters found at the end of flow experiments figs 7 and 8 at an operating flood mar site that experiences periodic inundation and drying highly reducing conditions are likely to be short lived with the shallowest soil being saturated days or a few weeks following a rain event then draining and becoming more oxic over time additionally oxic conditions are expected to dominate as water flows through the vadose zone underlying an infiltration basin providing opportunities for the readsorption of metals that were initially mobilized if the primary concerns at a managed recharge project site are nitrate concentrations and there is periodic wetting and drying of the system a very labile carbon source such as almond shells may be the most appropriate periodic wetting drying cycles will allow the temporary development of suboxic conditions that promote nitrate removal while also preventing the development of highly reducing conditions that lead to trace metal release this has been demonstrated in sequential managed aquifer recharge technologies smart which utilize sequential treatment zones characterized by carbon rich reducing zones followed by carbon depleted oxic zones to address multiple redox sensitive contaminants hellauer et al 2018 2017 regnery et al 2016 however if a managed recharge project is expected to have consistently saturated conditions then wood mulch or a limited application of almond shells may be a preferable amendment additionally adding somewhat less bioavailable carbon may be preferred where trace contaminants such as arsenic are present at high concentrations in shallow soils in the present study wood mulch promoted considerable nitrate removal but did not lead to as strong reducing conditions and associated trace metal release compared to almond shells this study helps to motivate additional work to better understand the mechanisms by which different carbon sources impact water quality during managed recharge including the nature of doc compounds so that mar systems can be optimized to provide maximum water supply and quality benefits 5 summary and conclusions experimental results from this study demonstrate the benefits of applying a carbon amendment during flood mar and illustrate the complexity in relationships between infiltration rates water chemistry soil microbial ecology and the nature of the applied carbon source of the two carbon amendments tested almond shells promoted more efficient nitrate removal than did wood mulch but also resulted in greater release of trace metals from soils under some conditions as a result wood mulch or a smaller quantity of almond shells may be a preferred soil amendment for managed recharge where consistently saturated conditions are expected and or where geogenic trace metals in the soil are a concern the amount of geogenic metals released during infiltration for mar ultimately depends on the amount and form of reactive metal compounds associated with soil grains once the soil reservoir of mobile metals is depleted geogenic metals should be less of a concern for ongoing mar operations given the dual threats to groundwater supply and quality that water stressed regions worldwide are facing incorporating a soil carbon source into the design of managed recharge projects should be considered as a means to generate multiple benefits for associated

14767,pfas are biologically recalcitrant compounds that are persistent in the environment and have subsequently contaminated groundwater landfill leachate and surface water due to their persistence and toxicity there are environmental concentration limits imposed on some pfas compounds that extend down to a few nanograms per litre and even proposals for reducing these to picogram per litre levels since pfas concentrates at water air interfaces as a result of their amphiphilic nature this characteristic is important for the successful modelling and prediction of transport behaviour of pfas through various systems here we present a procedure for using a foam fractionation method to experimentally determine the pfas adsorption behaviour at ng l and µg l concentrations in the presence of salts the equilibrium air water adsorption coefficients for pfhxs and pfoa at different salinities and concentrations are experimentally shown to be constant across the range of pfas concentrations investigated approx 0 1 100 µg l the adsorption isotherms may consequently be modelled by henry or langmuir style equations at these low concentrations keywords pfas foam fractionation adsorption isotherm surface tension remediation data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are synthetic chemicals consisting of a completely or partially fluorinated carbon chain due to their strong resistance to chemical thermal and biological degradation they are highly recalcitrant in the environment due to their widespread use in a variety of industrial and consumer products such as plastics paper leather lubricants and coatings cement metal cleaners floor polishes and aqueous film forming foam afff products ahrens and bundschuh 2014 prevedouros et al 2006 they have been detected in landfill leachates benskin et al 2012 groundwater bräunig et al 2017 soil and drinking water kaboré et al 2018 kurwadkar et al 2022 thompson et al 2011 the distribution of pfas in the environment has led to public exposure through drinking water food consumption and dust inhalation due to their potential toxicity to humans animals and biota fenton et al 2021 podder et al 2021 cui et al 2020 environmental concentration limits have been imposed on some pfas compounds that extend down to a few nanograms per litre ng l and there are even proposals for reducing these to picogram per litre levels pfas molecules tend to accumulate at air water interfaces due to their amphiphilic nature the adsorption of these amphiphilic pfas molecules to the air water interface particularly at low concentrations relevant to practical environmental conditions is key in the successful modelling and prediction of transport behaviour of pfas through various environmental systems additionally gaining precise knowledge of the pfas adsorption capacity at low concentrations is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of remediation technologies based on pfas separation into the air water interface for example the foam fractionation treatment process almost all the existing methods to measure pfas adsorption on the air water interface require the concentrations of adsorbent to be sufficiently high so that there are measurable changes to the surface forces usually concentrations in the mg l range which are several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of pollutants measured in the environment i e in the ng l range adsorption is most often presented as an isotherm of the surface concentration of the surface active molecule at the air water interface e g in mol m2 as a function of the bulk liquid concentration at equilibrium e g in mol m3 for example the langmuir isotherm describes the relationship between surface concentration surface excess γ and bulk concentration cb and at low surfactant concentrations can be approximated by the proportionality constant k as shown in eq 1 below 1 γ k c b since surface concentration can be directly estimated by the measured changes in the surface tension menger and rizvi 2011 amani et al 2020 adsorption isotherms are experimentally determined using a tool such as a tensiometer to measure changes in dynamic and equilibrium surface tensions there are many different versions of this apparatus such as drop bubble profile zholob et al 2007 loglio et al 2001 wilhelmy plate padday and russell 1960 böttger et al 2012 stevenson et al 1995 niño and patino 1998 du nouy ring padday and russell 1960 du noüy 1925 lunkenheimer and wantke 1981 and bubble pressure tensiometers fainerman and miller 2004 christov et al 2006 these apparatuses are used for measuring and interpreting how the balancing forces at the air water interface change in the presence of different concentrations of surface active substances this is done by for example analysing the shape of a bubble drop and fitting the young laplace equation to the drop and bubble profile or by physically disturbing the interface in the wilhelmy plate and ring tensiometry methods a limitation of these methods is that the accuracy reduces significantly as the surfactant concentrations decreases since the measurement errors are about constant while the corresponding measured change becomes smaller this eventually approaches a limiting scenario in surfactant concentrations where the adsorption measurement becomes impractical for example schaefer et al 2019 showed that perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos concentrations up to 500 micrograms per litre µg l in 0 01 m sodium chloride nacl showed no clear discernible change in surface tension from that of a pfas free solution similarly brusseau 2019 reported data from nine sources which all showed that pfoa surface tension did not measurably deviate from that of pure water until the concentration was above 5000 µg l for less surface active pfas such as perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and perfluoro butanoic acid pfba the discernible change in surface tension with respect to concentration is observed at even higher concentrations than pfos and pfoa therefore surface tension measurements are unsuitable on this basis for the direct measurement of adsorption behaviour at very low surfactant concentrations it is common therefore to use data collected at higher concentrations and apply a model adsorption isotherm to predict the adsorption performance at low concentrations the choice of the assumed model adsorption isotherm which typically take a linear or exponential form produces different outcomes and can have very significant practical consequences when modelling the transport behaviour of the pfas given the difficulty of obtaining direct experimental evidence of the adsorption behaviour of pfas at very low concentrations this remains a contentious issue schaefer et al 2019 arshadi et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 schaefer et al 2019 concluded that a freundlich based model rather than a langmuir based model described pfoa and pfos interfacial uptake while other studies brusseau 2019 arshadi et al 2020 le et al 2021 brusseau 2021 sha et al 2021 have observed a langmuir relationship to overcome the above limitations we propose to utilise an ordinary foam fractionation set up for direct measurement of pfas adsorption capacity at extremely low concentrations i e ng l range and beyond that which can be measured by conventional surface characterisation techniques depending on the concentration and the surface activity of the substance in this paper we provide the context and principle behind utilising the unsteady state foam fractionation operating parameters to measure the adsorption uptake and determine the equilibrium isotherm 2 methodology 2 1 materials pfhxs 97 purity was purchased from boc sciences pfoa 95 purity sodium dodecyl sulphate sds 99 purity and sodium chloride nacl acs reagent were purchased from merck all foam fractionation solutions were prepared using reverse osmosis ro water with electrical conductivity of 10 1 µs cm2 2 2 experimental setup foam fractionation is a physiochemical treatment process where air bubbles are sparged into a solution containing a surface active compound the surface active compound in this case pfas preferentially adsorbs to the air water interface i e the surfaces of the rising air bubbles in the solution and concentrate in the foam above the solution depleting its amount in the liquid pool buckley et al 2022 the foam can then be harvested to obtain a stream that is enriched in the surface active compound the present authors have reported the application of foam fractionation as a physical process to separate the surface active contaminant from water the foam fractionation setup generally follows that described in our earlier work buckley et al 2022 and is illustrated in fig 1 the setup consists of a perspex column with an internal diameter of 140 mm the foam in the column is generated by injecting air through a venturi system with a motive liquid flowrate of 15 l min supplied by a recirculation pump the liquid flow through the venturi creates a suction to pull in air and disperse it as a fine bubble swarm the system also has an in line heat exchanger for maintaining the temperature at 25 c and a peristaltic dosing pump flowrate set to 0 5 ml min to add co surfactant to the system just before the entrance to the recirculation pump since the concentration of pfas is very low a co surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate sds is necessary to produce a sufficiently stable foam to be extracted by the system the experiments were done with a background salt concentration of either 0 01 m or 0 1 m to mimic the effect of salinity naturally present in ground water and provide results more easily comparable to prior literature salts are known to affect the adsorption of surfactant molecules by suppressing the electrostatic double layer repulsions between the charged headgroups of ionic surfactants and salting out effect amani et al 2021 firouzi et al 2022 p amani and firouzi 2022 the air flowrate into the venturi was measured using a digital flowmeter that was calibrated for a range of 1 20 standard l min a syringe was connected to a sampling port near the base of the column and was used to extract samples of the liquid pool for pfas analysis the foam that was generated was collected 1 2 cm above the top of the liquid pool using vacuum suction 2 3 foam fractionation operating methodology 2 3 1 unsteady state batch pfas foam fractionation experiments the foam fractionation experiments were conducted in a batch mode with respect to pfas concentration the investigation was carried out with pfoa or pfhxs dissolved in 0 01 m or 0 1 m nacl solutions the fractionation column was loaded with a set quantity of liquid containing pfas to be separated but without any pre loaded co surfactant sds sds was continually dosed at a constant flowrate into the system throughout the duration of the experiment after an initial stabilization time typically in 15 min a steady state sds concentration was maintained in the pool the steady state sds concentration can be determined by mass balance using the method shown in our previous publication buckley et al 2023 and was determined to be 6 1 and 3 0 ppm for the 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl systems respectively the experiment consequently operates in batch mode with respect to pfas concentration which declines as the experiment progresses however the test progresses at a steady state with respect to the sds concentration this mode of operation is convenient because the bubble size which is predominantly dictated by the sds concentration in the liquid does not change over the course of an experiment the bubble size are also dependent on the background salt concentration and therefore the bubble size may differ between experiments with different salt concentrations for example experiments with 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl liquid samples from the column were collected every 5 10 min and analysed for pfas concentration at the end of the experiment the total amount of extracted foam was measured gravimetrically after defoaming and collapsing it into a liquid phase this was then divided by the collection time to determine the volumetric flowrate of liquid entrained and extracted from the system as part of the foam stream wf0 during the experiment the size distribution of bubbles in the first layer of foam cells which is adjacent to the surface of the liquid pool was measured using a high speed video camera together with a microscope several images were taken after the column had reached steady state and the images were then later analysed using imagej image processing software to obtain the bubble size distribution for each experiment the batch foam fractionation experiments were repeated for different volumes of liquid pool of 8 10 and 12 l corresponding to liquid pool heights above the air injection port h of 11 cm 24 cm and 37 cm respectively as indicated on fig 1 changing only the pool depth for the same physical and operating conditions changes the contact time of the bubbles rising through the liquid pool providing a simple and accurate method for showing if equilibrium has been reached if the surface excess is constant for different pool depths demonstrated by identical rates of pfas removal from the pool then it may be inferred that the bubble residence time is sufficient for equilibration this method provides the rate of removal of pfas however is not a suitable procedure to study the effect of pfas concentration in the liquid pool on the equilibrium adsorption for which steady state foam fractionation experiments are required as elaborated in section 2 3 2 2 3 2 steady state continuous pfas foam fractionation experiments in this study by calculating the surface excess concentration at the bubble surface at different steady state pfas concentrations in the liquid pool we seek to determine the adsorption equilibrium isotherm and validate that the adsorption follows a linear isotherm at environmentally relevant ng l µg l range concentrations to determine the surface excess at a fixed concentration of pfas using the proposed method the liquid pool concentration needs to be maintained at a constant value this is achieved by continuous addition of pfas together with the co foaming agent the liquid pool pfas concentration will reach a steady state where the rate of pfas addition to the column is equal to the rate of pfas being removed by the system in the foam under this condition a mass balance of the system with respect to pfas yields eq 2 which can be used to calculate the pfas adsorbed on the surface of the bubbles γ and corresponding steady state liquid pool concentration cb 2 d v c b d t 0 s b γ w f 0 c b q d c d where v is the liquid pool volume with dv dt as constant and since the flows in qd and out wf0 of the system are constant and measured qd is the flowrate of pfas plus co foaming agent solution being dosed to the system m3 s and cd is the concentration of pfas in the dosing solution mol m3 pfas was dosed at the nominal feeding rate of 0 5 ml min at concentrations varying from 0 5 to 150 mg l corresponding to mass loading rates between 0 25 and 75 µg min respectively samples were taken at multiple time intervals to check whether the pfas concentration in the column pool had achieved steady state it was found that steady state was achieved after approximately 30 min for the high salinity and high pfas concentration systems and after 60 min for the other systems i e lower pfas concentration and salinity 2 4 pfas analysis pfas samples were analysed with a shimadzu high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system coupled with a mass spectrometer qtrap ms 5500 ab sciex operating in electronic spray ionization esi and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode a 0 5 ml aliquot of pfas sample was added to an amber glass vial and spiked with 10 μl of the mass labelled internal standard 13c8 pfoa 0 2 mg l a fixed volume of 7 μl of sample was injected into a 100 2 1 mm 3 μm column restek 19 051 323 c18 maintained at a constant temperature of 40 c separation of pfas was achieved by gradient elution from the column using 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid in milli q water and methanol for the aqueous and organic phases respectively a pre column cartridge is installed between the solvent mixer and the injector to trap non target compounds present in the samples the limit of detection lod value was determined in the same manner as bräunig et al 2019 and was determined to be 0 1 µg l for pfoa and pfhxs for all pfas samples identification and validation of peaks were completed using retention times and comparing ratios of multiple reaction monitoring mrm transition area between the samples and calibration standards in the same analytical batch calibration standards were prepared in the concentration range of 0 1 100 µg l and run before and after pfas samples to monitor sensitivity drift data acquisition and processing were carried out using analyst and multiquant 3 03 sciex software results were only presented if the calibration curve show an r value 0 993 instrumental blanks milli q water and method blanks matrix were prepared and analysed together with the batch samples to assess the contamination introduced during sample preparation and analysis activities duplicate samples were analysed with the batch samples to monitor the repeatability of the method laboratory control spike samples and non extracted side spike samples were included in the sample preparation to monitor the recovery of target pfas analytes 3 conceptual development the application of the above described steady state and un steady state foam fractionation experiments for measurement of the adsorption equilibrium of pfas on the bubble surface and to produce an adsorption isotherm requires revisiting important concepts and making some theoretical assumptions to facilitate the data reduction those assumptions will be discussed here and later validated using available literature or experimental data in section 4 3 1 equilibrium between surface and bulk pfas concentrations a thermodynamic equilibrium exists between surfactant concentration in the associated liquid bulk solution and the surface excess on the bubbles i e air water interface for the experimental system here we consider that the liquid pool is well mixed which is primarily due to the high liquid recirculation rate relative to the pool volume and the turbulence induced by the bubble flow it is further assumed that the concentration of pfas in the film around the liquid is the same as that in the bulk liquid pool for the equilibrium to be achieved between the pfas concentration in the liquid pool and pfas adsorbed to the bubble surface there needs to be enough contact time between the surface and bulk liquid if the contact time is very short then the extent of adsorption may be limited by mass transfer kinetics and the equilibrium condition approached but not reached the contact time depends on the rise velocity of the bubbles and the distance they need to rise i e the height of the liquid pool above the bubble injection point the bubble rise velocity is a function of the bubble size which in turn depends on the method of generating the bubbles in this case a venturi and the chemistry of the liquid manifested primarily through the surface tension by conducting experiments at varying liquid height about the air injection port it will be verified that the system is indeed at equilibrium 3 2 determining pfas adsorption as the air bubbles emerge out from the liquid pool into the foam they drag with them some entrained liquid referred to as interstitial liquid the pfas concentration in the interstitial liquid is in equilibrium with the pfas adsorbed at the surface of the bubble to evaluate the pfas adsorption i e surface excess it is necessary to know at some location in the column i the amount of surface area available for pfas adsorption ii the volume and concentration of pfas in the interstitial liquid and iii the concentration of pfas in the collapsed foam that is the amount of pfas contained in both the air film interface and the adjacent interstitial liquid at steady state the rate of liquid entrainment into the foam is equivalent to the flowrate of liquid exiting the foam fractionation column through the vacuum extraction system which is measured over the course of each experiment a small amount of liquid is also lost from the column due to evaporation 0 1 but this is negligible compared to the rate of liquid entrainment in the foam the surface area flux in the first layer of the foam just above the liquid surface is determined from the air flowrate into the system through the venturi and the bubble size which are both measured during the test additionally the concentration of the interstitial liquid in the first layer of foam can reasonably be assumed to be the same as the liquid pool concentration as they are in direct contact the liquid pool concentration is measured by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy 3 3 co adsorption of pfas and co foaming agent it is a practical requirement to produce a stable foam in order for it to be extracted by the vacuum extraction system for measurement hence a supporting co foaming agent is added to the system at a steady rate while the concentration of the co foaming agent sds in the pool is higher than the pfas concentration several mg l of sds compared to μg l or ng l of pfas the co surfactant concentration is still significantly below the cmc critical micelle concentration limit and hence the interface surface area coverage of sds on the bubble is very small fainerman et al 2010 under these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that upon adsorption the pfas and sds will each have negligible effect on the surface activity of each other ji et al 2021 have shown that at lower concentrations of pfoa 0 1 mg l the addition of sds had no measurable effect on the surface tension supporting the contention that at much lower concentrations of pfoa such as those comparable with this study the added sds will have no or negligible impact on the adsorption behaviour of pfoa at the interface this finding was supported by our previous study buckley et al 2023 which found a 1 reduction in surface tension for a solution containing 10 ppm pfoa and 10 ppm sds compared to solution which only contained 10 ppm sds 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimising the process conditions effect of salinity and liquid pool volume the pfas removal in the batch foam fractionation experiments at different operating conditions are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that increasing the salinity from 0 01 to 0 1 m increased both the removal and the removal rate of both pfhxs and pfoa which agrees with our previous results buckley et al 2022 and those reported in literature brusseau and van glubt 2019 furthermore the rate of removal of pfoa was observed to be larger than that of pfhxs which is also expected based on the higher surface activity of pfoa due to its longer fluorocarbon chain brusseau and van glubt 2021 the removal trends shown in fig 2 further indicate that the rate of removal of each pfas species is not changed when the pool height varies from 11 to 37 cm this shows that the bubble residence time for the bubble size distribution in these experiments is sufficient for equilibrium between the pfas in the bulk and the surface to be achieved when the liquid pool height is 11 cm corresponding to 8 l liquid pool volume or more above the bubble injection point this is the case in both 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions 4 2 determining pfas adsorption coefficient k for steady state experiments the equation used to estimate the surface excess γ for each system is shown in eq 2 in which the values qd cd cb v and wf0 come from direct experimental measurements the parameter sb in eq 3 is the bubble surface flux representing the available surface area for adsorption of pfas in the system the value of sb is obtained from the air flowrate into the system g and the bubble size rb eq 3 3 s b 3 g r b the measured bubble size distribution is shown in fig 3 for different liquid pool heights and salt concentrations it can be seen from fig 3 that a narrower bubble size distribution was observed for the higher salinity this is to be expected as increasing nacl concentration has been shown to inhibit bubble coalescence firouzi and nguyen 2014 p amani and firouzi 2022 fig 4 reports the experimentally measured adsorption of pfas with respect to the concentration in the bulk for systems with 0 1 and 0 01 m sodium chloride salt the results were obtained from the continuous dosing experiments for pfhxs and pfoa in 0 01 m nacl and 0 1 m nacl the column was operated with a liquid pool depth of 24 cm and 37 cm while steady concentration of pfas in the bulk liquid was maintained by steady dosing rate of pfas the corresponding equilibrium pfas concentration in the foam was obtained by mass balance steady state pfas concentrations lay between 0 08 89 9 µg l and 0 05 73 1 µg l for pfhxs and pfoa respectively pfoa is more easily removed by foam fractionation than pfhxs due to its greater hydrophobicity buckley et al 2022 and while the steady state concentrations in the column were similar it may be noted that the pfoa was dosed and removed by the process at approximately double the rate of pfhxs from fig 4 it can be clearly seen that a well designed foam fractionation system can be used as a tool to experimentally estimate the surface excess the surface excess can be related to the liquid pool concentration through the pfas air water adsorption coefficient γ k c b and then directly compared with the results of adsorption isotherms obtained from surface tension measurements the dashed line in fig 4 shows the linear trendline that best fits the data with the y intercept bound to the origin the correlation coefficient r2 for the trendline was 0 875 and 0 747 for pfoa and 0 857 and 0 786 for pfhxs in 0 1 m and 0 01 m nacl solution respectively from fig 4 it is apparent that the surface excess is directly proportional to the bulk concentration γ c b 1 despite significant changes in concentration over approx 2 3 orders of magnitude supporting the conclusion that the adsorption behaviour follows a langmuir isotherm based on the linear behaviour at low concentrations 4 3 determination of k for unsteady state batch experiments having shown that the isotherm follows linear behaviour we can now apply a similar method to determine the k or equilibrium adsorption coefficient for the batch experimental data shown in fig 2 to confirm that they remain unchanged with increasing pool height above 24 cm the unsteady state mass balance of pfas in the column is shown in eq 4 and is used to determine the adsorption coefficient k of pfas on the foam surface 4 d v c b d t s b k c b w f 0 c b v is the volume of the liquid pool m3 cb is the concentration of pfas in the liquid pool mol m3 and sb is the rate of surface area production in the liquid pool and crossing the foam water interface m2 s calculated from the measured bubble size distribution and the gas flowrate measured going into the venturi wf0 is the entrained rate of liquid uptake into the foam m3 s and k is the pfas air water adsorption coefficient m the total amount of foam collected over the course of an experiment was quite small 200 ml compared to the total pool volume 10 l the results from this analysis and the pfas air water adsorption coefficients for the batch experiments are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 in both systems it can be clearly seen that the k value did not change as the liquid pool height was increased from 24 to 37 cm with a small increase being observed from 11 to 24 cm in the system with 0 1 m nacl these results support the conclusion that equilibrium was attained between the pfas in the bulk solution and the bubble surface before the bubble rises to the top of the liquid pool and is collected into the foam fig 5 also presents a comparison of the k values obtained from the continuous experiments using the steady state model eq 2 with the unsteady state model eq 4 it can be clearly seen that there is some difference between the results obtained from the different methods we consider that this arises from and is illustrative of the difficulty of using the batch method as a means for evaluating k the problem occurs because in the batch experiments the value of k is obtained by fitting the concentration decline curve this is only valid after the end of the initial stabilisation period when the sds concentration in the pool has stopped changing in the early period when the sds concentration is still building up and which encompass the first point or points in the decline curve the surface area flux is increasing as the bubbles become smaller in response to lowering the surface tension laplace 1799 in addition in the early phase the larger bubbles rise faster and so there is no longer certainty that liquid surface equilibrium is achieved both of these mechanisms have the effect of causing the calculated k values to be lower than they should be this problem can be ameliorated by fitting results only after stabilisation which we have done previously vo et al 2023 but this becomes difficult when the starting concentration of pfas is very low and the removal rate high as is the case here in the steady state experiments eq 2 qd is set by the pump flowrate cd is the concentration of the pfas standard solution and the parameters cb and wf0 are easily measured from the system the surface area flux sb is perhaps the most prone to error since it depends on bubble size whose measurement is complicated by shape deformation of bubbles in the foam distortion effects from observing the bubble size through a perspex cylindrical column and wall effects due to only being able to observe the bubbles adjacent or very near to the perspex column wall cheng and lemlich 1983 nevertheless bubble size error is likely to be relatively small even for our visual imaging method so the method proposed in this paper should provide superior accuracy compared to current alternatives better methods of measuring the bubble size distribution would further improve the outcomes 4 4 comparison of estimated pfas adsorption behaviour with prior literature in the absence of experimentally measured sorption data at environmentally relevant concentrations the prior literature has proceeded by fitting adsorption isotherms to surface tension data taken at much higher concentrations and then extrapolating to predict the adsorption behaviour at low concentrations this is reasonable as there is no measurable change in the surface forces at the interface at the very low pfas concentrations of interest lacking direct evidence extrapolation has resulted in different outcomes and predictions amongst researchers regarding the isotherm at these low concentrations using the method described here we were able to experimentally obtain the pfas air water adsorption coefficient k in 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl over the pfas concentration range investigated 0 1 100 µg l these k values did not change significantly over the range of concentrations investigated that is the surface excess γ is directly proportional to concentration cb this supports the contention that the isotherm follows the langmuir form based on the linear behaviour at low concentrations for the purposes of comparison results for pfas adsorption coefficient k for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl from four different articles schaefer et al 2019 brusseau 2019 le et al 2021 buckley et al 2022 all using different methods for fitting the adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 6 along with the isotherm calculated from experimental data collected from this study the values reported in this study differ from these publications but are within the same order of magnitude the experimental error associated with the results reported in our previous paper buckley et al 2022 which uses the unsteady state method we consider should be significantly larger than this study for reasons explained earlier also the results from steady state fractionation are more direct and experimentally determined at the pfas concentrations of interest as compared with extraction from model extrapolations which are the root of surface tension based measurements by the other references shown the easy repeatability of the results from this paper also serve to reinforce our belief that the method outlined here presents a good alternative technique the relatively small uncertainties associated with the characterisation of the bubble size may be addressed by using more sophisticated measurement techniques than the visual photographic method used here data for pfhxs has been developed in this paper however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no prior data to compare with at the concentration range which was investigated 4 conclusion the paper presents a method for using a foam fractionation system to illuminate pfas adsorption behaviour at environmentally relevant i e very low concentrations pfoa and pfhxs adsorption in 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl were confirmed to follow a langmuir adsorption behaviour with no significant change to the air water interface adsorption coefficient over the pfas concentration range investigated approx 0 1 100 µg l this method may be applied

14767,pfas are biologically recalcitrant compounds that are persistent in the environment and have subsequently contaminated groundwater landfill leachate and surface water due to their persistence and toxicity there are environmental concentration limits imposed on some pfas compounds that extend down to a few nanograms per litre and even proposals for reducing these to picogram per litre levels since pfas concentrates at water air interfaces as a result of their amphiphilic nature this characteristic is important for the successful modelling and prediction of transport behaviour of pfas through various systems here we present a procedure for using a foam fractionation method to experimentally determine the pfas adsorption behaviour at ng l and µg l concentrations in the presence of salts the equilibrium air water adsorption coefficients for pfhxs and pfoa at different salinities and concentrations are experimentally shown to be constant across the range of pfas concentrations investigated approx 0 1 100 µg l the adsorption isotherms may consequently be modelled by henry or langmuir style equations at these low concentrations keywords pfas foam fractionation adsorption isotherm surface tension remediation data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are synthetic chemicals consisting of a completely or partially fluorinated carbon chain due to their strong resistance to chemical thermal and biological degradation they are highly recalcitrant in the environment due to their widespread use in a variety of industrial and consumer products such as plastics paper leather lubricants and coatings cement metal cleaners floor polishes and aqueous film forming foam afff products ahrens and bundschuh 2014 prevedouros et al 2006 they have been detected in landfill leachates benskin et al 2012 groundwater bräunig et al 2017 soil and drinking water kaboré et al 2018 kurwadkar et al 2022 thompson et al 2011 the distribution of pfas in the environment has led to public exposure through drinking water food consumption and dust inhalation due to their potential toxicity to humans animals and biota fenton et al 2021 podder et al 2021 cui et al 2020 environmental concentration limits have been imposed on some pfas compounds that extend down to a few nanograms per litre ng l and there are even proposals for reducing these to picogram per litre levels pfas molecules tend to accumulate at air water interfaces due to their amphiphilic nature the adsorption of these amphiphilic pfas molecules to the air water interface particularly at low concentrations relevant to practical environmental conditions is key in the successful modelling and prediction of transport behaviour of pfas through various environmental systems additionally gaining precise knowledge of the pfas adsorption capacity at low concentrations is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of remediation technologies based on pfas separation into the air water interface for example the foam fractionation treatment process almost all the existing methods to measure pfas adsorption on the air water interface require the concentrations of adsorbent to be sufficiently high so that there are measurable changes to the surface forces usually concentrations in the mg l range which are several orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of pollutants measured in the environment i e in the ng l range adsorption is most often presented as an isotherm of the surface concentration of the surface active molecule at the air water interface e g in mol m2 as a function of the bulk liquid concentration at equilibrium e g in mol m3 for example the langmuir isotherm describes the relationship between surface concentration surface excess γ and bulk concentration cb and at low surfactant concentrations can be approximated by the proportionality constant k as shown in eq 1 below 1 γ k c b since surface concentration can be directly estimated by the measured changes in the surface tension menger and rizvi 2011 amani et al 2020 adsorption isotherms are experimentally determined using a tool such as a tensiometer to measure changes in dynamic and equilibrium surface tensions there are many different versions of this apparatus such as drop bubble profile zholob et al 2007 loglio et al 2001 wilhelmy plate padday and russell 1960 böttger et al 2012 stevenson et al 1995 niño and patino 1998 du nouy ring padday and russell 1960 du noüy 1925 lunkenheimer and wantke 1981 and bubble pressure tensiometers fainerman and miller 2004 christov et al 2006 these apparatuses are used for measuring and interpreting how the balancing forces at the air water interface change in the presence of different concentrations of surface active substances this is done by for example analysing the shape of a bubble drop and fitting the young laplace equation to the drop and bubble profile or by physically disturbing the interface in the wilhelmy plate and ring tensiometry methods a limitation of these methods is that the accuracy reduces significantly as the surfactant concentrations decreases since the measurement errors are about constant while the corresponding measured change becomes smaller this eventually approaches a limiting scenario in surfactant concentrations where the adsorption measurement becomes impractical for example schaefer et al 2019 showed that perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos concentrations up to 500 micrograms per litre µg l in 0 01 m sodium chloride nacl showed no clear discernible change in surface tension from that of a pfas free solution similarly brusseau 2019 reported data from nine sources which all showed that pfoa surface tension did not measurably deviate from that of pure water until the concentration was above 5000 µg l for less surface active pfas such as perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and perfluoro butanoic acid pfba the discernible change in surface tension with respect to concentration is observed at even higher concentrations than pfos and pfoa therefore surface tension measurements are unsuitable on this basis for the direct measurement of adsorption behaviour at very low surfactant concentrations it is common therefore to use data collected at higher concentrations and apply a model adsorption isotherm to predict the adsorption performance at low concentrations the choice of the assumed model adsorption isotherm which typically take a linear or exponential form produces different outcomes and can have very significant practical consequences when modelling the transport behaviour of the pfas given the difficulty of obtaining direct experimental evidence of the adsorption behaviour of pfas at very low concentrations this remains a contentious issue schaefer et al 2019 arshadi et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 schaefer et al 2019 concluded that a freundlich based model rather than a langmuir based model described pfoa and pfos interfacial uptake while other studies brusseau 2019 arshadi et al 2020 le et al 2021 brusseau 2021 sha et al 2021 have observed a langmuir relationship to overcome the above limitations we propose to utilise an ordinary foam fractionation set up for direct measurement of pfas adsorption capacity at extremely low concentrations i e ng l range and beyond that which can be measured by conventional surface characterisation techniques depending on the concentration and the surface activity of the substance in this paper we provide the context and principle behind utilising the unsteady state foam fractionation operating parameters to measure the adsorption uptake and determine the equilibrium isotherm 2 methodology 2 1 materials pfhxs 97 purity was purchased from boc sciences pfoa 95 purity sodium dodecyl sulphate sds 99 purity and sodium chloride nacl acs reagent were purchased from merck all foam fractionation solutions were prepared using reverse osmosis ro water with electrical conductivity of 10 1 µs cm2 2 2 experimental setup foam fractionation is a physiochemical treatment process where air bubbles are sparged into a solution containing a surface active compound the surface active compound in this case pfas preferentially adsorbs to the air water interface i e the surfaces of the rising air bubbles in the solution and concentrate in the foam above the solution depleting its amount in the liquid pool buckley et al 2022 the foam can then be harvested to obtain a stream that is enriched in the surface active compound the present authors have reported the application of foam fractionation as a physical process to separate the surface active contaminant from water the foam fractionation setup generally follows that described in our earlier work buckley et al 2022 and is illustrated in fig 1 the setup consists of a perspex column with an internal diameter of 140 mm the foam in the column is generated by injecting air through a venturi system with a motive liquid flowrate of 15 l min supplied by a recirculation pump the liquid flow through the venturi creates a suction to pull in air and disperse it as a fine bubble swarm the system also has an in line heat exchanger for maintaining the temperature at 25 c and a peristaltic dosing pump flowrate set to 0 5 ml min to add co surfactant to the system just before the entrance to the recirculation pump since the concentration of pfas is very low a co surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate sds is necessary to produce a sufficiently stable foam to be extracted by the system the experiments were done with a background salt concentration of either 0 01 m or 0 1 m to mimic the effect of salinity naturally present in ground water and provide results more easily comparable to prior literature salts are known to affect the adsorption of surfactant molecules by suppressing the electrostatic double layer repulsions between the charged headgroups of ionic surfactants and salting out effect amani et al 2021 firouzi et al 2022 p amani and firouzi 2022 the air flowrate into the venturi was measured using a digital flowmeter that was calibrated for a range of 1 20 standard l min a syringe was connected to a sampling port near the base of the column and was used to extract samples of the liquid pool for pfas analysis the foam that was generated was collected 1 2 cm above the top of the liquid pool using vacuum suction 2 3 foam fractionation operating methodology 2 3 1 unsteady state batch pfas foam fractionation experiments the foam fractionation experiments were conducted in a batch mode with respect to pfas concentration the investigation was carried out with pfoa or pfhxs dissolved in 0 01 m or 0 1 m nacl solutions the fractionation column was loaded with a set quantity of liquid containing pfas to be separated but without any pre loaded co surfactant sds sds was continually dosed at a constant flowrate into the system throughout the duration of the experiment after an initial stabilization time typically in 15 min a steady state sds concentration was maintained in the pool the steady state sds concentration can be determined by mass balance using the method shown in our previous publication buckley et al 2023 and was determined to be 6 1 and 3 0 ppm for the 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl systems respectively the experiment consequently operates in batch mode with respect to pfas concentration which declines as the experiment progresses however the test progresses at a steady state with respect to the sds concentration this mode of operation is convenient because the bubble size which is predominantly dictated by the sds concentration in the liquid does not change over the course of an experiment the bubble size are also dependent on the background salt concentration and therefore the bubble size may differ between experiments with different salt concentrations for example experiments with 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl liquid samples from the column were collected every 5 10 min and analysed for pfas concentration at the end of the experiment the total amount of extracted foam was measured gravimetrically after defoaming and collapsing it into a liquid phase this was then divided by the collection time to determine the volumetric flowrate of liquid entrained and extracted from the system as part of the foam stream wf0 during the experiment the size distribution of bubbles in the first layer of foam cells which is adjacent to the surface of the liquid pool was measured using a high speed video camera together with a microscope several images were taken after the column had reached steady state and the images were then later analysed using imagej image processing software to obtain the bubble size distribution for each experiment the batch foam fractionation experiments were repeated for different volumes of liquid pool of 8 10 and 12 l corresponding to liquid pool heights above the air injection port h of 11 cm 24 cm and 37 cm respectively as indicated on fig 1 changing only the pool depth for the same physical and operating conditions changes the contact time of the bubbles rising through the liquid pool providing a simple and accurate method for showing if equilibrium has been reached if the surface excess is constant for different pool depths demonstrated by identical rates of pfas removal from the pool then it may be inferred that the bubble residence time is sufficient for equilibration this method provides the rate of removal of pfas however is not a suitable procedure to study the effect of pfas concentration in the liquid pool on the equilibrium adsorption for which steady state foam fractionation experiments are required as elaborated in section 2 3 2 2 3 2 steady state continuous pfas foam fractionation experiments in this study by calculating the surface excess concentration at the bubble surface at different steady state pfas concentrations in the liquid pool we seek to determine the adsorption equilibrium isotherm and validate that the adsorption follows a linear isotherm at environmentally relevant ng l µg l range concentrations to determine the surface excess at a fixed concentration of pfas using the proposed method the liquid pool concentration needs to be maintained at a constant value this is achieved by continuous addition of pfas together with the co foaming agent the liquid pool pfas concentration will reach a steady state where the rate of pfas addition to the column is equal to the rate of pfas being removed by the system in the foam under this condition a mass balance of the system with respect to pfas yields eq 2 which can be used to calculate the pfas adsorbed on the surface of the bubbles γ and corresponding steady state liquid pool concentration cb 2 d v c b d t 0 s b γ w f 0 c b q d c d where v is the liquid pool volume with dv dt as constant and since the flows in qd and out wf0 of the system are constant and measured qd is the flowrate of pfas plus co foaming agent solution being dosed to the system m3 s and cd is the concentration of pfas in the dosing solution mol m3 pfas was dosed at the nominal feeding rate of 0 5 ml min at concentrations varying from 0 5 to 150 mg l corresponding to mass loading rates between 0 25 and 75 µg min respectively samples were taken at multiple time intervals to check whether the pfas concentration in the column pool had achieved steady state it was found that steady state was achieved after approximately 30 min for the high salinity and high pfas concentration systems and after 60 min for the other systems i e lower pfas concentration and salinity 2 4 pfas analysis pfas samples were analysed with a shimadzu high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system coupled with a mass spectrometer qtrap ms 5500 ab sciex operating in electronic spray ionization esi and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode a 0 5 ml aliquot of pfas sample was added to an amber glass vial and spiked with 10 μl of the mass labelled internal standard 13c8 pfoa 0 2 mg l a fixed volume of 7 μl of sample was injected into a 100 2 1 mm 3 μm column restek 19 051 323 c18 maintained at a constant temperature of 40 c separation of pfas was achieved by gradient elution from the column using 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid in milli q water and methanol for the aqueous and organic phases respectively a pre column cartridge is installed between the solvent mixer and the injector to trap non target compounds present in the samples the limit of detection lod value was determined in the same manner as bräunig et al 2019 and was determined to be 0 1 µg l for pfoa and pfhxs for all pfas samples identification and validation of peaks were completed using retention times and comparing ratios of multiple reaction monitoring mrm transition area between the samples and calibration standards in the same analytical batch calibration standards were prepared in the concentration range of 0 1 100 µg l and run before and after pfas samples to monitor sensitivity drift data acquisition and processing were carried out using analyst and multiquant 3 03 sciex software results were only presented if the calibration curve show an r value 0 993 instrumental blanks milli q water and method blanks matrix were prepared and analysed together with the batch samples to assess the contamination introduced during sample preparation and analysis activities duplicate samples were analysed with the batch samples to monitor the repeatability of the method laboratory control spike samples and non extracted side spike samples were included in the sample preparation to monitor the recovery of target pfas analytes 3 conceptual development the application of the above described steady state and un steady state foam fractionation experiments for measurement of the adsorption equilibrium of pfas on the bubble surface and to produce an adsorption isotherm requires revisiting important concepts and making some theoretical assumptions to facilitate the data reduction those assumptions will be discussed here and later validated using available literature or experimental data in section 4 3 1 equilibrium between surface and bulk pfas concentrations a thermodynamic equilibrium exists between surfactant concentration in the associated liquid bulk solution and the surface excess on the bubbles i e air water interface for the experimental system here we consider that the liquid pool is well mixed which is primarily due to the high liquid recirculation rate relative to the pool volume and the turbulence induced by the bubble flow it is further assumed that the concentration of pfas in the film around the liquid is the same as that in the bulk liquid pool for the equilibrium to be achieved between the pfas concentration in the liquid pool and pfas adsorbed to the bubble surface there needs to be enough contact time between the surface and bulk liquid if the contact time is very short then the extent of adsorption may be limited by mass transfer kinetics and the equilibrium condition approached but not reached the contact time depends on the rise velocity of the bubbles and the distance they need to rise i e the height of the liquid pool above the bubble injection point the bubble rise velocity is a function of the bubble size which in turn depends on the method of generating the bubbles in this case a venturi and the chemistry of the liquid manifested primarily through the surface tension by conducting experiments at varying liquid height about the air injection port it will be verified that the system is indeed at equilibrium 3 2 determining pfas adsorption as the air bubbles emerge out from the liquid pool into the foam they drag with them some entrained liquid referred to as interstitial liquid the pfas concentration in the interstitial liquid is in equilibrium with the pfas adsorbed at the surface of the bubble to evaluate the pfas adsorption i e surface excess it is necessary to know at some location in the column i the amount of surface area available for pfas adsorption ii the volume and concentration of pfas in the interstitial liquid and iii the concentration of pfas in the collapsed foam that is the amount of pfas contained in both the air film interface and the adjacent interstitial liquid at steady state the rate of liquid entrainment into the foam is equivalent to the flowrate of liquid exiting the foam fractionation column through the vacuum extraction system which is measured over the course of each experiment a small amount of liquid is also lost from the column due to evaporation 0 1 but this is negligible compared to the rate of liquid entrainment in the foam the surface area flux in the first layer of the foam just above the liquid surface is determined from the air flowrate into the system through the venturi and the bubble size which are both measured during the test additionally the concentration of the interstitial liquid in the first layer of foam can reasonably be assumed to be the same as the liquid pool concentration as they are in direct contact the liquid pool concentration is measured by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy 3 3 co adsorption of pfas and co foaming agent it is a practical requirement to produce a stable foam in order for it to be extracted by the vacuum extraction system for measurement hence a supporting co foaming agent is added to the system at a steady rate while the concentration of the co foaming agent sds in the pool is higher than the pfas concentration several mg l of sds compared to μg l or ng l of pfas the co surfactant concentration is still significantly below the cmc critical micelle concentration limit and hence the interface surface area coverage of sds on the bubble is very small fainerman et al 2010 under these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that upon adsorption the pfas and sds will each have negligible effect on the surface activity of each other ji et al 2021 have shown that at lower concentrations of pfoa 0 1 mg l the addition of sds had no measurable effect on the surface tension supporting the contention that at much lower concentrations of pfoa such as those comparable with this study the added sds will have no or negligible impact on the adsorption behaviour of pfoa at the interface this finding was supported by our previous study buckley et al 2023 which found a 1 reduction in surface tension for a solution containing 10 ppm pfoa and 10 ppm sds compared to solution which only contained 10 ppm sds 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimising the process conditions effect of salinity and liquid pool volume the pfas removal in the batch foam fractionation experiments at different operating conditions are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that increasing the salinity from 0 01 to 0 1 m increased both the removal and the removal rate of both pfhxs and pfoa which agrees with our previous results buckley et al 2022 and those reported in literature brusseau and van glubt 2019 furthermore the rate of removal of pfoa was observed to be larger than that of pfhxs which is also expected based on the higher surface activity of pfoa due to its longer fluorocarbon chain brusseau and van glubt 2021 the removal trends shown in fig 2 further indicate that the rate of removal of each pfas species is not changed when the pool height varies from 11 to 37 cm this shows that the bubble residence time for the bubble size distribution in these experiments is sufficient for equilibrium between the pfas in the bulk and the surface to be achieved when the liquid pool height is 11 cm corresponding to 8 l liquid pool volume or more above the bubble injection point this is the case in both 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl solutions 4 2 determining pfas adsorption coefficient k for steady state experiments the equation used to estimate the surface excess γ for each system is shown in eq 2 in which the values qd cd cb v and wf0 come from direct experimental measurements the parameter sb in eq 3 is the bubble surface flux representing the available surface area for adsorption of pfas in the system the value of sb is obtained from the air flowrate into the system g and the bubble size rb eq 3 3 s b 3 g r b the measured bubble size distribution is shown in fig 3 for different liquid pool heights and salt concentrations it can be seen from fig 3 that a narrower bubble size distribution was observed for the higher salinity this is to be expected as increasing nacl concentration has been shown to inhibit bubble coalescence firouzi and nguyen 2014 p amani and firouzi 2022 fig 4 reports the experimentally measured adsorption of pfas with respect to the concentration in the bulk for systems with 0 1 and 0 01 m sodium chloride salt the results were obtained from the continuous dosing experiments for pfhxs and pfoa in 0 01 m nacl and 0 1 m nacl the column was operated with a liquid pool depth of 24 cm and 37 cm while steady concentration of pfas in the bulk liquid was maintained by steady dosing rate of pfas the corresponding equilibrium pfas concentration in the foam was obtained by mass balance steady state pfas concentrations lay between 0 08 89 9 µg l and 0 05 73 1 µg l for pfhxs and pfoa respectively pfoa is more easily removed by foam fractionation than pfhxs due to its greater hydrophobicity buckley et al 2022 and while the steady state concentrations in the column were similar it may be noted that the pfoa was dosed and removed by the process at approximately double the rate of pfhxs from fig 4 it can be clearly seen that a well designed foam fractionation system can be used as a tool to experimentally estimate the surface excess the surface excess can be related to the liquid pool concentration through the pfas air water adsorption coefficient γ k c b and then directly compared with the results of adsorption isotherms obtained from surface tension measurements the dashed line in fig 4 shows the linear trendline that best fits the data with the y intercept bound to the origin the correlation coefficient r2 for the trendline was 0 875 and 0 747 for pfoa and 0 857 and 0 786 for pfhxs in 0 1 m and 0 01 m nacl solution respectively from fig 4 it is apparent that the surface excess is directly proportional to the bulk concentration γ c b 1 despite significant changes in concentration over approx 2 3 orders of magnitude supporting the conclusion that the adsorption behaviour follows a langmuir isotherm based on the linear behaviour at low concentrations 4 3 determination of k for unsteady state batch experiments having shown that the isotherm follows linear behaviour we can now apply a similar method to determine the k or equilibrium adsorption coefficient for the batch experimental data shown in fig 2 to confirm that they remain unchanged with increasing pool height above 24 cm the unsteady state mass balance of pfas in the column is shown in eq 4 and is used to determine the adsorption coefficient k of pfas on the foam surface 4 d v c b d t s b k c b w f 0 c b v is the volume of the liquid pool m3 cb is the concentration of pfas in the liquid pool mol m3 and sb is the rate of surface area production in the liquid pool and crossing the foam water interface m2 s calculated from the measured bubble size distribution and the gas flowrate measured going into the venturi wf0 is the entrained rate of liquid uptake into the foam m3 s and k is the pfas air water adsorption coefficient m the total amount of foam collected over the course of an experiment was quite small 200 ml compared to the total pool volume 10 l the results from this analysis and the pfas air water adsorption coefficients for the batch experiments are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 in both systems it can be clearly seen that the k value did not change as the liquid pool height was increased from 24 to 37 cm with a small increase being observed from 11 to 24 cm in the system with 0 1 m nacl these results support the conclusion that equilibrium was attained between the pfas in the bulk solution and the bubble surface before the bubble rises to the top of the liquid pool and is collected into the foam fig 5 also presents a comparison of the k values obtained from the continuous experiments using the steady state model eq 2 with the unsteady state model eq 4 it can be clearly seen that there is some difference between the results obtained from the different methods we consider that this arises from and is illustrative of the difficulty of using the batch method as a means for evaluating k the problem occurs because in the batch experiments the value of k is obtained by fitting the concentration decline curve this is only valid after the end of the initial stabilisation period when the sds concentration in the pool has stopped changing in the early period when the sds concentration is still building up and which encompass the first point or points in the decline curve the surface area flux is increasing as the bubbles become smaller in response to lowering the surface tension laplace 1799 in addition in the early phase the larger bubbles rise faster and so there is no longer certainty that liquid surface equilibrium is achieved both of these mechanisms have the effect of causing the calculated k values to be lower than they should be this problem can be ameliorated by fitting results only after stabilisation which we have done previously vo et al 2023 but this becomes difficult when the starting concentration of pfas is very low and the removal rate high as is the case here in the steady state experiments eq 2 qd is set by the pump flowrate cd is the concentration of the pfas standard solution and the parameters cb and wf0 are easily measured from the system the surface area flux sb is perhaps the most prone to error since it depends on bubble size whose measurement is complicated by shape deformation of bubbles in the foam distortion effects from observing the bubble size through a perspex cylindrical column and wall effects due to only being able to observe the bubbles adjacent or very near to the perspex column wall cheng and lemlich 1983 nevertheless bubble size error is likely to be relatively small even for our visual imaging method so the method proposed in this paper should provide superior accuracy compared to current alternatives better methods of measuring the bubble size distribution would further improve the outcomes 4 4 comparison of estimated pfas adsorption behaviour with prior literature in the absence of experimentally measured sorption data at environmentally relevant concentrations the prior literature has proceeded by fitting adsorption isotherms to surface tension data taken at much higher concentrations and then extrapolating to predict the adsorption behaviour at low concentrations this is reasonable as there is no measurable change in the surface forces at the interface at the very low pfas concentrations of interest lacking direct evidence extrapolation has resulted in different outcomes and predictions amongst researchers regarding the isotherm at these low concentrations using the method described here we were able to experimentally obtain the pfas air water adsorption coefficient k in 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl over the pfas concentration range investigated 0 1 100 µg l these k values did not change significantly over the range of concentrations investigated that is the surface excess γ is directly proportional to concentration cb this supports the contention that the isotherm follows the langmuir form based on the linear behaviour at low concentrations for the purposes of comparison results for pfas adsorption coefficient k for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl from four different articles schaefer et al 2019 brusseau 2019 le et al 2021 buckley et al 2022 all using different methods for fitting the adsorption isotherms are shown in fig 6 along with the isotherm calculated from experimental data collected from this study the values reported in this study differ from these publications but are within the same order of magnitude the experimental error associated with the results reported in our previous paper buckley et al 2022 which uses the unsteady state method we consider should be significantly larger than this study for reasons explained earlier also the results from steady state fractionation are more direct and experimentally determined at the pfas concentrations of interest as compared with extraction from model extrapolations which are the root of surface tension based measurements by the other references shown the easy repeatability of the results from this paper also serve to reinforce our belief that the method outlined here presents a good alternative technique the relatively small uncertainties associated with the characterisation of the bubble size may be addressed by using more sophisticated measurement techniques than the visual photographic method used here data for pfhxs has been developed in this paper however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no prior data to compare with at the concentration range which was investigated 4 conclusion the paper presents a method for using a foam fractionation system to illuminate pfas adsorption behaviour at environmentally relevant i e very low concentrations pfoa and pfhxs adsorption in 0 01 m and 0 1 m nacl were confirmed to follow a langmuir adsorption behaviour with no significant change to the air water interface adsorption coefficient over the pfas concentration range investigated approx 0 1 100 µg l this method may be applied to any surface active chemical where air water adsorption coefficients or isotherms are required at concentrations very much below measurable changes in surface tension declaration of competing

14768,recent studies suggested that long lived photooxidants llpo which are reactive intermediates formed during irradiation of dissolved organic matter dom may consist of phenoxyl radicals derived from phenolic moieties of the dom besides the well studied excited triplet states of chromophoric dom 3cdom llpo presumably are important photooxidants for the transformation of electron rich contaminants in surface waters the main objective of this study was to further test the potential role of phenoxyl radical as llpo suwannee river fulvic acid srfa as a model dom was pre oxidised using the phenol reactive oxidants chlorine and ozone followed by its characterization by the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva254 the ratio of absorbance at λ 254 nm and λ 365 nm e2 e3 and the electron donating capacity edc subsequently the photoreactivity of pre oxidized srfa was tested using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop as a llpo probe compound at two initial concentrations dmop 0 0 1 and 5 0 μm linear inter correlations were observed for the relative changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc for increasing oxidant doses pseudo first order transformation rate constants normalized to the changing srfa absorption rate i e k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs for 0 1 and 5 0 µm respectively exhibited the following distinct trends the llpo dominated k 0 1 obs r cdom abs ratio decreased with increasing oxidant dose and with decreasing suva254 and edc while the 3cdom dominated k 5 0 obs r cdom abs ratio positively correlated with e2 e3 finally it was concluded that precursors of 3cdom and llpo are chemically modified differently by pre oxidation of dom and llpo precursors likely consist of phenolic moieties of dom suggesting phenoxyl radicals as llpo graphical abstract image graphical

organic matter dom is ubiquitous in surface waters and describes a complex mixture of organic compounds produced by biogeochemical processes leenheer and croué 2003 dom spans a broad range of molecular weight typically between 100 100 000 da and is composed of aliphatic and hydrocarbon structures with various functional moieties including amides carbonyls and phenols derrien et al 2019 the chromophoric part of dom cdom is able to absorb light and consequently to form photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri which may induce the transformation of micropollutants guo et al 2022 richard and canonica 2005 vione et al 2014 cdom produced ppri include short lived photooxidants such as the pool of excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom mcneill and canonica 2016 furthermore long lived photooxidants llpo form upon cdom light absorption and have been observed to enhance 3cdom induced transformation processes canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 kawaguchi 1993 remke et al 2021 llpo have estimated lifetimes of 100 μs and were found to be relevant for the transformation of electron rich i e readily oxidizable phenols phenylureas and anilines canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 it has been hypothesized that llpo precursors are phenolic moieties of dom buschmann et al 2005 remke et al 2021 moreover photochemically produced phenoxyl radicals were successfully used to mimic the enhancement effect ascribed to llpo remke et al 2022 remke et al 2021 for the assessment of cdom induced photochemistry probe compounds are commonly employed to identify and or quantify ppri rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 to measure 3cdom induced oxidations mostly 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was used as a probe compound berg et al 2019 bodhipaksha et al 2015 mcneill and canonica 2016 a further parameter used to describe the efficiency of tmp reactive 3cdom formation for a given dom is the quantum yield coefficient f tmp defined by eq 1 as the pseudo first order phototransformation rate constant of tmp k tmp obs s 1 divided by the rate of light absorption by cdom r cdom abs moles of photons per liter per second briefly m s 1 1 f tmp k tmp obs r cdom abs m 1 f tmp is proportional to and used as an indicator of the intersystem crossing quantum yield equivalent to the excited triplet formation quantum yield for tmp reactive 3cdom canonica et al 1995 previous studies involving chemical reduction of dom using sodium borohydride and utilizing tmp as a probe compound provided evidence that carbonyl moieties were the main precursors of 3cdom golanoski et al 2012 sharpless 2012 for the detection of llpo mainly 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop has been used as a probe compound canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 the quantification of the llpo effect was based on the determination of the pseudo first order rate constants for the phototransformation of dmop k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs at initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 or 5 0 μm respectively canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 two alternative methods for llpo quantification were used the first method considered the difference k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs to be the minimum contribution of llpo to k obs at initial dmop concentration 0 1 μm canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the second method considered the ratio k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs defined as enhancement factor to the minimum enhancement in k obs due to llpo with respect to k 5 0 obs representing the contribution of 3cdom to dmop phototransformation remke et al 2021 chemical oxidation of dom in particular using chlorination or ozonation leads to distinct changes in uv absorption spectra electron donating capacity edc and photochemical reactivity of dom leresche et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 wan et al 2021 wenk et al 2013a wenk et al 2015 changes in absorption spectra and edc of dom are associated to transformations of oxidant reactive moieties and linking these changes to photochemical reactivity changes may provide evidence for llpo precursors chlorination and two different types of ozonation in absence and presence of tert butanol t buoh have been used in several of the aforementioned studies and are also employed in the present investigations ozonation in the presence of t buoh is performed to prevent oxidation of dom through reactions with oh and obtain dom oxidation exclusively by direct ozone reactions in contrast ozonation in absence of t buoh is characterized by smaller ozone exposures at equal ozone doses and less selective modification of various types of dom moieties as a consequence of oh reactions remucal et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 table 1 illustrates the various types of oxidation process and how they affect dom properties note that in this study we focus on three parameters namely suva254 e2 e3 and the edc suva254 is an indicator for dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 while e2 e3 is inversely proportional to the dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 i e e2 e3 increases with decreasing molecular weight edc correlates with the phenolic content of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2016 phenolic moieties and hydroquinones are major reactants for oxidants gallard and von gunten 2002a önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013a moreover chlorination leads to the formation of e g chlorophenols gallard and von gunten 2002b while ozonation besides benzoquinone also leads to the formation of aliphatic ring opening products mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 this study tests the hypothesis that llpo precursors are phenolic dom moieties and evaluates the relationship between changes in photoreactivity and changes in characteristic dom parameters i e suva254 e2 e3 and edc in this study suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was employed as a model dom and changes in the aforementioned parameters of srfa upon oxidation with chlorine and ozone the latter performed in buffered aqueous solutions at ph 7 with or without t buoh were evaluated subsequently the oxidized srfa was inspected for changes in pseudo first order phototransformation rate constants of dmop initial concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm finally changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc were correlated to the changes in pseudo first order rate constants for the transformation of dmop photosensitized by pre oxidized srfa material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions the following chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop alfa aesar 98 na2hpo4 2h2o sigma aldrich merck 98 5 and nah2po4 h2o merck for analysis and the dom isolate suwannee river fulvic acid srfa type standard iii 3s101f international humic substances society ihss ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was obtained from an arium pro ultrapure water system sartorius ag goettingen germany stock solutions of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol 10 or 500 μm were prepared in ultrapure water phosphate buffer stock solutions 50 mm ph 7 76 and 100 mm ph 6 7 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving appropriate amounts of na2hpo4 2h2o and nah2po4 h2o srfa stock solutions 60 mgcl 1 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving an estimated target amount of the hygroscopic isolates the concentrations of these srfa stock solutions were defined by

csh shimadzu japan all solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 oxidation of srfa by chlorine and ozone srfa oxidation was performed by mixing oxidant solutions with buffered phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 srfa containing solutions 10 mgcl 1 specific oxidant doses of 0 0 25 moloxidant molc 1 were applied to achieve similar conditions as in a previous study wenk et al 2013a ozonation experiments were performed in the absence and presence of 5 mm t buoh as a scavenger for oh the reaction mixtures were mixed after addition of the oxidants the solutions were kept at room temperature for 12 h or 2 h for chlorination or ozonation respectively and afterwards stored at 4 c for a week uv absorbance and edc measurements as well as irradiation experiments were performed within 24 h for every batch of oxidized srfa the complete workflow is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 characterization of oxidized srfa before starting the bulk parameter measurements and irradiation experiments the dpd apha 2005 and indigo method hoigné and bader 1980 were employed to detect residual oxidants for the applied experimental procedure no residual oxidant was detected in any of the samples electron donating capacity edc the edc is an operationally defined parameter which quantifies the moles of electrons transferred from electron donating dom moieties to a chemical oxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2020 here edc measurements were performed according to the edc assay from a previous study walpen et al 2020 in brief this assay uses the radical cation 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts as a chemical dom oxidant and the electron transfer of dom to abts to obtain abts is measured by a reduction in absorbance at 728 nm ε 14 000 m 1 cm 1 ph 7 0 solutions were diluted to doc concentrations between 0 5 and 3 mgcl 1 to obtain reliable edc measurements walpen et al 2020 absorbance measurements absorbance measurements were performed on an agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer in the double beam mode spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 250 500 nm and the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva254 units l mgc 1 m 1 was obtained by dividing the 254 nm absorbance by the cell path length and the concentration of non oxidized srfa in terms of mg of carbon thereby it was assumed that the carbon content of srfa was not significantly affected by pre oxidation wenk et al 2013a the e2 e3 was calculated as the ratio of the dom absorbances at λ 254 nm and λ 365 nm 2 4 steady state irradiation experiments steady state irradiations were performed in a merry go round photoreactor with the established conditions for the observation of dmop phototransformation induced by ppri with differing lifetimes according to previous publications canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 in brief 16 ml of aqueous solution containing 2 5 mgcl 1 srfa untreated or oxidized 0 1 or 5 0 μm dmop and 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 0 were irradiated in glass stoppered quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter seven 360 μl samples were taken in equidistant time intervals for 0 1 µm every 30 s for 5 0 µm every 2 min a medium pressure mercury lamp heraeus noble light model tq718 operated at 500 w served as a light source positioned in a borosilicate cooling jacket with a filter solution 0 15 m sodium nitrate solution recirculated at 25 c resulting in a cut off filter absorbing light with λ 320 nm dark experiments were performed for every srfa batch with initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 or 5 0 μm the photon fluence rate in the relevant wavelength range of 334 436 nm e p 334 436 nm was measured weekly using the para nitroanisol pyridine actinometer and determined to be 5 0 0 3 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 details of the calculations are provided in the supporting information si text s1 2 5 analytical instrumentation concentrations of dmop were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc utilizing an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a photodiode array detector and a fluorescence detector agilent 1200 series the photodiode array detector was used to analyze samples from solutions with an initial dmop concentration of 5 0 μm detection wavelength of 220 nm whereas for samples for an initial dmop concentration of 0 1 μm the fluorescence detector was preferred as it reaches higher sensitivity excitation emission wavelength 230 325 nm typically duplicate injections of 50 μl samples were performed a reverse phase c18 column cosmosil 5c18 ms ii packed column pore size 120 å particle size 5 µm internal diameter 3 0 mm length 100 mm with a column oven temperature of 25 c was used using an isocratic method with an eluent consisting of 75 10 mm aqueous phosphoric acid ph 2 1 and 25 acetonitrile and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 dmop eluted with a retention time of 2 6 min standard deviations of duplicate measurements were typically 5 the ph of the oxidized dom solutions and of the sample solution prior and after the irradiation experiments were measured using a ph meter metrohm model 605 equipped with a metrohm ph electrode model 6 02341 110 generally a small ph decrease 0 1 ph units was observed during the irradiation experiments 2 6 kinetics of dom induced phototransformations pseudo first order rate constants for the phototransformation of dmop were determined as the slope of linear regression lines for the natural logarithmic concentration values ln dmop as a function of the irradiation time the rate constants were denoted as k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs for initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm respectively no correction of the dom light screening effect was applied since for the employed srfa concentration 2 5 mgcl 1 such corrections 5 remke et al 2021 are smaller than the experimental error in k obs the absorption properties of cdom change as a consequence of oxidative treatment which makes it important to analyze the efficiency of dmop phototransformation in terms of absorbed photons to this end the rate constants k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs were scaled to r cdom abs the rate of light absorption by cdom and the corresponding ratios k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs were obtained r cdom abs was calculated based on the photon fluence rate determined by chemical actinometry and the decadic absorption coefficient of the considered cdom solutions for calculation details see si text s2 by analogy to eq 1 k 5 0 obs r cdom abs corresponds approximately to f dmop the quantum yield coefficient for dmop transforming 3cdom the underlying assumption is that at the initial dmop concentration of 5 μm the phototransformation of dmop is almost exclusively due to reaction with 3cdom by contrast for k 0 1 obs r cdom abs there is no straightforward relationship to the formation quantum yield of llpo since the llpo lifetime is not well defined and depends on the dmop concentration k 0 1 obs r cdom abs is proposed to be positively correlated to llpo formation efficiency and to llpo lifetime as a measure to represent the dmop transformation kinetics for low compared to high initial concentrations the enhancement factor ef was calculated as the ratio k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs in analogy to a previous study remke et al 2021 results and discussion 3 1 changes in srfa bulk parameters results of changes in uv absorbance parameters suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of increasing specific oxidant doses are shown in fig 2 linear correlations were obtained for the changes in srfa of suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of the specific oxidant doses in accordance with previous studies as indicated in table 1 leresche et al 2021 remucal et al 2020 wan et al 2021 wenk et al 2013a the parameters of the linear regressions are provided in table s5 si and plotted data is in tables s6 s8 suva254 decreases with increasing specific oxidant dose with a somewhat more pronounced decrease for ozonated samples with without t buoh than for chlorinated samples fig 2a spectra are in si fig s1 e2 e3 increases with increasing specific chlorine and ozone with t buoh doses attributed to a decrease in molecular weight fig 2b such changes in e2 e3 can be attributed on the one hand to reactions of chlorine or ozone with e g activated aromatic compounds leading to ring opening and fragmentation and finally yielding lower molecular weight compounds gallard and von gunten 2002b jiang et al 2020 ramseier and von gunten 2009 and on the other hand to oxidation of conjugated systems remucal et al 2020 for ozonation in the absence of t buoh e2 e3 remains fairly stable indicating small changes in molecular weight and conjugated systems this is expected from a higher contribution of oh which leads to smaller changes in the structure of dom due to a lower selectivity of this oxidant remucal et al 2020 fig 2c shows relative edc changes versus applied oxidant dose with the strongest edc decrease for chlorination followed by ozonation with t buoh and ozonation without t buoh the slopes of the linear regressions were units molc moloxidant 1 6 7 0 8 for chlorination 3 3 0 5 for ozonation with t buoh and 2 3 0 3 for ozonation without t buoh this is in agreement with previous studies in which it has been suggested that chlorination leads to chlorinated phenols which likely exert a smaller electron donating capacity than phenols önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013a and table 1 for direct ozone reactions an oxidation of phenolic moieties also leads to abatement of edc whereas in absence of t buoh a smaller ozone exposure and involvement of oh renders this process less efficient wenk et al 2013b 3 2 dmop phototransformation in aqueous solutions of oxidized srfa fig 3 shows the trends in k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs with increasing specific chlorine or ozone doses without and with t buoh and the corresponding data is provided in si tables s9 s11 in untreated srfa k 0 1 obs was more than tenfold of k 5 0 obs and this enhancement was ascribed to the contribution of long lived photooxidants llpo in k 0 1 obs whereas 3cdom activity is assumed to be mainly responsible for k 5 0 obs remke et al 2021 trends in k 0 1 obs with increasing specific molar oxidant doses differ from the corresponding trends in k 5 0 obs for all of the applied oxidants for chlorinated srfa k 0 1 obs decreases moderately whereas k 5 0 obs stays constant over the range of applied hocl doses fig 3a ozonation in presence of t buoh leads to a strong decrease of k 0 1 obs whereas k 5 0 obs initially plateaus up to a specific ozone dose of 0 1 molo3 molc 1 and decreases for higher specific ozone doses to 50 of the initial value fig 3b for srfa ozonated without t buoh a non steady trend was observed for k 0 1 obs with an initial decrease followed by an increase with a local maximum at a specific ozone dose of 0 1 molo3 molc 1 and a further decrease fig 3c in contrast k 5 0 obs decreases continuously the particular non linear trend in k 0 1 obs was verified carefully to exclude an artefact and its implications will be discussed in more detail in the section on the enhancement factor for oxidized srfa these differences in trends between k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs corroborate the hypothesis of the involvement of different pools of srfa moieties in dmop phototransformation in general the photoactive functional groups contributing to k 0 1 obs seem to be more affected by oxidation than for k 5 0 obs trends in k 5 0 obs are in the expected range of changes for 3cdom induced compound phototransformation based on previous studies leresche et al 2019 the following section will compare the changes in dmop transformation kinetics with the changes in edc and uv absorbance 3 3 correlation of dmop phototransformation efficiency to changes in srfa properties in this sub section the photon absorption based photochemical reactivity changes of pre oxidized srfa k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs are considered in relation to specific oxidant doses and changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc fig 4 as shown in fig 4 k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases with increasing oxidant doses and the corresponding decrease in suva254 it decreases moderately for chlorinated srfa factor 2 and more strongly for ozonated srfa with and without t buoh factor 3 for a 20 reduction in suva254 compared to untreated srfa fig 4a b these decreasing trends indicate that a decrease in llpo formation efficiency and or lifetime is related to srfa moieties that contribute to suva254 i e aromatic moieties moreover k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases strongly with increasing e2 e3 for ozonated srfa with t buoh and moderately for chlorinated srfa fig 4c in contrast no clear trend of k 0 1 obs r cdom abs versus e2 e3 can be observed for ozonated srfa without t buoh fig 4c the trends for k 0 1 obs r cdom abs versus e2 e3 differ between the oxidation methods which suggests that llpo formation does not strongly depend on dom molecular weight and changes in conjugated systems k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases with decreasing edc for all three oxidation conditions fig 4d even though edc is less efficiently abated by ozone compared to chlorine fig 2c the effect of pre ozonation on k 0 1 obs r cdom abs is larger whereas ozone leads to e g benzoquinones chlorination leads to chlorophenols acero et al 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002a b tentscher et al 2018 which might still serve as llpo precursors analogous data for k 5 0 obs r cdom abs which reflects the quantum yield coefficient f dmop for 3cdom induced dmop transformation are shown in figs 4e h f dmop increases with the specific molar oxidant dose for the srfa treated by chlorination and ozonation with t buoh whereas f dmop decreases for the ozonated srfa in absence of t buoh fig 4e also f dmop increases with decreasing suva254 and edc for chlorination and ozonation with t buoh fig 4f h the observations of f dmop for chlorination and ozonation with t buoh are similar to the trends in 3cdom quantum yields which were observed in previous studies leresche et al 2019 leresche et al 2021 wan et al 2021 in those studies the increase in quantum yields with increasing oxidant dose and observed decrease in suva254 and edc was explained by the increase in 3cdom precursors such as quinones formed during dom oxidation önnby et al 2018 for ozonation of srfa without t buoh the presence of oh may lead to an abatement of 3cdom precursors with a smaller formation of quinone type moieties which are more typically formed during ozone and chlorine reactions criquet et al 2015 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 f dmop increases with increasing relative e2 e3 for all oxidation scenarios with an overall good linear fit determination coefficient 0 75 for f dmop with e2 e3 e2 e30 1 fig 4g for linear fit see fig s3 si also f tmp is often positively correlated with e2 e3 and this correlation is rationalized by higher 3cdom formation efficiencies by low molecular weight dom moieties compared to high molecular weight dom functional groups berg et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 o connor et al 2019 trubetskaya et al 2007 upon oxidation of srfa its photochemical activity changes whereby the trends in k 0 1 obs r cdom abs with increasing oxidant dose and the above discussed cdom bulk parameters figs 4a d differ from those in f dmop figs 4e h this observation is in line with the different nature of llpo and 3cdom confirming that these photooxidants are related to different moieties of dom 3 4 enhancement factor ef for oxidized srfa the ef was introduced in a previous study to assess the relative importance of llpo on target compound transformation by factoring out the impact of 3cdom remke et al 2021 for ef 1 llpo only play a minor role for the transformation and they do not need to be included in the modeling of degradation kinetics of aquatic organic contaminants the general tendency is that ef and therefore the importance of llpo compared to 3cdom decreases with increasing oxidant dose with a stronger decrease for ozonation with without t buoh compared to chlorination fig 5 a however the ef in ozonated samples without oh scavenging without t buoh shows a second maximum at a specific oxidant dose of 0 1 mol o3 mol c fig 5a with a continuous decrease in suva254 and edc fig 5b c the behavior is not observed in the presence of an oh scavenger indicating an interplay of formation and abatement reactions with oh such reactions with benzene structures within dom might lead to deactivated phenols e g methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate which act as llpo thus lead to an enhancement but are expected to exhibit comparatively weak edc values interestingly in the range of oxidant doses employed in this study ef is significantly larger than unity meaning that llpo should be considered in modeling the degradation of contaminants that are comparably susceptible to llpo as dmop llpo precursors are suggested to be phenolic moieties which are more reactive with the selected oxidants than the 3cdom precursors which likely contain aromatic ketone moieties canonica and freiburghaus 2001 mcneill and canonica 2016 at ph 7 the apparent second order rate constant k obs ph7 for the reaction of ozone with phenol is 1 5 1 8 106 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 tentscher et al 2018 for benzophenone a model dom sensitizer mcneill and canonica 2016 k obs ph7 is expected to be similar to the structurally analogous ketoprofen with k 0 4 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for chlorine the reaction with benzophenone or other aromatic ketones is expected to be very low deborde and von gunten 2008 4 environmental implications the aim of this study was to test the photoreactivity of pre oxidized srfa with different initial concentrations of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop employed as a probe compound and to evaluate the hypothesis that long lived photooxidants llpo consist of phenoxyl radicals to test this srfa was oxidized by chlorination and ozonation with without t buoh and dmop transformation was measured in aqueous solution of the pre oxidized srfa with two initial concentrations namely 0 1 and 5 0 μm table 2 summarizes the observed trends in dom absorbance edc and dom induced phototransformation kinetics for increasing specific oxidant doses suva254 edc and normalized k 0 1 obs decreased with increasing chlorine and ozone doses e2 e3 and normalized k 5 0 obs increased with increasing chlorine and ozone doses with t buoh and stagnated or slightly decreased with increasing ozone doses without t buoh these opposite trends in normalized k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs support the hypothesis of two different pools of photooxidants formed upon light absorption of dom thereby the precursors of the pool of long lived photooxidants are affected by changes in dom aromaticity and phenol content but unaffected by changes in molecular weight or in conjugated systems in contrast precursors of the short lived 3cdom are affected by changes in dom molecular weight 5 conclusions in this study the fate of long lived photooxidants was tested by oxidative treatment of phenolic dom moieties the photochemical reactivity of gradually oxidized srfa was evaluated and compared to changes in suva254 e2 e3 ratios and edc dmop was employed as probe compound at initial concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm the transformation kinetics for an initial concentration of 0 1 μm was used as an indicator for the llpo formation rate transformations at initial dmop concentrations of 5 0 μm were used as an indicator for 3cdom quantum yields the main outcomes of this study are for the pre oxidations of srfa with chlorine or ozone close to linear correlations were observed for the changes of suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of the oxidant doses in line with previous studies this relationship is a result of the reactions of chlorine and ozone with the oxidant susceptible moieties in dom such as phenols for low initial dmop concentrations the pseudo first order transformation rate constant normalized for the changes in srfa absorbance decreased significantly for chlorinated and ozonated with without t buoh srfa whereas for high initial dmop concentrations transformations were slightly enhanced for chlorinated and ozonated with t buoh and constant for ozonated srfa without t buoh this contrasting observation corroborates the hypothesis of the formation of two distinct pools of photooxidants differing in their lifetime and precursor moieties for low initial dmop concentrations decreasing relative suva254 and edc correlate with a decrease in pseudo first order transformation rate constants this hints to the involvement of phenolic moieties as photooxidant precursors there was no clear trend for e2 e3 for the three pre oxidation processes therefore it can be hypothesized that llpo formation is independent of the molecular weight and conjugated systems for the higher initial dmop concentrations the quantum yield coefficient f dmop correlates with the relative changes in e2 e3 this is consistent with previous studies and can be interpreted as an increased 3cdom formation from low molecular weight dom the enhancement factor reflecting the impact of llpo compared to 3cdom on contaminant transformation decreases with increasing oxidant doses and therefore decreasing suva254 and edc thus llpo precursors are more susceptible to oxidation than 3cdom precursors supporting the hypothesis that llpo consist of phenoxyl radicals having dom phenolic moieties as their precursors funding this study was supported by the swiss national science foundation project no 200021 169422

14768,recent studies suggested that long lived photooxidants llpo which are reactive intermediates formed during irradiation of dissolved organic matter dom may consist of phenoxyl radicals derived from phenolic moieties of the dom besides the well studied excited triplet states of chromophoric dom 3cdom llpo presumably are important photooxidants for the transformation of electron rich contaminants in surface waters the main objective of this study was to further test the potential role of phenoxyl radical as llpo suwannee river fulvic acid srfa as a model dom was pre oxidised using the phenol reactive oxidants chlorine and ozone followed by its characterization by the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva254 the ratio of absorbance at λ 254 nm and λ 365 nm e2 e3 and the electron donating capacity edc subsequently the photoreactivity of pre oxidized srfa was tested using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop as a llpo probe compound at two initial concentrations dmop 0 0 1 and 5 0 μm linear inter correlations were observed for the relative changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc for increasing oxidant doses pseudo first order transformation rate constants normalized to the changing srfa absorption rate i e k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs for 0 1 and 5 0 µm respectively exhibited the following distinct trends the llpo dominated k 0 1 obs r cdom abs ratio decreased with increasing oxidant dose and with decreasing suva254 and edc while the 3cdom dominated k 5 0 obs r cdom abs ratio positively correlated with e2 e3 finally it was concluded that precursors of 3cdom and llpo are chemically modified differently by pre oxidation of dom and llpo precursors likely consist of phenolic moieties of dom suggesting phenoxyl radicals as llpo graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter ozonation chlorination long lived photooxidants 3cdom 3 4 dimethoxyphenol data availability data will be made available on request introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in surface waters and describes a complex mixture of organic compounds produced by biogeochemical processes leenheer and croué 2003 dom spans a broad range of molecular weight typically between 100 100 000 da and is composed of aliphatic and hydrocarbon structures with various functional moieties including amides carbonyls and phenols derrien et al 2019 the chromophoric part of dom cdom is able to absorb light and consequently to form photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri which may induce the transformation of micropollutants guo et al 2022 richard and canonica 2005 vione et al 2014 cdom produced ppri include short lived photooxidants such as the pool of excited triplet states of the cdom 3cdom mcneill and canonica 2016 furthermore long lived photooxidants llpo form upon cdom light absorption and have been observed to enhance 3cdom induced transformation processes canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 kawaguchi 1993 remke et al 2021 llpo have estimated lifetimes of 100 μs and were found to be relevant for the transformation of electron rich i e readily oxidizable phenols phenylureas and anilines canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 it has been hypothesized that llpo precursors are phenolic moieties of dom buschmann et al 2005 remke et al 2021 moreover photochemically produced phenoxyl radicals were successfully used to mimic the enhancement effect ascribed to llpo remke et al 2022 remke et al 2021 for the assessment of cdom induced photochemistry probe compounds are commonly employed to identify and or quantify ppri rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 to measure 3cdom induced oxidations mostly 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was used as a probe compound berg et al 2019 bodhipaksha et al 2015 mcneill and canonica 2016 a further parameter used to describe the efficiency of tmp reactive 3cdom formation for a given dom is the quantum yield coefficient f tmp defined by eq 1 as the pseudo first order phototransformation rate constant of tmp k tmp obs s 1 divided by the rate of light absorption by cdom r cdom abs moles of photons per liter per second briefly m s 1 1 f tmp k tmp obs r cdom abs m 1 f tmp is proportional to and used as an indicator of the intersystem crossing quantum yield equivalent to the excited triplet formation quantum yield for tmp reactive 3cdom canonica et al 1995 previous studies involving chemical reduction of dom using sodium borohydride and utilizing tmp as a probe compound provided evidence that carbonyl moieties were the main precursors of 3cdom golanoski et al 2012 sharpless 2012 for the detection of llpo mainly 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop has been used as a probe compound canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 the quantification of the llpo effect was based on the determination of the pseudo first order rate constants for the phototransformation of dmop k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs at initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 or 5 0 μm respectively canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 two alternative methods for llpo quantification were used the first method considered the difference k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs to be the minimum contribution of llpo to k obs at initial dmop concentration 0 1 μm canonica and freiburghaus 2001 the second method considered the ratio k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs defined as enhancement factor to the minimum enhancement in k obs due to llpo with respect to k 5 0 obs representing the contribution of 3cdom to dmop phototransformation remke et al 2021 chemical oxidation of dom in particular using chlorination or ozonation leads to distinct changes in uv absorption spectra electron donating capacity edc and photochemical reactivity of dom leresche et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 remucal et al 2020 wan et al 2021 wenk et al 2013a wenk et al 2015 changes in absorption spectra and edc of dom are associated to transformations of oxidant reactive moieties and linking these changes to photochemical reactivity changes may provide evidence for llpo precursors chlorination and two different types of ozonation in absence and presence of tert butanol t buoh have been used in several of the aforementioned studies and are also employed in the present investigations ozonation in the presence of t buoh is performed to prevent oxidation of dom through reactions with oh and obtain dom oxidation exclusively by direct ozone reactions in contrast ozonation in absence of t buoh is characterized by smaller ozone exposures at equal ozone doses and less selective modification of various types of dom moieties as a consequence of oh reactions remucal et al 2020 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 table 1 illustrates the various types of oxidation process and how they affect dom properties note that in this study we focus on three parameters namely suva254 e2 e3 and the edc suva254 is an indicator for dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 while e2 e3 is inversely proportional to the dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 i e e2 e3 increases with decreasing molecular weight edc correlates with the phenolic content of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2016 phenolic moieties and hydroquinones are major reactants for oxidants gallard and von gunten 2002a önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013a moreover chlorination leads to the formation of e g chlorophenols gallard and von gunten 2002b while ozonation besides benzoquinone also leads to the formation of aliphatic ring opening products mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 this study tests the hypothesis that llpo precursors are phenolic dom moieties and evaluates the relationship between changes in photoreactivity and changes in characteristic dom parameters i e suva254 e2 e3 and edc in this study suwannee river fulvic acid srfa was employed as a model dom and changes in the aforementioned parameters of srfa upon oxidation with chlorine and ozone the latter performed in buffered aqueous solutions at ph 7 with or without t buoh were evaluated subsequently the oxidized srfa was inspected for changes in pseudo first order phototransformation rate constants of dmop initial concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm finally changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc were correlated to the changes in pseudo first order rate constants for the transformation of dmop photosensitized by pre oxidized srfa material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions the following chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop alfa aesar 98 na2hpo4 2h2o sigma aldrich merck 98 5 and nah2po4 h2o merck for analysis and the dom isolate suwannee river fulvic acid srfa type standard iii 3s101f international humic substances society ihss ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was obtained from an arium pro ultrapure water system sartorius ag goettingen germany stock solutions of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol 10 or 500 μm were prepared in ultrapure water phosphate buffer stock solutions 50 mm ph 7 76 and 100 mm ph 6 7 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving appropriate amounts of na2hpo4 2h2o and nah2po4 h2o srfa stock solutions 60 mgcl 1 were prepared in ultrapure water by dissolving an estimated target amount of the hygroscopic isolates the concentrations of these srfa stock solutions were defined by

csh shimadzu japan all solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 oxidation of srfa by chlorine and ozone srfa oxidation was performed by mixing oxidant solutions with buffered phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 srfa containing solutions 10 mgcl 1 specific oxidant doses of 0 0 25 moloxidant molc 1 were applied to achieve similar conditions as in a previous study wenk et al 2013a ozonation experiments were performed in the absence and presence of 5 mm t buoh as a scavenger for oh the reaction mixtures were mixed after addition of the oxidants the solutions were kept at room temperature for 12 h or 2 h for chlorination or ozonation respectively and afterwards stored at 4 c for a week uv absorbance and edc measurements as well as irradiation experiments were performed within 24 h for every batch of oxidized srfa the complete workflow is illustrated in fig 1 2 3 characterization of oxidized srfa before starting the bulk parameter measurements and irradiation experiments the dpd apha 2005 and indigo method hoigné and bader 1980 were employed to detect residual oxidants for the applied experimental procedure no residual oxidant was detected in any of the samples electron donating capacity edc the edc is an operationally defined parameter which quantifies the moles of electrons transferred from electron donating dom moieties to a chemical oxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2020 here edc measurements were performed according to the edc assay from a previous study walpen et al 2020 in brief this assay uses the radical cation 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts as a chemical dom oxidant and the electron transfer of dom to abts to obtain abts is measured by a reduction in absorbance at 728 nm ε 14 000 m 1 cm 1 ph 7 0 solutions were diluted to doc concentrations between 0 5 and 3 mgcl 1 to obtain reliable edc measurements walpen et al 2020 absorbance measurements absorbance measurements were performed on an agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer in the double beam mode spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 250 500 nm and the specific uv absorption at 254 nm suva254 units l mgc 1 m 1 was obtained by dividing the 254 nm absorbance by the cell path length and the concentration of non oxidized srfa in terms of mg of carbon thereby it was assumed that the carbon content of srfa was not significantly affected by pre oxidation wenk et al 2013a the e2 e3 was calculated as the ratio of the dom absorbances at λ 254 nm and λ 365 nm 2 4 steady state irradiation experiments steady state irradiations were performed in a merry go round photoreactor with the established conditions for the observation of dmop phototransformation induced by ppri with differing lifetimes according to previous publications canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 in brief 16 ml of aqueous solution containing 2 5 mgcl 1 srfa untreated or oxidized 0 1 or 5 0 μm dmop and 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 0 were irradiated in glass stoppered quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter seven 360 μl samples were taken in equidistant time intervals for 0 1 µm every 30 s for 5 0 µm every 2 min a medium pressure mercury lamp heraeus noble light model tq718 operated at 500 w served as a light source positioned in a borosilicate cooling jacket with a filter solution 0 15 m sodium nitrate solution recirculated at 25 c resulting in a cut off filter absorbing light with λ 320 nm dark experiments were performed for every srfa batch with initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 or 5 0 μm the photon fluence rate in the relevant wavelength range of 334 436 nm e p 334 436 nm was measured weekly using the para nitroanisol pyridine actinometer and determined to be 5 0 0 3 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 details of the calculations are provided in the supporting information si text s1 2 5 analytical instrumentation concentrations of dmop were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc utilizing an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a photodiode array detector and a fluorescence detector agilent 1200 series the photodiode array detector was used to analyze samples from solutions with an initial dmop concentration of 5 0 μm detection wavelength of 220 nm whereas for samples for an initial dmop concentration of 0 1 μm the fluorescence detector was preferred as it reaches higher sensitivity excitation emission wavelength 230 325 nm typically duplicate injections of 50 μl samples were performed a reverse phase c18 column cosmosil 5c18 ms ii packed column pore size 120 å particle size 5 µm internal diameter 3 0 mm length 100 mm with a column oven temperature of 25 c was used using an isocratic method with an eluent consisting of 75 10 mm aqueous phosphoric acid ph 2 1 and 25 acetonitrile and a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 dmop eluted with a retention time of 2 6 min standard deviations of duplicate measurements were typically 5 the ph of the oxidized dom solutions and of the sample solution prior and after the irradiation experiments were measured using a ph meter metrohm model 605 equipped with a metrohm ph electrode model 6 02341 110 generally a small ph decrease 0 1 ph units was observed during the irradiation experiments 2 6 kinetics of dom induced phototransformations pseudo first order rate constants for the phototransformation of dmop were determined as the slope of linear regression lines for the natural logarithmic concentration values ln dmop as a function of the irradiation time the rate constants were denoted as k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs for initial dmop concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm respectively no correction of the dom light screening effect was applied since for the employed srfa concentration 2 5 mgcl 1 such corrections 5 remke et al 2021 are smaller than the experimental error in k obs the absorption properties of cdom change as a consequence of oxidative treatment which makes it important to analyze the efficiency of dmop phototransformation in terms of absorbed photons to this end the rate constants k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs were scaled to r cdom abs the rate of light absorption by cdom and the corresponding ratios k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs were obtained r cdom abs was calculated based on the photon fluence rate determined by chemical actinometry and the decadic absorption coefficient of the considered cdom solutions for calculation details see si text s2 by analogy to eq 1 k 5 0 obs r cdom abs corresponds approximately to f dmop the quantum yield coefficient for dmop transforming 3cdom the underlying assumption is that at the initial dmop concentration of 5 μm the phototransformation of dmop is almost exclusively due to reaction with 3cdom by contrast for k 0 1 obs r cdom abs there is no straightforward relationship to the formation quantum yield of llpo since the llpo lifetime is not well defined and depends on the dmop concentration k 0 1 obs r cdom abs is proposed to be positively correlated to llpo formation efficiency and to llpo lifetime as a measure to represent the dmop transformation kinetics for low compared to high initial concentrations the enhancement factor ef was calculated as the ratio k 0 1 obs k 5 0 obs in analogy to a previous study remke et al 2021 results and discussion 3 1 changes in srfa bulk parameters results of changes in uv absorbance parameters suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of increasing specific oxidant doses are shown in fig 2 linear correlations were obtained for the changes in srfa of suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of the specific oxidant doses in accordance with previous studies as indicated in table 1 leresche et al 2021 remucal et al 2020 wan et al 2021 wenk et al 2013a the parameters of the linear regressions are provided in table s5 si and plotted data is in tables s6 s8 suva254 decreases with increasing specific oxidant dose with a somewhat more pronounced decrease for ozonated samples with without t buoh than for chlorinated samples fig 2a spectra are in si fig s1 e2 e3 increases with increasing specific chlorine and ozone with t buoh doses attributed to a decrease in molecular weight fig 2b such changes in e2 e3 can be attributed on the one hand to reactions of chlorine or ozone with e g activated aromatic compounds leading to ring opening and fragmentation and finally yielding lower molecular weight compounds gallard and von gunten 2002b jiang et al 2020 ramseier and von gunten 2009 and on the other hand to oxidation of conjugated systems remucal et al 2020 for ozonation in the absence of t buoh e2 e3 remains fairly stable indicating small changes in molecular weight and conjugated systems this is expected from a higher contribution of oh which leads to smaller changes in the structure of dom due to a lower selectivity of this oxidant remucal et al 2020 fig 2c shows relative edc changes versus applied oxidant dose with the strongest edc decrease for chlorination followed by ozonation with t buoh and ozonation without t buoh the slopes of the linear regressions were units molc moloxidant 1 6 7 0 8 for chlorination 3 3 0 5 for ozonation with t buoh and 2 3 0 3 for ozonation without t buoh this is in agreement with previous studies in which it has been suggested that chlorination leads to chlorinated phenols which likely exert a smaller electron donating capacity than phenols önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013a and table 1 for direct ozone reactions an oxidation of phenolic moieties also leads to abatement of edc whereas in absence of t buoh a smaller ozone exposure and involvement of oh renders this process less efficient wenk et al 2013b 3 2 dmop phototransformation in aqueous solutions of oxidized srfa fig 3 shows the trends in k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs with increasing specific chlorine or ozone doses without and with t buoh and the corresponding data is provided in si tables s9 s11 in untreated srfa k 0 1 obs was more than tenfold of k 5 0 obs and this enhancement was ascribed to the contribution of long lived photooxidants llpo in k 0 1 obs whereas 3cdom activity is assumed to be mainly responsible for k 5 0 obs remke et al 2021 trends in k 0 1 obs with increasing specific molar oxidant doses differ from the corresponding trends in k 5 0 obs for all of the applied oxidants for chlorinated srfa k 0 1 obs decreases moderately whereas k 5 0 obs stays constant over the range of applied hocl doses fig 3a ozonation in presence of t buoh leads to a strong decrease of k 0 1 obs whereas k 5 0 obs initially plateaus up to a specific ozone dose of 0 1 molo3 molc 1 and decreases for higher specific ozone doses to 50 of the initial value fig 3b for srfa ozonated without t buoh a non steady trend was observed for k 0 1 obs with an initial decrease followed by an increase with a local maximum at a specific ozone dose of 0 1 molo3 molc 1 and a further decrease fig 3c in contrast k 5 0 obs decreases continuously the particular non linear trend in k 0 1 obs was verified carefully to exclude an artefact and its implications will be discussed in more detail in the section on the enhancement factor for oxidized srfa these differences in trends between k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs corroborate the hypothesis of the involvement of different pools of srfa moieties in dmop phototransformation in general the photoactive functional groups contributing to k 0 1 obs seem to be more affected by oxidation than for k 5 0 obs trends in k 5 0 obs are in the expected range of changes for 3cdom induced compound phototransformation based on previous studies leresche et al 2019 the following section will compare the changes in dmop transformation kinetics with the changes in edc and uv absorbance 3 3 correlation of dmop phototransformation efficiency to changes in srfa properties in this sub section the photon absorption based photochemical reactivity changes of pre oxidized srfa k 0 1 obs r cdom abs and k 5 0 obs r cdom abs are considered in relation to specific oxidant doses and changes in suva254 e2 e3 and edc fig 4 as shown in fig 4 k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases with increasing oxidant doses and the corresponding decrease in suva254 it decreases moderately for chlorinated srfa factor 2 and more strongly for ozonated srfa with and without t buoh factor 3 for a 20 reduction in suva254 compared to untreated srfa fig 4a b these decreasing trends indicate that a decrease in llpo formation efficiency and or lifetime is related to srfa moieties that contribute to suva254 i e aromatic moieties moreover k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases strongly with increasing e2 e3 for ozonated srfa with t buoh and moderately for chlorinated srfa fig 4c in contrast no clear trend of k 0 1 obs r cdom abs versus e2 e3 can be observed for ozonated srfa without t buoh fig 4c the trends for k 0 1 obs r cdom abs versus e2 e3 differ between the oxidation methods which suggests that llpo formation does not strongly depend on dom molecular weight and changes in conjugated systems k 0 1 obs r cdom abs decreases with decreasing edc for all three oxidation conditions fig 4d even though edc is less efficiently abated by ozone compared to chlorine fig 2c the effect of pre ozonation on k 0 1 obs r cdom abs is larger whereas ozone leads to e g benzoquinones chlorination leads to chlorophenols acero et al 2005 gallard and von gunten 2002a b tentscher et al 2018 which might still serve as llpo precursors analogous data for k 5 0 obs r cdom abs which reflects the quantum yield coefficient f dmop for 3cdom induced dmop transformation are shown in figs 4e h f dmop increases with the specific molar oxidant dose for the srfa treated by chlorination and ozonation with t buoh whereas f dmop decreases for the ozonated srfa in absence of t buoh fig 4e also f dmop increases with decreasing suva254 and edc for chlorination and ozonation with t buoh fig 4f h the observations of f dmop for chlorination and ozonation with t buoh are similar to the trends in 3cdom quantum yields which were observed in previous studies leresche et al 2019 leresche et al 2021 wan et al 2021 in those studies the increase in quantum yields with increasing oxidant dose and observed decrease in suva254 and edc was explained by the increase in 3cdom precursors such as quinones formed during dom oxidation önnby et al 2018 for ozonation of srfa without t buoh the presence of oh may lead to an abatement of 3cdom precursors with a smaller formation of quinone type moieties which are more typically formed during ozone and chlorine reactions criquet et al 2015 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 f dmop increases with increasing relative e2 e3 for all oxidation scenarios with an overall good linear fit determination coefficient 0 75 for f dmop with e2 e3 e2 e30 1 fig 4g for linear fit see fig s3 si also f tmp is often positively correlated with e2 e3 and this correlation is rationalized by higher 3cdom formation efficiencies by low molecular weight dom moieties compared to high molecular weight dom functional groups berg et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 o connor et al 2019 trubetskaya et al 2007 upon oxidation of srfa its photochemical activity changes whereby the trends in k 0 1 obs r cdom abs with increasing oxidant dose and the above discussed cdom bulk parameters figs 4a d differ from those in f dmop figs 4e h this observation is in line with the different nature of llpo and 3cdom confirming that these photooxidants are related to different moieties of dom 3 4 enhancement factor ef for oxidized srfa the ef was introduced in a previous study to assess the relative importance of llpo on target compound transformation by factoring out the impact of 3cdom remke et al 2021 for ef 1 llpo only play a minor role for the transformation and they do not need to be included in the modeling of degradation kinetics of aquatic organic contaminants the general tendency is that ef and therefore the importance of llpo compared to 3cdom decreases with increasing oxidant dose with a stronger decrease for ozonation with without t buoh compared to chlorination fig 5 a however the ef in ozonated samples without oh scavenging without t buoh shows a second maximum at a specific oxidant dose of 0 1 mol o3 mol c fig 5a with a continuous decrease in suva254 and edc fig 5b c the behavior is not observed in the presence of an oh scavenger indicating an interplay of formation and abatement reactions with oh such reactions with benzene structures within dom might lead to deactivated phenols e g methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate which act as llpo thus lead to an enhancement but are expected to exhibit comparatively weak edc values interestingly in the range of oxidant doses employed in this study ef is significantly larger than unity meaning that llpo should be considered in modeling the degradation of contaminants that are comparably susceptible to llpo as dmop llpo precursors are suggested to be phenolic moieties which are more reactive with the selected oxidants than the 3cdom precursors which likely contain aromatic ketone moieties canonica and freiburghaus 2001 mcneill and canonica 2016 at ph 7 the apparent second order rate constant k obs ph7 for the reaction of ozone with phenol is 1 5 1 8 106 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 tentscher et al 2018 for benzophenone a model dom sensitizer mcneill and canonica 2016 k obs ph7 is expected to be similar to the structurally analogous ketoprofen with k 0 4 m 1s 1 real et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for chlorine the reaction with benzophenone or other aromatic ketones is expected to be very low deborde and von gunten 2008 4 environmental implications the aim of this study was to test the photoreactivity of pre oxidized srfa with different initial concentrations of 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop employed as a probe compound and to evaluate the hypothesis that long lived photooxidants llpo consist of phenoxyl radicals to test this srfa was oxidized by chlorination and ozonation with without t buoh and dmop transformation was measured in aqueous solution of the pre oxidized srfa with two initial concentrations namely 0 1 and 5 0 μm table 2 summarizes the observed trends in dom absorbance edc and dom induced phototransformation kinetics for increasing specific oxidant doses suva254 edc and normalized k 0 1 obs decreased with increasing chlorine and ozone doses e2 e3 and normalized k 5 0 obs increased with increasing chlorine and ozone doses with t buoh and stagnated or slightly decreased with increasing ozone doses without t buoh these opposite trends in normalized k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs support the hypothesis of two different pools of photooxidants formed upon light absorption of dom thereby the precursors of the pool of long lived photooxidants are affected by changes in dom aromaticity and phenol content but unaffected by changes in molecular weight or in conjugated systems in contrast precursors of the short lived 3cdom are affected by changes in dom molecular weight 5 conclusions in this study the fate of long lived photooxidants was tested by oxidative treatment of phenolic dom moieties the photochemical reactivity of gradually oxidized srfa was evaluated and compared to changes in suva254 e2 e3 ratios and edc dmop was employed as probe compound at initial concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm the transformation kinetics for an initial concentration of 0 1 μm was used as an indicator for the llpo formation rate transformations at initial dmop concentrations of 5 0 μm were used as an indicator for 3cdom quantum yields the main outcomes of this study are for the pre oxidations of srfa with chlorine or ozone close to linear correlations were observed for the changes of suva254 e2 e3 and edc as a function of the oxidant doses in line with previous studies this relationship is a result of the reactions of chlorine and ozone with the oxidant susceptible moieties in dom such as phenols for low initial dmop concentrations the pseudo first order transformation rate constant normalized for the changes in srfa absorbance decreased significantly for chlorinated and ozonated with without t buoh srfa whereas for high initial dmop concentrations transformations were slightly enhanced for chlorinated and ozonated with t buoh and constant for ozonated srfa without t buoh this contrasting observation corroborates the hypothesis of the formation of two distinct pools of photooxidants differing in their lifetime and precursor moieties for low initial dmop concentrations decreasing relative suva254 and edc correlate with a decrease in pseudo first order transformation rate constants this hints to the involvement of phenolic moieties as photooxidant precursors there was no clear trend for e2 e3 for the three pre oxidation processes therefore it can be hypothesized that llpo formation is independent of the molecular weight and conjugated systems for the higher initial dmop concentrations the quantum yield coefficient f dmop correlates with the relative changes in e2 e3 this is consistent with previous studies and can be interpreted as an increased 3cdom formation from low molecular weight dom the enhancement factor reflecting the impact of llpo compared to 3cdom on contaminant transformation decreases with increasing oxidant doses and therefore decreasing suva254 and edc thus llpo precursors are more susceptible to oxidation than 3cdom precursors supporting the hypothesis that llpo consist of phenoxyl radicals having dom phenolic moieties as their precursors funding this study was supported by the swiss national science foundation project no 200021 169422

14769,the management of sediment water interfaces especially bed stability is essential for controlling accumulated contaminants in the sediment in this study the relationship between sediment erosion and phosphorus p release under the remediation strategy of contaminated sediment backfilling csbt was explored through a flume experiment i e the dredged sediment was calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the dredged area for sediment capping thus avoiding the introduction of foreign materials via in situ remediation and the large scale land occupation associated with ex situ remediation acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and optical backscatter sensor obs were used to measure the vertical distributions of flow velocity and sediment concentration in the overlying water respectively and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was used to measure the p distribution in the sediment the results revealed that improving bed stability from csbt can considerably improve the robustness of sediment water interface and reduce sediment erosion by more than 70 the corresponding p release from the contaminated sediment could be inhibited with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 csbt is a potent strategy for managing contaminated sediment this study provides a theoretical reference for controlling sediment pollution further

for maintaining the ecology of rivers lakes and reservoirs hauer et al 2018 lai et al 2018 li et al 2019 samantha et al 2022 however it also accumulates pollutants because of its capacity to adsorb nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants apitz et al 2005 huang et al 2015a shaughnessy et al al 2019 xie et al 2015 the fate and transport of accumulated pollutants are controlled by hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics especially at the sediment water interface huang et al 2015b the accumulated pollutants may be released into the overlying water when physiochemical factors change chen et al 2014 jin et al 2019 kirtay et al 2018 ren et al 2019 yao et al 2009 potentially leading to algal blooms toxicity and black and malodourous conditions threatening the security of the aqueous environment and ecology and affecting the usage of water resources jarvie et al 2005 the release of pollutants from sediment under dynamic condition is much higher than that under static condition especially in shallow lakes dade 1993 inoue and nakamura 2011 sun et al 2006 wind waves and other external force disturbances are the dominant mechanisms resulting in sediment resuspension couceiro et al 2009 percuoco et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2010 and the release of adsorbed substances by sediment resuspension is 10 30 times that by static release wang et al 2011 studied the release of phosphorus p from sediments in the florida everglades and the results indicated that environmental alterations caused by disturbances such as high flow and dredging may pose the risk of p release furthermore huang et al 2021 proposed a unified expression of the sediment nutrient flux under different control modes diffusion sand wave motion and bed erosion to describe nutrient behaviours in the sediment layer and overlying water via theoretical analysis it is necessary to focus on sediment erosion and the resultant pollutant release for the management of contaminated sediments sediment remediation technologies have been put forward recently aiming to understand and solve the problem of sediment contamination fukue et al 2007 pourabadehei and mulligan 2016 in situ capping chemical and biological remediation aim to immobilize pollutants in the sediment peng et al 2009 reible et al 2003 2014 zhang et al 2019 while cannot reduce the amount of pollutants and may cause new pollution due to the introduction of foreign materials environmental dredging for ex situ remediation is currently the most common method for the remediation of seriously polluted sediments gustavson et al 2008 francingues et al 2008 rakowska et al 2012 for example dredging has removed most sediment pollutants and improved the water quality in trummen lake holdren et al 2001 and new bedford port bergen et al 2005 in america and in dianchi lake chaohu lake tai lake and west lake in china liu et al 2006 but dredging may lead to the pollutant exposure from deeper sediment and requires a large scale land to pile up the dredged sediment more than 56 million m3 of sediment in france 200 million m3 in western europe approximately 300 million m3 in the usa oh et al 2011 suedel et al 2008 and 500 million m3 in china are dredged annually moreover more emphasis has been placed on the research and development of remediation materials or strategies and systematic measures for enhancing bed stability and reducing pollutant release are still lacking coll et al 2016 gray et al 2006 song et al 2017 quantifying the influence of remediation strategies on bed stability is crucial for defining the specific parameters and optimal design of remediation plans contaminated sediment backfilling technology csbt is a remediation strategy of contaminated sediment which combines in situ and ex situ technologies as first proposed by fang et al 2019 the dredged sediment is calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the dredged area as a sediment cap which can avoid the potential pollution caused by foreign materials in situ and the large scale requirement for lands ex situ it is expected that csbt may effectively reduce the sediment flux through enhancing bed stability and clarifying sediment water interface in this study we used phosphorus p contaminated sediment as an example to explore the relationship between sediment erosion and p release under csbt by flume experiment and the impacts of different coverages on bed stability and p release were quantified with the aim of providing a theoretical reference for controlling sediment pollution further supporting river and lake ecological management and environmental restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 contaminated sediment backfilling technology the major processes of csbt technology is shown in fig 1 including environmental dredging dewatering detoxification stabilization of contaminants ceramsite calcination and ceramsite backfill as previously described the dredged sediment was calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the original dredged area as a sediment cap in this manner dredging could be limited to a relatively shallow surface sediment layer and the produced ceramsite can be used as a cap on the remaining contaminated sediment at depth which combines sediment dredging with in situ remediation of capping and avoids the introduction of foreign materials and large scale land occupation dredged sediment requires dehydration and harmless treatment before use akcil et al 2015 which can minimize the volume of materials to be treated and increase the treatment and utilisation efficiency of dredged sediment meanwhile the properties of ceramsite e g density and particle size can be adjusted by controlling the calcination temperature calcination time and adding materials to ensure the stability of the backfilled material 2 2 flume experiments scheme flume experiments are an effective method to incorporate micro scale mechanisms and macro scale phenomena to better understand the mobility of pollutants and improve sediment remediation technologies barlow et al 2004 huang et al 2015c ussher et al 2011 here flume experiments were conducted to explore the effects of ceramsite backfill as a cap on the remediation of p contaminated sediment under different coverages especially focusing on bed stability and sediment release flux 1 circulated flume setup the experiment was conducted using a circulated flume in the state key lab of hydro science and engineering at tsinghua university to estimate the effects of csbt on the remediation of p contaminated sediment the flume was 16 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m high as shown in fig 2 with the side walls and bottom consisting of plexiglass water was circulated within the flume using a pump system and the flow was regulated using a discharge control system water levels were measured using rulers installed on both sides of the flume along the longitudinal direction a pipe baffle was set at the upstream end of the channel to stop water turbulence 2 preparation of sediment samples and ceramsite the sediment samples used in the experiments were collected from the shanxi hejin section of the yellow river and the median particle size was 80 μm the organic matter content was small and the sediment was relatively clean hence it was washed with clean water many times and then air dried in the experimental preparation stage the experiments tended to explore the potential of csbt for p contaminated sediment remediation mainly from the aspects of bed stability and p release flux therefore sufficient potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was mixed with the sediment samples to achieve saturated p adsorption of about 0 3 0 4 mg g which was then used as a seriously polluted sediment sample for flume experiments the test area was set at x 10 11 m of flume to place the polluted sediment samples at a thickness of 10 cm see fig 2 and boulders of the same thickness were laid on the rest of the flume to ensure a flatbed surface the main components of dredged sediment include sio2 iron aluminium oxide alkali metal oxides and organic matter which are good raw materials for making ceramsite under the condition of no auxiliary materials or a small number of auxiliary materials ceramsite can be prepared using calcined and non calcined methods the non calcined method has low energy consumption low cost and high requirements for raw materials and the calcined ceramsite has a high density and strength therefore in this study it is recommended to use the calcination method to meet the backfilled ceramsite stability the dredged contaminated sediment with high water content was pre treated and placed into the pelletizer to produce ceramsite embryos that met the hydrodynamic conditions of the backfill area i e a ceramsite particle size of approximately 1 cm in this study keep the newly prepared ceramsite embryo at room temperature for approximately 24 h to prevent deformation and then baked in a high temperature environment with 1000 1300 c the calcination temperature and time were adjusted to control the ceramsite density about 1 5 g cm3 fig 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry eds images of the prepared ceramsite clearly the main component of ceramsite is sio2 and the main elements of lamellar substances on particle surfaces are aluminium silicon and oxygen the sediment particles were partially melted at high temperatures and large unmelted sediment particles were bonded together 3 experimental procedure four experimental conditions of ceramsite backfill were set to study the resultant bed stability and p release flux with coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 as shown in fig 4 where the images on the right correspond to the plan view a coverage rate of 20 and side view a coverage rate of 70 correspondingly four increasing flow levels were considered for each coverage rate i e q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 which were selected based on the incipient property of original sediment specifically q 1 q 2 and q 3 correspond to the flow conditions with bed shear stresses less than close to and greater than the critical value respectively and the corresponding sediment bed is in static condition critical incipient state and mobile condition q 4 corresponds to the flow condition with a significant suspension of sediment particles an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was placed in the middle of the test area i e x 10 5 m from the inlet to measure the vertical distribution of the flow velocity the vertical interval of adjacent points for adv measurement increased gradually with increasing distance from the bed i e the interval ranged from 1 to 3 mm when the distance was less than 0 2h h is the water depth and above which it ranged from 5 to 10 mm moreover optical backscatter sensors obs campbel us 1 and 2 were placed 5 5 m from the inlet and 1 m from the outlet respectively to monitor the variations in suspended sediment concentration ssc as shown in fig 2 b the sediment concentration was derived from the standard curve between the obs signals and sediment concentration as presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material specifically after placing the contaminated sediment samples in the test area running water was injected slowly into the flume without disturbing the riverbed the water pump electromagnetic flowmeter and discharge control system were turned on and the flow was adjusted to be as uniform as possible by adjusting the opening and closing angles of the tail gate under each flow level water samples were collected at two different depths i e 0 1h near the bed bottom water sample and 0 9h near the water surface surface water sample in the centreline of various cross sections of the flume i e x 9 10 10 25 10 5 10 75 11 and 12 m to measure the p release flux from the sediment i e soluble reactive p srp which can be directly utilized by aquatic organisms such as algae water samples collected at x 9 m were used to estimate the recirculation of p within the flume which was subtracted from the test section to eliminate the effects of recycling adv was used to measure the vertical distribution of flow velocity after which the flow was increased to the next flow level and the above operations were repeated the obs worked continuously to measure the sediment concentration during the whole experiment after the experiment with four flow levels we slowly reduced the flow and turned off the water pump diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were inserted into the sediment of the test area which was taken out two days later to measure the p profiles this experimental condition was denoted as a coverage rate of 0 the release of sediment pollutants generally comes from the surface layer of 1 3 cm pratihary et al 2014 wang and pant 2010 beutel and horne 2018 assessed sediment nutrient flux from profundal sediment at lake tahoe california nevada usa and concluded that surface sediment was a large reservoir of nutrients and dredging can remove most sediment pollutants and improve the water quality and ecology therefore the surface sediment of 1 cm thickness was further dredged in the test area and then the prepared ceramsite with a particle size of 1 cm was backfilled to the dredging area with coverage rates of 20 40 and 70 to explore the p release characteristics under these four flow levels the other operation steps were the same as those before the ceramsite backfilling i e the case with a coverage rate of 0 2 3 data analysis 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the flow characteristics were measured at the centreline of the test section to compare the changes before and after ceramsite backfilling including the time averaged velocity and turbulence intensity the time averaged velocity in the streamwise direction u is calculated as 1 u 1 n i 1 n u i and the turbulence intensity in the streamwise direction σ u is calculated as 2 σ u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 0 5 where u i is the instantaneous velocity in the streamwise direction n is the number of measurements meanwhile the vertical distribution of u conforms to the logarithmic law keulegan 1939 nezu et al 1993 song and chiew 2001 i e 3 u u 5 75 lg 30 2 z k s where u is the bed friction velocity z is the distance from the bed surface and k s is the bed surface roughness 2 bed stability the erosion rate per unit area was regarded as a measure of sediment stability to estimate the changes before and after ceramsite backfilling amos et al 1997 2003 2010 chen et al al 2017 2022 which is defined as 4 e t q t δ s s c t a where et is the erosion rate at time t s q t represents the flow discharge l s and δ s s c t is the corresponding difference in ssc as measured by the obs before and after the test section g l and a is the bed area of the test section i e 0 5 m2 furthermore the erosion depth was calculated from the erosion rate 5 δ z e t δ t ρ where δ z refers to the erosion depth mm e t δ t represents the amount of sediment erosion per unit area during time t t δ t and ρ is the bed sediment density 3 phosphorus release p release is proportional to the flow discharge as sediment particles are easier to suspend with a higher discharge resulting in a greater release of adsorbed p meanwhile p release is inversely proportional to the coverage rate of ceramsite as ceramsite backfilling increases bed stability and inhibits sediment p release thomas and schallenberg 2008 to quantitatively describe the p release characteristics the relationships between the dimensionless p concentration in the water samples i e divided by the p concentration on sediment particles c p c 0 and the flow discharge q and coverage rate r were explored where the exponential function was adopted 6 c p c 0 f q r a i e b i q r where c p refers to the p concentration in the water sample c 0 refers to the sediment p concentration i e about 0 64 mg l in this study ai and bi are the fitting parameters 3 results and discussions in this section the hydrodynamic characteristics corresponding to these four coverage rates of ceramsite were first analysed and then the potential of csbt for sediment remediation was discussed mainly considering bed stability and sediment p release 3 1 hydrodynamic characteristics based on the incipient property of the original sediment the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 under each coverage rate were set to 12 8 17 3 22 9 and 30 5 l s respectively table 1 in addition the water flow in the flume was regulated in the state of two dimensional constant and uniform flow as far as possible by adjusting the opening and closing angles of the tailgate under these four flow levels the water depth h in the test area was recorded which showed an increasing trend with an increase in q under these four coverage rates overall relatively similar hydrodynamic conditions were controlled for the cases before and after ceramsite backfilling to estimate the effects of ceramsite backfilling on bed stability and p release during the experiment fig 5 displays the dimensionless relationship between the vertical time averaged velocity u u and water depth z h where data points of different colours represent the measured values under different coverage rates and the dashed lines are the fitting curves as calculated by eq 3 it can be observed that the vertical distribution of time averaged velocity followed the logarithmic law well and was relatively similar under different flow levels meanwhile the bed surface resistance increased after ceramsite backfilling correspondingly u u increased near the bed and decreased near the water surface which resulted in a more even vertical distribution of u u the influence of csbt on the bed surface can be compared by comparing the distribution of turbulence intensity under the same or similar flow conditions nezu and rodi 1991 proposed an exponential formula for calculating the turbulence intensity in the streamwise direction σ u based on the experimental data i e 7 σ u d u e λ z where z z h and the parameters du and λ take different values corresponding to different bed roughness the measured turbulence intensity σ u under different experimental conditions are represented by symbols of different colours in fig 6 and the fitting curves of eq 7 are represented by coloured lines the turbulence intensity increased with an increase in q and the ceramsite backfilling increased the turbulence intensity near the bed under the same flow level except q 4 the turbulence intensity in smooth and rough fixed bed open channel flow gradually increased along the water depth and decayed near the bed owing to flow viscosity and wall fixation nezu 1979 which has also been observed in the case with a coverage rate of 0 see the blue symbols and lines in fig 6 and the bed is composed of fine sediment however the turbulence intensity exhibited an overall trend of gradually increasing from the water surface to the bed under coverage rates of 20 40 and 70 the turbulence intensity increased around the ceramsite therefore there was no attenuation near the bed after ceramsite backfilling 3 2 effects of ceramsite backfilling on bed stability bed stability is directly related to sediment resuspension and thus the release of pollutants which is an important physical basis for the control of internal pollution in natural waters the initial bed was set to be relatively smooth and flat and the bed gradually became rough because of hydrodynamic disturbances during the experiments fig 7 shows a comparison of the bed morphology of the test section before and after the experiment for the condition without ceramsite backfilling i e a coverage rate of 0 the bed sediment was eroded resulting in a rough bed morphology with increasing q fig 7 a b in contrast the bed surface was relatively stable and there was no obvious scouring phenomenon under coverage rates of 40 and 70 as shown in fig 7 d e in particular ceramsite was relatively dispersed at a coverage rate of 20 and the vortices near the bed developed due to ceramsite which generated a large shear stress between water layers and led to the phenomenon of sediment scouring around the ceramsite as shown in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the temporal evolution of erosion rate in the test section as estimated from eq 4 which can be regarded as a measure of sediment stability and different colours represent the values under different coverage rates the erosion rate et was negligible under the low flow condition q 1 indicating that sediment particles remained stationary for all four coverage rates the erosion rate first increased rapidly and then decreased when the flow discharge q increased at coverage rates of 20 and 40 i e similar to the condition of 0 coverage rate thus the coverage rates of 20 and 40 slightly affected the bed stability under medium and high flow conditions q 2 q 4 because there was enough space amongst the relatively dispersed ceramsites to fully develop the vortices near the bed surface tanino and nepf 2008 xu and nepf 2020 liu et al 2017 and fang et al 2017 concluded that the coarse particles were in an isolated state when the spacing was large i e free from the interference of surrounding particles and the vortex structure downstream was fully developed showing a tornado structure as shown in fig 9 a however the flow patterns amongst the particles were affected by each other when the particle spacing was reduced to a certain extent and the length of the downstream vortex structure decreased significantly correspondingly there was a significant inhibition of the start up of particles as shown in fig 9 b thus ceramsite backfilling significantly increased the bed stability under a coverage rate of 70 which was also reflected by the almost negligible erosion rate from q 2 to q 4 in fig 8 similarly the coloured points in fig 10 represent the time series of eroded depth eq 5 corresponding to the coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 no bed erosion occurred under the low flow condition q 1 and there was no significant difference amongst the erosion curves of these four coverage rates the bed morphology gradually appeared when the flow discharge increased under coverages of 0 20 and 40 overall ceramsite backfilling significantly increased bed stability inhibited bed erosion and reduced the sediment erosion depth by more than 70 as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling as shown by the black downward arrow notably ceramsite backfilling did not increase bed stability under the coverage rate of 20 which even had a greater erosion depth than the case with a coverage rate of 0 as there was a phenomenon of sediment scouring around ceramsite as previously described figs 7 and 9 overall the original sediment particles were relatively fine and easily suspended corresponding to a lower bed stability and thus an unclear sediment water interface when the flow disturbed after ceramsite backfilling the incipient velocity increased resulting in an increased bed stability with over 70 decrease in erosion depth i e the case with a coverage rate of 70 3 3 effects on phosphorus release from sediment nutrients are often rich in sediment and pore water and the change of sediment dynamics has a significant impact on nutrient release from sediment into the overlying water you et al 2007 thus ceramsite backfilling may affect the release of adsorbed p from sediment under different flow conditions fig 11 shows the measured p concentration in water samples under different flow conditions apparently p concentration in the water samples increased successively with increasing q under different coverage rates corresponding to an increasing p release flux from the sediment the sediment particles remained stationary under the low flow condition q 1 for all four coverage rates and the p concentration in the water samples were small i e approximately 0 05 mg l the corresponding p concentrations increased to 1 17 0 80 0 80 and 0 20 mg l under the high flow condition q 4 for the coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 respectively overall p release flux was maintained at a relatively low level with increasing q for the coverage rate of 70 as indicated by the red dashed arrow therefore ceramsite backfilling with a coverage rate of 70 had a key role in inhibiting p release from sediment with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling see the grey solid arrow the inhibition efficiency of p release was relatively moderate under coverage rates of 20 and 40 as shown by the blue hollow arrow theoretically p concentration in water samples is a function of the flow discharge and coverage rate the measured and calculated dimensionless p concentration in water samples c p c 0 based on the exponential function of eq 6 are further compared in fig 12 where x and y axis represent the measured and simulated values respectively it is observed that the calculated results were generally close to the dashed line of perfect agreement i e y x thus eq 6 can quantitatively describe the influence of hydrodynamics and ceramsite backfill coverage rate on sediment p release r 2 0 9615 which also provides guidance for subsequent practical applications the distributions of p in sediments and overlying water after the experiment were obtained using dgt as combined with the analysis of computer density imaging cdi technique fig 13 the black dashed line represents the original sediment water interface in the flume experiment in general the p release flux from sediment decreased with an increase in coverage rate of ceramsite resulting in a smaller p concentration in the overlying water and more p retention in the sediment under a higher coverage rate however for the case with a coverage rate of 20 the flow may wash the sediment particles around the ceramsite which increased the sediment p release as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling in addition fig 14 shows the correlation between p and sediment concentrations in the water sample p concentration generally showed a good linear correlation with sediment concentration i e p release was directly associated with sediment resuspension due to the increasing q before ceramsite backfilling p and sediment concentrations in the water samples reached the maximum at a high flow condition q 4 as shown in the pink area after ceramsite backfilling especially with a coverage rate of 70 p and sediment concentrations in the water samples were significantly lower than those before backfilling as shown in the green area 3 4 advantages and future studies of csbt the major processes of csbt technology include environmental dredging dewatering detoxification ceramsite calcination and ceramsite backfill environmental dredging can remove most of the surface sediment pollutants and high temperature during the preparation of ceramsite will cause decomposition of organic matter solidification or volatilization of heavy metals thereby reducing the pollution degree of the dredged sediment more importantly ceramsite backfilling can significantly increase bed stability and decrease sediment flux i e csbt effectively controls internal pollution by enhancing bed stability clarifying sediment water interface and reducing sediment flux as a combination of in situ and ex situ remediation csbt allows a reduced dredging volume as the remaining sediment is capped by ceramsite thus reducing the cost of dredging and avoiding the disposal of large amounts of dredged material meanwhile the dredged sediment is backfilled to the original area which avoids the introduction of foreign materials in addition we need to concern the cost of ceramsite calcination in the future studies which may be prohibitive for example the preparation of ceramsite may be optimized from an economic perspective such as using non calcination method and severely polluted areas can be accurately identified to restrict the application of csbt to specific areas actually csbt allows a reduced dredging volume as the remaining sediment is capped by ceramsite thus reducing the cost in the aspect of whole project considering the change of sediment habitat due to ceramsite backfilling we also need to further incorporate the application of csbt with the improvement of habitats for zoobenthos and aquatic plants besides the controlling of internal pollution trying to increase the diversity of physical habitats moreover the long term effects of ceramsite capping in controlling pollutant release from sediment should be concerned as external input polluted sediment may settle onto the backfilled ceramic particles over time on one hand it is necessary to effectively control the input of exogenous pollution before the internal pollution remediation on the other hand we need to further explore the preparation of ceramsite e g controlling the temperature to produce porous ceramic particles or loading new materials on the surface of ceramic particles cheng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 such as metal oxides or nano zero valent iron overall in situations where dredged material disposal is limited or when the treatment of dredged material is necessary the cbst approach has substantial advantages and can be applied to typical areas with heavy pollution 4 conclusions the management of sediment water interfaces is essential for controlling internal pollution in this study the inhibition of sediment erosion and p release under the remediation strategy of contaminated sediment backfilling were explored by flume experiment the main conclusions are as follows 1 as a combination of in situ and ex situ remediation csbt avoids the introduction of foreign materials via in situ remediation and the large scale land occupation associated with ex situ remediation i e a potent strategy for managing contaminated sediment 2 ceramsite backfilling significantly increased bed stability inhibited bed erosion and reduced the sediment erosion depth by more than 70 as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling 3 ceramsite backfilling with a coverage rate of 70 had a key role in inhibiting p release from sediment with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling and the inhibition efficiency was relatively moderate under coverage rates of 20 and 40 in the future studies we need to concern issues such as the cost of ceramsite calcination improvement of physical habitats for zoobenthos and aquatic plants and the long term effects of

14769,the management of sediment water interfaces especially bed stability is essential for controlling accumulated contaminants in the sediment in this study the relationship between sediment erosion and phosphorus p release under the remediation strategy of contaminated sediment backfilling csbt was explored through a flume experiment i e the dredged sediment was calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the dredged area for sediment capping thus avoiding the introduction of foreign materials via in situ remediation and the large scale land occupation associated with ex situ remediation acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and optical backscatter sensor obs were used to measure the vertical distributions of flow velocity and sediment concentration in the overlying water respectively and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was used to measure the p distribution in the sediment the results revealed that improving bed stability from csbt can considerably improve the robustness of sediment water interface and reduce sediment erosion by more than 70 the corresponding p release from the contaminated sediment could be inhibited with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 csbt is a potent strategy for managing contaminated sediment this study provides a theoretical reference for controlling sediment pollution further

for maintaining the ecology of rivers lakes and reservoirs hauer et al 2018 lai et al 2018 li et al 2019 samantha et al 2022 however it also accumulates pollutants because of its capacity to adsorb nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants apitz et al 2005 huang et al 2015a shaughnessy et al al 2019 xie et al 2015 the fate and transport of accumulated pollutants are controlled by hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics especially at the sediment water interface huang et al 2015b the accumulated pollutants may be released into the overlying water when physiochemical factors change chen et al 2014 jin et al 2019 kirtay et al 2018 ren et al 2019 yao et al 2009 potentially leading to algal blooms toxicity and black and malodourous conditions threatening the security of the aqueous environment and ecology and affecting the usage of water resources jarvie et al 2005 the release of pollutants from sediment under dynamic condition is much higher than that under static condition especially in shallow lakes dade 1993 inoue and nakamura 2011 sun et al 2006 wind waves and other external force disturbances are the dominant mechanisms resulting in sediment resuspension couceiro et al 2009 percuoco et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2010 and the release of adsorbed substances by sediment resuspension is 10 30 times that by static release wang et al 2011 studied the release of phosphorus p from sediments in the florida everglades and the results indicated that environmental alterations caused by disturbances such as high flow and dredging may pose the risk of p release furthermore huang et al 2021 proposed a unified expression of the sediment nutrient flux under different control modes diffusion sand wave motion and bed erosion to describe nutrient behaviours in the sediment layer and overlying water via theoretical analysis it is necessary to focus on sediment erosion and the resultant pollutant release for the management of contaminated sediments sediment remediation technologies have been put forward recently aiming to understand and solve the problem of sediment contamination fukue et al 2007 pourabadehei and mulligan 2016 in situ capping chemical and biological remediation aim to immobilize pollutants in the sediment peng et al 2009 reible et al 2003 2014 zhang et al 2019 while cannot reduce the amount of pollutants and may cause new pollution due to the introduction of foreign materials environmental dredging for ex situ remediation is currently the most common method for the remediation of seriously polluted sediments gustavson et al 2008 francingues et al 2008 rakowska et al 2012 for example dredging has removed most sediment pollutants and improved the water quality in trummen lake holdren et al 2001 and new bedford port bergen et al 2005 in america and in dianchi lake chaohu lake tai lake and west lake in china liu et al 2006 but dredging may lead to the pollutant exposure from deeper sediment and requires a large scale land to pile up the dredged sediment more than 56 million m3 of sediment in france 200 million m3 in western europe approximately 300 million m3 in the usa oh et al 2011 suedel et al 2008 and 500 million m3 in china are dredged annually moreover more emphasis has been placed on the research and development of remediation materials or strategies and systematic measures for enhancing bed stability and reducing pollutant release are still lacking coll et al 2016 gray et al 2006 song et al 2017 quantifying the influence of remediation strategies on bed stability is crucial for defining the specific parameters and optimal design of remediation plans contaminated sediment backfilling technology csbt is a remediation strategy of contaminated sediment which combines in situ and ex situ technologies as first proposed by fang et al 2019 the dredged sediment is calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the dredged area as a sediment cap which can avoid the potential pollution caused by foreign materials in situ and the large scale requirement for lands ex situ it is expected that csbt may effectively reduce the sediment flux through enhancing bed stability and clarifying sediment water interface in this study we used phosphorus p contaminated sediment as an example to explore the relationship between sediment erosion and p release under csbt by flume experiment and the impacts of different coverages on bed stability and p release were quantified with the aim of providing a theoretical reference for controlling sediment pollution further supporting river and lake ecological management and environmental restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 contaminated sediment backfilling technology the major processes of csbt technology is shown in fig 1 including environmental dredging dewatering detoxification stabilization of contaminants ceramsite calcination and ceramsite backfill as previously described the dredged sediment was calcined into ceramsite after dewatering and detoxification and then backfilled to the original dredged area as a sediment cap in this manner dredging could be limited to a relatively shallow surface sediment layer and the produced ceramsite can be used as a cap on the remaining contaminated sediment at depth which combines sediment dredging with in situ remediation of capping and avoids the introduction of foreign materials and large scale land occupation dredged sediment requires dehydration and harmless treatment before use akcil et al 2015 which can minimize the volume of materials to be treated and increase the treatment and utilisation efficiency of dredged sediment meanwhile the properties of ceramsite e g density and particle size can be adjusted by controlling the calcination temperature calcination time and adding materials to ensure the stability of the backfilled material 2 2 flume experiments scheme flume experiments are an effective method to incorporate micro scale mechanisms and macro scale phenomena to better understand the mobility of pollutants and improve sediment remediation technologies barlow et al 2004 huang et al 2015c ussher et al 2011 here flume experiments were conducted to explore the effects of ceramsite backfill as a cap on the remediation of p contaminated sediment under different coverages especially focusing on bed stability and sediment release flux 1 circulated flume setup the experiment was conducted using a circulated flume in the state key lab of hydro science and engineering at tsinghua university to estimate the effects of csbt on the remediation of p contaminated sediment the flume was 16 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m high as shown in fig 2 with the side walls and bottom consisting of plexiglass water was circulated within the flume using a pump system and the flow was regulated using a discharge control system water levels were measured using rulers installed on both sides of the flume along the longitudinal direction a pipe baffle was set at the upstream end of the channel to stop water turbulence 2 preparation of sediment samples and ceramsite the sediment samples used in the experiments were collected from the shanxi hejin section of the yellow river and the median particle size was 80 μm the organic matter content was small and the sediment was relatively clean hence it was washed with clean water many times and then air dried in the experimental preparation stage the experiments tended to explore the potential of csbt for p contaminated sediment remediation mainly from the aspects of bed stability and p release flux therefore sufficient potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was mixed with the sediment samples to achieve saturated p adsorption of about 0 3 0 4 mg g which was then used as a seriously polluted sediment sample for flume experiments the test area was set at x 10 11 m of flume to place the polluted sediment samples at a thickness of 10 cm see fig 2 and boulders of the same thickness were laid on the rest of the flume to ensure a flatbed surface the main components of dredged sediment include sio2 iron aluminium oxide alkali metal oxides and organic matter which are good raw materials for making ceramsite under the condition of no auxiliary materials or a small number of auxiliary materials ceramsite can be prepared using calcined and non calcined methods the non calcined method has low energy consumption low cost and high requirements for raw materials and the calcined ceramsite has a high density and strength therefore in this study it is recommended to use the calcination method to meet the backfilled ceramsite stability the dredged contaminated sediment with high water content was pre treated and placed into the pelletizer to produce ceramsite embryos that met the hydrodynamic conditions of the backfill area i e a ceramsite particle size of approximately 1 cm in this study keep the newly prepared ceramsite embryo at room temperature for approximately 24 h to prevent deformation and then baked in a high temperature environment with 1000 1300 c the calcination temperature and time were adjusted to control the ceramsite density about 1 5 g cm3 fig 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry eds images of the prepared ceramsite clearly the main component of ceramsite is sio2 and the main elements of lamellar substances on particle surfaces are aluminium silicon and oxygen the sediment particles were partially melted at high temperatures and large unmelted sediment particles were bonded together 3 experimental procedure four experimental conditions of ceramsite backfill were set to study the resultant bed stability and p release flux with coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 as shown in fig 4 where the images on the right correspond to the plan view a coverage rate of 20 and side view a coverage rate of 70 correspondingly four increasing flow levels were considered for each coverage rate i e q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 which were selected based on the incipient property of original sediment specifically q 1 q 2 and q 3 correspond to the flow conditions with bed shear stresses less than close to and greater than the critical value respectively and the corresponding sediment bed is in static condition critical incipient state and mobile condition q 4 corresponds to the flow condition with a significant suspension of sediment particles an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was placed in the middle of the test area i e x 10 5 m from the inlet to measure the vertical distribution of the flow velocity the vertical interval of adjacent points for adv measurement increased gradually with increasing distance from the bed i e the interval ranged from 1 to 3 mm when the distance was less than 0 2h h is the water depth and above which it ranged from 5 to 10 mm moreover optical backscatter sensors obs campbel us 1 and 2 were placed 5 5 m from the inlet and 1 m from the outlet respectively to monitor the variations in suspended sediment concentration ssc as shown in fig 2 b the sediment concentration was derived from the standard curve between the obs signals and sediment concentration as presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material specifically after placing the contaminated sediment samples in the test area running water was injected slowly into the flume without disturbing the riverbed the water pump electromagnetic flowmeter and discharge control system were turned on and the flow was adjusted to be as uniform as possible by adjusting the opening and closing angles of the tail gate under each flow level water samples were collected at two different depths i e 0 1h near the bed bottom water sample and 0 9h near the water surface surface water sample in the centreline of various cross sections of the flume i e x 9 10 10 25 10 5 10 75 11 and 12 m to measure the p release flux from the sediment i e soluble reactive p srp which can be directly utilized by aquatic organisms such as algae water samples collected at x 9 m were used to estimate the recirculation of p within the flume which was subtracted from the test section to eliminate the effects of recycling adv was used to measure the vertical distribution of flow velocity after which the flow was increased to the next flow level and the above operations were repeated the obs worked continuously to measure the sediment concentration during the whole experiment after the experiment with four flow levels we slowly reduced the flow and turned off the water pump diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were inserted into the sediment of the test area which was taken out two days later to measure the p profiles this experimental condition was denoted as a coverage rate of 0 the release of sediment pollutants generally comes from the surface layer of 1 3 cm pratihary et al 2014 wang and pant 2010 beutel and horne 2018 assessed sediment nutrient flux from profundal sediment at lake tahoe california nevada usa and concluded that surface sediment was a large reservoir of nutrients and dredging can remove most sediment pollutants and improve the water quality and ecology therefore the surface sediment of 1 cm thickness was further dredged in the test area and then the prepared ceramsite with a particle size of 1 cm was backfilled to the dredging area with coverage rates of 20 40 and 70 to explore the p release characteristics under these four flow levels the other operation steps were the same as those before the ceramsite backfilling i e the case with a coverage rate of 0 2 3 data analysis 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the flow characteristics were measured at the centreline of the test section to compare the changes before and after ceramsite backfilling including the time averaged velocity and turbulence intensity the time averaged velocity in the streamwise direction u is calculated as 1 u 1 n i 1 n u i and the turbulence intensity in the streamwise direction σ u is calculated as 2 σ u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 0 5 where u i is the instantaneous velocity in the streamwise direction n is the number of measurements meanwhile the vertical distribution of u conforms to the logarithmic law keulegan 1939 nezu et al 1993 song and chiew 2001 i e 3 u u 5 75 lg 30 2 z k s where u is the bed friction velocity z is the distance from the bed surface and k s is the bed surface roughness 2 bed stability the erosion rate per unit area was regarded as a measure of sediment stability to estimate the changes before and after ceramsite backfilling amos et al 1997 2003 2010 chen et al al 2017 2022 which is defined as 4 e t q t δ s s c t a where et is the erosion rate at time t s q t represents the flow discharge l s and δ s s c t is the corresponding difference in ssc as measured by the obs before and after the test section g l and a is the bed area of the test section i e 0 5 m2 furthermore the erosion depth was calculated from the erosion rate 5 δ z e t δ t ρ where δ z refers to the erosion depth mm e t δ t represents the amount of sediment erosion per unit area during time t t δ t and ρ is the bed sediment density 3 phosphorus release p release is proportional to the flow discharge as sediment particles are easier to suspend with a higher discharge resulting in a greater release of adsorbed p meanwhile p release is inversely proportional to the coverage rate of ceramsite as ceramsite backfilling increases bed stability and inhibits sediment p release thomas and schallenberg 2008 to quantitatively describe the p release characteristics the relationships between the dimensionless p concentration in the water samples i e divided by the p concentration on sediment particles c p c 0 and the flow discharge q and coverage rate r were explored where the exponential function was adopted 6 c p c 0 f q r a i e b i q r where c p refers to the p concentration in the water sample c 0 refers to the sediment p concentration i e about 0 64 mg l in this study ai and bi are the fitting parameters 3 results and discussions in this section the hydrodynamic characteristics corresponding to these four coverage rates of ceramsite were first analysed and then the potential of csbt for sediment remediation was discussed mainly considering bed stability and sediment p release 3 1 hydrodynamic characteristics based on the incipient property of the original sediment the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 under each coverage rate were set to 12 8 17 3 22 9 and 30 5 l s respectively table 1 in addition the water flow in the flume was regulated in the state of two dimensional constant and uniform flow as far as possible by adjusting the opening and closing angles of the tailgate under these four flow levels the water depth h in the test area was recorded which showed an increasing trend with an increase in q under these four coverage rates overall relatively similar hydrodynamic conditions were controlled for the cases before and after ceramsite backfilling to estimate the effects of ceramsite backfilling on bed stability and p release during the experiment fig 5 displays the dimensionless relationship between the vertical time averaged velocity u u and water depth z h where data points of different colours represent the measured values under different coverage rates and the dashed lines are the fitting curves as calculated by eq 3 it can be observed that the vertical distribution of time averaged velocity followed the logarithmic law well and was relatively similar under different flow levels meanwhile the bed surface resistance increased after ceramsite backfilling correspondingly u u increased near the bed and decreased near the water surface which resulted in a more even vertical distribution of u u the influence of csbt on the bed surface can be compared by comparing the distribution of turbulence intensity under the same or similar flow conditions nezu and rodi 1991 proposed an exponential formula for calculating the turbulence intensity in the streamwise direction σ u based on the experimental data i e 7 σ u d u e λ z where z z h and the parameters du and λ take different values corresponding to different bed roughness the measured turbulence intensity σ u under different experimental conditions are represented by symbols of different colours in fig 6 and the fitting curves of eq 7 are represented by coloured lines the turbulence intensity increased with an increase in q and the ceramsite backfilling increased the turbulence intensity near the bed under the same flow level except q 4 the turbulence intensity in smooth and rough fixed bed open channel flow gradually increased along the water depth and decayed near the bed owing to flow viscosity and wall fixation nezu 1979 which has also been observed in the case with a coverage rate of 0 see the blue symbols and lines in fig 6 and the bed is composed of fine sediment however the turbulence intensity exhibited an overall trend of gradually increasing from the water surface to the bed under coverage rates of 20 40 and 70 the turbulence intensity increased around the ceramsite therefore there was no attenuation near the bed after ceramsite backfilling 3 2 effects of ceramsite backfilling on bed stability bed stability is directly related to sediment resuspension and thus the release of pollutants which is an important physical basis for the control of internal pollution in natural waters the initial bed was set to be relatively smooth and flat and the bed gradually became rough because of hydrodynamic disturbances during the experiments fig 7 shows a comparison of the bed morphology of the test section before and after the experiment for the condition without ceramsite backfilling i e a coverage rate of 0 the bed sediment was eroded resulting in a rough bed morphology with increasing q fig 7 a b in contrast the bed surface was relatively stable and there was no obvious scouring phenomenon under coverage rates of 40 and 70 as shown in fig 7 d e in particular ceramsite was relatively dispersed at a coverage rate of 20 and the vortices near the bed developed due to ceramsite which generated a large shear stress between water layers and led to the phenomenon of sediment scouring around the ceramsite as shown in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the temporal evolution of erosion rate in the test section as estimated from eq 4 which can be regarded as a measure of sediment stability and different colours represent the values under different coverage rates the erosion rate et was negligible under the low flow condition q 1 indicating that sediment particles remained stationary for all four coverage rates the erosion rate first increased rapidly and then decreased when the flow discharge q increased at coverage rates of 20 and 40 i e similar to the condition of 0 coverage rate thus the coverage rates of 20 and 40 slightly affected the bed stability under medium and high flow conditions q 2 q 4 because there was enough space amongst the relatively dispersed ceramsites to fully develop the vortices near the bed surface tanino and nepf 2008 xu and nepf 2020 liu et al 2017 and fang et al 2017 concluded that the coarse particles were in an isolated state when the spacing was large i e free from the interference of surrounding particles and the vortex structure downstream was fully developed showing a tornado structure as shown in fig 9 a however the flow patterns amongst the particles were affected by each other when the particle spacing was reduced to a certain extent and the length of the downstream vortex structure decreased significantly correspondingly there was a significant inhibition of the start up of particles as shown in fig 9 b thus ceramsite backfilling significantly increased the bed stability under a coverage rate of 70 which was also reflected by the almost negligible erosion rate from q 2 to q 4 in fig 8 similarly the coloured points in fig 10 represent the time series of eroded depth eq 5 corresponding to the coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 no bed erosion occurred under the low flow condition q 1 and there was no significant difference amongst the erosion curves of these four coverage rates the bed morphology gradually appeared when the flow discharge increased under coverages of 0 20 and 40 overall ceramsite backfilling significantly increased bed stability inhibited bed erosion and reduced the sediment erosion depth by more than 70 as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling as shown by the black downward arrow notably ceramsite backfilling did not increase bed stability under the coverage rate of 20 which even had a greater erosion depth than the case with a coverage rate of 0 as there was a phenomenon of sediment scouring around ceramsite as previously described figs 7 and 9 overall the original sediment particles were relatively fine and easily suspended corresponding to a lower bed stability and thus an unclear sediment water interface when the flow disturbed after ceramsite backfilling the incipient velocity increased resulting in an increased bed stability with over 70 decrease in erosion depth i e the case with a coverage rate of 70 3 3 effects on phosphorus release from sediment nutrients are often rich in sediment and pore water and the change of sediment dynamics has a significant impact on nutrient release from sediment into the overlying water you et al 2007 thus ceramsite backfilling may affect the release of adsorbed p from sediment under different flow conditions fig 11 shows the measured p concentration in water samples under different flow conditions apparently p concentration in the water samples increased successively with increasing q under different coverage rates corresponding to an increasing p release flux from the sediment the sediment particles remained stationary under the low flow condition q 1 for all four coverage rates and the p concentration in the water samples were small i e approximately 0 05 mg l the corresponding p concentrations increased to 1 17 0 80 0 80 and 0 20 mg l under the high flow condition q 4 for the coverage rates of 0 20 40 and 70 respectively overall p release flux was maintained at a relatively low level with increasing q for the coverage rate of 70 as indicated by the red dashed arrow therefore ceramsite backfilling with a coverage rate of 70 had a key role in inhibiting p release from sediment with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling see the grey solid arrow the inhibition efficiency of p release was relatively moderate under coverage rates of 20 and 40 as shown by the blue hollow arrow theoretically p concentration in water samples is a function of the flow discharge and coverage rate the measured and calculated dimensionless p concentration in water samples c p c 0 based on the exponential function of eq 6 are further compared in fig 12 where x and y axis represent the measured and simulated values respectively it is observed that the calculated results were generally close to the dashed line of perfect agreement i e y x thus eq 6 can quantitatively describe the influence of hydrodynamics and ceramsite backfill coverage rate on sediment p release r 2 0 9615 which also provides guidance for subsequent practical applications the distributions of p in sediments and overlying water after the experiment were obtained using dgt as combined with the analysis of computer density imaging cdi technique fig 13 the black dashed line represents the original sediment water interface in the flume experiment in general the p release flux from sediment decreased with an increase in coverage rate of ceramsite resulting in a smaller p concentration in the overlying water and more p retention in the sediment under a higher coverage rate however for the case with a coverage rate of 20 the flow may wash the sediment particles around the ceramsite which increased the sediment p release as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling in addition fig 14 shows the correlation between p and sediment concentrations in the water sample p concentration generally showed a good linear correlation with sediment concentration i e p release was directly associated with sediment resuspension due to the increasing q before ceramsite backfilling p and sediment concentrations in the water samples reached the maximum at a high flow condition q 4 as shown in the pink area after ceramsite backfilling especially with a coverage rate of 70 p and sediment concentrations in the water samples were significantly lower than those before backfilling as shown in the green area 3 4 advantages and future studies of csbt the major processes of csbt technology include environmental dredging dewatering detoxification ceramsite calcination and ceramsite backfill environmental dredging can remove most of the surface sediment pollutants and high temperature during the preparation of ceramsite will cause decomposition of organic matter solidification or volatilization of heavy metals thereby reducing the pollution degree of the dredged sediment more importantly ceramsite backfilling can significantly increase bed stability and decrease sediment flux i e csbt effectively controls internal pollution by enhancing bed stability clarifying sediment water interface and reducing sediment flux as a combination of in situ and ex situ remediation csbt allows a reduced dredging volume as the remaining sediment is capped by ceramsite thus reducing the cost of dredging and avoiding the disposal of large amounts of dredged material meanwhile the dredged sediment is backfilled to the original area which avoids the introduction of foreign materials in addition we need to concern the cost of ceramsite calcination in the future studies which may be prohibitive for example the preparation of ceramsite may be optimized from an economic perspective such as using non calcination method and severely polluted areas can be accurately identified to restrict the application of csbt to specific areas actually csbt allows a reduced dredging volume as the remaining sediment is capped by ceramsite thus reducing the cost in the aspect of whole project considering the change of sediment habitat due to ceramsite backfilling we also need to further incorporate the application of csbt with the improvement of habitats for zoobenthos and aquatic plants besides the controlling of internal pollution trying to increase the diversity of physical habitats moreover the long term effects of ceramsite capping in controlling pollutant release from sediment should be concerned as external input polluted sediment may settle onto the backfilled ceramic particles over time on one hand it is necessary to effectively control the input of exogenous pollution before the internal pollution remediation on the other hand we need to further explore the preparation of ceramsite e g controlling the temperature to produce porous ceramic particles or loading new materials on the surface of ceramic particles cheng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 such as metal oxides or nano zero valent iron overall in situations where dredged material disposal is limited or when the treatment of dredged material is necessary the cbst approach has substantial advantages and can be applied to typical areas with heavy pollution 4 conclusions the management of sediment water interfaces is essential for controlling internal pollution in this study the inhibition of sediment erosion and p release under the remediation strategy of contaminated sediment backfilling were explored by flume experiment the main conclusions are as follows 1 as a combination of in situ and ex situ remediation csbt avoids the introduction of foreign materials via in situ remediation and the large scale land occupation associated with ex situ remediation i e a potent strategy for managing contaminated sediment 2 ceramsite backfilling significantly increased bed stability inhibited bed erosion and reduced the sediment erosion depth by more than 70 as compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling 3 ceramsite backfilling with a coverage rate of 70 had a key role in inhibiting p release from sediment with an inhibition efficiency as high as 80 compared with the case without ceramsite backfilling and the inhibition efficiency was relatively moderate under coverage rates of 20 and 40 in the future studies we need to concern issues such as the cost of ceramsite calcination improvement of physical habitats for zoobenthos and aquatic plants and the long term effects of ceramsite capping in controlling pollutant release overall this study provides a new idea and reference basis for ecological management and environmental restoration of rivers and lakes declaration of
