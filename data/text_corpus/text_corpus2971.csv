14855,the excess nitrogen discharge into water bodies has resulted in extensive water pollution and human health risks which has become a critical global issue moreover nitrogenous wastewater contains considerable chemical energy contributed by organic pollutants and nitrogenous compounds therefore the treatment of various kinds of nitrogen containing wastewater for nitrogen removal and energy recovery is of significance biological methode and advanced oxidation processes aops are the main methods for nitrogen removal however biological treatment is easily inhibited by high salinity high ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n nitrite and toxic organics in wastewater which limits its application aops mainly induce in situ generation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 for nitrogen removal nevertheless ho shows low reactivity and n2 selectivity towards nh3 n nh4 n oxidation and so4 also demonstrates unsatisfactory nh3 n nh4 n removal it has been shown that cl clo can efficiently remove nh3 n nh4 n with high n2 selectivity the generation of cl clo can be triggered by various techniques among which the pec technique shows great potential due to its higher efficiency for cl clo generation and eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing solar energy cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n reduction can be strengthened through the design of photoanode and cathode materials respectively coupling with this two pathways an exhaustive total nitrogen tn

been used is confidential 1 introduction there exist many types of nitrogen containing wastewater with complex compositions where the nitrogen containing compounds exist in diverse forms nitrogen sources in water bodies can be classified into inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen inorganic nitrogen primarily includes ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n and nitrate nitrite nitrogen no3 n no2 n while organic nitrogen includes urea protein amino acids and organic amines the indiscriminate use of fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock domestic and industrial sources have resulted in extensive water pollution and human health risks tsai et al 2022 yu et al 2019 such as eutrophication zhang et al 2009 and methemoglobinemia reyter et al 2010 which has become a critical global issue moreover nitrogenous wastewater contains considerable chemical energy contributed by pollutants including organic matters such as glucose and phenol eqs 1 and 2 inorganic nitrogen such as nh4 eq 3 urea eq 4 and organic amines such as aniline and methylamine eqs 5 and 6 shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2022a therefore treating nitrogen containing wastewater for

treating nitrogen containing wastewater include biological method hörold et al 1993 physical stripping method marttinen et al 2002 chemical precipitation method zhang et al 2009 membrane separation method chiemchaisri et al 1992 ion exchange method mercer et al 1970 breakpoint chlorination method pressley et al 1972 etc biological treatment is commonly used for converting inorganic nitrogen to n2 through nitrification and denitrification but its application is limited by the factors such as high salinity high nh3 n nh4 n concentration nitrite toxic organic compounds and strict c n ratio chen et al 2011 hörold et al 1993 yang et al 2019 other methods such as physical stripping chemical precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange can remove nh3 n nh4 n efficiently but they cannot convert it to n2 leading to secondary pollution the breakpoint chlorination method can convert nh3 n nh4 n to n2 with high efficiency but it is costly and causes secondary pollution in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have been rapidly developed and gained significant attention ao et al 2021 the main process in most aops is the in situ generation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 currently ho based processes are the most studied treatments among various aops such as o3 anggo krisbiantoro et al 2020 uv h2o2 huang et al 2008 fenton menon et al 2021 photocatalysis pc feng et al 2021 wang et al 2014a yao et al 2020 and photoelectrocatalysis pec elysabeth et al 2021 wang et al 2021a tables s1 s4 endowed with high oxidation potential 2 8 v vs nhe zhang et al 2021 ho is non selective but high efficient in attacking target contaminants nevertheless nh3 n nh4 n due to its chemically inert property cannot be easily and selectively attacked by ho liu and wang 2023 for example huang et al 2008 studied ho generation by uv h2o2 for nh3 n removal initial concentration 31 mg n l 1 and only 26 4 of nh3 n was removed within 5 h accompanied by the main product of no3 n so4 based aops have also been studied to treat nitrogen containing wastewater in which sulfite persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms was activated to generate so4 for nh3 n nh4 n removal amanollahi et al 2021 fan et al 2019 hao et al 2021 liu and wang 2023 qu et al 2020 sun et al 2022 tables s3 and s4 so4 possesses excellent oxidizing ability with potential of 2 5 3 1 v vs she amanollahi et al 2021 while it still demonstrates unsatisfactory nh3 n nh4 n removal efficiency for example sun et al 2022 studied nh4 n removal within 30 min in a visible light driven marine with cl or freshwater without cl pfc pms system in which the nh4 n removal efficiencies were 95 73 and 22 58 respectively the results indicate that nh4 n removal is dominantly contributed by chlorine radicals instead of so4 recently chlorine radicals based aops have attracted much attention due to their high efficiency and selectivity in converting nh3 n nh4 n into n2 liu and wang 2023 lu et al 2023 wang et al 2023a yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b zheng et al 2020 2022 zhou et al 2023 2022a tables s1 s5 chlorine radicals have been shown to react more rapidly with electron rich moieties such as nh3 n nh4 n compared to ho zhang et al 2019b 2018b zheng et al 2020 it has been reported that the active free chlorine hclo can also efficiently remove nh3 n nh4 n li and liu 2009 wang et al 2023b zhou et al 2021a the kinetics constants of nh4 n reactions with different types of chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 hclo or ho are as follows k clo 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 k cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 k ho 1 4 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 k hclo 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 kcl2 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 jafvert and valentine 1992 zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore among these active species the generation of cl clo dominated chlorine radicals is required for more efficient nh3 n nh4 n removal chloridion cl a common precursor for cl clo is usually present in industrial wastewater especially in high salinity and high nitrogen wastewater which provides a foundation for in situ generation of cl clo liu and wang 2023 various techniques have been employed to trigger the generation of cl clo including uv nh2cl zhang et al 2019a vacuum uv vuv uv wang et al 2023a ec uv wang et al 2020a xiao et al 2009 ye et al 2016 electrochemistry ec li et al 2019a zhang et al 2022a 2022b zheng et al 2020 pc shi et al 2022 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021d pec ji et al 2017 lu et al 2022 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b 2018b and so4 based aops hao et al 2021 liu and wang 2023 zheng et al 2022 among them pec technique has drawn great attention due to its higher efficiency for cl clo generation and eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing the solar energy wastewater fuel cells wfcs offer the dual benefits of purifying wastewater while recovering energy in recent years microbial fuel cells mfcs have gained attention as they integrate wastewater treatment and energy recovery zeng et al 2018 however mfcs essentially belongs to microbial treatment technology which is limited in treating difficult sewage with high salinity high nitrogen and high toxicity etc moreover the electron transfer process in mfc is complex and slow resulting in low output current low power density large internal resistance long start up time and harsh operating conditions xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 however photocatalytic fuel cells pfcs show great potential in refractory organics degradation and energy recovery due to stronger oxidation capacities of photogenerated holes ho and faster charge transfer process under illumination catalyzed by semiconductor materials zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 compared with mfcs wfcs have the merits of faster electron transfer wider application range and better adaptability to the environment however the existing pfcs still have drawbacks in treating nitrogen containing wastewater the photogenerated holes and ho generated on photoanode surface may directly oxidize nh3 n nh4 n into no3 n no2 n which are difficult to further transform into n2 and remove in pfcs leading to low tn removal based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n the pec system has been shown to achieve complete nh3 n nh4 n removal with more than 80 of n2 selectivity ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b 2022b additionally the approximately 20 of no3 n generated during the process can be efficiently reduced to n2 or nh3 n nh4 n using specific cathodes zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2022a our group has strengthened cl clo generation by designing photoanode materials such as wo3 tio2 wo3 bivo4 wo3 sb sno2 wo3 while also promoting no3 n reduction by designing cathode materials such as pd cu nf and cunw cf the coupling of these two pathways has led to the development of an exhaustive tn removal system capable of treating various types of nitrogen containing wastewater and achieving complete tn removal fang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019b shen et al 2019b 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b 2018b when introducing the nitrogen removal mechanism into pfcs the concept of nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells nfcs is proposed for treating several typical types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen resulting in high efficient tn removal organics purification toxic chlorate control and energy recovery simultaneously shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a zhou et al 2022a this review summarizes and discusses the recent progress in this field 2 mechanism of pec exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n 2 1 mechanism of cl oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n table 1 displays the primary reactions involved in nh4 n degradation by cl in the pec system under the excitation of solar light the photoanode generates electron hole pairs eq 7 with the holes being able to oxidize h2o and cl to ho and cl respectively eqs 8 and 9 cl can react with cl to generate cl2 and a pair of cl2 or cl can react to form cl2 and further to form hclo eqs 10 and 13 the second order reaction rate constant of cl with organics is 3 71 108 1 52 109 m 1 s 1 much higher than that of cl2 4 60 106 3 57 107 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2021 cl cl2 or ho can react with h2o oh or cl to form hclo eqs 14 18 with hclo being converted to cl eq 19 it is known that cl cl2 ho and hclo are strong oxidants capable of reacting with nh4 the kinetic constants for their reactions with nh4 n are as follows k cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 k ho 1 4 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 k hclo 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 kcl2 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 eqs 20 23 it is evident that cl has much higher reactivity towards nh4 n oxidation compared to cl2 ho and hclo cl or cl2 can promote rapid addition hydrogen extraction and direct electron transfer reactions with nh4 n to form a range of free radicals nh2 and nhcl and intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh with the rate constant of cl reaction with nh2cl 2 4 107 m 1 s 1 being higher than that of cl2 6 5 106 m 1 s 1 eqs 22 28 these intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh can further react to form n2 eqs 29 31 indicating that cl is usually the main active chlorine species involved in the oxidation of nh4 n in the process of cl oxidation of nh4 n cl is continuously generated and can be further oxidized to cl thus forming the cl cl cyclic reaction theoretically nh4 n is inclined to be converted to no3 nby ho and nh2 can be finally oxidized to no3 n by ho eqs 32 and 33 2 2 mechanism of clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n owing to the low cl concentration in the system the rate of nh4 n oxidation to n2 is relatively low and the formation of clo is more conducive to the conversion of nh3 n nh4 n to n2 zhang et al 2019b at the photoanode o2 and ho are produced in a competitive process exner et al 2014 it has been found that ho tends to convert cl to hclo and clo instead of cl zhang et al 2019b table 2 shows that clo can be generated by the reactions of cl or ho with hclo clo with the reaction rate constants as high as 3 0 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 0 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 34 37 hua et al 2019 wu et al 2017 clo has a high potential 1 8 v vs nhe and can quickly react with electron rich nh4 n group kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 sun et al 2016 reported that the concentration of clo is 102 103 times that of ho and cl in the uv cl process zheng et al 2020 confirmed the predominance of clo in the ec cl process whose steady state concentrations 8 08 10 13 m are 16 4 26 5 and 1609 5 times those of cl2 ho and cl respectively in some cases clo may exhibit much higher reactivity than cl fang et al 2014 the rate constant of nh4 n oxidation by clo is up to 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 much higher than that of nh4 oxidation by cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 eqs 22 and 38 clo can also oxidize nh2cl to nhcl as shown in eq 39 the subsequent process based on clo reactions is similar to the cl reactions mentioned above where the intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh further react to form n2 eqs 29 31 based on the above discussed it can be conjectured that clo has higher reactivity than cl for nh4 oxidation yan et al 2021 the selection of appropriate photoanode materials is crucial in achieving efficient cl clo formation and controlling the production of toxic chlorate byproducts this is due to the fact that different photoanode materials possess unique band gap and valence band vb edge positions which determines their respective absorption spectra and redox potentials common photoanode materials include tio2 wo3 bivo4 and fe2o3 etc each with distinct energy band structures as illustrated in fig 1a for instance tio2 has a band gap of 3 0 3 2 ev which restricts its absorption to only ultraviolet light zhou et al 2020a 2021c 2020b on the other hand fe2o3 cannot oxidize cl to cl due to its higher vb location compared to e cl cl christoforidis et al 2016 meanwhile wo3 and bivo4 possess smaller band gaps with the capacity of absorbing visible light and their lower vb positions than e cl cl endow them with the ability to oxidize cl to cl ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore wo3 bivo4 and their composites are typically preferred as photoanodes in pec system moreover a composite photoanode consisting of si photovoltaic cells sipvcs connected in series with the photoanode is often used this configuration generates a self biased potential that enhances photogenerated charge separation and improves solar energy utilization while reducing system energy consumption 2 3 mechanism of exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction the cl clo system can selectively oxidize nh3 n nh4 n to n2 but about 20 of nh3 n nh4 n is over oxidized to no3 n which results in incomplete tn removal ji et al 2017 lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019b recently electrochemical reduction of no3 n has gained significant attention due to its convenience environmental friendliness and low cost su et al 2017 no3 n can be reduced on the cathode electrochemically and the possible reactions are shown in table 3 this process involves a series of possible nitrogen containing intermediates such as no2 no2 n no n2o n2 n2h4 nh2oh and nh4 n liu et al 2021 su et al 2016 firstly no3 n is reduced to no2 which is further reduced to no2 n eqs 40 and 41 subsequently no2 n is reduced to no and no can be directly converted to n2 which can be further reduced to nh4 n eqs 42 44 meanwhile no2 n and no can also be reduced to n2o eqs 45 and 46 n2o can be reduced to nh2oh and n2h4 where nh2oh can be further converted to nh4 n eqs 47 49 the reduction of no3 n strongly depends on the applied potential and electrode materials su et al 2016 by adjusting the applied potential no3 n can be selectively reduced to different products moreover different electrode materials have a significant impact on no3 n reduction products hence selecting appropriate electrode materials and regulating the applied potential can enhance the selectivity of no3 n reduction products researchers have studied a variety of metal cathodes including cu fe al ni zn ag au pt and pd dima et al 2003 estudillo wong et al 2011 katsounaros and kyriacou 2008 lacasa et al 2011 su et al 2016 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2014a among these cathodes cu and fe have been paid the most attention due to their high efficiency and low cost in which cu and its alloys have been considered as the most effective catalysts to promote electrochemically no3 n reduction reyter et al 2008 2010 for example wang et al 2020b prepared the cu cu2o nwas cathode by anodizing copper mesh combined with in situ reduction exhibiting a no3 n conversion efficiency and nh3 selectivity of 97 0 and 81 2 respectively our group zhou et al 2021a developed a novel 3d pd cu oh 2 cf cathode via in situ wet chemical method where cu oh 2 nanowires were grown on cf and further surface electrodeposition of pd was performed exhibiting a 98 8 conversion of no3 n to nh4 n gu et al 2020 prepared a porous and nitrogen doped carbon cathode modified with pd cu nanoparticle alloy pd cu pnc which demonstrated a no3 n conversion efficiency and n2 selectivity of 97 1 and 83 respectively obviously the selectivity of no3 n conversion to n2 can be improved by designing cathode materials however a portion of no3 n is inevitably converted to nh3 n nh4 n resulting in uncomplete tn removal in the system therefore through the design of cathode materials no3 n is selectively reduced to n2 and nh3 n nh4 n at cathode eqs 40 48 and the produced nh3 n nh4 n is subsequently oxidized to n2 by cl clo the tn removal mechanism in this system can be explained as follows i the photoanode produces strong oxidizing cl clo which rapidly react with nh3 n nh4 n to convert it into n2 and a small quantity of no3 n ii the cathode selectively reduces the small amount of no3 n or no3 n existing in the system or no3 n produced by the previous step 1 to n2 and a trace amount of nh3 n nh4 n is generated due to excessive reduction of no3 n iii the nh3 n nh4 n produced in step ii is converted into n2 by step i consequently an exhaustive tn removal system is constructed based on photoanodic nh3 n nh4 n oxidation by cl clo and cathodic no3 n reduction which theoretically enables highly efficient tn removal for treating various nitrogen containing wastewater fig 1b 3 system design of cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction for exhaustive tn removal 3 1 highly selective oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n to n2 by cl clo cl clo can rapidly attack nh4 n to capture h atoms to form n centered radicals nh2 thus quickly converting nh4 n into n2 wang et al 2016 in 2017 our group ji et al 2017 designed a pec cl system for highly selective conversion of nh4 n to n2 by cl using wo3 as photoanode the nh4 n removal mechanism in this system is shown in fig 2a where cl selectively converts nh4 n to n2 along with generation of a small amount of no3 n fig 2b shows the nh4 n degradation process by electrocatalytic ec photocatalytic pc and pec systems with or without cl the nh4 n was hardly degraded by the pccl or eccl system the nh4 n degradation efficiency was improved to 9 6 within 90 min by pec system because the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is inhibited when the potential is applied however the nh4 n could be completely removed within 90 min by peccl system indicating that cl plays a crucial role in degrading nh4 n moreover the parameters such as the applied potential cl concentration and ph have important effects on nh4 n removal and need to be discussed and optimized with the increase of cl concentration or the decrease of ph value the nh4 n degradation rate increased gradually this is because a higher cl concentration will produce more cl and accelerate nh4 n degradation a smaller ph will generate more h and the photoinduced electrons reach the cathode through the external circuit to reduce h to h2 which effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs generating more holes to strengthen cl generation for nh4 n degradation however the degradation products of nh4 n were mainly n2 and no3 n in which the n2 yield first increased and then decreased with increased cl concentration or decreased ph value when the cl concentration was 400 mg l 1 cl nh4 20 and ph was 4 the tn removal efficiency reached the maximum of 79 9 fig 2c the radical quenching experiments were used to characterize the types of free radicals for nh4 n degradation in which tert butyl alcohol tba was used as the quench agent for cl and ho and nitrobenzene nb was used as the quench agent for ho ji et al 2017 the experimental results show that cl is the main free radical responsible for nh4 n degradation the nh4 n degradation efficiency remained basically unchanged after five times of consecutive tests with 20 mg l 1 nh4 n added into the system every 90 min without additional cl added suggesting the excellent stability of this system fig 2g the photoanode materials significantly affect the tn removal efficiency for nh4 n degradation in peccl system the tn removal efficiency of wo3 photoanode system is better than that of the reported to2 photoanode systems livolsi et al 2023 wang et al 2014b xiao et al 2016 for example wang et al 2014b previously studied the nh4 n removal using tio2 nanotube arrays tio2 nts as photoanode in pec cl system which showed 99 of nh4 n removal with a low n2 selectivity 50 8 of within 2 h fig 2h recently zheng et al 2022 prepared the chemical reduced bivo4 r bivo4 photoanode using nabh4 as reductant which showed excellent performance in the pec cl system for selective degradation of nh3 n to n2 from saline sewage the reactive chlorine species cl clo hclo produced in this system are responsible for the high selectivity of nh3 n degradation in which cl is the dominant reactive species in removing nh3 n due to its adequate generation fig 2f the nh3 n removal efficiency of the r bivo4 system 100 within 40 min is much better than that of the bivo4 system 50 within 40 min which is ascribed to the improved pec reactivity via the chemical reduction process that induces oxygen vacancies into bivo4 fig 2g during the nh3 n degradation 91 6 of nh3 n was converted into n2 accompanied by no3 n 8 4 of initial nh3 n as the major degradation byproduct of nh3 n in sewage fig 2h meanwhile the composition of wastewater may also affect the nh4 n degradation efficiency for example zhang et al 2020 studied the co degradation of 4 chlorophenol and nh4 n in wastewater by the pec system finding that nh4 n removal increased from 62 to 95 within 2 5 h when 4 chlorophenol simultaneously existed in wastewater during 4 chlorophenol degradation by photogenerated holes and ho cl was generated as a degradation product which could form cl for contributing to nh4 n degradation in 2019 our group zhang et al 2019b developed a novel double sided electrode structure with wo3 photoanode in front and sb doped tin oxide sb sno2 anode at the back for in situ generation of clo clo can quickly decompose nh4 n into n2 which is more efficient than the previous cl reactions the sb sno2 is an ideal material for the generation of hclo due to its good chlorine evolution potential yang et al 2014b zhang et al 2019b ho generated on wo3 reacts with hclo generated on sb sno2 to produce clo fig 2i the nh4 n degradation efficiency by sb sno2 wo3 system was 99 2 which is 2 38 and 2 90 times that of wo3 and sb sno2 systems respectively fig 2j the electron spin resonance esr technique using dmpo as trapping agent confirmed the presence of the main ho and clo signals as well as the weak cl signal for the sb sno2 wo3 system hao et al 2019 xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2018b free radical quenching experiments using tba as the quench agent for ho cl and clo cheng et al 2013 and hco3 as the quench agent for ho and cl guo et al 2017 supported the leading role of clo in nh4 n degradation moreover this system still maintained a high nh4 n removal efficiency 100 after 5 times of consecutive runs indicating the excellent stability of sb sno2 wo3 electrode the actual wastewater was treated by sb sno2 wo3 system with 81 2 of the tn removal within 90 min fig 2k the above studies indicate that the sb sno2 wo3 system can efficiently convert nh4 n to n2 by generating clo recent studies by lu et al 2022 demonstrated the use of oxygen vacancies containing tio2 nanotubes tnts photoanode and graphite cathode in pec cl system for nh4 n degradation in which clo dominated the 81 06 of nh4 n degradation with 86 of n2 selectivity within 90 min in a later study lu et al 2023 improved this system by using ni modified graphite felt ni gf cathode to strengthen h2o2 generation which improved ho yield and consequentially induced more clo generated by the quenching of ho with free chlorine contributing to higher nh4 n removal efficiency fig 2l the ni loadings of ni gf cathode significantly influenced the nh4 n removal and the 10 0 wt ni gf cathode system showed the best nh4 n degradation efficiency which is due to the fact that 10 0 wt ni gf cathode strengthens more h2o2 generation and thus induces more ho for clo formation fig 2m during the nh4 n degradation in the 10 0 wt ni gf cathode system 96 1 of nh4 n was selectively converted to n2 within 90 min without no3 n no2 n detected fig 2n the method described in this study has several advantages firstly it produces cl in situ eliminating the need for continuous cl addition secondly the cl cl system is always cyclic without the need for external intervention although molecular chlorine cl2 probably may be inevitably generated due to the combination of two cl or cl2 eqs 11 and 12 the loss of total cl in this system can remain low even after nh4 n depletion this is because the produced cl2 is hydrolyzed to form hclo clo eqs 13 20 24 27 34 37 which rapidly reacts and accelerates the recycling of chloride preventing cl2 from escaping into the air for example xiao et al 2009 investigated the combination of electrochemical and ultraviolet light irradiation upe process using iro2 ti anode and ti mesh cathode in the presence of cl for nh3 n degradation they found that the loss ratio of total cl decreased from 21 0 to 7 2 in the upe process implying that the recycle of chloride was accelerated and the elapse of cl2 decreased significantly compared to the electrochemical e process additionally the cl concentration required for the system is as low as 0 05 m table s5 which is equivalent to 1 10 of the cl concentration in seawater 0 5 m ji et al 2017 finally the selectivity and high rate of cl reaction with nh4 n means that the reaction process produces relatively few chlorinated organic compounds thereby reducing environmental risk ji et al 2017 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2018a 2018b 3 2 exhaustive tn removal based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction based on cl clo system nh4 n could be converted to n2 with the selectivity of more than 80 while 20 no3 n was generated resulting in incomplete tn removal zhang et al 2019b 2018b meanwhile this system is not efficient in removing tn from nitrate wastewater in 2018 our group zhang et al 2018b designed an exhaustive tn removal system by using pd cu modified foam ni cathode pd cu ni to reduce the redundant no3 n to n2 the sem images of nf and pd cu nf electrodes are presented in fig 3a and 3b respectively which show that the pd cu particles uniformly cover the surface of nf with a particle size of 150 nm the mechanism of exhaustive tn removal in this system involves cyclic reactions of cl oxidation of nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction fig 3c zhang et al 2018b the no3 n reduction of pd cu nf cathode could reach 100 within 90 min which is higher than that of pd nf 68 7 cu nf 60 7 nf 21 and pt 11 0 cathodes demonstrating excellent no3 n reduction activity of pd cu nf cathode fig 3d fig 3e shows that no3 n could be completely removed within 90 min and no2 n was almost not generated while nh4 n concentration first increased and then gradually decreased to almost 0 below the detection limit with a tn removal of up to 98 2 fig 3f shows that the degradation efficiency of nh4 n in this system reached 99 within 90 min detection of intermediate products during nh4 n oxidation indicates that no2 n was hardly detected while the concentration of no3 n first increased and then gradually decreased to almost 0 with a tn removal of 97 4 these results indicate that the exhaustive tn removal system can completely transform no3 n or nh4 n into n2 the species of free radicals were determined using esr technique with dmpo as trapping agent in the absence of cl four peaks with 1 2 2 1 intensity were detected proving the presence of ho xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2018b the addition of cl resulted in the observation of 11 line esr spectrum indicating the simultaneous presence of ho and cl in the system li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b treatment of wastewater containing different proportions of inorganic nitrogen was further investigated fig 3g the tn removal efficiency was slightly reduced when the wastewater contained both no3 and nh4 particularly the efficiency was the lowest 93 1 within 90 min when the ratio was 1 1 the reduction rate of no3 n decreased when nh4 was present on one hand nh4 n oxidation on the photoanode contributed to more no3 n on the other hand h produced during nh4 n oxidation competed with no3 n on the cathode the system effectively treated the wastewater containing various inorganic nitrogen no2 no3 nh4 when the ratio of no2 no3 and nh4 was 1 1 1 the tn removal efficiency was 98 4 within 90 min indicating the system s potential to treat complex nitrogen containing wastewater the tn removal efficiency maintained at the first level 94 2 after five times of successive experiments indicating the excellent stability of pd cu nf cathode fig 3h the exhaustive tn removal system based on cl oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction was used to treat urine wastewater shen et al 2019b different kinds of organic amine wastewater li et al 2019b and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen tang et al 2020 in which the tn removal efficiencies were 99 37 within 2 h 92 37 99 20 within 2 5 h and 99 9 within 3 h respectively table s5 based on the rapid conversion of nh4 n to n2 through clo oxidation using sb sno2 wo3 anode and the high efficient no3 n reduction by pd cu nf cathode an exhaustive tn removal system was designed fig 3i zhang et al 2019b the tn removal efficiency in this system was 98 4 within 90 min which is 2 1 times that of the system using wo3 as photoanode 47 1 fig 3j later li et al 2020 presented a clo mediated pec flow through configuration system of ag tio2 nts photoanode and pd cu nf cathode for highly efficient nh4 n removal from water fig 3k in this system the nh4 n was completely removed with a high n2 conversion of more than 92 within 15 min fig 3l the exhaustive tn removal system based on clo oxidation of nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction was used to treat urine wastewater shen et al 2020 wastewater containing organics and nitrogen huang et al 2020 in which the tn removal efficiencies were 99 74 and 99 0 respectively within 1 h these works suggest that the exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction has the potential to treat more complex nitrogen containing wastewater with high efficiency 3 3 control of toxic chlorate byproducts the exhaustive tn removal has been realized by developing the pec system that utilizes photoanodic nh4 n oxidation by cl clo and cathodic no3 n reduction however the over oxidation of cl by a large amount of ho generated in the system can lead to the formation of toxic chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 byproducts posing a great risk to practical applications for example degradation of contaminants using wo3 as photoanode in pec system produced 30 150 mg l 1 chlorate koo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b clo3 can severely damage red blood cells while clo4 inhibits the absorption of iodine affecting thyroid hormone synthesis and potentially causing cancer azizi et al 2011 constantinou et al 2019 jasper et al 2017 to address this issue our group zhang et al 2021 first proposed a new method for designing bivo4 wo3 heterojunction photoanode by fine tuning the vb position the oxidation capacity of holes can be adjusted to promote the selective oxidation of cl to cl instead of clo3 or clo4 the vb edge of wo3 is 3 0 v vs nhe koo et al 2019 which is higher than the potential of e 0 ho h2o 2 8 v vs nhe leading to the generation of a large amount of ho that causes the over oxidation of nh4 n and cl on the other hand the vb edge of bivo4 is located at 2 5 v vs nhe and cannot oxidize oh to ho zhou et al 2021b 2022b the energy band matching of bivo4 and wo3 allows the construction of bivo4 wo3 heterojunction that can regulate the oxidation ability of holes to avoid chlorate generation furthermore the bivo4 wo3 heterojunction improves the electron transport visible light absorption and electrode stability the sipvcs were used in combination with bivo4 wo3 to form composite photoanode this system is capable of achieving self driven degradation of nh4 n while suppressing the production of toxic chlorate byproducts fig 4a the concentration of no3 n gradually increased during nh4 n degradation and almost no no2 n was generated resulting in a tn removal efficiency of 80 1 within 2 h fig 4b meanwhile the chlorate concentration produced in wo3 bivo4 system was only 18 3 mg l 1 which is lower than that of wo3 system 73 mg l 1 resulting in 79 inhibition fig 4c the cumulative concentration of ho in the bivo4 wo3 system 0 13 mm within 75 min was much lower than that in the wo3 system 0 62 mm within 75 min indicating that the wo3 bivo4 heterojunction construction inhibited ho generation thus effectively suppressing chlorate formation fig 4d moreover the use of bivo4 wo3 could suppress 31 of nitrate formation compared to pristine wo3 due to the mild oxidation ability of holes generated by bivo4 wo3 which prevented nh4 n from being overoxidized to further improve the tn removal efficiency the pt cathode was replaced by the pd cu nf cathode to construct a cyclic nitrogen removal system as shown in fig 4e fang et al 2020 the tn removal efficiency could reach 97 1 within 90 min fig 4f in addition the chlorate and nitrate produced by the wo3 bivo4 system were suppressed by 61 and 44 respectively the improved nitrate inhibition from 31 to 44 in this system is ascribed to the pd cu nf cathode that promotes no3 n reduction besides li et al 2021 investigated the formation of reactive chlorine species and toxic oxychlorides in peccl system using three typical photoanodes tio2 wo3 and bivo4 the phenol removal and toxic clo3 formation by different photoanodes were compared the photoanodes showed the phenol removal rates as follows wo3 bivo4 tio2 fig 4g however more than 2 mg l 1 clo3 was detected in wo3 and tio2 systems within 2 h which is over 10 times higher than that of bivo4 system fig 4h bivo4 photoanode possess moderate valence band maximum vbm which endows the holes with relatively weak oxidizing capacity restricting ho production and thereby inducing the formation of non ho mediated active chlorine species instead of poisonous clo3 in this system fig 4i however tio2 or wo3 photoanode possesses large vbm that enables the holes to oxidize h2o to ho resulting in a significant number of clo3 produced in this system the above works provide foundation for the inhibition of toxic chlorate byproducts in the practical applications of peccl system for harmless processing of nitrogen containing wastewater which shows potential of mitigating risks to the environment 4 design of nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells nfcs with the design of exhaustive tn removal system by strengthening photoanodic cl clo generation for nh3 n nh4 n oxidation and promoting cathodic no3 n reduction the above works have realized complete tn removal for treating vrious nitrogen containing wastewater when incorporating the denitrogenation mechanism into the pfcs the concept of nfcs is proposed to treat several typical types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen realizing high efficiency tn removal organics purification and chemical energy recovery simultaneously 4 1 inorganic nitrogen nfc based on the above works our group zhou et al 2022a designed a novel inorganic nitrogen nfc that utilized the copper nanowires growing in situ on copper foam electrode cnw cf as denitrification cathode to achieve tn removal and energy recovery of nitrate fig 5a showed the preparation process and the corresponding sem images of the cnw cf cathode where the copper nanowires with diameters ranging from 50 to150 nm were uniformly arranged on the substrate the no3 n was high selectively reduced to nh4 n instead of n2 by cnw cf and the nh4 n was completely converted to n2 by the nfc system fig 5b meanwhile the electrons generated during nh4 n oxidation process were transferred to the cathode forming a closed loop circuit for external electricity production as shown in fig 5c the cnw cf cathode demonstrated superior no3 n reduction capability with complete no3 n removal within 45 min surpassing that of pt and cf cathodes less than 15 within 90 min no3 n reduction is an exothermic process allowing for the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy cotchim et al 2015 djerdjev et al 2021 nox n was almost completely eliminated within 45 min while the concentration of nh4 n increased and then fell below the detection limit within 90 min which realized complete tn removal fig 5d the maximum power density of this system was 0 973 mw cm 2 at 15 min progressively decreasing as the chemical energy of the system was depleted with the generation and conversion of nitrogen containing species to n2 the results indicated that no3 was the key parameter for power generation when no3 was not introduced the power density was 0 688 mw cm 2 which was caused by the photovoltage produced by sipvc however the addition of no3 increased the power to 0 973 mw cm 2 fig 5e the ratio of no3 and nh4 also had a significant impact on the power production but not on tn removal in the system fig 5f when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was less than 1 the system power density increased from 0 816 to 0 962 mw cm 2 and then maintained a relatively stable value as nh4 increased when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was equal to 1 the system power density dropped significantly to 0 760 mw cm 2 when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was larger than 1 the system power density slowly decreased as nh4 increased after six consecutive cycles the tn removal 96 1 and no3 n removal 99 1 as well as the power density 0 972 ma cm 2 remained essentially constant demonstrating the excellent stability of the cell system fig 5g and h this study presents a novel concept of simultaneous energy recovery from no3 n to n2 conversion thereby offering a new solution for the resource based treatment of nitrate wastewater 4 2 urine nfc urine is a major biomass resource containing lots of organic matters urea and polysaccharides maurer et al 2006 urine is one of the main sources of nitrogen accounting for 80 of tn in domestic sewage spångberg et al 2014 billions of tonnes of human urine are released each year and excessive urine discharge can lead to severe nitrogen pollution and even water body eutrophication moreover excess urine can result in effluent with high nitrogen and toc concentrations posing a constant challenge to wastewater treatment plants and environment apart from that urine is dominated by urea and other organic matters which are rich in chemical energy for this reason our group shen et al 2019a developed the urine nfc to achieve urine denitrification and purification with chemical energy recovery providing a new idea for the resourceful application of urine wastewater fig 6a in the simulated urine wastewater experiments the system achieved 99 02 of tn removal and 50 76 of toc removal within 120 min fig 6b with a maximum power density of 2 24 mw cm 2 fig 6c after four consecutive experiments the tn removal efficiency remained at 95 01 indicating the excellent stability of this system fig 6d in the actual urine wastewater experiments the system recorded a maximum power density of 2 51 mw cm 2 fig 6e tn and toc removal efficiencies of 98 6 and 54 55 respectively within 180 min fig 6f this study elucidates a potentially effective and sustainable method for urine resource treatment 4 3 organic amine nfc in practice nitrogen containing wastewater normally comprises highly toxic and non degradable organic nitrogen compounds which causes significant damage to humans and ecosystems organic amines are prime examples of these substances and they pose a considerable difficulty for nitrogen containing wastewater treatment to address this issue an nfc was employed to treat organic amine containing wastewater for removing tn while recovering energy fig 7a zha et al 2022 throughout the process the oxidation of the organic amines released a large number of electrons which could be recovered for electricity generation without the addition of cl methylamine degradation occurred at a high rate but resulted in the conversion of methylamine s nitrogen mainly to nh4 n and no3 n with very low tn removal fig 7b this result indicated that ho could oxidize organic amines to inorganic nitrogen rather than n2 in the presence of cl the formed cl selectively oxidized methylamine to n2 dramatically increasing the tn removal efficiency the cunws cf cathode reached high tn removal rate of 94 93 within 2 h outperforming the cf cathode 72 69 and pt cathode 60 62 this was because the cunws cf cathode could selectively reduce excess no3 n to nh4 n and the nh4 n was then oxidized to n2 by cl after two hours the methylamine removal efficiency reached 100 and the tn and toc removal efficiencies were 94 93 and 58 47 respectively fig 7c during the process a small amount of no3 n and trace amount of nh4 n were produced and then eliminated almost no no2 n was produced and organic amine was completely converted to n2 within 3 h with a maximum power output of 2 49 mw cm 2 fig 7d and e the nfc system yielded satisfactory results when treating other organic amine wastewaters fig 7f using ethylamine and dimethylamine as target pollutants the tn removal efficiencies reached 91 81 and 93 10 and the toc removal efficiencies were 53 57 and 56 71 respectively within 2 h and the corresponding power output maximum are 2 40 and 2 27 mw cm 2 respectively from a view of practical application the actual organic amine wastewater was treated by the nfc system with tn and toc removal efficiencies of 89 46 and 47 31 respectively within 2 h and a maximum power output of 2 33 mw cm 2 suggesting its practical application potential for organic amine wastewater treatment this work highlights an efficient and sustainable method for treating highly toxic and non degradable organic nitrogen wastewater 4 4 organics containing nfc the tn removal from inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater and organic amine wastewater with synchronous chemical energy recovery can be achieved by implementing a cyclic nitrogen depletion system shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhou et al 2022a however nitrogenous wastewater typically contains significant levels of refractory organic matters making it challenging to treat organic matter and nitrogen compound simultaneously for this reason our group zhang et al 2018a initially constructed an organics containing nfc based on prior research using a simple mix of phenol and nh4 n as the wastewater substrate for simultaneous tn removal carbon removal and energy recovery fig 8a after just 90 min of treatment the system effectively removed phenol concomitantly generating low toxicity small molecule organic acids and co2 and achieving 56 2 toc removal 94 1 tn removal and a maximum power density output of 1 23 mw cm 2 fig 8b 8c both phenol degradation and nh4 n oxidation happened at the anode and the effect of the coexisting phenol on no3 n nh4 n degradation was studied obviously no3 n degradation nearly remained unaffected by phenol concentration while nh4 n degradation was more sensitive to phenol concentration fig 8d and 8e nh4 n was completely removed at phenol concentration below 20 mg l 1 however at a phenol concentration of 30 mg l 1 1 8 mg l 1 of nh4 n remained after 90 min of degradation by prolonging the reaction time to 120 min nh4 n could be totally removed the system displays consistent performance over five successive degradation experiments with tn and toc removal efficiencies of 94 1 and 53 5 respectively indicating its excellent stability for the continuous treatment of wastewater containing organics and nitrogen fig 8f 5 conclusions and future perspectives 5 1 conclusions this review provides an overview of nitrogen removal from wastewater based on ho so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 in pc ec pec and other aops systems which are summarized in tables s1 s5 on the basis of the above studies it has been shown that cl clo radicals show extremely high efficiency and n2 selectivity towards nh3 n nh4 n oxidation among the above techniques the pec technique can trigger cl clo generation with higher efficiency while providing eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing solar energy the pec exhaustive tn removal system is designed by integrating cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction in which cl clo generation and no3 n reduction can be strengthened by the design of anode materials such as wo3 tio2 wo3 bivo4 wo3 sb sno2 wo3 ruo2 fto wo3 and cathode materials such as pd cu nf pd au ni cunw cf respectively this system addresses the problem that tn is hard to be completely removed from nitrogenous wastewater via chemical oxidation when introducing the mechanism into pfcs the concept of nfcs is proposed and the nfcs can be applied to treat various types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen for high efficient tn removal organics degradation toxic chlorate control and energy recovery simultaneously in this review the exhaustive tn removal mechanism of peccl system is clarified through recent research progress regarding cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction and the regulatory strategies of function enhancement for photoanodic cl clo generation cathodic no3 n reduction and chlorate byproducts suppression are summarized and investigated these findings provide important theoretical and data support for the practical application of nfcs 5 2 future perspectives the utilization of pec technique holds great promise for the solar powered purification of environmental pollutants particularly for treating refractory organics and nitrogen pollutants to achieve further breakthroughs in pec treatment of complex nitrogen containing wastewater it is crucial to conduct research into new photoanode materials that efficiently induce cl clo generation new cathode materials that effectively reduce no3 n and superior exhaustive tn removal systems based on the findings of this review the following areas of further research should be pursued 1 expand the application scope of nfcs the nitrogen containing wastewater can exhibit a wide range of complicated types and properties by improving the nfcs system researchers can investigate the treatment of more complex nitrogen containing wastewater systems for example xiao et al 2019 conducted a study on the treatment of cu cyanide complexes wastewater by peccl system achieving simultaneous decomplexation of cu cyanide complexes 98 1 cu recovery 96 2 and tn removal 95 6 simultaneously table s3 2 strengthen the cyclic efficiency of cl chlorine radicals and improve the steady state concentrations of cl clo several strategies can be explored in addition to the development of efficient photoanode materials for cl clo generation as discussed earlier one such strategy involves introducing ps or pms to the peccl system to synergistically strengthen cl clo generation for higher steady state concentrations for example hao et al 2021 demonstrated the efficacy of the cobalt doped graphitic carbon nitride co g c3n4 pms cl system where the pms was efficiently activated by the co g c3n4 to generate so4 for oxidizing cl to cl this system achieved 98 3 of nh4 n removal and 76 1 of tn removal table s4 similarly liu and wang 2023 developed the co2 pms cl system where the redox cycle of co2 co3 could efficiently activate pms to generate so4 for oxidizing cl to cl achieving 90 39 of nh4 n removal efficiency with 97 16 of n2 selectivity table s4 in addition to these approaches it has been reported that hclo clo and intermediate nh2cl can dissociate to cl upon uv light irradiation with wavelength of 200 400 nm regions wang et al 2020a xiao et al 2009 therefore introducing the uv chlorine process in the peccl system additional uv light irradiation towards the reactor can improve cl generation 3 the inhibition of chlorate byproducts such as clo3 and clo4 must be considered in peccl system chlorate byproducts are unavoidably generated and even small amounts will pose a risk to the environment compared with cl clo is more beneficial for the highly efficient conversion of nh4 n to n2 clo can be generated by cl or ho oxidation of hclo clo to efficiently increase the concentration of clo it is recommended to strengthen ho generation lu et al 2023 however it is important to note that ho can over oxidize chlorine containing matters leading to the formation of chlorate byproducts which should be avoided therefore it is a more environmentally friendly choice to promoting clo generation by increasing hclo concentration in the peccl system for example by adding additional hclo to the system or developing efficient anode materials such as wo3 sb sno2 zhang et al 2019b and ruo2 fto wo3 shen et al 2020 for hclo generation 4 develop effective alternatives to reactive chlorine species for nfcs for example koo et al 2021 constructed a pec br system with br instead of cl for the conversion of nh4 n to n2 in this system br was oxidized to reactive bromine species br br2 and hobr obr that served as an effective alternative to chlorine disinfectant exhibiting a much higher nh4 n removal efficiency 95 within 120 min than that in the peccl system 16 within 120 min table s3 5 the peccl system can also be applied to treat the wastewater with h containing nitrogen pollutants such as nh4 and urea which enables the simultaneous tn removal and h2 recovery in urine wastewater which contains a significant amount of urea the fuel cell system can effectively degrade urea to remove tn and recover chemical energy shen et al 2019a however the potential of urea as a hydrogen source has been overlooked boggs et al 2009 kim et al 2018 urea decomposition requires only 1 18 of the thermodynamic potential needed for water decomposition eqs 50 and 51 but it generates three times more h2 zhang et al 2022a therefore the use of urea decomposition to produce hydrogen not only reduces energy consumption but also abates the pollution of urea rich wastewater 50 h 2 o 1 2 o 2 h 2 e 0 1 23 v vs rhe 51 co n h 2 2 h 2 o c o 2 n 2 3 h 2 e 0 0 084 v vs rhe however the decomposition of urea into n2 and h2 is a sluggish kinetic process involving 6 electron transport at a slow rate song et al 2019 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2023 cl clo can selectively convert urea to n2 which promotes rapid electron transport and thereby overcomes the slow kinetics of cathodic hydrogen generation fang et al 2020 shen et al 2019a 2019b designing photoanode materials to strengthen cl clo generation and cathode materials to promote no3 n reduction as well as her kinetics is crucial for achieving improved tn removal efficiency and hydrogen production during urea degradation for example our group wang et al 2021b proposed the pec cl system using tio2 wo3 as photoanode and cu nws cf as cathode to treat urine wastewater realizing simultaneous urea degradation 98 3 tn removal 75 3 and hydrogen production 139 μmol within 2 h table s5 we further improved this system by using co3o4 bivo4 photoanode and monicuox cu cathode achieving much higher tn removal 93 6 and hydrogen production 680 μmol within 2 h zhou et al 2023 table s5 6 reactor design of peccl system for example kim et al 2018 2021 utilized a system consisting of anode cell containing urea cathode cell and saline water cell in the middle separated by anion and cation exchange membranes in this setup cl migrated from the middle cell to anode cell and formed cl which realizes desalination of saline water while degrading urea for efficient h2 generation and tn removal table s3 li et al 2020 developed a flow through configuration for peccl system which resulted in a 5 fold increase in nh3 n oxidation rate compared to the conventional batch reactor table s3 this increase in oxidation kinetics was due to the higher flow rate which increased the probability of contact between individual ammonia molecules and the active sites of the photoanode 7 the exhaustive tn removal system achieves complete tn removal in this review however the toc removal efficiency remains very low typically less than 60 to improve the toc removal efficiency the fenton reaction could be introduced to the existing system 8 the pd cu nf and pd au ni cathodes showed excellent activity and selectivity for no3 n reduction in this review however the precious metals such as pd and au are costly future research can focus on developing efficient and inexpensive metal non mental cathodes with high efficient no3 n reduction performance to replace existing cathodes additionally the complex reduction mechanism of no3 n requires further research and analysis including calculation and other characterization to provide guidance for electrode design 9 the design and development of photoanode materials with high solar energy conversion efficiency are crucial for reducing system energy consumption and maintaining a sustainable system this aspect remains the focus of subsequent research 10 the power generation efficiency of nfcs is influenced by wastewater composition pollutant concentration and other factors despite ensuring efficient tn removal further

14855,the excess nitrogen discharge into water bodies has resulted in extensive water pollution and human health risks which has become a critical global issue moreover nitrogenous wastewater contains considerable chemical energy contributed by organic pollutants and nitrogenous compounds therefore the treatment of various kinds of nitrogen containing wastewater for nitrogen removal and energy recovery is of significance biological methode and advanced oxidation processes aops are the main methods for nitrogen removal however biological treatment is easily inhibited by high salinity high ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n nitrite and toxic organics in wastewater which limits its application aops mainly induce in situ generation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 for nitrogen removal nevertheless ho shows low reactivity and n2 selectivity towards nh3 n nh4 n oxidation and so4 also demonstrates unsatisfactory nh3 n nh4 n removal it has been shown that cl clo can efficiently remove nh3 n nh4 n with high n2 selectivity the generation of cl clo can be triggered by various techniques among which the pec technique shows great potential due to its higher efficiency for cl clo generation and eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing solar energy cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n reduction can be strengthened through the design of photoanode and cathode materials respectively coupling with this two pathways an exhaustive total nitrogen tn removal system is designed for complete tn removal when introducing the mechanism into photocatalytic fuel cells pfcs the concept of nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells nfcs is proposed to treat several typical types of nitrogen containing wastewater achieving high efficiency tn removal organics degradation toxic chlorate control and energy recovery simultaneously recent research progress in this field is reviewed summarized and discussed and in depth perspectives are proposed providing new ideas for the resource treatment of nitrogen containing wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n no3 n reduction exhaustive tn removal system energy recovery data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction there exist many types of nitrogen containing wastewater with complex compositions where the nitrogen containing compounds exist in diverse forms nitrogen sources in water bodies can be classified into inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen inorganic nitrogen primarily includes ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n and nitrate nitrite nitrogen no3 n no2 n while organic nitrogen includes urea protein amino acids and organic amines the indiscriminate use of fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock domestic and industrial sources have resulted in extensive water pollution and human health risks tsai et al 2022 yu et al 2019 such as eutrophication zhang et al 2009 and methemoglobinemia reyter et al 2010 which has become a critical global issue moreover nitrogenous wastewater contains considerable chemical energy contributed by pollutants including organic matters such as glucose and phenol eqs 1 and 2 inorganic nitrogen such as nh4 eq 3 urea eq 4 and organic amines such as aniline and methylamine eqs 5 and 6 shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2022a therefore treating nitrogen containing wastewater for

treating nitrogen containing wastewater include biological method hörold et al 1993 physical stripping method marttinen et al 2002 chemical precipitation method zhang et al 2009 membrane separation method chiemchaisri et al 1992 ion exchange method mercer et al 1970 breakpoint chlorination method pressley et al 1972 etc biological treatment is commonly used for converting inorganic nitrogen to n2 through nitrification and denitrification but its application is limited by the factors such as high salinity high nh3 n nh4 n concentration nitrite toxic organic compounds and strict c n ratio chen et al 2011 hörold et al 1993 yang et al 2019 other methods such as physical stripping chemical precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange can remove nh3 n nh4 n efficiently but they cannot convert it to n2 leading to secondary pollution the breakpoint chlorination method can convert nh3 n nh4 n to n2 with high efficiency but it is costly and causes secondary pollution in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have been rapidly developed and gained significant attention ao et al 2021 the main process in most aops is the in situ generation of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 currently ho based processes are the most studied treatments among various aops such as o3 anggo krisbiantoro et al 2020 uv h2o2 huang et al 2008 fenton menon et al 2021 photocatalysis pc feng et al 2021 wang et al 2014a yao et al 2020 and photoelectrocatalysis pec elysabeth et al 2021 wang et al 2021a tables s1 s4 endowed with high oxidation potential 2 8 v vs nhe zhang et al 2021 ho is non selective but high efficient in attacking target contaminants nevertheless nh3 n nh4 n due to its chemically inert property cannot be easily and selectively attacked by ho liu and wang 2023 for example huang et al 2008 studied ho generation by uv h2o2 for nh3 n removal initial concentration 31 mg n l 1 and only 26 4 of nh3 n was removed within 5 h accompanied by the main product of no3 n so4 based aops have also been studied to treat nitrogen containing wastewater in which sulfite persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms was activated to generate so4 for nh3 n nh4 n removal amanollahi et al 2021 fan et al 2019 hao et al 2021 liu and wang 2023 qu et al 2020 sun et al 2022 tables s3 and s4 so4 possesses excellent oxidizing ability with potential of 2 5 3 1 v vs she amanollahi et al 2021 while it still demonstrates unsatisfactory nh3 n nh4 n removal efficiency for example sun et al 2022 studied nh4 n removal within 30 min in a visible light driven marine with cl or freshwater without cl pfc pms system in which the nh4 n removal efficiencies were 95 73 and 22 58 respectively the results indicate that nh4 n removal is dominantly contributed by chlorine radicals instead of so4 recently chlorine radicals based aops have attracted much attention due to their high efficiency and selectivity in converting nh3 n nh4 n into n2 liu and wang 2023 lu et al 2023 wang et al 2023a yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a 2022b zheng et al 2020 2022 zhou et al 2023 2022a tables s1 s5 chlorine radicals have been shown to react more rapidly with electron rich moieties such as nh3 n nh4 n compared to ho zhang et al 2019b 2018b zheng et al 2020 it has been reported that the active free chlorine hclo can also efficiently remove nh3 n nh4 n li and liu 2009 wang et al 2023b zhou et al 2021a the kinetics constants of nh4 n reactions with different types of chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 hclo or ho are as follows k clo 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 k cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 k ho 1 4 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 k hclo 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 kcl2 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 jafvert and valentine 1992 zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore among these active species the generation of cl clo dominated chlorine radicals is required for more efficient nh3 n nh4 n removal chloridion cl a common precursor for cl clo is usually present in industrial wastewater especially in high salinity and high nitrogen wastewater which provides a foundation for in situ generation of cl clo liu and wang 2023 various techniques have been employed to trigger the generation of cl clo including uv nh2cl zhang et al 2019a vacuum uv vuv uv wang et al 2023a ec uv wang et al 2020a xiao et al 2009 ye et al 2016 electrochemistry ec li et al 2019a zhang et al 2022a 2022b zheng et al 2020 pc shi et al 2022 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021d pec ji et al 2017 lu et al 2022 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b 2018b and so4 based aops hao et al 2021 liu and wang 2023 zheng et al 2022 among them pec technique has drawn great attention due to its higher efficiency for cl clo generation and eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing the solar energy wastewater fuel cells wfcs offer the dual benefits of purifying wastewater while recovering energy in recent years microbial fuel cells mfcs have gained attention as they integrate wastewater treatment and energy recovery zeng et al 2018 however mfcs essentially belongs to microbial treatment technology which is limited in treating difficult sewage with high salinity high nitrogen and high toxicity etc moreover the electron transfer process in mfc is complex and slow resulting in low output current low power density large internal resistance long start up time and harsh operating conditions xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 however photocatalytic fuel cells pfcs show great potential in refractory organics degradation and energy recovery due to stronger oxidation capacities of photogenerated holes ho and faster charge transfer process under illumination catalyzed by semiconductor materials zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 compared with mfcs wfcs have the merits of faster electron transfer wider application range and better adaptability to the environment however the existing pfcs still have drawbacks in treating nitrogen containing wastewater the photogenerated holes and ho generated on photoanode surface may directly oxidize nh3 n nh4 n into no3 n no2 n which are difficult to further transform into n2 and remove in pfcs leading to low tn removal based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n the pec system has been shown to achieve complete nh3 n nh4 n removal with more than 80 of n2 selectivity ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b 2022b additionally the approximately 20 of no3 n generated during the process can be efficiently reduced to n2 or nh3 n nh4 n using specific cathodes zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2022a our group has strengthened cl clo generation by designing photoanode materials such as wo3 tio2 wo3 bivo4 wo3 sb sno2 wo3 while also promoting no3 n reduction by designing cathode materials such as pd cu nf and cunw cf the coupling of these two pathways has led to the development of an exhaustive tn removal system capable of treating various types of nitrogen containing wastewater and achieving complete tn removal fang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019b shen et al 2019b 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b 2018b when introducing the nitrogen removal mechanism into pfcs the concept of nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells nfcs is proposed for treating several typical types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen resulting in high efficient tn removal organics purification toxic chlorate control and energy recovery simultaneously shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a zhou et al 2022a this review summarizes and discusses the recent progress in this field 2 mechanism of pec exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n 2 1 mechanism of cl oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n table 1 displays the primary reactions involved in nh4 n degradation by cl in the pec system under the excitation of solar light the photoanode generates electron hole pairs eq 7 with the holes being able to oxidize h2o and cl to ho and cl respectively eqs 8 and 9 cl can react with cl to generate cl2 and a pair of cl2 or cl can react to form cl2 and further to form hclo eqs 10 and 13 the second order reaction rate constant of cl with organics is 3 71 108 1 52 109 m 1 s 1 much higher than that of cl2 4 60 106 3 57 107 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2021 cl cl2 or ho can react with h2o oh or cl to form hclo eqs 14 18 with hclo being converted to cl eq 19 it is known that cl cl2 ho and hclo are strong oxidants capable of reacting with nh4 the kinetic constants for their reactions with nh4 n are as follows k cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 k ho 1 4 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 k hclo 4 2 106 m 1 s 1 kcl2 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 eqs 20 23 it is evident that cl has much higher reactivity towards nh4 n oxidation compared to cl2 ho and hclo cl or cl2 can promote rapid addition hydrogen extraction and direct electron transfer reactions with nh4 n to form a range of free radicals nh2 and nhcl and intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh with the rate constant of cl reaction with nh2cl 2 4 107 m 1 s 1 being higher than that of cl2 6 5 106 m 1 s 1 eqs 22 28 these intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh can further react to form n2 eqs 29 31 indicating that cl is usually the main active chlorine species involved in the oxidation of nh4 n in the process of cl oxidation of nh4 n cl is continuously generated and can be further oxidized to cl thus forming the cl cl cyclic reaction theoretically nh4 n is inclined to be converted to no3 nby ho and nh2 can be finally oxidized to no3 n by ho eqs 32 and 33 2 2 mechanism of clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n owing to the low cl concentration in the system the rate of nh4 n oxidation to n2 is relatively low and the formation of clo is more conducive to the conversion of nh3 n nh4 n to n2 zhang et al 2019b at the photoanode o2 and ho are produced in a competitive process exner et al 2014 it has been found that ho tends to convert cl to hclo and clo instead of cl zhang et al 2019b table 2 shows that clo can be generated by the reactions of cl or ho with hclo clo with the reaction rate constants as high as 3 0 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 0 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 34 37 hua et al 2019 wu et al 2017 clo has a high potential 1 8 v vs nhe and can quickly react with electron rich nh4 n group kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 sun et al 2016 reported that the concentration of clo is 102 103 times that of ho and cl in the uv cl process zheng et al 2020 confirmed the predominance of clo in the ec cl process whose steady state concentrations 8 08 10 13 m are 16 4 26 5 and 1609 5 times those of cl2 ho and cl respectively in some cases clo may exhibit much higher reactivity than cl fang et al 2014 the rate constant of nh4 n oxidation by clo is up to 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 much higher than that of nh4 oxidation by cl 0 26 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 eqs 22 and 38 clo can also oxidize nh2cl to nhcl as shown in eq 39 the subsequent process based on clo reactions is similar to the cl reactions mentioned above where the intermediates nh2cl nhcl2 and noh further react to form n2 eqs 29 31 based on the above discussed it can be conjectured that clo has higher reactivity than cl for nh4 oxidation yan et al 2021 the selection of appropriate photoanode materials is crucial in achieving efficient cl clo formation and controlling the production of toxic chlorate byproducts this is due to the fact that different photoanode materials possess unique band gap and valence band vb edge positions which determines their respective absorption spectra and redox potentials common photoanode materials include tio2 wo3 bivo4 and fe2o3 etc each with distinct energy band structures as illustrated in fig 1a for instance tio2 has a band gap of 3 0 3 2 ev which restricts its absorption to only ultraviolet light zhou et al 2020a 2021c 2020b on the other hand fe2o3 cannot oxidize cl to cl due to its higher vb location compared to e cl cl christoforidis et al 2016 meanwhile wo3 and bivo4 possess smaller band gaps with the capacity of absorbing visible light and their lower vb positions than e cl cl endow them with the ability to oxidize cl to cl ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 therefore wo3 bivo4 and their composites are typically preferred as photoanodes in pec system moreover a composite photoanode consisting of si photovoltaic cells sipvcs connected in series with the photoanode is often used this configuration generates a self biased potential that enhances photogenerated charge separation and improves solar energy utilization while reducing system energy consumption 2 3 mechanism of exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction the cl clo system can selectively oxidize nh3 n nh4 n to n2 but about 20 of nh3 n nh4 n is over oxidized to no3 n which results in incomplete tn removal ji et al 2017 lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2019b recently electrochemical reduction of no3 n has gained significant attention due to its convenience environmental friendliness and low cost su et al 2017 no3 n can be reduced on the cathode electrochemically and the possible reactions are shown in table 3 this process involves a series of possible nitrogen containing intermediates such as no2 no2 n no n2o n2 n2h4 nh2oh and nh4 n liu et al 2021 su et al 2016 firstly no3 n is reduced to no2 which is further reduced to no2 n eqs 40 and 41 subsequently no2 n is reduced to no and no can be directly converted to n2 which can be further reduced to nh4 n eqs 42 44 meanwhile no2 n and no can also be reduced to n2o eqs 45 and 46 n2o can be reduced to nh2oh and n2h4 where nh2oh can be further converted to nh4 n eqs 47 49 the reduction of no3 n strongly depends on the applied potential and electrode materials su et al 2016 by adjusting the applied potential no3 n can be selectively reduced to different products moreover different electrode materials have a significant impact on no3 n reduction products hence selecting appropriate electrode materials and regulating the applied potential can enhance the selectivity of no3 n reduction products researchers have studied a variety of metal cathodes including cu fe al ni zn ag au pt and pd dima et al 2003 estudillo wong et al 2011 katsounaros and kyriacou 2008 lacasa et al 2011 su et al 2016 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2014a among these cathodes cu and fe have been paid the most attention due to their high efficiency and low cost in which cu and its alloys have been considered as the most effective catalysts to promote electrochemically no3 n reduction reyter et al 2008 2010 for example wang et al 2020b prepared the cu cu2o nwas cathode by anodizing copper mesh combined with in situ reduction exhibiting a no3 n conversion efficiency and nh3 selectivity of 97 0 and 81 2 respectively our group zhou et al 2021a developed a novel 3d pd cu oh 2 cf cathode via in situ wet chemical method where cu oh 2 nanowires were grown on cf and further surface electrodeposition of pd was performed exhibiting a 98 8 conversion of no3 n to nh4 n gu et al 2020 prepared a porous and nitrogen doped carbon cathode modified with pd cu nanoparticle alloy pd cu pnc which demonstrated a no3 n conversion efficiency and n2 selectivity of 97 1 and 83 respectively obviously the selectivity of no3 n conversion to n2 can be improved by designing cathode materials however a portion of no3 n is inevitably converted to nh3 n nh4 n resulting in uncomplete tn removal in the system therefore through the design of cathode materials no3 n is selectively reduced to n2 and nh3 n nh4 n at cathode eqs 40 48 and the produced nh3 n nh4 n is subsequently oxidized to n2 by cl clo the tn removal mechanism in this system can be explained as follows i the photoanode produces strong oxidizing cl clo which rapidly react with nh3 n nh4 n to convert it into n2 and a small quantity of no3 n ii the cathode selectively reduces the small amount of no3 n or no3 n existing in the system or no3 n produced by the previous step 1 to n2 and a trace amount of nh3 n nh4 n is generated due to excessive reduction of no3 n iii the nh3 n nh4 n produced in step ii is converted into n2 by step i consequently an exhaustive tn removal system is constructed based on photoanodic nh3 n nh4 n oxidation by cl clo and cathodic no3 n reduction which theoretically enables highly efficient tn removal for treating various nitrogen containing wastewater fig 1b 3 system design of cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction for exhaustive tn removal 3 1 highly selective oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n to n2 by cl clo cl clo can rapidly attack nh4 n to capture h atoms to form n centered radicals nh2 thus quickly converting nh4 n into n2 wang et al 2016 in 2017 our group ji et al 2017 designed a pec cl system for highly selective conversion of nh4 n to n2 by cl using wo3 as photoanode the nh4 n removal mechanism in this system is shown in fig 2a where cl selectively converts nh4 n to n2 along with generation of a small amount of no3 n fig 2b shows the nh4 n degradation process by electrocatalytic ec photocatalytic pc and pec systems with or without cl the nh4 n was hardly degraded by the pccl or eccl system the nh4 n degradation efficiency was improved to 9 6 within 90 min by pec system because the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is inhibited when the potential is applied however the nh4 n could be completely removed within 90 min by peccl system indicating that cl plays a crucial role in degrading nh4 n moreover the parameters such as the applied potential cl concentration and ph have important effects on nh4 n removal and need to be discussed and optimized with the increase of cl concentration or the decrease of ph value the nh4 n degradation rate increased gradually this is because a higher cl concentration will produce more cl and accelerate nh4 n degradation a smaller ph will generate more h and the photoinduced electrons reach the cathode through the external circuit to reduce h to h2 which effectively promotes the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs generating more holes to strengthen cl generation for nh4 n degradation however the degradation products of nh4 n were mainly n2 and no3 n in which the n2 yield first increased and then decreased with increased cl concentration or decreased ph value when the cl concentration was 400 mg l 1 cl nh4 20 and ph was 4 the tn removal efficiency reached the maximum of 79 9 fig 2c the radical quenching experiments were used to characterize the types of free radicals for nh4 n degradation in which tert butyl alcohol tba was used as the quench agent for cl and ho and nitrobenzene nb was used as the quench agent for ho ji et al 2017 the experimental results show that cl is the main free radical responsible for nh4 n degradation the nh4 n degradation efficiency remained basically unchanged after five times of consecutive tests with 20 mg l 1 nh4 n added into the system every 90 min without additional cl added suggesting the excellent stability of this system fig 2g the photoanode materials significantly affect the tn removal efficiency for nh4 n degradation in peccl system the tn removal efficiency of wo3 photoanode system is better than that of the reported to2 photoanode systems livolsi et al 2023 wang et al 2014b xiao et al 2016 for example wang et al 2014b previously studied the nh4 n removal using tio2 nanotube arrays tio2 nts as photoanode in pec cl system which showed 99 of nh4 n removal with a low n2 selectivity 50 8 of within 2 h fig 2h recently zheng et al 2022 prepared the chemical reduced bivo4 r bivo4 photoanode using nabh4 as reductant which showed excellent performance in the pec cl system for selective degradation of nh3 n to n2 from saline sewage the reactive chlorine species cl clo hclo produced in this system are responsible for the high selectivity of nh3 n degradation in which cl is the dominant reactive species in removing nh3 n due to its adequate generation fig 2f the nh3 n removal efficiency of the r bivo4 system 100 within 40 min is much better than that of the bivo4 system 50 within 40 min which is ascribed to the improved pec reactivity via the chemical reduction process that induces oxygen vacancies into bivo4 fig 2g during the nh3 n degradation 91 6 of nh3 n was converted into n2 accompanied by no3 n 8 4 of initial nh3 n as the major degradation byproduct of nh3 n in sewage fig 2h meanwhile the composition of wastewater may also affect the nh4 n degradation efficiency for example zhang et al 2020 studied the co degradation of 4 chlorophenol and nh4 n in wastewater by the pec system finding that nh4 n removal increased from 62 to 95 within 2 5 h when 4 chlorophenol simultaneously existed in wastewater during 4 chlorophenol degradation by photogenerated holes and ho cl was generated as a degradation product which could form cl for contributing to nh4 n degradation in 2019 our group zhang et al 2019b developed a novel double sided electrode structure with wo3 photoanode in front and sb doped tin oxide sb sno2 anode at the back for in situ generation of clo clo can quickly decompose nh4 n into n2 which is more efficient than the previous cl reactions the sb sno2 is an ideal material for the generation of hclo due to its good chlorine evolution potential yang et al 2014b zhang et al 2019b ho generated on wo3 reacts with hclo generated on sb sno2 to produce clo fig 2i the nh4 n degradation efficiency by sb sno2 wo3 system was 99 2 which is 2 38 and 2 90 times that of wo3 and sb sno2 systems respectively fig 2j the electron spin resonance esr technique using dmpo as trapping agent confirmed the presence of the main ho and clo signals as well as the weak cl signal for the sb sno2 wo3 system hao et al 2019 xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2018b free radical quenching experiments using tba as the quench agent for ho cl and clo cheng et al 2013 and hco3 as the quench agent for ho and cl guo et al 2017 supported the leading role of clo in nh4 n degradation moreover this system still maintained a high nh4 n removal efficiency 100 after 5 times of consecutive runs indicating the excellent stability of sb sno2 wo3 electrode the actual wastewater was treated by sb sno2 wo3 system with 81 2 of the tn removal within 90 min fig 2k the above studies indicate that the sb sno2 wo3 system can efficiently convert nh4 n to n2 by generating clo recent studies by lu et al 2022 demonstrated the use of oxygen vacancies containing tio2 nanotubes tnts photoanode and graphite cathode in pec cl system for nh4 n degradation in which clo dominated the 81 06 of nh4 n degradation with 86 of n2 selectivity within 90 min in a later study lu et al 2023 improved this system by using ni modified graphite felt ni gf cathode to strengthen h2o2 generation which improved ho yield and consequentially induced more clo generated by the quenching of ho with free chlorine contributing to higher nh4 n removal efficiency fig 2l the ni loadings of ni gf cathode significantly influenced the nh4 n removal and the 10 0 wt ni gf cathode system showed the best nh4 n degradation efficiency which is due to the fact that 10 0 wt ni gf cathode strengthens more h2o2 generation and thus induces more ho for clo formation fig 2m during the nh4 n degradation in the 10 0 wt ni gf cathode system 96 1 of nh4 n was selectively converted to n2 within 90 min without no3 n no2 n detected fig 2n the method described in this study has several advantages firstly it produces cl in situ eliminating the need for continuous cl addition secondly the cl cl system is always cyclic without the need for external intervention although molecular chlorine cl2 probably may be inevitably generated due to the combination of two cl or cl2 eqs 11 and 12 the loss of total cl in this system can remain low even after nh4 n depletion this is because the produced cl2 is hydrolyzed to form hclo clo eqs 13 20 24 27 34 37 which rapidly reacts and accelerates the recycling of chloride preventing cl2 from escaping into the air for example xiao et al 2009 investigated the combination of electrochemical and ultraviolet light irradiation upe process using iro2 ti anode and ti mesh cathode in the presence of cl for nh3 n degradation they found that the loss ratio of total cl decreased from 21 0 to 7 2 in the upe process implying that the recycle of chloride was accelerated and the elapse of cl2 decreased significantly compared to the electrochemical e process additionally the cl concentration required for the system is as low as 0 05 m table s5 which is equivalent to 1 10 of the cl concentration in seawater 0 5 m ji et al 2017 finally the selectivity and high rate of cl reaction with nh4 n means that the reaction process produces relatively few chlorinated organic compounds thereby reducing environmental risk ji et al 2017 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2018a 2018b 3 2 exhaustive tn removal based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction based on cl clo system nh4 n could be converted to n2 with the selectivity of more than 80 while 20 no3 n was generated resulting in incomplete tn removal zhang et al 2019b 2018b meanwhile this system is not efficient in removing tn from nitrate wastewater in 2018 our group zhang et al 2018b designed an exhaustive tn removal system by using pd cu modified foam ni cathode pd cu ni to reduce the redundant no3 n to n2 the sem images of nf and pd cu nf electrodes are presented in fig 3a and 3b respectively which show that the pd cu particles uniformly cover the surface of nf with a particle size of 150 nm the mechanism of exhaustive tn removal in this system involves cyclic reactions of cl oxidation of nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction fig 3c zhang et al 2018b the no3 n reduction of pd cu nf cathode could reach 100 within 90 min which is higher than that of pd nf 68 7 cu nf 60 7 nf 21 and pt 11 0 cathodes demonstrating excellent no3 n reduction activity of pd cu nf cathode fig 3d fig 3e shows that no3 n could be completely removed within 90 min and no2 n was almost not generated while nh4 n concentration first increased and then gradually decreased to almost 0 below the detection limit with a tn removal of up to 98 2 fig 3f shows that the degradation efficiency of nh4 n in this system reached 99 within 90 min detection of intermediate products during nh4 n oxidation indicates that no2 n was hardly detected while the concentration of no3 n first increased and then gradually decreased to almost 0 with a tn removal of 97 4 these results indicate that the exhaustive tn removal system can completely transform no3 n or nh4 n into n2 the species of free radicals were determined using esr technique with dmpo as trapping agent in the absence of cl four peaks with 1 2 2 1 intensity were detected proving the presence of ho xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2018b the addition of cl resulted in the observation of 11 line esr spectrum indicating the simultaneous presence of ho and cl in the system li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b treatment of wastewater containing different proportions of inorganic nitrogen was further investigated fig 3g the tn removal efficiency was slightly reduced when the wastewater contained both no3 and nh4 particularly the efficiency was the lowest 93 1 within 90 min when the ratio was 1 1 the reduction rate of no3 n decreased when nh4 was present on one hand nh4 n oxidation on the photoanode contributed to more no3 n on the other hand h produced during nh4 n oxidation competed with no3 n on the cathode the system effectively treated the wastewater containing various inorganic nitrogen no2 no3 nh4 when the ratio of no2 no3 and nh4 was 1 1 1 the tn removal efficiency was 98 4 within 90 min indicating the system s potential to treat complex nitrogen containing wastewater the tn removal efficiency maintained at the first level 94 2 after five times of successive experiments indicating the excellent stability of pd cu nf cathode fig 3h the exhaustive tn removal system based on cl oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction was used to treat urine wastewater shen et al 2019b different kinds of organic amine wastewater li et al 2019b and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen tang et al 2020 in which the tn removal efficiencies were 99 37 within 2 h 92 37 99 20 within 2 5 h and 99 9 within 3 h respectively table s5 based on the rapid conversion of nh4 n to n2 through clo oxidation using sb sno2 wo3 anode and the high efficient no3 n reduction by pd cu nf cathode an exhaustive tn removal system was designed fig 3i zhang et al 2019b the tn removal efficiency in this system was 98 4 within 90 min which is 2 1 times that of the system using wo3 as photoanode 47 1 fig 3j later li et al 2020 presented a clo mediated pec flow through configuration system of ag tio2 nts photoanode and pd cu nf cathode for highly efficient nh4 n removal from water fig 3k in this system the nh4 n was completely removed with a high n2 conversion of more than 92 within 15 min fig 3l the exhaustive tn removal system based on clo oxidation of nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction was used to treat urine wastewater shen et al 2020 wastewater containing organics and nitrogen huang et al 2020 in which the tn removal efficiencies were 99 74 and 99 0 respectively within 1 h these works suggest that the exhaustive tn removal system based on cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and cathodic no3 n reduction has the potential to treat more complex nitrogen containing wastewater with high efficiency 3 3 control of toxic chlorate byproducts the exhaustive tn removal has been realized by developing the pec system that utilizes photoanodic nh4 n oxidation by cl clo and cathodic no3 n reduction however the over oxidation of cl by a large amount of ho generated in the system can lead to the formation of toxic chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 byproducts posing a great risk to practical applications for example degradation of contaminants using wo3 as photoanode in pec system produced 30 150 mg l 1 chlorate koo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b clo3 can severely damage red blood cells while clo4 inhibits the absorption of iodine affecting thyroid hormone synthesis and potentially causing cancer azizi et al 2011 constantinou et al 2019 jasper et al 2017 to address this issue our group zhang et al 2021 first proposed a new method for designing bivo4 wo3 heterojunction photoanode by fine tuning the vb position the oxidation capacity of holes can be adjusted to promote the selective oxidation of cl to cl instead of clo3 or clo4 the vb edge of wo3 is 3 0 v vs nhe koo et al 2019 which is higher than the potential of e 0 ho h2o 2 8 v vs nhe leading to the generation of a large amount of ho that causes the over oxidation of nh4 n and cl on the other hand the vb edge of bivo4 is located at 2 5 v vs nhe and cannot oxidize oh to ho zhou et al 2021b 2022b the energy band matching of bivo4 and wo3 allows the construction of bivo4 wo3 heterojunction that can regulate the oxidation ability of holes to avoid chlorate generation furthermore the bivo4 wo3 heterojunction improves the electron transport visible light absorption and electrode stability the sipvcs were used in combination with bivo4 wo3 to form composite photoanode this system is capable of achieving self driven degradation of nh4 n while suppressing the production of toxic chlorate byproducts fig 4a the concentration of no3 n gradually increased during nh4 n degradation and almost no no2 n was generated resulting in a tn removal efficiency of 80 1 within 2 h fig 4b meanwhile the chlorate concentration produced in wo3 bivo4 system was only 18 3 mg l 1 which is lower than that of wo3 system 73 mg l 1 resulting in 79 inhibition fig 4c the cumulative concentration of ho in the bivo4 wo3 system 0 13 mm within 75 min was much lower than that in the wo3 system 0 62 mm within 75 min indicating that the wo3 bivo4 heterojunction construction inhibited ho generation thus effectively suppressing chlorate formation fig 4d moreover the use of bivo4 wo3 could suppress 31 of nitrate formation compared to pristine wo3 due to the mild oxidation ability of holes generated by bivo4 wo3 which prevented nh4 n from being overoxidized to further improve the tn removal efficiency the pt cathode was replaced by the pd cu nf cathode to construct a cyclic nitrogen removal system as shown in fig 4e fang et al 2020 the tn removal efficiency could reach 97 1 within 90 min fig 4f in addition the chlorate and nitrate produced by the wo3 bivo4 system were suppressed by 61 and 44 respectively the improved nitrate inhibition from 31 to 44 in this system is ascribed to the pd cu nf cathode that promotes no3 n reduction besides li et al 2021 investigated the formation of reactive chlorine species and toxic oxychlorides in peccl system using three typical photoanodes tio2 wo3 and bivo4 the phenol removal and toxic clo3 formation by different photoanodes were compared the photoanodes showed the phenol removal rates as follows wo3 bivo4 tio2 fig 4g however more than 2 mg l 1 clo3 was detected in wo3 and tio2 systems within 2 h which is over 10 times higher than that of bivo4 system fig 4h bivo4 photoanode possess moderate valence band maximum vbm which endows the holes with relatively weak oxidizing capacity restricting ho production and thereby inducing the formation of non ho mediated active chlorine species instead of poisonous clo3 in this system fig 4i however tio2 or wo3 photoanode possesses large vbm that enables the holes to oxidize h2o to ho resulting in a significant number of clo3 produced in this system the above works provide foundation for the inhibition of toxic chlorate byproducts in the practical applications of peccl system for harmless processing of nitrogen containing wastewater which shows potential of mitigating risks to the environment 4 design of nitrogen containing wastewater fuel cells nfcs with the design of exhaustive tn removal system by strengthening photoanodic cl clo generation for nh3 n nh4 n oxidation and promoting cathodic no3 n reduction the above works have realized complete tn removal for treating vrious nitrogen containing wastewater when incorporating the denitrogenation mechanism into the pfcs the concept of nfcs is proposed to treat several typical types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen realizing high efficiency tn removal organics purification and chemical energy recovery simultaneously 4 1 inorganic nitrogen nfc based on the above works our group zhou et al 2022a designed a novel inorganic nitrogen nfc that utilized the copper nanowires growing in situ on copper foam electrode cnw cf as denitrification cathode to achieve tn removal and energy recovery of nitrate fig 5a showed the preparation process and the corresponding sem images of the cnw cf cathode where the copper nanowires with diameters ranging from 50 to150 nm were uniformly arranged on the substrate the no3 n was high selectively reduced to nh4 n instead of n2 by cnw cf and the nh4 n was completely converted to n2 by the nfc system fig 5b meanwhile the electrons generated during nh4 n oxidation process were transferred to the cathode forming a closed loop circuit for external electricity production as shown in fig 5c the cnw cf cathode demonstrated superior no3 n reduction capability with complete no3 n removal within 45 min surpassing that of pt and cf cathodes less than 15 within 90 min no3 n reduction is an exothermic process allowing for the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy cotchim et al 2015 djerdjev et al 2021 nox n was almost completely eliminated within 45 min while the concentration of nh4 n increased and then fell below the detection limit within 90 min which realized complete tn removal fig 5d the maximum power density of this system was 0 973 mw cm 2 at 15 min progressively decreasing as the chemical energy of the system was depleted with the generation and conversion of nitrogen containing species to n2 the results indicated that no3 was the key parameter for power generation when no3 was not introduced the power density was 0 688 mw cm 2 which was caused by the photovoltage produced by sipvc however the addition of no3 increased the power to 0 973 mw cm 2 fig 5e the ratio of no3 and nh4 also had a significant impact on the power production but not on tn removal in the system fig 5f when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was less than 1 the system power density increased from 0 816 to 0 962 mw cm 2 and then maintained a relatively stable value as nh4 increased when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was equal to 1 the system power density dropped significantly to 0 760 mw cm 2 when the ratio of nh4 to no3 was larger than 1 the system power density slowly decreased as nh4 increased after six consecutive cycles the tn removal 96 1 and no3 n removal 99 1 as well as the power density 0 972 ma cm 2 remained essentially constant demonstrating the excellent stability of the cell system fig 5g and h this study presents a novel concept of simultaneous energy recovery from no3 n to n2 conversion thereby offering a new solution for the resource based treatment of nitrate wastewater 4 2 urine nfc urine is a major biomass resource containing lots of organic matters urea and polysaccharides maurer et al 2006 urine is one of the main sources of nitrogen accounting for 80 of tn in domestic sewage spångberg et al 2014 billions of tonnes of human urine are released each year and excessive urine discharge can lead to severe nitrogen pollution and even water body eutrophication moreover excess urine can result in effluent with high nitrogen and toc concentrations posing a constant challenge to wastewater treatment plants and environment apart from that urine is dominated by urea and other organic matters which are rich in chemical energy for this reason our group shen et al 2019a developed the urine nfc to achieve urine denitrification and purification with chemical energy recovery providing a new idea for the resourceful application of urine wastewater fig 6a in the simulated urine wastewater experiments the system achieved 99 02 of tn removal and 50 76 of toc removal within 120 min fig 6b with a maximum power density of 2 24 mw cm 2 fig 6c after four consecutive experiments the tn removal efficiency remained at 95 01 indicating the excellent stability of this system fig 6d in the actual urine wastewater experiments the system recorded a maximum power density of 2 51 mw cm 2 fig 6e tn and toc removal efficiencies of 98 6 and 54 55 respectively within 180 min fig 6f this study elucidates a potentially effective and sustainable method for urine resource treatment 4 3 organic amine nfc in practice nitrogen containing wastewater normally comprises highly toxic and non degradable organic nitrogen compounds which causes significant damage to humans and ecosystems organic amines are prime examples of these substances and they pose a considerable difficulty for nitrogen containing wastewater treatment to address this issue an nfc was employed to treat organic amine containing wastewater for removing tn while recovering energy fig 7a zha et al 2022 throughout the process the oxidation of the organic amines released a large number of electrons which could be recovered for electricity generation without the addition of cl methylamine degradation occurred at a high rate but resulted in the conversion of methylamine s nitrogen mainly to nh4 n and no3 n with very low tn removal fig 7b this result indicated that ho could oxidize organic amines to inorganic nitrogen rather than n2 in the presence of cl the formed cl selectively oxidized methylamine to n2 dramatically increasing the tn removal efficiency the cunws cf cathode reached high tn removal rate of 94 93 within 2 h outperforming the cf cathode 72 69 and pt cathode 60 62 this was because the cunws cf cathode could selectively reduce excess no3 n to nh4 n and the nh4 n was then oxidized to n2 by cl after two hours the methylamine removal efficiency reached 100 and the tn and toc removal efficiencies were 94 93 and 58 47 respectively fig 7c during the process a small amount of no3 n and trace amount of nh4 n were produced and then eliminated almost no no2 n was produced and organic amine was completely converted to n2 within 3 h with a maximum power output of 2 49 mw cm 2 fig 7d and e the nfc system yielded satisfactory results when treating other organic amine wastewaters fig 7f using ethylamine and dimethylamine as target pollutants the tn removal efficiencies reached 91 81 and 93 10 and the toc removal efficiencies were 53 57 and 56 71 respectively within 2 h and the corresponding power output maximum are 2 40 and 2 27 mw cm 2 respectively from a view of practical application the actual organic amine wastewater was treated by the nfc system with tn and toc removal efficiencies of 89 46 and 47 31 respectively within 2 h and a maximum power output of 2 33 mw cm 2 suggesting its practical application potential for organic amine wastewater treatment this work highlights an efficient and sustainable method for treating highly toxic and non degradable organic nitrogen wastewater 4 4 organics containing nfc the tn removal from inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater and organic amine wastewater with synchronous chemical energy recovery can be achieved by implementing a cyclic nitrogen depletion system shen et al 2019a zha et al 2022 zhou et al 2022a however nitrogenous wastewater typically contains significant levels of refractory organic matters making it challenging to treat organic matter and nitrogen compound simultaneously for this reason our group zhang et al 2018a initially constructed an organics containing nfc based on prior research using a simple mix of phenol and nh4 n as the wastewater substrate for simultaneous tn removal carbon removal and energy recovery fig 8a after just 90 min of treatment the system effectively removed phenol concomitantly generating low toxicity small molecule organic acids and co2 and achieving 56 2 toc removal 94 1 tn removal and a maximum power density output of 1 23 mw cm 2 fig 8b 8c both phenol degradation and nh4 n oxidation happened at the anode and the effect of the coexisting phenol on no3 n nh4 n degradation was studied obviously no3 n degradation nearly remained unaffected by phenol concentration while nh4 n degradation was more sensitive to phenol concentration fig 8d and 8e nh4 n was completely removed at phenol concentration below 20 mg l 1 however at a phenol concentration of 30 mg l 1 1 8 mg l 1 of nh4 n remained after 90 min of degradation by prolonging the reaction time to 120 min nh4 n could be totally removed the system displays consistent performance over five successive degradation experiments with tn and toc removal efficiencies of 94 1 and 53 5 respectively indicating its excellent stability for the continuous treatment of wastewater containing organics and nitrogen fig 8f 5 conclusions and future perspectives 5 1 conclusions this review provides an overview of nitrogen removal from wastewater based on ho so4 and chlorine radicals cl clo cl2 in pc ec pec and other aops systems which are summarized in tables s1 s5 on the basis of the above studies it has been shown that cl clo radicals show extremely high efficiency and n2 selectivity towards nh3 n nh4 n oxidation among the above techniques the pec technique can trigger cl clo generation with higher efficiency while providing eco friendly approach for pollutants degradation and energy recovery by utilizing solar energy the pec exhaustive tn removal system is designed by integrating cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction in which cl clo generation and no3 n reduction can be strengthened by the design of anode materials such as wo3 tio2 wo3 bivo4 wo3 sb sno2 wo3 ruo2 fto wo3 and cathode materials such as pd cu nf pd au ni cunw cf respectively this system addresses the problem that tn is hard to be completely removed from nitrogenous wastewater via chemical oxidation when introducing the mechanism into pfcs the concept of nfcs is proposed and the nfcs can be applied to treat various types of nitrogen containing wastewater including inorganic nitrogen wastewater urine wastewater organic amine wastewater and wastewater containing organics and nitrogen for high efficient tn removal organics degradation toxic chlorate control and energy recovery simultaneously in this review the exhaustive tn removal mechanism of peccl system is clarified through recent research progress regarding cl clo oxidation of nh3 n nh4 n and no3 n reduction and the regulatory strategies of function enhancement for photoanodic cl clo generation cathodic no3 n reduction and chlorate byproducts suppression are summarized and investigated these findings provide important theoretical and data support for the practical application of nfcs 5 2 future perspectives the utilization of pec technique holds great promise for the solar powered purification of environmental pollutants particularly for treating refractory organics and nitrogen pollutants to achieve further breakthroughs in pec treatment of complex nitrogen containing wastewater it is crucial to conduct research into new photoanode materials that efficiently induce cl clo generation new cathode materials that effectively reduce no3 n and superior exhaustive tn removal systems based on the findings of this review the following areas of further research should be pursued 1 expand the application scope of nfcs the nitrogen containing wastewater can exhibit a wide range of complicated types and properties by improving the nfcs system researchers can investigate the treatment of more complex nitrogen containing wastewater systems for example xiao et al 2019 conducted a study on the treatment of cu cyanide complexes wastewater by peccl system achieving simultaneous decomplexation of cu cyanide complexes 98 1 cu recovery 96 2 and tn removal 95 6 simultaneously table s3 2 strengthen the cyclic efficiency of cl chlorine radicals and improve the steady state concentrations of cl clo several strategies can be explored in addition to the development of efficient photoanode materials for cl clo generation as discussed earlier one such strategy involves introducing ps or pms to the peccl system to synergistically strengthen cl clo generation for higher steady state concentrations for example hao et al 2021 demonstrated the efficacy of the cobalt doped graphitic carbon nitride co g c3n4 pms cl system where the pms was efficiently activated by the co g c3n4 to generate so4 for oxidizing cl to cl this system achieved 98 3 of nh4 n removal and 76 1 of tn removal table s4 similarly liu and wang 2023 developed the co2 pms cl system where the redox cycle of co2 co3 could efficiently activate pms to generate so4 for oxidizing cl to cl achieving 90 39 of nh4 n removal efficiency with 97 16 of n2 selectivity table s4 in addition to these approaches it has been reported that hclo clo and intermediate nh2cl can dissociate to cl upon uv light irradiation with wavelength of 200 400 nm regions wang et al 2020a xiao et al 2009 therefore introducing the uv chlorine process in the peccl system additional uv light irradiation towards the reactor can improve cl generation 3 the inhibition of chlorate byproducts such as clo3 and clo4 must be considered in peccl system chlorate byproducts are unavoidably generated and even small amounts will pose a risk to the environment compared with cl clo is more beneficial for the highly efficient conversion of nh4 n to n2 clo can be generated by cl or ho oxidation of hclo clo to efficiently increase the concentration of clo it is recommended to strengthen ho generation lu et al 2023 however it is important to note that ho can over oxidize chlorine containing matters leading to the formation of chlorate byproducts which should be avoided therefore it is a more environmentally friendly choice to promoting clo generation by increasing hclo concentration in the peccl system for example by adding additional hclo to the system or developing efficient anode materials such as wo3 sb sno2 zhang et al 2019b and ruo2 fto wo3 shen et al 2020 for hclo generation 4 develop effective alternatives to reactive chlorine species for nfcs for example koo et al 2021 constructed a pec br system with br instead of cl for the conversion of nh4 n to n2 in this system br was oxidized to reactive bromine species br br2 and hobr obr that served as an effective alternative to chlorine disinfectant exhibiting a much higher nh4 n removal efficiency 95 within 120 min than that in the peccl system 16 within 120 min table s3 5 the peccl system can also be applied to treat the wastewater with h containing nitrogen pollutants such as nh4 and urea which enables the simultaneous tn removal and h2 recovery in urine wastewater which contains a significant amount of urea the fuel cell system can effectively degrade urea to remove tn and recover chemical energy shen et al 2019a however the potential of urea as a hydrogen source has been overlooked boggs et al 2009 kim et al 2018 urea decomposition requires only 1 18 of the thermodynamic potential needed for water decomposition eqs 50 and 51 but it generates three times more h2 zhang et al 2022a therefore the use of urea decomposition to produce hydrogen not only reduces energy consumption but also abates the pollution of urea rich wastewater 50 h 2 o 1 2 o 2 h 2 e 0 1 23 v vs rhe 51 co n h 2 2 h 2 o c o 2 n 2 3 h 2 e 0 0 084 v vs rhe however the decomposition of urea into n2 and h2 is a sluggish kinetic process involving 6 electron transport at a slow rate song et al 2019 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2023 cl clo can selectively convert urea to n2 which promotes rapid electron transport and thereby overcomes the slow kinetics of cathodic hydrogen generation fang et al 2020 shen et al 2019a 2019b designing photoanode materials to strengthen cl clo generation and cathode materials to promote no3 n reduction as well as her kinetics is crucial for achieving improved tn removal efficiency and hydrogen production during urea degradation for example our group wang et al 2021b proposed the pec cl system using tio2 wo3 as photoanode and cu nws cf as cathode to treat urine wastewater realizing simultaneous urea degradation 98 3 tn removal 75 3 and hydrogen production 139 μmol within 2 h table s5 we further improved this system by using co3o4 bivo4 photoanode and monicuox cu cathode achieving much higher tn removal 93 6 and hydrogen production 680 μmol within 2 h zhou et al 2023 table s5 6 reactor design of peccl system for example kim et al 2018 2021 utilized a system consisting of anode cell containing urea cathode cell and saline water cell in the middle separated by anion and cation exchange membranes in this setup cl migrated from the middle cell to anode cell and formed cl which realizes desalination of saline water while degrading urea for efficient h2 generation and tn removal table s3 li et al 2020 developed a flow through configuration for peccl system which resulted in a 5 fold increase in nh3 n oxidation rate compared to the conventional batch reactor table s3 this increase in oxidation kinetics was due to the higher flow rate which increased the probability of contact between individual ammonia molecules and the active sites of the photoanode 7 the exhaustive tn removal system achieves complete tn removal in this review however the toc removal efficiency remains very low typically less than 60 to improve the toc removal efficiency the fenton reaction could be introduced to the existing system 8 the pd cu nf and pd au ni cathodes showed excellent activity and selectivity for no3 n reduction in this review however the precious metals such as pd and au are costly future research can focus on developing efficient and inexpensive metal non mental cathodes with high efficient no3 n reduction performance to replace existing cathodes additionally the complex reduction mechanism of no3 n requires further research and analysis including calculation and other characterization to provide guidance for electrode design 9 the design and development of photoanode materials with high solar energy conversion efficiency are crucial for reducing system energy consumption and maintaining a sustainable system this aspect remains the focus of subsequent research 10 the power generation efficiency of nfcs is influenced by wastewater composition pollutant concentration and other factors despite ensuring efficient tn removal further

14856,singlet oxygen 1o2 attracts much attention in persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops because of its wide ph tolerance and high selectivity toward electron rich organics however there are conflicts about the 1o2 role in ps aops on several aspects including the formation of different key reactive oxygen species ros at similar active sites ph dependence broad spectrum activity and selectivity in the elimination of organic pollutants to a large degree these conflicts root in the drawbacks of the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 for example the quenchers of 1o2 have high reactivity to other ros and persulfate as well in addition electron transfer process etp also selectively oxidizes organics having a misleading effect on the identification of 1o2 therefore in this review we summarized and discussed some basic properties of 1o2 the debatable role of 1o2 in ps aops on multiple aspects and the methods and their drawbacks to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 on the whole this review aims to better understand the role of 1o2 in ps aops and further help with its reasonable utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords singlet oxygen peroxymonosulfate peroxydisulfate electron paramagnetic resonance quenching experiment overestimation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops have developed rapidly over the past decade in the early period ps aops become attractive because of the superior redox potential and lifetime of so4 2 5 3 1 v 30 40 μs than ho 1 8 2 7 v 1 μs ike et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 xiao et al 2018 however more and more studies find that so4 is not the dominant reactive oxygen species ros lee et al 2020 wu and kim 2022 zhang et al 2021b nonradical pathways including singlet 1o2 and electron transfer process etp play a vital role in some ps aops ren et al 2022 xiao et al 2021 owing to its long lifetime wide ph tolerance and high selectivity toward electron rich organics luo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a xiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2020a 1o2 receives much attention in the elimination of organic pollutants some researchers have designed catalysts to 100 or nearly 100 generate 1o2 by triggering persulfate for the effective removal of organic pollutants mi et al 2021 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2023 zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 in 1o2 dominated ps aops a lot of kinds of organics can be efficiently removed including but not limited to phenolic substances sulfonamides dyes tetracyclines and quinolones gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2022d zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 however some of these organics such as bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen are reported to have low second order reaction rate constants with 1o2 k1o2 lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a generally 1o2 can remove deprotonated organics alkaline environment much better li et al 2020a but in some 1o2 dominated ps aops ph has no influence on the removal of organics or just inhibits their removal in alkaline environments gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 this conflict might be that the generation of 1o2 is affected by ph li et al 2019b lu et al 2022 tian et al 2021 besides it is found that 1o2 can be generated on m nx m fe or co sites wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 whereas there are studies using catalysts containing m nx but radicals and high valent iron oxo species feho contribute to the removal of pollutants rather than 1o2 qian et al 2021 xue et al 2021 according to the above contents non negligible conflicts of 1o2 exist in ps aops in several aspects electron paramagnetic resonance epr and quenching tests have been widely used to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 apart from the above conflicts as several drawbacks of epr and quenching tests are found the role of 1o2 in some ps aops might be overestimated gao et al 2022c lu et al 2020 yun et al 2018 the related drawbacks are as follows firstly 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl tempo is not solely from the oxidation of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp by 1o2 lu et al 2020 nardi et al 2014 secondly as the quenchers of 1o2 l histidine and sodium azide nan3 can directly consume peroxymonosulfate liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 thirdly even in presence of excessive quenchers of radicals so4 and ho the removal of organics which have high second order reaction rate constants with so4 or ho cannot be significantly suppressed gao et al 2022c fourthly etp has been proven to be the main way of organics removal in some ps aops but this way cannot be identified by epr and quenching tests ren et al 2022 wang et al 2022c yang et al 2022a yun et al 2018 noting that etp dominated ps aops also have high selectivity to degrade organics ren et al 2022 yang et al 2022a thus in some reported 1o2 dominated systems if methods were not taken to identify etp the role of 1o2 might be overestimated revealing the key ros in ps aops helps design highly efficient catalysts as a kind of attractive ros the 1o2 role in ps aops might be overestimated having the potential to mislead the development of efficient catalysts thereby aiming to help researchers to have a clearer understanding of the 1o2 role this review focuses on the basic properties of 1o2 the debatable aspects of 1o2 in ps aops and the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 2 the basic properties of 1o2 and its formation in ps aops 2 1 electronic structure redox potential and lifetime of 1o2 1o2 involves various excited states of o2 3 σ g 0 kj mol with two electrons having opposite spins in π antibonding orbitals and o 2 1 δ g 95 kj mol and o 2 1 σ g 159 kj mol are the two low lying singlet excited states fig 1 derosa 2002 schweitzer and schmidt 2003 because the lifetime of o 2 1 σ g is smaller than 1 ns al nu airat et al 2021 it is hard to play an important role in the elimination of organic pollutants the relaxation of o 2 1 δ g back to ground state is spin forbidden which makes o 2 1 δ g has a relatively long lifetime thus 1o2 usually represents o 2 1 δ g generally the higher the redox potential the ros has the stronger ability it has to degrade organic pollutants the redox potentials of 1o2 reported in the literature vary a lot such as 2 2 v yi et al 2019 1 52 v standard condition xiao et al 2021 and 0 81 v e 0 vs nhe at ph 7 1o2 o2 koppenol et al 2010 the energy of o 2 3 σ g is 0 98 ev 1 ev 96 49 kj mol lower than that of singlet oxygen o 2 1 δ g given that the standard redox potential of four electron transferred o 2 3 σ g generation is 1 23 v thus according to δg nef the redox potential of o 2 1 δ g is 1 23 0 98 4 1 48 v e0 vs nhe 1o2 h h2o and at ph 7 it will be 1 48 0 0592 7 1 07 v chen et al 2021b koppenol et al 2010 no matter in what way 1o2 is reduced 1o2 h h2o or 1o2 o2 the redox potential of 1o2 is at a relatively low value at ph 7 1 07 or 0 81 v overall 1o2 is known as one kind of ros with low oxidability thus 2 2 v seems unreasonable higher redox potential means a high ability to grab electrons from organics however 1o2 is prone to react with organics by electrophilic addition instead of single electron transfer barrios et al 2021 thus the low redox potential of 1o2 does not always mean that 1o2 has low ability to degrade unsaturated organics in water the lifetime of 1o2 is about 4 2 μs rodgers 1983 and the mean travel distance of 1o2 in water is around 200 nm aubry and bouttemy 1997 the lifetime of 1o2 varied a lot in different solvents table 1 bregnhøj et al 2016 hurst et al 1982 rodgers 1983 in solvents 1o2 is deactivated from 1o2 to o2 through electronic to vibrational coupling with solvents having high frequency oscillators such as o h and c h bonds bregnhøj et al 2017 hurst et al 1982 rodgers 1983 you 2018 due to the distinct content of o h and c h bonds of the different solvents 1o2 has very different lifetimes in the common solvents besides the closer the vibrational frequency of the solvent and 1o2 the higher the 1o2 deactivating ability the solvent has al nu airat et al 2021 for example compared with o d bonds 2550 cm 1 the vibrational frequency of o h bonds 3500 cm 1 is closer to 1o2 3286 cm 1 al nu airat et al 2021 thus 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o than in h2o 2 2 the reaction between 1o2 and organics owing to the low lying and empty π antibonding orbital fig 1 1o2 has high ability to obtain a pair of electrons as a result 1o2 can act as an electrophile agent to attack electron rich organics al nu airat et al 2021 derosa 2002 lee et al 2020 1o2 has a high affinity to unsaturated organics with electron rich double bonds especially to olefins the reactions between 1o2 and olefins mainly involve ene type reaction 2 2 cycloaddition and 4 2 cycloaddition with dioxetanes hydroperoxides and endoperoxides as the products respectively al nu airat et al 2021 frimer 1979 min and boff 2002 however most of these products are unstable which leads to their conversion to other substances through bond cleavage or rearrangement frimer 1979 apart from olefins 1o2 can also react with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons conjugated dienes phenols sulfides and heterocycles aubry and bouttemy 1997 clennan 2000 ohloff 1975 wasserman and ives 1981 although there are a lot of works about the reactions between 1o2 and organics most of them focus on organics synthesis derosa 2002 ohloff 1975 wasserman and ives 1981 with little attention on organics degradation in the early period of 1o2 utilization in pollutant removal phenolic compounds were widely studied thomas and foote thomas and foote 1978 proved that charge transfer drives the degradation of phenolic compounds by 1o2 resulting in the formation of o2 and phenoxyl radicals in some studies p benzoquinone is found to be the primary product which can be further degraded by 1o2 into smaller molecules gerdes et al 2001 nowakowska and kępczyński 1998 pizzocaro et al 1992 on the whole fig 2 a 1o2 can degrade organic compounds via electrophilic addition ene type reaction 2 2 cycloaddition 4 2 cycloaddition and addition to heteroatoms and single electron transfer set al nu airat et al 2021 barrios et al 2021 based on aqueous phase free energy of activation and free energy of reaction calculated from density functional theory barrios et al barrios et al 2021 found that set is mainly effective for phenolates and aromatic and aliphatic amines while for other organics phenols furans sulfides imidazoles thioureas pyrroles and indoles electrophilic addition plays more important roles fig 2b 2 3 the comparison of organics degradation by different reactive species in ps aops all so4 ho 1o2 etp and high valent metal oxo species mho have been found these species are referred to as reactive species rs for convenience in this review as shown in fig 3 the mechanisms of these rs to degrade organics have similarities and differences barrios et al 2021 luo et al 2018 shao et al 2022 comparatively speaking the ketonic group c o has a high probability of appearing in the degradation products of organic oxidation by 1o2 based on this point in a ps aops system containing so4 ho and 1o2 the authors classified the products of 2 4 dichlorophenol degradation with quinoid structure from 1o2 oxidation ma et al 2022 with phenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as target pollutants quinones are the main intermediates in 1o2 generation systems but they are not found in etp systems such as va cnt peroxymonosulfate pms and gns peroxydisulfate pds yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 to degrade ffa 1o2 results in several intermediates with the parent structure being kept and c o is formed in these intermediates while in the presence of ho fe2 h2o2 some small molecules are generated zheng et al 2022 notably the products of organics oxidation by 1o2 should be strongly related to ph since both set and electrophilic addition play important roles in deprotonated organics degradation barrios et al 2021 set is also an important way for so4 and ho to degrade organics having the potential to deeply decompose the organics fig 3 thus at ph 10 in h2o2 moo4 2 system 1o2 formation system 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol were degraded into small molecule organic acids tai and jiang 2005 to be honest it is hard to say that different rs result in totally different degradation products on the one hand there are similar ways for these rs to degrade organics such as set for radicals and 1o2 fig 3 on the other hand the same degradation products may be formed in different ways for instance with phenol as the target pollutant p benzoquinone is formed in the 1o2 system by electrophilic addition with 1 4 peroxide structures as the intermediate al nu airat et al 2018 and produced in the ho system by the addition elimination reaction with hydroquinone as the intermediate bremner et al 2006 the degradation products from 1o2 and mho systems also have similarities because the degradation of phenols by mho can generate quinones as well jiang et al 2020 li et al 2018a besides the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones can be realized by addition to heteroatoms of 1o2 and o atom transfer of mho respectively fig 4 aubry and bouttemy 1997 clennan 2000 shao et al 2022 the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones is usually used to detect mho in ps aops inspired by the reaction between sulfides and 1o2 and considering there is 1o2 in many ps aops systems with metal contained materials as the catalyst the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones might be owing to 1o2 instead of mho fig 4 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso are two kinds of sulfoxides used to detect mho dong et al 2020a 2021 li et al 2021 rao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 yao et al 2022 zong et al 2020 because it is known that dmso and pmso can be uniquely oxidized by mho to form methyl sulfone dmso2 and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 respectively as early as 1980 sawaki and ogata sawaki and ogata 1981 found that dmso can be oxidized to dmso2 by 1o2 through o atom transfer besides in a very recent study 1o2 is found to oxidize pmso into pmso2 yao et al 2022 apart from mho and 1o2 other oxidants can transform sulfoxide to sulfone as well such as hypochlorite wood and travis 1928 and hco3 huang and mabury 2000 in ps aops hypochlorite and co3 might form in the presence of cl or co3 2 lee et al 2020 thus when there is cl or co3 2 the identification of mho by using pmso to pmso2 conversion should be carefully used 2 4 the formation of 1o2 in ps aops various ways to produce 1o2 exist in ps aops and there are similarities and differences in pms and pds based systems fig 5 both pms gu et al 2022 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 and pds cheng et al 2017 liu et al 2022b ma et al 2023 wang et al 2023 wu et al 2022a can be activated by ketone type chemical moieties such as quinones and some carbon materials containing c o it needs to note that the precursors of 1o2 in c o catalyzed persulfate activation might have the ability to directly degrade pollutants for instance the generation of 1o2 in the benzoquinone pms system was enhanced in 93 d2o but was inhibited in 50 methanol the lifetime of 1o2 in methanol is longer than in h2o suggesting that the reactive intermediates to generate 1o2 can react with methanol lu et al 2020 this also implies that the role of 1o2 might be overestimated in c o catalyzed persulfate system because of the unknown properties of this type of 1o2 precursor distinguishing the contribution of 1o2 precursor and 1o2 in contaminant degradation is difficult but it is relatively easy to judge if the 1o2 precursor plays an important role in pollutant removal firstly dft calculations can be carried out to obtain the difference between 1o2 precursor and 1o2 in the free energy barrier for reacting with different pollutants secondly the organics with low reactivity to 1o2 can be used as target pollutants to judge the degradation ability of the 1o2 precursor if the 1o2 precursor has superiority in the above two cases the role of 1o2 might be overestimated in some ketone type chemical moieties catalyzed persulfate systems the disproportionation of o2 is another common way to generate 1o2 in both pms and pds based systems the more important point is the origin of o2 1 catalysts directly activate pms dong et al 2020b shahzad et al 2020 wang et al 2020a yan et al 2022b or pds bu et al 2021 liu et al 2022a pan et al 2023 zhu et al 2019 to form o2 2 catalysts reduce o2 to form o2 jiang et al 2023 li et al 2020b qin et al 2018 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020b and 3 pms self decomposition gao et al 2022a xu et al 2022 the first way is the most reported if the target pollutant has a high ability to react with o2 such as 1 3 dichlorobenzenethe and p chlorobenzoic acid guo et al 2021a the disproportionation of o2 to generate 1o2 might be inhibited to some degree in pms based systems so5 is one important precursor of 1o2 some catalysts can grab one electron from pms to produce so5 and then so5 will react with h2o or another so5 to form 1o2 eqs 1 3 this process can happen in carbon based catalysts gao et al 2020b liu et al 2021 2023 wu et al 2022b g c3n4 based catalysts fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021a and metal oxide based catalysts bai et al 2022 han et al 2022 qin et al 2023 shahzad et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the self decomposition of pms can produce 1o2 but this reaction is not the main source of 1o2 due to the low reaction constant k 4 7 5 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 10 evans and upton 1985 there is one interesting point that the target pollutant itself or its degradation products can change the way of ros formation li et al 2019a 2019b wen et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 quinones intermediates might be formed in the degradation of target pollutants and then they will be as homogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate to form 1o2 li et al 2019a 2019b zhou et al 2017 under visible light without target pollutant pds can self decompose to so4 and then undergoing a series of reactions 1o2 will form while in the presence of target pollutant taking atrazine atz as an example so4 can grab one electron from atrazine to produce atz and then atz react with o2 to form atz o o atz o o will decompose to o2 as the precursor of 1o2 wen et al 2022 1 s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 2 1 o 2 2 4 s o 5 2 h 2 o 4 h s o 4 3 1 o 2 3 s o 5 s o 5 s 2 o 8 2 1 o 2 in addition 1o2 can be derived from so4 and ho nguyen et al 2022 sun et al 2021 wen et al 2022 so4 and ho themselves can be quickly consumed by the organics because of their high ability to degrade organics thus in the case that 1o2 derives from so4 and ho 1o2 would not play an important role of course there are some other voices about 1o2 formation in 1o2 dominated ps aops since the diverse kind of catalysts and complex reactions of these ros for instance solar light can promote 1o2 generation in the carbonate pms system yuan et al 2023 because the related studies are few there will be no further discussion 3 debatable roles of 1o2 in ps aops more and more studies find that the role of 1o2 is debatable on multiple aspects including similar active sites but different ros conflicts based on the reaction kinetics and ph and potential misleading of inorganic ions influence fig 6 3 1 similar active sites but different ros in ps aops related reports it is often found that there are catalysts containing similar active sites but having different key ros table s1 fe doped g c3n4 is a kind of attractive catalyst of ps aops however in the studies of li et al 4 chlorophenol li et al 2018a zhang et al 4 chlorophenol zhang et al 2021a and duan et al o phenylphenol duan et al 2021 feho 1o2 and etp are the key rs respectively n doped carbon material is another kind of high activity catalyst although graphitic n is identified as the active site of carbon material ren et al phenol ren et al 2020 and gao et al bisphenol a gao et al 2020b proved that etp and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of pollutants respectively co nx sites in graphitic carbon have good performance in pms activation as well co n4 was the active site in the studies of xue et al 4 chlorophenol xue et al 2021 and li et al bisphenol a li et al 2018c but the key rs in the two studies were so4 and 1o2 respectively these conflicts may be related to the type of target pollutants due to the distinct reaction constants between various pollutants and the common ros xie et al 2022b yang et al 2022c recently in a cocaal ldo pms system containing so4 1o2 and ho the main effective ros is dependent on the parent structures of pollutants so4 for carbamazepine like compounds ho for triazine compounds and 1o2 for sulfonamides and phenolic substances xie et al 2022b in addition there might be different active sites in one catalyst that can trigger pms for the generation of different ros gao et al gao et al 2020b 2020a suppose that the negatively charged graphitic n and its adjacent positively charged c are responsible for radicals so4 and ho and 1o2 formation respectively negatively charged graphitic n can give one electron to pms resulting in the reduction of pms with ho or so4 formation while for positively charged c it can grab one electron leading to the oxidation of pms with so5 the procure of 1o2 generation 3 2 conflicts based on reaction kinetics as shown in table 2 some organics have significantly distinct second order reaction constants with 1o2 k1o2 but they have similar removal efficiency in 1o2 dominated ps aops for example the k1o2 of phenol is two orders higher than that of sulfamethoxazole lee et al 2020 but they have very similar removal tendencies in a 1o2 dominant ps aops system wang et al 2022a bisphenol a as a widely studied pollutant is efficiently removed in several 1o2 dominant ps aops systems gao et al 2020b luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 p but a pure 1o2 generation system photoexcited rose bengal rb has limited ability to remove bisphenol a yun et al 2018 besides some organics have similar k1o2 but their removal rates vary a lot in 1o2 dominant ps aops for instance the k1o2 of sulfamethoxazole and atrazine are 2 104 and 4 104 m 1s 1 respectively gao et al 2022c lee et al 2020 however in a ps aops system with 100 1o2 generation the removal rate of sulfamethoxazole is about 100 but it is less than 10 for atrazine zhang et al 2021a when the second order reaction constants of organics with ros are lower than 107 these organics are regarded as having low removal efficiencies facing the ros tertiary butanol tba and nitrobenzene have high reaction rates with ho but their second order reaction constants with so4 are 4 105 and 4 106 respectively dong et al 2020a gao et al 2022c thus they are usually used to distinguish ho and so4 to more clearly understand the relationship between k1o2 and the removal efficiency of organics lee et al lee et al 2020 summarized the half lives of various organics exposed to 1o2 taking 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 1 2 108 m 1s 1 sulfisoxazole 5 5 107 m 1s 1 phenol 2 8 106 m 1s 1 bisphenol a 8 0 105 m 1s 1 and sulfamethoxazole 2 0 104 m 1s 1 as examples they have significantly distinct reaction rates with 1o2 and their half lives facing 1o2 are 2 10 4 4 22 86 430 300 1504 and 12034 60169 min respectively actually a lot of common organics have low k1o2 107 in acidic and neutral environments lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a for most of the studies about ps aops the reactions are carried out in acidic environments due to the influence of pms and pds on ph value therefore the role of 1o2 in ps aops is very questionable 3 3 conflicts on the aspect of ph dependence within the most studied ph wide 3 11 generally the removal of target pollutant is not limited by ph or only inhibited at the alkaline condition in 1o2 dominant ps aops system gao et al 2019 liu et al 2022b luo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 because catalysts are usually negatively charged under alkaline conditions the inhibition at alkaline conditions might be caused by the repulsion between the catalyst and persulfate liang et al 2022a tian et al 2021 wang et al 2022b xia et al 2022 the high wide ph tolerance of 1o2 in ps aops is contradictory to some reports in a photosensitized rb system a traditional 1o2 generation system there was almost no removal of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp at ph 4 5 and 7 yun et al 2018 whereas in a ps aops system with 100 generation of 1o2 the removal of 4 cp is not limited by ph 3 4 10 8 zhang et al 2021a for a large number of organics 1o2 is about two orders of magnitude more readily to degrade deprotonated organics than un deprotonated ones table 2 li et al 2020a tratnyek and hoigne 1991 wu et al 2021 showing that the reaction between 1o2 and organics is highly ph dependent this property has been used as evidence to exclude the role of 1o2 wu et al 2021 however using perinaphthenone as a photosensitizer to generate 1o2 appiani appiani et al 2017 found that the degradation of furfuryl alcohol ffa by 1o2 is ph 3 12 independent indicating 1o2 has wide ph tolerance these conflicts about the ph dependence of 1o2 might be related to the types of organics and the 1o2 generation system in the photosensitized rb system the removal of 4 cp at ph 4 is tremendously lower than at ph 9 but the difference in the elimination rate of pentachlorophenol between ph 4 and 9 is relatively small yun et al 2018 at different ph the light absorption ability of photosensitizer might vary a lot for instance under irradiation of 546 nm light rb cannot adsorb light well at ph 6 resulting in low generation of 1o2 nowakowska and kępczyński 1998 there might be also other reasons for example the interaction between photosensitizer and target pollutant would change a lot as the change of ph having the potential to affect the formation of 1o2 in addition some studies reported that the key ros or the generation rate of ros is ph dependent which might be that ph can affect the protonation degree of persulfate or target pollutants change the surface zeta potential or hydroxyl group content of catalyst and affect the dissolution rate of metal ions for metal containing catalyst huang et al 2022 liang et al 2022a lu et al 2022 tian et al 2021 xie et al 2022a xing et al 2020 zong et al 2020 in a fecu doped g c3n4 pms system under acidic condition ph 3 1 ho and 1o2 both contributed a lot to ofloxacin removal but at ph 9 1o2 become the dominant ros tian et al 2021 it is because fe and cu species in fecu doped g c3n4 tend to exist as iron hydroxides and copper hydroxides under alkaline conditions leading to loss of their ability of electron gain and loss in another system ni feocl pds visible light the generation of 1o2 at ph 10 0 is over 4 times than at ph 6 5 and the authors propose that pds is easier to be activated at alkaline conditions lu et al 2022 all in all the wide ph tolerance of 1o2 needs further systematic study 3 4 potential misleading of inorganic ions influence the high selectivity to degrade organics in some ps aops systems might not be due to 1o2 but because of the high ability of the inorganic radicals to degrade organics and the presence of etp generally it is known as that so4 and ho can grab electron from the common inorganic ions to form corresponding inorganic radicals wang and wang 2021 the redox potential of cl no3 h2po4 and hco3 are 2 4 v 2 3 2 5 v 2 65 v and 1 65 v respectively neta and huie 1988 patra et al 2020 wang and wang 2021 wojnárovits et al 2020a wojnárovits and takács 2019 wu et al 2020 without considering the reported unreasonable value 2 2 v the redox potential of 1o2 is lower than all of these common inorganic radicals it means that 1o2 can hardly be consumed by these inorganic ions thus 1o2 still has high ability to degrade organics in the presence of high concentrations of inorganic ions appiani et al 2017 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d zhang et al 2021a even for hco3 with low redox potential it has high second order reaction rate constants khco3 with a lot of organics such as sulfamethoxazole 4 4 108 m 1s 1 sulfamethazine 4 4 108 m 1s 1 phenol 2 2 107 m 1s 1 propranolol 2 5 108 m 1s 1 and diclofenac 7 8 107 m 1s 1 wojnárovits et al 2020b thus when the target pollutants have high khco3 it needs careful judgment of the 1o2 role of course 1o2 dominated ps aops do not always have a high tolerance to inorganic ions due to the possibility of active sites occupied by these inorganic ions liu et al 2023 or the ph increase caused by carbonate xia et al 2022 in recent years the etp is revealed as the critical way of pollutant elimination in ps aops and this way also has high selectivity in the removal of organics due to their moderate redox potential 0 6 1 2 v cheng et al 2023a hu et al 2017 lee et al 2015 ren et al 2022 shao et al 2020 to be honest in the ps aops with 100 or nearly 100 generation of 1o2 mi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a there is a similar performance of linear sweep voltammetry lsv analyses with etp dominated ps aops system ren et al 2022 2020 thus the overestimation of 1o2 might happen due to the neglect of electron transfer to make a more accurate judgment the system with 100 or nearly 100 generation of 1o2 should be further verified by pre mixing tests the pre mixing of pms and catalyst with different times yang et al 2022c and separation experiment pms and pollutant were separated by catalyst membrane or salt bridge wang et al 2022c yun et al 2018 although some reasons have been discussed for the above conflicts the primary origins should be attributed to the unnoticed drawbacks of the methods used to identify and evaluate the 1o2 role thus the following contents focus on discussions of these methods which can be classified into two groups identification of 1o2 and evaluation of 1o2 role namely to prove the existence of 1o2 and verify whether 1o2 plays an important role in the removal of organic or not fig 7 4 identification of 1o2 to study the role of 1o2 the existence of 1o2 should be proved first the main ways to identify 1o2 include phosphorescence detection based on physical quenching of 1o2 epr tests and various probes having specific reactions with 1o2 4 1 phosphorescence detection based on 1o2 relaxation emission detection of 1o2 relaxation is the most direct and convincing evidence for 1o2 generation including dimol emission at 634 and 703 nm eq 4 and monomol emission at 1270 nm eq 5 almeida et al 2003 daimon and nosaka 2007 derosa 2002 lu et al 2020 miyamoto et al 2003a to compare the difference of 1o2 role in h2o2 ocl and pms benzoquinone lu et al lu et al 2020 used a stopped flow spectrometer to detect the phosphorescence from dimol emission of 1o2 based on a homemade time resolved phosphorescence system shao et al shao et al 2021 found a sharp peak centered at 1270 nm in graphitized nanodiamond pms indicating the existence of 1o2 because the chemistry behind dimol emission has not been yet well understood adam et al 2005 the detection of monomol emission at around 1270 nm is more reliable in addition although phosphorescence detection is the most direct and reliable method to detect 1o2 it has not been widely used shao et al 2021 due to it requiring sophisticated instruments you 2018 4 o 2 1 δ g o 2 1 δ g 2 o 2 3 σ g h ν λ 634 and 703 nm 5 o 2 1 δ g o 2 3 σ g h ν λ 1270 nm 4 2 electron paramagnetic resonance 1 the spin trapping agents of 1o2 as early as 1976 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp had been used as the spin trapping agent of 1o2 and temp can react with 1o2 to produce 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl tempo free radiacl lion et al 1976 tempo has a three lines epr spectrum with 1 1 1 intensity lion et al 1976 in the studies of ps aops apart from temp yan et al 2022a zong et al 2020 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol templ and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone tempn have been used to trap 1o2 as well fig 8 a and b gao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d yin et al 2018 the oxidation products of templ and tempn by 1o2 have a similar epr spectrum with tempo noting that in a lot of reports all three spin trapping agents are usually abbreviated as temp gao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d 2018 yin et al 2018 or tmp yu et al 2023 for the convenience of discussion in this review 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone are all named as temp and tempo represents their 1o2 oxidation product in addition temp can increase the ph and then might accelerate the decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2018 hence the epr tests with only pms should be always provided as a control 2 debatable role of tempo as the evidence of 1o2 the appearance of tempo does not always indicate the existence of 1o2 due to that tempo also can be generated through electron transfer mechanism fig 8 c lu et al 2020 nardi et al 2014 yun et al 2018 to verify the formation of tempo by electron transfer mechanism nardi et al nardi et al 2014 employed magic blue one electron oxidizing agent to extract electron from temp resulting in the appearance of tempo in presence of 1o2 fig 8 c as known in some ps aops systems the etp is responsible for pollutant removal ren et al 2022 as a result the appearance of tempo in ps aops is not solid evidence of 1o2 existence thus to further verify the appearance of 1o2 epr tests in d2o are employed because the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o can lead to a higher intensity of epr signal than in h2o hu et al 2021 liu et al 2023 for example in n cnt 60 pms system replacing h2o with d2o leads to enhanced epr peak intensity of tempo suggesting the generation of 1o2 liu et al 2023 contrary results appeared in some studies shao et al 2021 yun et al 2018 namely d2o gives rise to lower tempo epr signal shao et al shao et al 2021 suppose that this phenomenon could be attributed to the retardation of pms decomposition in d2o but according to the evidence of yun et al yun et al 2018 this is because electron transfer results in the appearance of tempo rather than by 1o2 oxidation noting that in the epr tests of yun et al yun et al 2018 their key evidence is that a stronger epr signal of tempo was found in the photoexcited rb system but not for cnt pms system after replacing h2o with d2o in other words the influence of d2o on the decomposition of pms was not considered this point might be the origin of the conflict 3 the possible misleading role of the inexistence of radical epr signal generally 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is used as the spin trapping agent of so4 ho and o2 in the studies related to ps aops of zhang et al zhang et al 2021a wang et al wang et al 2022a yan et al yan et al 2022b and zhao et al zhao et al 2022 there are no signals of dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo ooh but strong signals of tempo are found wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 this phenomenon is used as solid evidence that 1o2 plays the primary role in pollutant removal in a recent study yu et al 2023 a similar phenomenon was found but the intensity of tempo in the catalyst pms system is even lower than that only in the presence of pms and in this study the etp contributes to the elimination of pollutants instead of 1o2 yu et al 2023 as above discussed tempo can be generated by electron transfer mechanism thus the inexistence of dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo ooh but strong signals of tempo might lead to an overestimation of the effect of 1o2 4 judging the role of 1o2 in the elimination of pollutants the formation of tempo only can prove the existence of 1o2 but cannot confirm its contribution to pollutant removal thus there are studies to judge the role of 1o2 by comparing the intensity change of the tempo epr signal before and after the addition of target pollutants if the intensity of the tempo epr signal decreased it means 1o2 plays a role in pollutant removal chen et al 2021a gao et al 2020b xia et al 2022 but there is a possibility that 1o2 is the derivative of radicals and in this case the target pollutants can consume radicals to decrease the intensity of the tempo epr signal in addition in the study of gao et al 2021b the addition of bisphenol a enhanced the signal intensity of tempo and decreased the signal intensity of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 but they still suppose that 1o2 contribute to the bisphenol a removal and the enhancement of tempo signal is because bisphenol a is preferentially reacted with so4 and ho assuming that so4 ho and 1o2 coexist there is a high possibility that parts of temp and tempo can be degraded by so4 and ho if the ability of so4 and ho to degrade temp and tempo is significantly higher than that of the target pollutant to consume 1o2 the addition of the target pollutant with high reactivity to so4 and ho can enhance the tempo signal besides if a lot of quinones are produced in the degradation of target pollutants they will catalyze persulfate to form 1o2 leading to enhanced tempo signal ahmad et al 2013 4 3 probes some chemicals having specific reactions with 1o2 can be used as probes of 1o2 the products of probes and 1o2 can be detected by a spectrophotometer fluorescence detector or hplc aubry 1985 wu et al 2011 you 2018 to be honest a large number of molecular probes of 1o2 have been developed and well summarized wu et al 2011 you 2018 but only a few of these probes are used in ps aops because of some drawbacks such as commercially unavailable insoluble in water low specificity to 1o2 and photosensitized formation of 1o2 1 spectrophotometric probes this kind of probe can be detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer after their specific reactions with 1o2 their characteristic absorption wavelength will change π conjugated dienes can be applied as spectrophotometric probes for 1o2 including 5 membered heteroarenes acenes and alkenes with ozonide analogues endoperoxides and 1 2 dioxetanes as their reaction products with 1o2 respectively you 2018 compared with their parent compounds these products have shorter π conjugation lengths which bring about hypsochromic or hypochromic shifts in the electronic absorption spectra you 2018 9 10 diphenylanthracene dpa and 9 10 anthracenediyl bis methylene dimalonic acid abda are two typical spectrophotometric probes fig 9 a and b displaying peak wavelength at about 378 nm and 400 nm respectively gao et al 2021a you 2018 zhang et al 2022a in the presence of fe sac and pms gao et al gao et al 2021a used the decrease in absorption intensity of dpa around 378 nm as evidence of 1o2 existence several studies reported the decreased absorbance intensity of abda in ps aops indicating the appearance of 1o2 adil et al 2020 liu et al 2023 lou et al 2017 identification of 1o2 by spectrophotometric probes in ps aops is not ideal because the degradation of spectrophotometric probes by other ros also can lead to the reduction of absorbance intensity 2 photoluminescent probes compared with spectrophotometric probes photoluminescent probes are more sensitive to 1o2 photoluminescent probes usually contain two parts the 1o2 receptor and the photosensitive part generally the 1o2 receptor can react with 1o2 to produce endoperoxide which will change the way of photoexcited electron to back to ground state thus 1o2 will be detected by monitoring the change in fluorescence or phosphorescence signal 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf is the most commonly used photoluminescent probe of 1o2 with 1 2 dibenzoylbenzene dbb as the reaction product fig 9 c although dpbf does not photosensitize the formation of 1o2 and is sensitive to 1o2 it is not soluble in pure water and cannot react with other ros ho o2 ro roo h2o2 and c centered radicals to generate dbb carloni et al 1993 entradas et al 2020 zhang and li 2011 obviously dpbf is not a desired probe of 1o2 in ps aops singlet oxygen sensor green sosg is another commercially available and widely used photoluminescent probe of 1o2 fig 9 d due to its water solubility and specificity to 1o2 nosaka and nosaka 2017 sosg has been used to detect 1o2 in ps aops for example with graphitized nanodiamond as catalyst and pms as oxidant sosg endoperoxide sosg ep appeared with strong fluorescence intensity demonstrating the existence of 1o2 shao et al 2021 however depending on the irradiation conditions some relaxation pathways of sosg would happen to disturb the detection of 1o2 including intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer major contribution and intersystem crossing with 1o2 generation minor contribution under visible light excitation and sosg decomposition as the result of two photon ionization under ultraviolet light excitation kim et al 2013 in addition sosg also can photosensitize 1o2 formation kim et al 2013 3 chemiluminescence probes the reaction between chemiluminescence probes and 1o2 provides luminescence responses without the requirement of photoexcitation in the early period the widely used chemiluminescence probes include 2 methyl 6 phenyl 3 7 dihydroimidazo 1 2 α pyrazin 3 one cla and its derivatives however cla and its derivatives lack selectivity for 1o2 due to their reaction with o2 although chemiluminescence probes with high selectivity have been developed generally their reactions to produce chemiluminescence need triggers and the produced chemiluminescence has a short lifetime wu et al 2011 you 2018 4 chromatography probes some endoperoxides are the specific products between probes and 1o2 if the products have relatively high stability to exist for more than several hours they can be detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to be the evidence of 1o2 tetrapotassium rubrene 2 3 8 9 tetracarboxylate rtc a red compound exhibits high reactivity toward 1o2 rtco2 is considered to be the specific product of rtc with 1o2 involvement to examine the 1o2 formation in various mineral compounds h2o2 systems aubry aubry 1985 used hplc to detect rtco2 as evidence of 1o2 formation besides as a spectrophotometric probe dpa can serve as a chromatography probe as well the dpao2 as the reaction product of dpa and 1o2 is thermostable almeida et al 2003 miyamoto et al 2003b interestingly liu et al liu et al 2020b found that in the presence of both thiacloprid the target pollutant and pms dpao2 increased significantly indicating that thiacloprid can catalyze pms to form 1o2 in the benzoquinone pms system zhou et al zhou et al 2015 confirmed the generation of 1o2 by the formation of dpao2 as the most used quencher of 1o2 ffa can be used as a chromatography probe as well because the products of ffa degraded by 1o2 and radicals are different zheng et al 2022 using chromatography probes the degradation product should be detected in time due to the relative instability of endoperoxides there might be intermediates having the same retention time in hplc detection as the target endoperoxides product aubry 1985 thus the detection by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms always is suggested as the supplement 5 evaluation of 1o2 role 5 1 quenching experiment 1 the commonly used 1o2 quenchers and the way to ensure their dosage quenching experiments are the most used methods to verify the role of 1o2 these experiments are based on competitive reactions in which the quenchers with high reaction rates with 1o2 are selected ffa l histidine nan3 and β carotene are the frequenter in quenching experiments of 1o2 and their k1o2 are 1 2 108 3 2 107 1 109 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively liu et al 2023 shao et al 2021 wu et al 2022b wu and kim 2022 yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 to ensure the dosage and efficiency of the selected quenchers the competition kinetic rate coefficient f r o s t s is better to be calculated eq 6 ren et al 2022 in which f r o s t s is the proportion of ros consumed by the target pollutant k t r o s and k q r o s represent the second order rate constants for the ros with target pollutant and quencher respectively t and q are the initial concentrations of target pollutant and quencher respectively when f r o s t s is less than 0 01 the scavenger can almost eliminate the target ros however this method needs to know the reaction rates of ros with target pollutants traditionally the contribution of 1o2 is evaluated by the inhibition degree of the target pollutants in the presence of these quenchers the inhibition degree is related to the dosage of quenchers however some pollutants have significantly higher second order reaction rate constants to the related ros than the quencher in this case to meet f r o s t s 0 01 it needs a large quantity of quencher which might affect the generation of ros by changing the solvent property thus it can reduce the dosage of quenchers to obtain a relatively high value of f r o s t s and then judge the quenching effect by comparing the difference between the practical and calculated f r o s t s 6 f r o s t s k t r o s t k t r o s t k q r o s q 2 the overestimation of 1o2 caused by direct reaction between quenchers and pms noting that owing to some of the 1o2 quenchers being readily consumed by so4 and ho liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 it needs to know the contributions of so4 and ho using tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol as quenchers at first in ps aops it is often found that there is no inhibition on pollutants removal by tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol addition but by 1o2 quenchers suggesting that 1o2 plays a vital role in pollutants removal however the quenching effects of 1o2 quenchers are very likely from the direct consumption of pms l histidine and nan3 are ready to react with pms liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 for example in the presence of 25 mm l histidine and nan3 about 70 and more than 95 pms 1 mm was decomposed within 10 min respectively yun et al 2018 compared with l histidine and nan3 ffa and β carotene have a relatively low ability to decompose pms gao et al 2022c shao et al 2021 but for β carotene there is a report that β carotene cannot efficiently deactivate intracellular singlet oxygen bosio et al 2013 implying that the quenching effect of β carotene may be misleading more importantly β carotene is water insoluble in addition the inhibition of pollutant removal in the presence of ffa might be from the inhibition of pollutants adsorption instead of degradation deng et al 2022 fu et al 2022 3 the overestimation of 1o2 resulted from the quenching results of radicals the quenching effect of tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol can result in an overestimation of the 1o2 role gao et al gao et al 2022c 2022b and guo et al guo et al 2021b 2021a developed a kinetic model based on the bimolecular reaction of micropollutants with ros having the ability to calculate the contributions of ros and predict the elimination rate of pollutants according to this model so4 and ho are responsible for the pollutants removal in co ⅱ pms system studies and the quenching effects of tba methanol ethanol and isopropanol depend on the reaction rates between target pollutants and so4 for the organics having a high reaction rate with so4 their removal cannot be suppressed by tba methanol ethanol and isopropanol in addition underestimation of 1o2 might happen as well according to the quenching results of radicals liu et al liu et al 2021 found that ethanol has no significant inhibition on phenol removal but tba has which is due to the suppression of pms utilization by tba rather than that ho plays an important role 5 2 solvent exchange because 1o2 has different lifetimes in the common solvents the 1o2 role can be evaluated by solvent exchange generally if one ps aops system is 1o2 dominated replacing h2o with the solvent in which 1o2 has a much longer lifetime will enhance the removal of pollutants gao et al 2020a liu et al 2020b pan et al 2021 for example in n cnt 60 pms system the removal efficiency of phenol increased obviously after exchanging 50 h2o by d2o liu et al 2023 d2o is the most used luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d 2023 zheng et al 2023 since it has similar properties to h2o but sometimes the results of d2o exchange are not so solid because the solvent isotope effect may give rise to a 10 20 decrease in the chemical reaction rate eddy and menzies 1940 gardner swain et al 1960 gardner swain and w bader 1960 shao et al shao et al 2021 proved that 1o2 played an important role in graphitized nanodiamond pms system but d2o led to low removal efficiency of 4 cp and low intensity of tempo signal because d2o induced retardation of pms decomposition in addition to d2o h2o exchange by methanol or ethanol is also a good way to verify the role of 1o2 because they not only can prolong the lifetime of 1o2 but also can quench some other ros such as so4 and ho lu et al lu et al 2020 found that after 50 h2o exchange by methanol the epr signal of tempo was enhanced in h2o2 ocl system a typical system for 1o2 generation in the study of zheng et al zheng et al 2023 100 change of h2o by methanol the removal of sulfamethoxazole was not inhibited but server inhibition happened with the addition of β carotene indicating the important role of 1o2 this phenomenon also implies that for some unknown reasons the solvent exchange does not always enhance the removal of target pollutants 5 3 comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system there are some classical 1o2 formation systems such as h2o2 ocl photosensitized methods dyes as photosensitizers and mineral compounds moo4 2 woo4 2 vo3 la2o3 etc h2o2 alkaline condition aubry 1985 derosa 2002 tai and jiang 2005 which are shown in the eqs 7 10 aubry 1985 derosa 2002 2002 if one kind of organic can be readily oxidized by 1o2 in ps aops correspondingly it should be removed efficiently in these classical 1o2 formation systems some researchers have used this point to confirm the role of 1o2 in ps aops as known ffa is highly sensitive to 1o2 lu et al lu et al 2020 found that ffa can be removed efficiently in h2o2 ocl but not for smx suggesting that smx is inert to 1o2 bisphenol a carbamazepine cimetidine propranolol phenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol all can be effectively removed in ps aops but only cimetidine and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol have high degradation rates in photoexcited rb system duan et al 2022 yun et al 2018 ibuprofen can be well degraded in both fep pms system and the moo4 2 h2o2 system with this as evidence zheng et al zheng et al 2022 suppose that 1o2 can effectively remove ibuprofen the above three classical 1o2 formation systems have their disadvantages respectively aubry and bouttemy 1997 the reaction between h2o2 and ocl is too fast leading to a large fraction of 1o2 being lost through bubbles aubry and bouttemy 1997 in the photosensitized method there might be other ros formation derosa 2002 and the target pollutants might be in an excited state which makes it easier to be degraded especially under ultraviolet uv light under ultraviolet and visible light photoexcited rb has similar performance to generate 1o2 thus visible light photoexcited rb is a good system pickering and wiesner 2005 as for the moo4 2 h2o2 system it needs an alkaline environment aubry and cazin 1988 you 2018 in which the ability of 1o2 to oxidize some organics would be significantly enhanced lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a as known in ps aops after the addition of pms or pds the ph of the system will quickly decrease to acid hu et al 2018 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022b thus the results in the moo4 2 h2o2 system are not good references for the ps aops system 7 c l o h 2 o 2 h 2 o c l 1 o 2 8 2 h 2 o 2 m o o 4 2 2 h 2 o 1 o 2 9 p s 0 h ν p s 0 k i s c p t 1 p photosensitizer 10 p t 1 o 2 k e n p s 0 1 o 2 the above classical 1o2 formation systems are homogeneous the interaction between pollutants or persulfate and heterogeneous catalysts might influence the degradation of the pollutants for instance in the photoexcited methylene blue mb system ph increase resulted in a degradation tendency change of phenol that is contrary to the mno2 pds system 1o2 as the main rs and the authors suppose that it is because the electrostatic repulsion among mno2 surface persulfate anions and phenol at higher ph 8 5 10 zhu et al 2019 thus 1o2 formation systems with heterogeneous catalysts need to be considered for example uv fullerol system is a good candidate badireddy et al 2007 pickering and wiesner 2005 the uv fullerol system is more effective in acidic conditions pickering and wiesner 2005 which are identical to the acidic environment in ps aops but for the pollutants having the potential to be easily decomposed under uv uv fullerol is not a good choice 5 4 the quantification of 1o2 contribution a lot of ps aops systems contain multiple ros including pms itself 1o2 so4 ho and o2 to fully understand their roles it needs to quantify their respective contributions all the quantitative methods are based on reaction kinetics on the whole these methods can be divided into three categories quenching based method probe based method and solvent based method 1 quenching based method almost all ps aops related studies have carried out quenching experiments to evaluate the role of various ros thus the first order reaction rate constants of pollutants removed in the presence of these quenchers are available which can be used to calculate the contributions of ros cai et al 2022 gao et al 2021b guan et al 2018 in the quenching based method the used quencher numbers need to be the same as the number of target ros besides the number of ros that the quenchers can effectively quench should be an inclusion relation for example quencher a quencher b and quencher c were selected to quantify ho so4 and 1o2 quencher a should only effectively quench ho to obtain the first order reaction rate constant k1 and quencher b can quench both ho and so4 for obtaining k2 while for quencher c it needs to have the ability to quench all of ho so4 and 1o2 to get k3 if the first order reaction rate constant of target pollutant degradation without quenchers is k0 the contributions of the three ros to target pollutants removal can be calculated based on eqs 11 13 cai et al 2022 using k2 k0 to represent the contribution of 1o2 is not well because there might be other ros at least pms exists thus the eq 13 is better divided into the eqs 14 and 15 on the whole the key to this method needs to find suitable quenchers having the inclusion relation to quench ros generally tba methanol or ethanol or isopropanol and ffa can be used to quantify the contributions of ho so4 and 1o2 in addition o2 is also a common ros in ps aops li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 zhuo et al 2022 if o2 is considered a quencher with high reactivity to all of so4 ho 1o2 and o2 should be selected for this purpose 4 chlorobenzoicacid might be a good quencher because its second order reaction rate constant to so4 ho 1o2 and o2 are 3 6 10 8 5 0 10 8 1 4 10 7 8 6 10 7 m 1s 1 respectively gao et al 2022c although this method is simple for the target pollutants with high reaction rates with so4 and ho tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol cannot quench the degradation of the target pollutants in this case the quenching based method is not suitable in addition when using this method the reasonable dosage of quenchers should be calculated based on eq 6 to ensure that the target ros can be efficiently eliminated when the calculated dosage of quenchers is too high this quantification method is not suggested because the high concentration of quenchers might change the interaction among the catalyst persulfate and pollutant 11 r o h k 0 k 1 k 0 12 r s o 4 k 1 k 2 k 0 13 r 1 o 2 k 2 k 0 14 r 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 k 0 15 r o t h e r s k 3 k 0 2 probe based method in this method the degradation experiments of chemical probes are used to obtain the concentrations or exposures of the various ros gao et al 2022c 2022b liu et al 2023 xie et al 2022b firstly the second order reaction rate constants of the selected probes with the various ros should be available secondly the number n of selected probes should be the same as the ros number n because it needs to solve a system of multivariate equations however the pms concentration or exposures can be directly calculated based pms consumption curve during the reaction thus the number of selected probes can be n 1 for instance if the ros in the system include pms 1o2 so4 and ho the contributions of the ros can be calculated by the eqs 16 24 gao et al 2022b 2022c in the following equations p m s d t s o 4 d t h o d t and 1 o 2 d t are the exposures of ros

ps aops both etp and ros contribute to the removal of target pollutants there are no second order reaction rate constants between etp and the organic pollutants thus the above probe based method cannot be used to calculate the contribution of etp f e t p we proposed a modified probe based method to calculate the contribution of etp based on the expansion of eq 23 if there are pms 1o2 so4 ho and etp for the target pollutant removal eq 23 should be expanded to eq 25 rrate and k p m s p m s d t can be obtained by degradation experiment if the target organic pollutant has known second order reaction rate constants with these ros k s o 4 k o h and k 1 o 2 will be available thus if s o 4 d t h o d t and 1 o 2 d t are known f e t p can be calculated by eqs 25 29 because the organics with

56 11635 11645 environ sci technol 2022 56 78 97 it can be assumed that etp does not participate in the removal of these organics thus these organics can be used to obtain the exposures of ros s o 4 d

methods this method is based on the kinetic solvent isotope effect assuming that among the ros only the 1o2 related reactions are significantly affected by changing h2o to d2o the contribution x of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants can be obtained by the eq 30 cory et al 2009 jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 k o b s d 2 o t and k o b s h 2 o t are the first order rate constants of target pollutant degradation in d2o and h2o respectively k h 2 o 1 o 2 2 5 10 5 m 1s 1 and k d 2 o 1 o 2 1 6 10 4 m 1s 1 are the quenching rate constants of 1o2 by h2o and d2o respectively ω is the

conflicts 6 1 the origin of conflicts of 1o2 role the primary origins of conflicts in the 1o2 role mainly come from the overlooking of other degradation pathways overlooking of intrinsic drawbacks of the detection methods and unclear test conditions 1 overlooking of other degradation pathways because of the diversity of degradation pathways in ps aops the identification of the rs requires a series of tests such as epr quenching experiments probe degradation or transformation solvent exchange tests pre mixing tests and electrochemistry tests the absence of some of these tests can lead to an imperfect conclusion zhang et al zhang et al 2021a used various methods to prove that in fe doped g c3 n4 pms system 100 1o2 generation was realized however in this study the results of lsv tests are similar to those in the etp dominated studies ren et al 2022 pre mixing test and separation experiment pms and pollutant were separated by catalyst membrane or salt bridge should be further carried out to ensure if etp exists in this system or not in another study with 100 1o2 generation as well pre mixing of pms and catalyst only led to a slight inhibition of ciprofloxacin removal and more importantly the inhibition effect with 5 and 10 min of pre mixing is very close indicating the existence of etp but there is no separation experiment all 1o2 etp and mho belong to non radical ways they have some similarities shao et al 2022 thus in some 1o2 dominated systems the role of the other two non radical ways should be carefully studied but the related tests to identify etp or mho often are absent in a lot of studies table s1 2 overlooking of intrinsic drawbacks of the detection methods as discussed in sections 4 and 5 the methods used to study the role of 1o2 have drawbacks more or less table 3 among these methods epr and quenching tests are the most used however some researchers have ignored their drawbacks which is the most important reason for 1o2 role overestimation there are two typical cases firstly the appearance of tempo might be from etp instead of 1o2 kou et al kou et al 2023 prepared two kinds of carbon materials with polyaniline as a precursor c p50cn 900 dicyandiamide as extra n source and c p50c 900 c p50cn 900 pms has a much higher ability to degrade phenol than c p50c 900 pms but the tempo signal intensity in c p50c 900 pms even slightly higher than that in c p50cn 900 pms etp is the key way to remove phenol in c p50cn 900 pms and tempo is supposed to be from etp in some pds based systems there is a similar phenomenon namely that tempo appeared but etp is the key way to degrade pollutants cheng et al 2023b wang et al 2019 however verification of tempo origin is frequently lacking in related studies besides it also needs to note that the existence of 1o2 does not mean the important role of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants jiang et al 2017 li et al 2018a since 1o2 has low reactivity to most of the common pollutants in the acidic environment for instance in a fe iii doped g c3n4 pms system 1o2 was found but the author supposed that 1o2 cannot effectively remove 4 chlorophenol and one of the reasons is that 4 chlorophenol has a low k1o2 at ph 3 6 0 10 6 m 1s 1 li et al 2018a some other phenols such as phenol and bisphenol a even have lower k1o2 than 4 chlorophenol at acid conditions ren et al 2022 why do some studies prove that these phenols can be effectively removed in 1o2 dominated ps aops without buffer table s1 namely at acid conditions secondly the improper use of the quenchers can lead to an overestimation of the 1o2 role which should be the main reason why some pollutants with low k1o2 were proven to be effectively removed in 1o2 dominated ps aops l histidine and nan3 as quenchers of 1o2 have non negligible drawbacks l histidine and nan3 can quickly consume pms ffa has a higher k1o2 than l histidine gao et al 2022c however when they are both used l histidine usually has significantly higher inhibition effect in pollutant removal than ffa in both pms zheng et al 2023 and pds wang et al 2021 based systems compared with ffa nan3 still can directly consume some pds but it has a slow rate zhu et al 2019 thus the inhibition effect of l histidine and nan3 are not solid evidence to confirm the role of 1o2 but l histidine and nan3 are usually used as the quenchers without further using ffa li et al 2018b ma et al 2023 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022a compared with l histidine and nan3 ffa is more suitable as 1o2 quencher however the kso4 and kho of ffa are much higher one to two orders of magnitude than tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol thus the higher quenching effect of ffa is not always due to the elimination of 1o2 but it might be because ffa has a higher ability to quench so4 and ho gao et al 2022c besides in radical dominated ps aos for the pollutants with high kso4 and kho low dosages of tba and methanol even ffa almost have no quenching effect gao et al 2022c thus the improper use and dosage of the quenchers usually lead to an overestimation of the 1o2 role as a result some pollutants with low k1o2 at acid conditions are often supposed to be effectively degraded by 1o2 3 unclear test conditions different test conditions might result in different results epr is one of the most commonly used methods to identify 1o2 however it is puzzling about some epr results especially in the presence of only persulfate in some studies with only pms or pds no epr signal of 1o2 and radicals so4 and ho was found du et al 2021 liang et al 2022b liu et al 2020a miao et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 but it is contrary in others chen et al 2020 gao et al 2020a xu et al 2020 yang et al 2022b zhou et al 2022 in our opinion this phenomenon is strongly related to the detection conditions the different detection conditions have the potential to cause different results in the presence of the catalyst however most of the studies do not give the details of epr tests such as the ph the kind of buffer and the concentrations of trapping agents and persulfate 1o2 has similar performances to etp in some aspects thereby it needs electrochemistry tests to identify whether etp exists or not electrochemistry tests such as linear sweep voltammetry lsv and open circuit potential ocp are the important methods to identify etp however in some etp dominated studies there is no information about how the electrochemistry tests were carried out such as the ph and kind of the electrolyte the working electrode and how it is prepared as a result it is hard to compare the results of these studies 6 2 the methods to solve the conflicts according to the above aspects of conflict origin we propose a relatively reasonable process to identify the role of 1o2 it can be divided into three steps and noting that these steps should be modified according to the practical cases step one to confirm the existence of 1o2 if the related detection instrument is available phosphorescence detection based on 1o2 relaxation is always recommended as the most solid way to ensure the generation of 1o2 as an alternative the combination of the comparison of tempo signal intensity in different solvents and chromatography probes rtc or dpa is suggested if the signal intensity of tempo increases with the change of h2o into d2o it can judge the existence of 1o2 however replacing h2o with d2o does not always result in stronger tempo signal intensity because the negative effect on persulfate utilization caused by d2o might be stronger than the positive effect of 1o2 lifetime increase in d2o shao et al 2021 thus it is necessary to combine chromatography probes as further evidence the degradation products of chromatography probes should be detected by both hplc and hplc ms to avoid the appearance of products having the same retention time as target endoperoxides step two to roughly evaluate the 1o2 role by quenching tests solvent exchange methods and comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system in the quenching experiment ffa and ethanol or methanol or isopropanol are selected to quench 1o2 and radicals so4 and ho respectively the suitable dosage of quenchers should be calculated based on eq 6 to ensure that the addition of quenchers can effectively eliminate the target ros at the reasonable dosage of quenchers if ffa has a much stronger quenching effect the role of etp and mho cannot be ignored because they may co contribute to pollutant elimination with 1o2 thus to further confirm the role of 1o2 solvent exchange methods should be carried out if d2o can enhance the removal of pollutants 1o2 contributes to the removal of pollutants in addition we also suggest using these classical 1o2 generation systems as a reference it is important to note that because the production yield of 1o2 might be significantly different between classical 1o2 generation systems and ps aops systems the degradation of ffa at the same concentration and similar ph should be carried out in both systems as control otherwise it is hard to judge if the target pollutants can be effectively degraded by 1o2 for example in the study of zhu et al zhu et al 2019 the removal of phenol in a 1o2 dominated mno2 pds system is much higher than in a photoexcited mb system 1o2 formation system at ph 6 5 but the authors suppose that phenol is removed by 1o2 phenol itself being degraded by 1o2 is debatable but if the degradation of ffa is provided in both the photoexcited mb system and mno2 pds system the comparison will be more convincing if there is no etp or mho the contribution of 1o2 can be directly quantified by the probe based method however undergoing the above judgments can only prove whether 1o2 participates in pollutant removal or not but it still cannot prove whether etp and mho work or not besides if d2o cannot enhance pollutant removal the role of 1o2 should not be ignored because of the retardation effect on pms decomposition caused by d2o shao et al 2021 thereby no matter in which case the role of 1o2 needs to be further studied step three to evaluate the 1o2 role in the presence of etp or mho for the catalyst without metal it is relatively easy to distinguish the contribution of 1o2 and etp firstly pre mixing tests electrochemical analysis such as lsv and ocp and separation tests need to be used to confirm if etp exists and then probe based methods eqs 25 29 can be used to quantify their respective contributions in the case that mho might exist it is hard to distinguish its role from that of 1o2 because the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones can be realized by addition to the heteroatoms of 1o2 and o atom transfer of mho respectively in a recent review of mho they also referred to the difficulty to distinguish the role of 1o2 and mho shao et al 2022 mho can exchange the oxygen atom 16o with h2 18o shao et al 2022 however the 18o isotope labeling technique is not viable as well to identify mho in ps aops because some studies propose that h2o participates in the formation of 1o2 by reacting with so5 or o2 liu et al 2022a shahzad et al 2020 wu et al 2021 thus the solvent exchange method might be effective in distinguishing 1o2 and mho besides mho can degrade organics in multiple ways while electrophilic addition is the main way for 1o2 to degrade organics fig 3 thus there will be different degradation products the degradation products of target pollutants in classical 1o2 and mho systems can be used to compare with those formed in ps aops systems however if 1o2 and mho coexist this method is unsuitable due to that the lifetime of mho s level is far longer than that of 1o2 μs level rodgers 1983 shao et al 2022 changing h2o by d2o should only have little influence on the efficiency of pollutant removal by mho 7 conclusion and prospects aiming to better understand the debatable role of 1o2 in ps aops and its origins this review have summarized and discussed 1o2 role through several aspects firstly we introduced some basic properties of 1o2 including electronic structure redox potential and life time of 1o2 the reaction between organic and 1o2 and the formation of 1o2 in ps aops secondly some conflicts of 1o2 role in ps aops are summarized and discussed from multiple aspects involving active sites reaction kinetics ph dependence and selectivity to organics degradation thirdly the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 are discussed especially focusing on some cases of overestimation of 1o2 because of the intrinsic drawbacks and unreasonable utilization of these methods based on our summarization and discussion for the judgment of 1o2 role in ps aops the following contents should be noticed or done 1 because of the inherent drawbacks of epr analysis and quenching tests other methods such as solvent exchange by d2o chromatography probes comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system and probe based quantification should be used as well to give more convincing results 2 there are several potential similar performances of 1o2 and the etp such as oxidizing temp to form tempo ph tolerance and selectivity to degrade organics thus in 1o2 dominated ps aops the role of the etp should be thoroughly verified 3 based on the classical 1o2 formation systems systematic studies should be carried out to ensure the degradation rule of the common organic pollutants at different ph which will provide a solid reference to study the role the 1o2 in ps aops 4 the influence of d2o should be deeply studied because it can prolong the lifetime of 1o2 but also can inhibit the decomposition of persulfate it needs to know which aspect will have a stronger influence on pollutants removal and if the influence is related to the type of pollutants 5 although the role of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants might be overestimated it might have high reactivity with the intermediate products of pollutants degradation to accelerate the mineralization of organics which also deserves further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

14856,singlet oxygen 1o2 attracts much attention in persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops because of its wide ph tolerance and high selectivity toward electron rich organics however there are conflicts about the 1o2 role in ps aops on several aspects including the formation of different key reactive oxygen species ros at similar active sites ph dependence broad spectrum activity and selectivity in the elimination of organic pollutants to a large degree these conflicts root in the drawbacks of the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 for example the quenchers of 1o2 have high reactivity to other ros and persulfate as well in addition electron transfer process etp also selectively oxidizes organics having a misleading effect on the identification of 1o2 therefore in this review we summarized and discussed some basic properties of 1o2 the debatable role of 1o2 in ps aops on multiple aspects and the methods and their drawbacks to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 on the whole this review aims to better understand the role of 1o2 in ps aops and further help with its reasonable utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords singlet oxygen peroxymonosulfate peroxydisulfate electron paramagnetic resonance quenching experiment overestimation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops have developed rapidly over the past decade in the early period ps aops become attractive because of the superior redox potential and lifetime of so4 2 5 3 1 v 30 40 μs than ho 1 8 2 7 v 1 μs ike et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 xiao et al 2018 however more and more studies find that so4 is not the dominant reactive oxygen species ros lee et al 2020 wu and kim 2022 zhang et al 2021b nonradical pathways including singlet 1o2 and electron transfer process etp play a vital role in some ps aops ren et al 2022 xiao et al 2021 owing to its long lifetime wide ph tolerance and high selectivity toward electron rich organics luo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a xiao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2020a 1o2 receives much attention in the elimination of organic pollutants some researchers have designed catalysts to 100 or nearly 100 generate 1o2 by triggering persulfate for the effective removal of organic pollutants mi et al 2021 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2023 zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 in 1o2 dominated ps aops a lot of kinds of organics can be efficiently removed including but not limited to phenolic substances sulfonamides dyes tetracyclines and quinolones gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2022d zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 however some of these organics such as bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen are reported to have low second order reaction rate constants with 1o2 k1o2 lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a generally 1o2 can remove deprotonated organics alkaline environment much better li et al 2020a but in some 1o2 dominated ps aops ph has no influence on the removal of organics or just inhibits their removal in alkaline environments gao et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 this conflict might be that the generation of 1o2 is affected by ph li et al 2019b lu et al 2022 tian et al 2021 besides it is found that 1o2 can be generated on m nx m fe or co sites wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 whereas there are studies using catalysts containing m nx but radicals and high valent iron oxo species feho contribute to the removal of pollutants rather than 1o2 qian et al 2021 xue et al 2021 according to the above contents non negligible conflicts of 1o2 exist in ps aops in several aspects electron paramagnetic resonance epr and quenching tests have been widely used to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 apart from the above conflicts as several drawbacks of epr and quenching tests are found the role of 1o2 in some ps aops might be overestimated gao et al 2022c lu et al 2020 yun et al 2018 the related drawbacks are as follows firstly 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl tempo is not solely from the oxidation of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp by 1o2 lu et al 2020 nardi et al 2014 secondly as the quenchers of 1o2 l histidine and sodium azide nan3 can directly consume peroxymonosulfate liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 thirdly even in presence of excessive quenchers of radicals so4 and ho the removal of organics which have high second order reaction rate constants with so4 or ho cannot be significantly suppressed gao et al 2022c fourthly etp has been proven to be the main way of organics removal in some ps aops but this way cannot be identified by epr and quenching tests ren et al 2022 wang et al 2022c yang et al 2022a yun et al 2018 noting that etp dominated ps aops also have high selectivity to degrade organics ren et al 2022 yang et al 2022a thus in some reported 1o2 dominated systems if methods were not taken to identify etp the role of 1o2 might be overestimated revealing the key ros in ps aops helps design highly efficient catalysts as a kind of attractive ros the 1o2 role in ps aops might be overestimated having the potential to mislead the development of efficient catalysts thereby aiming to help researchers to have a clearer understanding of the 1o2 role this review focuses on the basic properties of 1o2 the debatable aspects of 1o2 in ps aops and the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 2 the basic properties of 1o2 and its formation in ps aops 2 1 electronic structure redox potential and lifetime of 1o2 1o2 involves various excited states of o2 3 σ g 0 kj mol with two electrons having opposite spins in π antibonding orbitals and o 2 1 δ g 95 kj mol and o 2 1 σ g 159 kj mol are the two low lying singlet excited states fig 1 derosa 2002 schweitzer and schmidt 2003 because the lifetime of o 2 1 σ g is smaller than 1 ns al nu airat et al 2021 it is hard to play an important role in the elimination of organic pollutants the relaxation of o 2 1 δ g back to ground state is spin forbidden which makes o 2 1 δ g has a relatively long lifetime thus 1o2 usually represents o 2 1 δ g generally the higher the redox potential the ros has the stronger ability it has to degrade organic pollutants the redox potentials of 1o2 reported in the literature vary a lot such as 2 2 v yi et al 2019 1 52 v standard condition xiao et al 2021 and 0 81 v e 0 vs nhe at ph 7 1o2 o2 koppenol et al 2010 the energy of o 2 3 σ g is 0 98 ev 1 ev 96 49 kj mol lower than that of singlet oxygen o 2 1 δ g given that the standard redox potential of four electron transferred o 2 3 σ g generation is 1 23 v thus according to δg nef the redox potential of o 2 1 δ g is 1 23 0 98 4 1 48 v e0 vs nhe 1o2 h h2o and at ph 7 it will be 1 48 0 0592 7 1 07 v chen et al 2021b koppenol et al 2010 no matter in what way 1o2 is reduced 1o2 h h2o or 1o2 o2 the redox potential of 1o2 is at a relatively low value at ph 7 1 07 or 0 81 v overall 1o2 is known as one kind of ros with low oxidability thus 2 2 v seems unreasonable higher redox potential means a high ability to grab electrons from organics however 1o2 is prone to react with organics by electrophilic addition instead of single electron transfer barrios et al 2021 thus the low redox potential of 1o2 does not always mean that 1o2 has low ability to degrade unsaturated organics in water the lifetime of 1o2 is about 4 2 μs rodgers 1983 and the mean travel distance of 1o2 in water is around 200 nm aubry and bouttemy 1997 the lifetime of 1o2 varied a lot in different solvents table 1 bregnhøj et al 2016 hurst et al 1982 rodgers 1983 in solvents 1o2 is deactivated from 1o2 to o2 through electronic to vibrational coupling with solvents having high frequency oscillators such as o h and c h bonds bregnhøj et al 2017 hurst et al 1982 rodgers 1983 you 2018 due to the distinct content of o h and c h bonds of the different solvents 1o2 has very different lifetimes in the common solvents besides the closer the vibrational frequency of the solvent and 1o2 the higher the 1o2 deactivating ability the solvent has al nu airat et al 2021 for example compared with o d bonds 2550 cm 1 the vibrational frequency of o h bonds 3500 cm 1 is closer to 1o2 3286 cm 1 al nu airat et al 2021 thus 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o than in h2o 2 2 the reaction between 1o2 and organics owing to the low lying and empty π antibonding orbital fig 1 1o2 has high ability to obtain a pair of electrons as a result 1o2 can act as an electrophile agent to attack electron rich organics al nu airat et al 2021 derosa 2002 lee et al 2020 1o2 has a high affinity to unsaturated organics with electron rich double bonds especially to olefins the reactions between 1o2 and olefins mainly involve ene type reaction 2 2 cycloaddition and 4 2 cycloaddition with dioxetanes hydroperoxides and endoperoxides as the products respectively al nu airat et al 2021 frimer 1979 min and boff 2002 however most of these products are unstable which leads to their conversion to other substances through bond cleavage or rearrangement frimer 1979 apart from olefins 1o2 can also react with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons conjugated dienes phenols sulfides and heterocycles aubry and bouttemy 1997 clennan 2000 ohloff 1975 wasserman and ives 1981 although there are a lot of works about the reactions between 1o2 and organics most of them focus on organics synthesis derosa 2002 ohloff 1975 wasserman and ives 1981 with little attention on organics degradation in the early period of 1o2 utilization in pollutant removal phenolic compounds were widely studied thomas and foote thomas and foote 1978 proved that charge transfer drives the degradation of phenolic compounds by 1o2 resulting in the formation of o2 and phenoxyl radicals in some studies p benzoquinone is found to be the primary product which can be further degraded by 1o2 into smaller molecules gerdes et al 2001 nowakowska and kępczyński 1998 pizzocaro et al 1992 on the whole fig 2 a 1o2 can degrade organic compounds via electrophilic addition ene type reaction 2 2 cycloaddition 4 2 cycloaddition and addition to heteroatoms and single electron transfer set al nu airat et al 2021 barrios et al 2021 based on aqueous phase free energy of activation and free energy of reaction calculated from density functional theory barrios et al barrios et al 2021 found that set is mainly effective for phenolates and aromatic and aliphatic amines while for other organics phenols furans sulfides imidazoles thioureas pyrroles and indoles electrophilic addition plays more important roles fig 2b 2 3 the comparison of organics degradation by different reactive species in ps aops all so4 ho 1o2 etp and high valent metal oxo species mho have been found these species are referred to as reactive species rs for convenience in this review as shown in fig 3 the mechanisms of these rs to degrade organics have similarities and differences barrios et al 2021 luo et al 2018 shao et al 2022 comparatively speaking the ketonic group c o has a high probability of appearing in the degradation products of organic oxidation by 1o2 based on this point in a ps aops system containing so4 ho and 1o2 the authors classified the products of 2 4 dichlorophenol degradation with quinoid structure from 1o2 oxidation ma et al 2022 with phenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as target pollutants quinones are the main intermediates in 1o2 generation systems but they are not found in etp systems such as va cnt peroxymonosulfate pms and gns peroxydisulfate pds yun et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 to degrade ffa 1o2 results in several intermediates with the parent structure being kept and c o is formed in these intermediates while in the presence of ho fe2 h2o2 some small molecules are generated zheng et al 2022 notably the products of organics oxidation by 1o2 should be strongly related to ph since both set and electrophilic addition play important roles in deprotonated organics degradation barrios et al 2021 set is also an important way for so4 and ho to degrade organics having the potential to deeply decompose the organics fig 3 thus at ph 10 in h2o2 moo4 2 system 1o2 formation system 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol were degraded into small molecule organic acids tai and jiang 2005 to be honest it is hard to say that different rs result in totally different degradation products on the one hand there are similar ways for these rs to degrade organics such as set for radicals and 1o2 fig 3 on the other hand the same degradation products may be formed in different ways for instance with phenol as the target pollutant p benzoquinone is formed in the 1o2 system by electrophilic addition with 1 4 peroxide structures as the intermediate al nu airat et al 2018 and produced in the ho system by the addition elimination reaction with hydroquinone as the intermediate bremner et al 2006 the degradation products from 1o2 and mho systems also have similarities because the degradation of phenols by mho can generate quinones as well jiang et al 2020 li et al 2018a besides the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones can be realized by addition to heteroatoms of 1o2 and o atom transfer of mho respectively fig 4 aubry and bouttemy 1997 clennan 2000 shao et al 2022 the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones is usually used to detect mho in ps aops inspired by the reaction between sulfides and 1o2 and considering there is 1o2 in many ps aops systems with metal contained materials as the catalyst the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones might be owing to 1o2 instead of mho fig 4 dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso are two kinds of sulfoxides used to detect mho dong et al 2020a 2021 li et al 2021 rao et al 2022 wang et al 2018 yao et al 2022 zong et al 2020 because it is known that dmso and pmso can be uniquely oxidized by mho to form methyl sulfone dmso2 and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 respectively as early as 1980 sawaki and ogata sawaki and ogata 1981 found that dmso can be oxidized to dmso2 by 1o2 through o atom transfer besides in a very recent study 1o2 is found to oxidize pmso into pmso2 yao et al 2022 apart from mho and 1o2 other oxidants can transform sulfoxide to sulfone as well such as hypochlorite wood and travis 1928 and hco3 huang and mabury 2000 in ps aops hypochlorite and co3 might form in the presence of cl or co3 2 lee et al 2020 thus when there is cl or co3 2 the identification of mho by using pmso to pmso2 conversion should be carefully used 2 4 the formation of 1o2 in ps aops various ways to produce 1o2 exist in ps aops and there are similarities and differences in pms and pds based systems fig 5 both pms gu et al 2022 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 and pds cheng et al 2017 liu et al 2022b ma et al 2023 wang et al 2023 wu et al 2022a can be activated by ketone type chemical moieties such as quinones and some carbon materials containing c o it needs to note that the precursors of 1o2 in c o catalyzed persulfate activation might have the ability to directly degrade pollutants for instance the generation of 1o2 in the benzoquinone pms system was enhanced in 93 d2o but was inhibited in 50 methanol the lifetime of 1o2 in methanol is longer than in h2o suggesting that the reactive intermediates to generate 1o2 can react with methanol lu et al 2020 this also implies that the role of 1o2 might be overestimated in c o catalyzed persulfate system because of the unknown properties of this type of 1o2 precursor distinguishing the contribution of 1o2 precursor and 1o2 in contaminant degradation is difficult but it is relatively easy to judge if the 1o2 precursor plays an important role in pollutant removal firstly dft calculations can be carried out to obtain the difference between 1o2 precursor and 1o2 in the free energy barrier for reacting with different pollutants secondly the organics with low reactivity to 1o2 can be used as target pollutants to judge the degradation ability of the 1o2 precursor if the 1o2 precursor has superiority in the above two cases the role of 1o2 might be overestimated in some ketone type chemical moieties catalyzed persulfate systems the disproportionation of o2 is another common way to generate 1o2 in both pms and pds based systems the more important point is the origin of o2 1 catalysts directly activate pms dong et al 2020b shahzad et al 2020 wang et al 2020a yan et al 2022b or pds bu et al 2021 liu et al 2022a pan et al 2023 zhu et al 2019 to form o2 2 catalysts reduce o2 to form o2 jiang et al 2023 li et al 2020b qin et al 2018 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020b and 3 pms self decomposition gao et al 2022a xu et al 2022 the first way is the most reported if the target pollutant has a high ability to react with o2 such as 1 3 dichlorobenzenethe and p chlorobenzoic acid guo et al 2021a the disproportionation of o2 to generate 1o2 might be inhibited to some degree in pms based systems so5 is one important precursor of 1o2 some catalysts can grab one electron from pms to produce so5 and then so5 will react with h2o or another so5 to form 1o2 eqs 1 3 this process can happen in carbon based catalysts gao et al 2020b liu et al 2021 2023 wu et al 2022b g c3n4 based catalysts fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021a and metal oxide based catalysts bai et al 2022 han et al 2022 qin et al 2023 shahzad et al 2020 wu et al 2021 the self decomposition of pms can produce 1o2 but this reaction is not the main source of 1o2 due to the low reaction constant k 4 7 5 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 10 evans and upton 1985 there is one interesting point that the target pollutant itself or its degradation products can change the way of ros formation li et al 2019a 2019b wen et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 quinones intermediates might be formed in the degradation of target pollutants and then they will be as homogeneous catalyst to activate persulfate to form 1o2 li et al 2019a 2019b zhou et al 2017 under visible light without target pollutant pds can self decompose to so4 and then undergoing a series of reactions 1o2 will form while in the presence of target pollutant taking atrazine atz as an example so4 can grab one electron from atrazine to produce atz and then atz react with o2 to form atz o o atz o o will decompose to o2 as the precursor of 1o2 wen et al 2022 1 s o 5 s o 5 2 s o 4 2 1 o 2 2 4 s o 5 2 h 2 o 4 h s o 4 3 1 o 2 3 s o 5 s o 5 s 2 o 8 2 1 o 2 in addition 1o2 can be derived from so4 and ho nguyen et al 2022 sun et al 2021 wen et al 2022 so4 and ho themselves can be quickly consumed by the organics because of their high ability to degrade organics thus in the case that 1o2 derives from so4 and ho 1o2 would not play an important role of course there are some other voices about 1o2 formation in 1o2 dominated ps aops since the diverse kind of catalysts and complex reactions of these ros for instance solar light can promote 1o2 generation in the carbonate pms system yuan et al 2023 because the related studies are few there will be no further discussion 3 debatable roles of 1o2 in ps aops more and more studies find that the role of 1o2 is debatable on multiple aspects including similar active sites but different ros conflicts based on the reaction kinetics and ph and potential misleading of inorganic ions influence fig 6 3 1 similar active sites but different ros in ps aops related reports it is often found that there are catalysts containing similar active sites but having different key ros table s1 fe doped g c3n4 is a kind of attractive catalyst of ps aops however in the studies of li et al 4 chlorophenol li et al 2018a zhang et al 4 chlorophenol zhang et al 2021a and duan et al o phenylphenol duan et al 2021 feho 1o2 and etp are the key rs respectively n doped carbon material is another kind of high activity catalyst although graphitic n is identified as the active site of carbon material ren et al phenol ren et al 2020 and gao et al bisphenol a gao et al 2020b proved that etp and 1o2 contributed to the degradation of pollutants respectively co nx sites in graphitic carbon have good performance in pms activation as well co n4 was the active site in the studies of xue et al 4 chlorophenol xue et al 2021 and li et al bisphenol a li et al 2018c but the key rs in the two studies were so4 and 1o2 respectively these conflicts may be related to the type of target pollutants due to the distinct reaction constants between various pollutants and the common ros xie et al 2022b yang et al 2022c recently in a cocaal ldo pms system containing so4 1o2 and ho the main effective ros is dependent on the parent structures of pollutants so4 for carbamazepine like compounds ho for triazine compounds and 1o2 for sulfonamides and phenolic substances xie et al 2022b in addition there might be different active sites in one catalyst that can trigger pms for the generation of different ros gao et al gao et al 2020b 2020a suppose that the negatively charged graphitic n and its adjacent positively charged c are responsible for radicals so4 and ho and 1o2 formation respectively negatively charged graphitic n can give one electron to pms resulting in the reduction of pms with ho or so4 formation while for positively charged c it can grab one electron leading to the oxidation of pms with so5 the procure of 1o2 generation 3 2 conflicts based on reaction kinetics as shown in table 2 some organics have significantly distinct second order reaction constants with 1o2 k1o2 but they have similar removal efficiency in 1o2 dominated ps aops for example the k1o2 of phenol is two orders higher than that of sulfamethoxazole lee et al 2020 but they have very similar removal tendencies in a 1o2 dominant ps aops system wang et al 2022a bisphenol a as a widely studied pollutant is efficiently removed in several 1o2 dominant ps aops systems gao et al 2020b luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 p but a pure 1o2 generation system photoexcited rose bengal rb has limited ability to remove bisphenol a yun et al 2018 besides some organics have similar k1o2 but their removal rates vary a lot in 1o2 dominant ps aops for instance the k1o2 of sulfamethoxazole and atrazine are 2 104 and 4 104 m 1s 1 respectively gao et al 2022c lee et al 2020 however in a ps aops system with 100 1o2 generation the removal rate of sulfamethoxazole is about 100 but it is less than 10 for atrazine zhang et al 2021a when the second order reaction constants of organics with ros are lower than 107 these organics are regarded as having low removal efficiencies facing the ros tertiary butanol tba and nitrobenzene have high reaction rates with ho but their second order reaction constants with so4 are 4 105 and 4 106 respectively dong et al 2020a gao et al 2022c thus they are usually used to distinguish ho and so4 to more clearly understand the relationship between k1o2 and the removal efficiency of organics lee et al lee et al 2020 summarized the half lives of various organics exposed to 1o2 taking 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 1 2 108 m 1s 1 sulfisoxazole 5 5 107 m 1s 1 phenol 2 8 106 m 1s 1 bisphenol a 8 0 105 m 1s 1 and sulfamethoxazole 2 0 104 m 1s 1 as examples they have significantly distinct reaction rates with 1o2 and their half lives facing 1o2 are 2 10 4 4 22 86 430 300 1504 and 12034 60169 min respectively actually a lot of common organics have low k1o2 107 in acidic and neutral environments lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a for most of the studies about ps aops the reactions are carried out in acidic environments due to the influence of pms and pds on ph value therefore the role of 1o2 in ps aops is very questionable 3 3 conflicts on the aspect of ph dependence within the most studied ph wide 3 11 generally the removal of target pollutant is not limited by ph or only inhibited at the alkaline condition in 1o2 dominant ps aops system gao et al 2019 liu et al 2022b luo et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a zheng et al 2023 because catalysts are usually negatively charged under alkaline conditions the inhibition at alkaline conditions might be caused by the repulsion between the catalyst and persulfate liang et al 2022a tian et al 2021 wang et al 2022b xia et al 2022 the high wide ph tolerance of 1o2 in ps aops is contradictory to some reports in a photosensitized rb system a traditional 1o2 generation system there was almost no removal of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp at ph 4 5 and 7 yun et al 2018 whereas in a ps aops system with 100 generation of 1o2 the removal of 4 cp is not limited by ph 3 4 10 8 zhang et al 2021a for a large number of organics 1o2 is about two orders of magnitude more readily to degrade deprotonated organics than un deprotonated ones table 2 li et al 2020a tratnyek and hoigne 1991 wu et al 2021 showing that the reaction between 1o2 and organics is highly ph dependent this property has been used as evidence to exclude the role of 1o2 wu et al 2021 however using perinaphthenone as a photosensitizer to generate 1o2 appiani appiani et al 2017 found that the degradation of furfuryl alcohol ffa by 1o2 is ph 3 12 independent indicating 1o2 has wide ph tolerance these conflicts about the ph dependence of 1o2 might be related to the types of organics and the 1o2 generation system in the photosensitized rb system the removal of 4 cp at ph 4 is tremendously lower than at ph 9 but the difference in the elimination rate of pentachlorophenol between ph 4 and 9 is relatively small yun et al 2018 at different ph the light absorption ability of photosensitizer might vary a lot for instance under irradiation of 546 nm light rb cannot adsorb light well at ph 6 resulting in low generation of 1o2 nowakowska and kępczyński 1998 there might be also other reasons for example the interaction between photosensitizer and target pollutant would change a lot as the change of ph having the potential to affect the formation of 1o2 in addition some studies reported that the key ros or the generation rate of ros is ph dependent which might be that ph can affect the protonation degree of persulfate or target pollutants change the surface zeta potential or hydroxyl group content of catalyst and affect the dissolution rate of metal ions for metal containing catalyst huang et al 2022 liang et al 2022a lu et al 2022 tian et al 2021 xie et al 2022a xing et al 2020 zong et al 2020 in a fecu doped g c3n4 pms system under acidic condition ph 3 1 ho and 1o2 both contributed a lot to ofloxacin removal but at ph 9 1o2 become the dominant ros tian et al 2021 it is because fe and cu species in fecu doped g c3n4 tend to exist as iron hydroxides and copper hydroxides under alkaline conditions leading to loss of their ability of electron gain and loss in another system ni feocl pds visible light the generation of 1o2 at ph 10 0 is over 4 times than at ph 6 5 and the authors propose that pds is easier to be activated at alkaline conditions lu et al 2022 all in all the wide ph tolerance of 1o2 needs further systematic study 3 4 potential misleading of inorganic ions influence the high selectivity to degrade organics in some ps aops systems might not be due to 1o2 but because of the high ability of the inorganic radicals to degrade organics and the presence of etp generally it is known as that so4 and ho can grab electron from the common inorganic ions to form corresponding inorganic radicals wang and wang 2021 the redox potential of cl no3 h2po4 and hco3 are 2 4 v 2 3 2 5 v 2 65 v and 1 65 v respectively neta and huie 1988 patra et al 2020 wang and wang 2021 wojnárovits et al 2020a wojnárovits and takács 2019 wu et al 2020 without considering the reported unreasonable value 2 2 v the redox potential of 1o2 is lower than all of these common inorganic radicals it means that 1o2 can hardly be consumed by these inorganic ions thus 1o2 still has high ability to degrade organics in the presence of high concentrations of inorganic ions appiani et al 2017 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d zhang et al 2021a even for hco3 with low redox potential it has high second order reaction rate constants khco3 with a lot of organics such as sulfamethoxazole 4 4 108 m 1s 1 sulfamethazine 4 4 108 m 1s 1 phenol 2 2 107 m 1s 1 propranolol 2 5 108 m 1s 1 and diclofenac 7 8 107 m 1s 1 wojnárovits et al 2020b thus when the target pollutants have high khco3 it needs careful judgment of the 1o2 role of course 1o2 dominated ps aops do not always have a high tolerance to inorganic ions due to the possibility of active sites occupied by these inorganic ions liu et al 2023 or the ph increase caused by carbonate xia et al 2022 in recent years the etp is revealed as the critical way of pollutant elimination in ps aops and this way also has high selectivity in the removal of organics due to their moderate redox potential 0 6 1 2 v cheng et al 2023a hu et al 2017 lee et al 2015 ren et al 2022 shao et al 2020 to be honest in the ps aops with 100 or nearly 100 generation of 1o2 mi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a there is a similar performance of linear sweep voltammetry lsv analyses with etp dominated ps aops system ren et al 2022 2020 thus the overestimation of 1o2 might happen due to the neglect of electron transfer to make a more accurate judgment the system with 100 or nearly 100 generation of 1o2 should be further verified by pre mixing tests the pre mixing of pms and catalyst with different times yang et al 2022c and separation experiment pms and pollutant were separated by catalyst membrane or salt bridge wang et al 2022c yun et al 2018 although some reasons have been discussed for the above conflicts the primary origins should be attributed to the unnoticed drawbacks of the methods used to identify and evaluate the 1o2 role thus the following contents focus on discussions of these methods which can be classified into two groups identification of 1o2 and evaluation of 1o2 role namely to prove the existence of 1o2 and verify whether 1o2 plays an important role in the removal of organic or not fig 7 4 identification of 1o2 to study the role of 1o2 the existence of 1o2 should be proved first the main ways to identify 1o2 include phosphorescence detection based on physical quenching of 1o2 epr tests and various probes having specific reactions with 1o2 4 1 phosphorescence detection based on 1o2 relaxation emission detection of 1o2 relaxation is the most direct and convincing evidence for 1o2 generation including dimol emission at 634 and 703 nm eq 4 and monomol emission at 1270 nm eq 5 almeida et al 2003 daimon and nosaka 2007 derosa 2002 lu et al 2020 miyamoto et al 2003a to compare the difference of 1o2 role in h2o2 ocl and pms benzoquinone lu et al lu et al 2020 used a stopped flow spectrometer to detect the phosphorescence from dimol emission of 1o2 based on a homemade time resolved phosphorescence system shao et al shao et al 2021 found a sharp peak centered at 1270 nm in graphitized nanodiamond pms indicating the existence of 1o2 because the chemistry behind dimol emission has not been yet well understood adam et al 2005 the detection of monomol emission at around 1270 nm is more reliable in addition although phosphorescence detection is the most direct and reliable method to detect 1o2 it has not been widely used shao et al 2021 due to it requiring sophisticated instruments you 2018 4 o 2 1 δ g o 2 1 δ g 2 o 2 3 σ g h ν λ 634 and 703 nm 5 o 2 1 δ g o 2 3 σ g h ν λ 1270 nm 4 2 electron paramagnetic resonance 1 the spin trapping agents of 1o2 as early as 1976 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp had been used as the spin trapping agent of 1o2 and temp can react with 1o2 to produce 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl tempo free radiacl lion et al 1976 tempo has a three lines epr spectrum with 1 1 1 intensity lion et al 1976 in the studies of ps aops apart from temp yan et al 2022a zong et al 2020 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol templ and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone tempn have been used to trap 1o2 as well fig 8 a and b gao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d yin et al 2018 the oxidation products of templ and tempn by 1o2 have a similar epr spectrum with tempo noting that in a lot of reports all three spin trapping agents are usually abbreviated as temp gao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d 2018 yin et al 2018 or tmp yu et al 2023 for the convenience of discussion in this review 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone are all named as temp and tempo represents their 1o2 oxidation product in addition temp can increase the ph and then might accelerate the decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2018 hence the epr tests with only pms should be always provided as a control 2 debatable role of tempo as the evidence of 1o2 the appearance of tempo does not always indicate the existence of 1o2 due to that tempo also can be generated through electron transfer mechanism fig 8 c lu et al 2020 nardi et al 2014 yun et al 2018 to verify the formation of tempo by electron transfer mechanism nardi et al nardi et al 2014 employed magic blue one electron oxidizing agent to extract electron from temp resulting in the appearance of tempo in presence of 1o2 fig 8 c as known in some ps aops systems the etp is responsible for pollutant removal ren et al 2022 as a result the appearance of tempo in ps aops is not solid evidence of 1o2 existence thus to further verify the appearance of 1o2 epr tests in d2o are employed because the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o can lead to a higher intensity of epr signal than in h2o hu et al 2021 liu et al 2023 for example in n cnt 60 pms system replacing h2o with d2o leads to enhanced epr peak intensity of tempo suggesting the generation of 1o2 liu et al 2023 contrary results appeared in some studies shao et al 2021 yun et al 2018 namely d2o gives rise to lower tempo epr signal shao et al shao et al 2021 suppose that this phenomenon could be attributed to the retardation of pms decomposition in d2o but according to the evidence of yun et al yun et al 2018 this is because electron transfer results in the appearance of tempo rather than by 1o2 oxidation noting that in the epr tests of yun et al yun et al 2018 their key evidence is that a stronger epr signal of tempo was found in the photoexcited rb system but not for cnt pms system after replacing h2o with d2o in other words the influence of d2o on the decomposition of pms was not considered this point might be the origin of the conflict 3 the possible misleading role of the inexistence of radical epr signal generally 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is used as the spin trapping agent of so4 ho and o2 in the studies related to ps aops of zhang et al zhang et al 2021a wang et al wang et al 2022a yan et al yan et al 2022b and zhao et al zhao et al 2022 there are no signals of dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo ooh but strong signals of tempo are found wang et al 2022a zhang et al 2021a zhao et al 2022 this phenomenon is used as solid evidence that 1o2 plays the primary role in pollutant removal in a recent study yu et al 2023 a similar phenomenon was found but the intensity of tempo in the catalyst pms system is even lower than that only in the presence of pms and in this study the etp contributes to the elimination of pollutants instead of 1o2 yu et al 2023 as above discussed tempo can be generated by electron transfer mechanism thus the inexistence of dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo ooh but strong signals of tempo might lead to an overestimation of the effect of 1o2 4 judging the role of 1o2 in the elimination of pollutants the formation of tempo only can prove the existence of 1o2 but cannot confirm its contribution to pollutant removal thus there are studies to judge the role of 1o2 by comparing the intensity change of the tempo epr signal before and after the addition of target pollutants if the intensity of the tempo epr signal decreased it means 1o2 plays a role in pollutant removal chen et al 2021a gao et al 2020b xia et al 2022 but there is a possibility that 1o2 is the derivative of radicals and in this case the target pollutants can consume radicals to decrease the intensity of the tempo epr signal in addition in the study of gao et al 2021b the addition of bisphenol a enhanced the signal intensity of tempo and decreased the signal intensity of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 but they still suppose that 1o2 contribute to the bisphenol a removal and the enhancement of tempo signal is because bisphenol a is preferentially reacted with so4 and ho assuming that so4 ho and 1o2 coexist there is a high possibility that parts of temp and tempo can be degraded by so4 and ho if the ability of so4 and ho to degrade temp and tempo is significantly higher than that of the target pollutant to consume 1o2 the addition of the target pollutant with high reactivity to so4 and ho can enhance the tempo signal besides if a lot of quinones are produced in the degradation of target pollutants they will catalyze persulfate to form 1o2 leading to enhanced tempo signal ahmad et al 2013 4 3 probes some chemicals having specific reactions with 1o2 can be used as probes of 1o2 the products of probes and 1o2 can be detected by a spectrophotometer fluorescence detector or hplc aubry 1985 wu et al 2011 you 2018 to be honest a large number of molecular probes of 1o2 have been developed and well summarized wu et al 2011 you 2018 but only a few of these probes are used in ps aops because of some drawbacks such as commercially unavailable insoluble in water low specificity to 1o2 and photosensitized formation of 1o2 1 spectrophotometric probes this kind of probe can be detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer after their specific reactions with 1o2 their characteristic absorption wavelength will change π conjugated dienes can be applied as spectrophotometric probes for 1o2 including 5 membered heteroarenes acenes and alkenes with ozonide analogues endoperoxides and 1 2 dioxetanes as their reaction products with 1o2 respectively you 2018 compared with their parent compounds these products have shorter π conjugation lengths which bring about hypsochromic or hypochromic shifts in the electronic absorption spectra you 2018 9 10 diphenylanthracene dpa and 9 10 anthracenediyl bis methylene dimalonic acid abda are two typical spectrophotometric probes fig 9 a and b displaying peak wavelength at about 378 nm and 400 nm respectively gao et al 2021a you 2018 zhang et al 2022a in the presence of fe sac and pms gao et al gao et al 2021a used the decrease in absorption intensity of dpa around 378 nm as evidence of 1o2 existence several studies reported the decreased absorbance intensity of abda in ps aops indicating the appearance of 1o2 adil et al 2020 liu et al 2023 lou et al 2017 identification of 1o2 by spectrophotometric probes in ps aops is not ideal because the degradation of spectrophotometric probes by other ros also can lead to the reduction of absorbance intensity 2 photoluminescent probes compared with spectrophotometric probes photoluminescent probes are more sensitive to 1o2 photoluminescent probes usually contain two parts the 1o2 receptor and the photosensitive part generally the 1o2 receptor can react with 1o2 to produce endoperoxide which will change the way of photoexcited electron to back to ground state thus 1o2 will be detected by monitoring the change in fluorescence or phosphorescence signal 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf is the most commonly used photoluminescent probe of 1o2 with 1 2 dibenzoylbenzene dbb as the reaction product fig 9 c although dpbf does not photosensitize the formation of 1o2 and is sensitive to 1o2 it is not soluble in pure water and cannot react with other ros ho o2 ro roo h2o2 and c centered radicals to generate dbb carloni et al 1993 entradas et al 2020 zhang and li 2011 obviously dpbf is not a desired probe of 1o2 in ps aops singlet oxygen sensor green sosg is another commercially available and widely used photoluminescent probe of 1o2 fig 9 d due to its water solubility and specificity to 1o2 nosaka and nosaka 2017 sosg has been used to detect 1o2 in ps aops for example with graphitized nanodiamond as catalyst and pms as oxidant sosg endoperoxide sosg ep appeared with strong fluorescence intensity demonstrating the existence of 1o2 shao et al 2021 however depending on the irradiation conditions some relaxation pathways of sosg would happen to disturb the detection of 1o2 including intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer major contribution and intersystem crossing with 1o2 generation minor contribution under visible light excitation and sosg decomposition as the result of two photon ionization under ultraviolet light excitation kim et al 2013 in addition sosg also can photosensitize 1o2 formation kim et al 2013 3 chemiluminescence probes the reaction between chemiluminescence probes and 1o2 provides luminescence responses without the requirement of photoexcitation in the early period the widely used chemiluminescence probes include 2 methyl 6 phenyl 3 7 dihydroimidazo 1 2 α pyrazin 3 one cla and its derivatives however cla and its derivatives lack selectivity for 1o2 due to their reaction with o2 although chemiluminescence probes with high selectivity have been developed generally their reactions to produce chemiluminescence need triggers and the produced chemiluminescence has a short lifetime wu et al 2011 you 2018 4 chromatography probes some endoperoxides are the specific products between probes and 1o2 if the products have relatively high stability to exist for more than several hours they can be detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc to be the evidence of 1o2 tetrapotassium rubrene 2 3 8 9 tetracarboxylate rtc a red compound exhibits high reactivity toward 1o2 rtco2 is considered to be the specific product of rtc with 1o2 involvement to examine the 1o2 formation in various mineral compounds h2o2 systems aubry aubry 1985 used hplc to detect rtco2 as evidence of 1o2 formation besides as a spectrophotometric probe dpa can serve as a chromatography probe as well the dpao2 as the reaction product of dpa and 1o2 is thermostable almeida et al 2003 miyamoto et al 2003b interestingly liu et al liu et al 2020b found that in the presence of both thiacloprid the target pollutant and pms dpao2 increased significantly indicating that thiacloprid can catalyze pms to form 1o2 in the benzoquinone pms system zhou et al zhou et al 2015 confirmed the generation of 1o2 by the formation of dpao2 as the most used quencher of 1o2 ffa can be used as a chromatography probe as well because the products of ffa degraded by 1o2 and radicals are different zheng et al 2022 using chromatography probes the degradation product should be detected in time due to the relative instability of endoperoxides there might be intermediates having the same retention time in hplc detection as the target endoperoxides product aubry 1985 thus the detection by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms always is suggested as the supplement 5 evaluation of 1o2 role 5 1 quenching experiment 1 the commonly used 1o2 quenchers and the way to ensure their dosage quenching experiments are the most used methods to verify the role of 1o2 these experiments are based on competitive reactions in which the quenchers with high reaction rates with 1o2 are selected ffa l histidine nan3 and β carotene are the frequenter in quenching experiments of 1o2 and their k1o2 are 1 2 108 3 2 107 1 109 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively liu et al 2023 shao et al 2021 wu et al 2022b wu and kim 2022 yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 to ensure the dosage and efficiency of the selected quenchers the competition kinetic rate coefficient f r o s t s is better to be calculated eq 6 ren et al 2022 in which f r o s t s is the proportion of ros consumed by the target pollutant k t r o s and k q r o s represent the second order rate constants for the ros with target pollutant and quencher respectively t and q are the initial concentrations of target pollutant and quencher respectively when f r o s t s is less than 0 01 the scavenger can almost eliminate the target ros however this method needs to know the reaction rates of ros with target pollutants traditionally the contribution of 1o2 is evaluated by the inhibition degree of the target pollutants in the presence of these quenchers the inhibition degree is related to the dosage of quenchers however some pollutants have significantly higher second order reaction rate constants to the related ros than the quencher in this case to meet f r o s t s 0 01 it needs a large quantity of quencher which might affect the generation of ros by changing the solvent property thus it can reduce the dosage of quenchers to obtain a relatively high value of f r o s t s and then judge the quenching effect by comparing the difference between the practical and calculated f r o s t s 6 f r o s t s k t r o s t k t r o s t k q r o s q 2 the overestimation of 1o2 caused by direct reaction between quenchers and pms noting that owing to some of the 1o2 quenchers being readily consumed by so4 and ho liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 it needs to know the contributions of so4 and ho using tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol as quenchers at first in ps aops it is often found that there is no inhibition on pollutants removal by tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol addition but by 1o2 quenchers suggesting that 1o2 plays a vital role in pollutants removal however the quenching effects of 1o2 quenchers are very likely from the direct consumption of pms l histidine and nan3 are ready to react with pms liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 for example in the presence of 25 mm l histidine and nan3 about 70 and more than 95 pms 1 mm was decomposed within 10 min respectively yun et al 2018 compared with l histidine and nan3 ffa and β carotene have a relatively low ability to decompose pms gao et al 2022c shao et al 2021 but for β carotene there is a report that β carotene cannot efficiently deactivate intracellular singlet oxygen bosio et al 2013 implying that the quenching effect of β carotene may be misleading more importantly β carotene is water insoluble in addition the inhibition of pollutant removal in the presence of ffa might be from the inhibition of pollutants adsorption instead of degradation deng et al 2022 fu et al 2022 3 the overestimation of 1o2 resulted from the quenching results of radicals the quenching effect of tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol can result in an overestimation of the 1o2 role gao et al gao et al 2022c 2022b and guo et al guo et al 2021b 2021a developed a kinetic model based on the bimolecular reaction of micropollutants with ros having the ability to calculate the contributions of ros and predict the elimination rate of pollutants according to this model so4 and ho are responsible for the pollutants removal in co ⅱ pms system studies and the quenching effects of tba methanol ethanol and isopropanol depend on the reaction rates between target pollutants and so4 for the organics having a high reaction rate with so4 their removal cannot be suppressed by tba methanol ethanol and isopropanol in addition underestimation of 1o2 might happen as well according to the quenching results of radicals liu et al liu et al 2021 found that ethanol has no significant inhibition on phenol removal but tba has which is due to the suppression of pms utilization by tba rather than that ho plays an important role 5 2 solvent exchange because 1o2 has different lifetimes in the common solvents the 1o2 role can be evaluated by solvent exchange generally if one ps aops system is 1o2 dominated replacing h2o with the solvent in which 1o2 has a much longer lifetime will enhance the removal of pollutants gao et al 2020a liu et al 2020b pan et al 2021 for example in n cnt 60 pms system the removal efficiency of phenol increased obviously after exchanging 50 h2o by d2o liu et al 2023 d2o is the most used luo et al 2019 yang et al 2022d 2023 zheng et al 2023 since it has similar properties to h2o but sometimes the results of d2o exchange are not so solid because the solvent isotope effect may give rise to a 10 20 decrease in the chemical reaction rate eddy and menzies 1940 gardner swain et al 1960 gardner swain and w bader 1960 shao et al shao et al 2021 proved that 1o2 played an important role in graphitized nanodiamond pms system but d2o led to low removal efficiency of 4 cp and low intensity of tempo signal because d2o induced retardation of pms decomposition in addition to d2o h2o exchange by methanol or ethanol is also a good way to verify the role of 1o2 because they not only can prolong the lifetime of 1o2 but also can quench some other ros such as so4 and ho lu et al lu et al 2020 found that after 50 h2o exchange by methanol the epr signal of tempo was enhanced in h2o2 ocl system a typical system for 1o2 generation in the study of zheng et al zheng et al 2023 100 change of h2o by methanol the removal of sulfamethoxazole was not inhibited but server inhibition happened with the addition of β carotene indicating the important role of 1o2 this phenomenon also implies that for some unknown reasons the solvent exchange does not always enhance the removal of target pollutants 5 3 comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system there are some classical 1o2 formation systems such as h2o2 ocl photosensitized methods dyes as photosensitizers and mineral compounds moo4 2 woo4 2 vo3 la2o3 etc h2o2 alkaline condition aubry 1985 derosa 2002 tai and jiang 2005 which are shown in the eqs 7 10 aubry 1985 derosa 2002 2002 if one kind of organic can be readily oxidized by 1o2 in ps aops correspondingly it should be removed efficiently in these classical 1o2 formation systems some researchers have used this point to confirm the role of 1o2 in ps aops as known ffa is highly sensitive to 1o2 lu et al lu et al 2020 found that ffa can be removed efficiently in h2o2 ocl but not for smx suggesting that smx is inert to 1o2 bisphenol a carbamazepine cimetidine propranolol phenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol all can be effectively removed in ps aops but only cimetidine and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol have high degradation rates in photoexcited rb system duan et al 2022 yun et al 2018 ibuprofen can be well degraded in both fep pms system and the moo4 2 h2o2 system with this as evidence zheng et al zheng et al 2022 suppose that 1o2 can effectively remove ibuprofen the above three classical 1o2 formation systems have their disadvantages respectively aubry and bouttemy 1997 the reaction between h2o2 and ocl is too fast leading to a large fraction of 1o2 being lost through bubbles aubry and bouttemy 1997 in the photosensitized method there might be other ros formation derosa 2002 and the target pollutants might be in an excited state which makes it easier to be degraded especially under ultraviolet uv light under ultraviolet and visible light photoexcited rb has similar performance to generate 1o2 thus visible light photoexcited rb is a good system pickering and wiesner 2005 as for the moo4 2 h2o2 system it needs an alkaline environment aubry and cazin 1988 you 2018 in which the ability of 1o2 to oxidize some organics would be significantly enhanced lee et al 2020 li et al 2020a as known in ps aops after the addition of pms or pds the ph of the system will quickly decrease to acid hu et al 2018 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022b thus the results in the moo4 2 h2o2 system are not good references for the ps aops system 7 c l o h 2 o 2 h 2 o c l 1 o 2 8 2 h 2 o 2 m o o 4 2 2 h 2 o 1 o 2 9 p s 0 h ν p s 0 k i s c p t 1 p photosensitizer 10 p t 1 o 2 k e n p s 0 1 o 2 the above classical 1o2 formation systems are homogeneous the interaction between pollutants or persulfate and heterogeneous catalysts might influence the degradation of the pollutants for instance in the photoexcited methylene blue mb system ph increase resulted in a degradation tendency change of phenol that is contrary to the mno2 pds system 1o2 as the main rs and the authors suppose that it is because the electrostatic repulsion among mno2 surface persulfate anions and phenol at higher ph 8 5 10 zhu et al 2019 thus 1o2 formation systems with heterogeneous catalysts need to be considered for example uv fullerol system is a good candidate badireddy et al 2007 pickering and wiesner 2005 the uv fullerol system is more effective in acidic conditions pickering and wiesner 2005 which are identical to the acidic environment in ps aops but for the pollutants having the potential to be easily decomposed under uv uv fullerol is not a good choice 5 4 the quantification of 1o2 contribution a lot of ps aops systems contain multiple ros including pms itself 1o2 so4 ho and o2 to fully understand their roles it needs to quantify their respective contributions all the quantitative methods are based on reaction kinetics on the whole these methods can be divided into three categories quenching based method probe based method and solvent based method 1 quenching based method almost all ps aops related studies have carried out quenching experiments to evaluate the role of various ros thus the first order reaction rate constants of pollutants removed in the presence of these quenchers are available which can be used to calculate the contributions of ros cai et al 2022 gao et al 2021b guan et al 2018 in the quenching based method the used quencher numbers need to be the same as the number of target ros besides the number of ros that the quenchers can effectively quench should be an inclusion relation for example quencher a quencher b and quencher c were selected to quantify ho so4 and 1o2 quencher a should only effectively quench ho to obtain the first order reaction rate constant k1 and quencher b can quench both ho and so4 for obtaining k2 while for quencher c it needs to have the ability to quench all of ho so4 and 1o2 to get k3 if the first order reaction rate constant of target pollutant degradation without quenchers is k0 the contributions of the three ros to target pollutants removal can be calculated based on eqs 11 13 cai et al 2022 using k2 k0 to represent the contribution of 1o2 is not well because there might be other ros at least pms exists thus the eq 13 is better divided into the eqs 14 and 15 on the whole the key to this method needs to find suitable quenchers having the inclusion relation to quench ros generally tba methanol or ethanol or isopropanol and ffa can be used to quantify the contributions of ho so4 and 1o2 in addition o2 is also a common ros in ps aops li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 zhuo et al 2022 if o2 is considered a quencher with high reactivity to all of so4 ho 1o2 and o2 should be selected for this purpose 4 chlorobenzoicacid might be a good quencher because its second order reaction rate constant to so4 ho 1o2 and o2 are 3 6 10 8 5 0 10 8 1 4 10 7 8 6 10 7 m 1s 1 respectively gao et al 2022c although this method is simple for the target pollutants with high reaction rates with so4 and ho tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol cannot quench the degradation of the target pollutants in this case the quenching based method is not suitable in addition when using this method the reasonable dosage of quenchers should be calculated based on eq 6 to ensure that the target ros can be efficiently eliminated when the calculated dosage of quenchers is too high this quantification method is not suggested because the high concentration of quenchers might change the interaction among the catalyst persulfate and pollutant 11 r o h k 0 k 1 k 0 12 r s o 4 k 1 k 2 k 0 13 r 1 o 2 k 2 k 0 14 r 1 o 2 k 2 k 3 k 0 15 r o t h e r s k 3 k 0 2 probe based method in this method the degradation experiments of chemical probes are used to obtain the concentrations or exposures of the various ros gao et al 2022c 2022b liu et al 2023 xie et al 2022b firstly the second order reaction rate constants of the selected probes with the various ros should be available secondly the number n of selected probes should be the same as the ros number n because it needs to solve a system of multivariate equations however the pms concentration or exposures can be directly calculated based pms consumption curve during the reaction thus the number of selected probes can be n 1 for instance if the ros in the system include pms 1o2 so4 and ho the contributions of the ros can be calculated by the eqs 16 24 gao et al 2022b 2022c in the following equations p m s d t s o 4 d t h o d t and 1 o 2 d t are the exposures of ros

ps aops both etp and ros contribute to the removal of target pollutants there are no second order reaction rate constants between etp and the organic pollutants thus the above probe based method cannot be used to calculate the contribution of etp f e t p we proposed a modified probe based method to calculate the contribution of etp based on the expansion of eq 23 if there are pms 1o2 so4 ho and etp for the target pollutant removal eq 23 should be expanded to eq 25 rrate and k p m s p m s d t can be obtained by degradation experiment if the target organic pollutant has known second order reaction rate constants with these ros k s o 4 k o h and k 1 o 2 will be available thus if s o 4 d t h o d t and 1 o 2 d t are known f e t p can be calculated by eqs 25 29 because the organics with

56 11635 11645 environ sci technol 2022 56 78 97 it can be assumed that etp does not participate in the removal of these organics thus these organics can be used to obtain the exposures of ros s o 4 d

methods this method is based on the kinetic solvent isotope effect assuming that among the ros only the 1o2 related reactions are significantly affected by changing h2o to d2o the contribution x of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants can be obtained by the eq 30 cory et al 2009 jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2020b yang et al 2018 k o b s d 2 o t and k o b s h 2 o t are the first order rate constants of target pollutant degradation in d2o and h2o respectively k h 2 o 1 o 2 2 5 10 5 m 1s 1 and k d 2 o 1 o 2 1 6 10 4 m 1s 1 are the quenching rate constants of 1o2 by h2o and d2o respectively ω is the

conflicts 6 1 the origin of conflicts of 1o2 role the primary origins of conflicts in the 1o2 role mainly come from the overlooking of other degradation pathways overlooking of intrinsic drawbacks of the detection methods and unclear test conditions 1 overlooking of other degradation pathways because of the diversity of degradation pathways in ps aops the identification of the rs requires a series of tests such as epr quenching experiments probe degradation or transformation solvent exchange tests pre mixing tests and electrochemistry tests the absence of some of these tests can lead to an imperfect conclusion zhang et al zhang et al 2021a used various methods to prove that in fe doped g c3 n4 pms system 100 1o2 generation was realized however in this study the results of lsv tests are similar to those in the etp dominated studies ren et al 2022 pre mixing test and separation experiment pms and pollutant were separated by catalyst membrane or salt bridge should be further carried out to ensure if etp exists in this system or not in another study with 100 1o2 generation as well pre mixing of pms and catalyst only led to a slight inhibition of ciprofloxacin removal and more importantly the inhibition effect with 5 and 10 min of pre mixing is very close indicating the existence of etp but there is no separation experiment all 1o2 etp and mho belong to non radical ways they have some similarities shao et al 2022 thus in some 1o2 dominated systems the role of the other two non radical ways should be carefully studied but the related tests to identify etp or mho often are absent in a lot of studies table s1 2 overlooking of intrinsic drawbacks of the detection methods as discussed in sections 4 and 5 the methods used to study the role of 1o2 have drawbacks more or less table 3 among these methods epr and quenching tests are the most used however some researchers have ignored their drawbacks which is the most important reason for 1o2 role overestimation there are two typical cases firstly the appearance of tempo might be from etp instead of 1o2 kou et al kou et al 2023 prepared two kinds of carbon materials with polyaniline as a precursor c p50cn 900 dicyandiamide as extra n source and c p50c 900 c p50cn 900 pms has a much higher ability to degrade phenol than c p50c 900 pms but the tempo signal intensity in c p50c 900 pms even slightly higher than that in c p50cn 900 pms etp is the key way to remove phenol in c p50cn 900 pms and tempo is supposed to be from etp in some pds based systems there is a similar phenomenon namely that tempo appeared but etp is the key way to degrade pollutants cheng et al 2023b wang et al 2019 however verification of tempo origin is frequently lacking in related studies besides it also needs to note that the existence of 1o2 does not mean the important role of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants jiang et al 2017 li et al 2018a since 1o2 has low reactivity to most of the common pollutants in the acidic environment for instance in a fe iii doped g c3n4 pms system 1o2 was found but the author supposed that 1o2 cannot effectively remove 4 chlorophenol and one of the reasons is that 4 chlorophenol has a low k1o2 at ph 3 6 0 10 6 m 1s 1 li et al 2018a some other phenols such as phenol and bisphenol a even have lower k1o2 than 4 chlorophenol at acid conditions ren et al 2022 why do some studies prove that these phenols can be effectively removed in 1o2 dominated ps aops without buffer table s1 namely at acid conditions secondly the improper use of the quenchers can lead to an overestimation of the 1o2 role which should be the main reason why some pollutants with low k1o2 were proven to be effectively removed in 1o2 dominated ps aops l histidine and nan3 as quenchers of 1o2 have non negligible drawbacks l histidine and nan3 can quickly consume pms ffa has a higher k1o2 than l histidine gao et al 2022c however when they are both used l histidine usually has significantly higher inhibition effect in pollutant removal than ffa in both pms zheng et al 2023 and pds wang et al 2021 based systems compared with ffa nan3 still can directly consume some pds but it has a slow rate zhu et al 2019 thus the inhibition effect of l histidine and nan3 are not solid evidence to confirm the role of 1o2 but l histidine and nan3 are usually used as the quenchers without further using ffa li et al 2018b ma et al 2023 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022a compared with l histidine and nan3 ffa is more suitable as 1o2 quencher however the kso4 and kho of ffa are much higher one to two orders of magnitude than tba and methanol or ethanol or isopropanol thus the higher quenching effect of ffa is not always due to the elimination of 1o2 but it might be because ffa has a higher ability to quench so4 and ho gao et al 2022c besides in radical dominated ps aos for the pollutants with high kso4 and kho low dosages of tba and methanol even ffa almost have no quenching effect gao et al 2022c thus the improper use and dosage of the quenchers usually lead to an overestimation of the 1o2 role as a result some pollutants with low k1o2 at acid conditions are often supposed to be effectively degraded by 1o2 3 unclear test conditions different test conditions might result in different results epr is one of the most commonly used methods to identify 1o2 however it is puzzling about some epr results especially in the presence of only persulfate in some studies with only pms or pds no epr signal of 1o2 and radicals so4 and ho was found du et al 2021 liang et al 2022b liu et al 2020a miao et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 but it is contrary in others chen et al 2020 gao et al 2020a xu et al 2020 yang et al 2022b zhou et al 2022 in our opinion this phenomenon is strongly related to the detection conditions the different detection conditions have the potential to cause different results in the presence of the catalyst however most of the studies do not give the details of epr tests such as the ph the kind of buffer and the concentrations of trapping agents and persulfate 1o2 has similar performances to etp in some aspects thereby it needs electrochemistry tests to identify whether etp exists or not electrochemistry tests such as linear sweep voltammetry lsv and open circuit potential ocp are the important methods to identify etp however in some etp dominated studies there is no information about how the electrochemistry tests were carried out such as the ph and kind of the electrolyte the working electrode and how it is prepared as a result it is hard to compare the results of these studies 6 2 the methods to solve the conflicts according to the above aspects of conflict origin we propose a relatively reasonable process to identify the role of 1o2 it can be divided into three steps and noting that these steps should be modified according to the practical cases step one to confirm the existence of 1o2 if the related detection instrument is available phosphorescence detection based on 1o2 relaxation is always recommended as the most solid way to ensure the generation of 1o2 as an alternative the combination of the comparison of tempo signal intensity in different solvents and chromatography probes rtc or dpa is suggested if the signal intensity of tempo increases with the change of h2o into d2o it can judge the existence of 1o2 however replacing h2o with d2o does not always result in stronger tempo signal intensity because the negative effect on persulfate utilization caused by d2o might be stronger than the positive effect of 1o2 lifetime increase in d2o shao et al 2021 thus it is necessary to combine chromatography probes as further evidence the degradation products of chromatography probes should be detected by both hplc and hplc ms to avoid the appearance of products having the same retention time as target endoperoxides step two to roughly evaluate the 1o2 role by quenching tests solvent exchange methods and comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system in the quenching experiment ffa and ethanol or methanol or isopropanol are selected to quench 1o2 and radicals so4 and ho respectively the suitable dosage of quenchers should be calculated based on eq 6 to ensure that the addition of quenchers can effectively eliminate the target ros at the reasonable dosage of quenchers if ffa has a much stronger quenching effect the role of etp and mho cannot be ignored because they may co contribute to pollutant elimination with 1o2 thus to further confirm the role of 1o2 solvent exchange methods should be carried out if d2o can enhance the removal of pollutants 1o2 contributes to the removal of pollutants in addition we also suggest using these classical 1o2 generation systems as a reference it is important to note that because the production yield of 1o2 might be significantly different between classical 1o2 generation systems and ps aops systems the degradation of ffa at the same concentration and similar ph should be carried out in both systems as control otherwise it is hard to judge if the target pollutants can be effectively degraded by 1o2 for example in the study of zhu et al zhu et al 2019 the removal of phenol in a 1o2 dominated mno2 pds system is much higher than in a photoexcited mb system 1o2 formation system at ph 6 5 but the authors suppose that phenol is removed by 1o2 phenol itself being degraded by 1o2 is debatable but if the degradation of ffa is provided in both the photoexcited mb system and mno2 pds system the comparison will be more convincing if there is no etp or mho the contribution of 1o2 can be directly quantified by the probe based method however undergoing the above judgments can only prove whether 1o2 participates in pollutant removal or not but it still cannot prove whether etp and mho work or not besides if d2o cannot enhance pollutant removal the role of 1o2 should not be ignored because of the retardation effect on pms decomposition caused by d2o shao et al 2021 thereby no matter in which case the role of 1o2 needs to be further studied step three to evaluate the 1o2 role in the presence of etp or mho for the catalyst without metal it is relatively easy to distinguish the contribution of 1o2 and etp firstly pre mixing tests electrochemical analysis such as lsv and ocp and separation tests need to be used to confirm if etp exists and then probe based methods eqs 25 29 can be used to quantify their respective contributions in the case that mho might exist it is hard to distinguish its role from that of 1o2 because the transformation of sulfoxides to sulfones can be realized by addition to the heteroatoms of 1o2 and o atom transfer of mho respectively in a recent review of mho they also referred to the difficulty to distinguish the role of 1o2 and mho shao et al 2022 mho can exchange the oxygen atom 16o with h2 18o shao et al 2022 however the 18o isotope labeling technique is not viable as well to identify mho in ps aops because some studies propose that h2o participates in the formation of 1o2 by reacting with so5 or o2 liu et al 2022a shahzad et al 2020 wu et al 2021 thus the solvent exchange method might be effective in distinguishing 1o2 and mho besides mho can degrade organics in multiple ways while electrophilic addition is the main way for 1o2 to degrade organics fig 3 thus there will be different degradation products the degradation products of target pollutants in classical 1o2 and mho systems can be used to compare with those formed in ps aops systems however if 1o2 and mho coexist this method is unsuitable due to that the lifetime of mho s level is far longer than that of 1o2 μs level rodgers 1983 shao et al 2022 changing h2o by d2o should only have little influence on the efficiency of pollutant removal by mho 7 conclusion and prospects aiming to better understand the debatable role of 1o2 in ps aops and its origins this review have summarized and discussed 1o2 role through several aspects firstly we introduced some basic properties of 1o2 including electronic structure redox potential and life time of 1o2 the reaction between organic and 1o2 and the formation of 1o2 in ps aops secondly some conflicts of 1o2 role in ps aops are summarized and discussed from multiple aspects involving active sites reaction kinetics ph dependence and selectivity to organics degradation thirdly the methods to identify and evaluate the role of 1o2 are discussed especially focusing on some cases of overestimation of 1o2 because of the intrinsic drawbacks and unreasonable utilization of these methods based on our summarization and discussion for the judgment of 1o2 role in ps aops the following contents should be noticed or done 1 because of the inherent drawbacks of epr analysis and quenching tests other methods such as solvent exchange by d2o chromatography probes comparison with the classical 1o2 formation system and probe based quantification should be used as well to give more convincing results 2 there are several potential similar performances of 1o2 and the etp such as oxidizing temp to form tempo ph tolerance and selectivity to degrade organics thus in 1o2 dominated ps aops the role of the etp should be thoroughly verified 3 based on the classical 1o2 formation systems systematic studies should be carried out to ensure the degradation rule of the common organic pollutants at different ph which will provide a solid reference to study the role the 1o2 in ps aops 4 the influence of d2o should be deeply studied because it can prolong the lifetime of 1o2 but also can inhibit the decomposition of persulfate it needs to know which aspect will have a stronger influence on pollutants removal and if the influence is related to the type of pollutants 5 although the role of 1o2 in the removal of pollutants might be overestimated it might have high reactivity with the intermediate products of pollutants degradation to accelerate the mineralization of organics which also deserves further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

respectively guo et al 2022 singh et al 2019 optimizing the specific surface area and hierarchical pore structure of carbon materials is an attractive way to enhance the edlc kim et al 2021 however the salt adsorption capacity normally could only reach 15 30 mg g 1 constrained by the limited ion storage adsorption sites by contrast as a typical faradaic electrode material two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have a high capacitance owing to their layered architectures enabling ion intercalation de intercalation or surface redox reactions fleischmann et al 2022 srimuk et al 2017 2020 mos2 is a classical type of tmds and has attracted widespread attention due to its unique sandwich layer structure high theoretical capacitance and the variable redox states of molybdenum atom mo fleischmann et al 2022 hao et al 2020 nguyen et al 2022 nevertheless pure mos2 is inclined to agglomeration and structure collapse and suffers from low electrical conductivity in electrochemical related applications combination of mos2 and carbonaceous materials e g reduced graphene oxide mxene carbon nanotubes provides a feasible solution to tackle these challenges cai et al 2021 2022 chen et al 2022 gao et al 2020 han et al 2019 hu et al 2022 li et al 2022 peng et al 2021 however according to previous studies the desalination performance of mos2 based electrodes remains only 20 35 mg g 1 on average compared to sulfur s selenium se has a higher electrical conductivity 1 10 11 se versus 0 5 10 27 s m 1 higher polarizability and weaker energy of metal selenium m se bond for the redox reactions with na hao et al 2022 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2021 more specifically mose2 has a se mo se sandwich structure and possesses advantages over mos2 in terms of larger layer spacing 6 4 å versus 6 2 å and better electrical conductivity which facilitates rapid charge carrier migration as well as sodium ion diffusion and storage zhao et al 2022a these excellent electrochemical properties of mose2 make it a prospective cdi cathode candidate for na pseudocapacitive intercalation however to the best of our knowledge the mechanisms behind the use of selenides as a cdi electrode are still lacking and remain unclear in the meantime the aggregation tendency unsatisfactory electrical conductivity and potential volume expansion during ion embedding of mose2 still hinder its wide application yu et al 2021 utilizing two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d carbon materials as growth substrate materials to inhibit the aggregation and improve the conductivity of mose2 nanosheets might offer an effective solution architectures of porous materials especially carbons serving as the supporting scaffold materials for active sites need to be carefully controlled to bring the full potential of the materials kim et al 2022a 2022b 2022c lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b 2022c 3d mesoporous carbon hollow spheres mchs have been reported to possess a high specific

sites for ion transport and on the other hand assist in the stabilization of selenides ge et al 2018 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 furthermore 3d spherical structures of mchs are believed to be able to mitigate the aggregation of mose2 nanosheets and the hollow configuration allows for buffering of mose2 vol expansion during cycling xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 therefore mchs might possess ideal structures to serve as scaffolds to support and stabilize mose2 additionally an effective combination of mose2 and mchs would be an exemplary structural template to explore the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc herein we innovatively designed and synthesized a composite with 2d 3d interconnected architectures of mose2 nanosheets and mchs and explored its hcdi application for water desalination fig 1 as expected the excellent interfacial structure expanded two dimensional layer spacing and biphase 1t 2h structure provided superior electron transfer high

ultrapure water and 3 ml of nh3 h2o were mixed and stirred for 15 min then 3 46 ml of tetrapropyl orthosilicate was dropwise added to the mixture solution and continued stirring for 15 min followed by dosing 0 4 g of resorcinol and 0 56 ml of formaldehyde 37 wt after which stirring was kept for 24 h afterward the precipitates were separated by centrifugation washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol and then dried at 60 c overnight in a vacuum oven the material mchs was finally obtained by calcination at 700 c for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere and etching with 20 wt naoh solution to remove silica the reason why 700 c was chosen to synthesize the mchs is that intact mesoporous hollow spherical structure a larger specific surface area a larger pore volume a larger carbon content and an appropriate pore size could be obtained in comparison with the mchs prepared at other carbonization temperatures of 500 c and 900 c ghosh et al 2018 2 1 2 preparation of mose2 mchs mose2 mchs was prepared via a facile solvothermal method specifically a certain amount of the as synthesized mchs was mixed with 30 mg of moo3 and 30 mg of selenium and then added into the mixture of 15 ml of ethanol 10 ml of deionized water and 5 ml of h2n2 h2o with continuous stirring applied after stirring for 30 min the mixture was put into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated at 200 c for 12 h finally the mose2 mchs was collected by suction filtration with 0 22 μm millipore filter washed several times with ethanol and deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c overnight in the above synthesis process of mose2 mchs mose2 mchs composites with various ratios of mose2 to mchs were prepared in order to identify the optimal 2d 3d interconnected architectures that would exhibit excellent synergistic effects when the usage amount of mchs was 15 mg 30 mg and 60 mg making the ratio of mose2 to mchs as 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 we labeled these samples as mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 respectively see fig 2 a for reference the same synthetic procedure without the addition of mchs was adopted to prepare pure mose2 2 2 hcdi experiments as schematically shown in fig s1 in supporting information a self made single channel flow by asymmetric hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi cell with batch mode operation was used to evaluate the electrochemical desalination performance of mose2 mchs electrode the hcdi cell consisted of a pair of electrodes with activated carbon ac as the anode and mose2 mchs material as the cathode and an anion exchange membrane aem and a cation exchange membrane cem were assembled next to the anode and cathode respectively for suppressing the co ion transport the anode and cathode were separated by a 200 µm thickness non conductive nylon sheet 300 mesh for fluid flow and prevention of short circuit silicon gaskets were used to prevent water leakage all the parts were assembled with the use of acrylic plates with holes drilled on the four sides to allow for fastening with bolts the mose2 mchs or ac electrode was prepared by mixing the active material carbon black and pvdf with a mass ratio of 8 1 1 with the addition of a small amount of nmp the mixed powder was fully grounded to form a homogeneous slurry which was then uniformly coated on a graphite paper to obtain an electrode size 5 cm 5 cm the electrode was finally dried at 60 c overnight under vacuum condition the active material s mass of each electrode was controlled at about 50 mg in the batch mode operation 50 ml nacl solution with different concentrations was used to simulate the treated brackish water driven by a peristaltic pump the saline water flowed through the hcdi cell and back into the feed tank in the single pass mode operation nacl solution was continuously fed into the hcdi cell at a flow rate of 7 5 ml min 1 without recirculation during the tests physicochemical adsorption equilibrium was firstly reached in the absence of electricity and then a constant voltage was applied to realize ion electrosorption after which desorption of ions and regeneration of the electrodes were achieved via the application of a reversed voltage the solution flow rate was controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump and the direct voltage was supplied by a direct current power source the temperature of the treated water was kept at 25 c during the experiment to reduce the error caused by the effect of temperature on the conductivity the conductivity and ph of the solution were constantly monitored by a conductivity meter and a ph meter while the electrical current was recorded by a current probe dcp bta connected to a data acquisition system sensordaq vernier usa the calibration curve of nacl concentration versus conductivity and the calculation methods for salt adsorption capacity sac mg g 1 salt adsorption rate sar mg g 1 min 1 charge efficiency λ and energy consumption w kwh kg 1 nacl were provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization sem and tem images were employed to visualize the morphological characteristics of the as synthesized materials as can be seen from fig 2b c pure mose2 showed a nanoflower like morphology size around 1 μm which resulted from the agglomeration of mose2 nanosheets the mchs exhibited a homogeneous spherical shape particle size around 320 nm fig 2d e hollow structure and abundant radial pore channels fig 3 d e as expected the sem morphology of mose2 mchs composites demonstrates that the introduction of mchs could effectively inhibit the agglomeration of mose2 nanosheets mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 clearly exhibited the vertical channel structure of 2d nanosheets uniformly anchored on the surface of 3d hollow carbon spheres fig 2f h which minimizes the tortuosity of ion migration process however when the addition of mose2 was twice the amount of mchs namely mose2 mchs 2 mose2 nanosheets aggregated and were adhered on the carbon spheres and blocked the pores of mchs fig 2i it might be attributed that the shell surface of mchs cannot provide sufficient growth sites when mose2 is overloaded based on the results it can be concluded that for mose2 mchs 1 the rich mesopores of the mchs surface were not completely covered by the vertically aligned interfacial structure of mose2 which is believed to promote solution penetration and create an efficient conduit for ion and electron transport and meanwhile abundant pseudocapacitive ion intercalation sites from the loaded mose2 might be provided we will confirm this later moreover this superior structure was effectively preserved after the hcdi cycling experiments fig 2j in addition according to the corresponding tem images fig 3e and elemental mappings fig 3g mose2 mchs maintained the hollow interior space and mose2 nanosheets were only dispersed on the inner and external sides of the carbon shell walls thickening the shell from 50 nm to 60 nm fig 3d e in this manner the active adsorption sites of mchs can be largely preserved to offer the best synergistic effects and the vertical distribution of mose2 effectively facilitated mass transfer the formation of the inner mose2 nanosheets may be the result of the solution penetrating inside the hollow mesoporous nanoreactor through the pore channels followed by the growth of mose2 on the inner shell walls during the synthesis process due to the carefully regulated development from the mchs substrate mose2 grown on the mose2 mchs composite exhibited a significantly less layered structure when compared to the layers of pure mose2 nanosheets fig 3c f notably the high resolution tem hrtem of mose2 mchs 1 showed the extended layer spacing lattice fringes 0 69 nm versus 0 64 nm relative to pure mose2 which can be indexed to the 002 plane of mose2 in combination with xrd characterization results the layer expansion could benefit ion diffusion and storage and meanwhile significantly lessen internal strain during ion intercalation and deintercalation gao et al 2020 these findings demonstrate the significance and excellence of mchs as a dispersion and growth limiting substrate for mose2 loading further examination of specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution of the as prepared samples was carried out through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms with the results shown in fig 4 a the specific surface area of mose2 mchs composites achieved a large enhancement against the low ssa of pure mose2 only 8 9 m2 g 1 and the ssa of the mose2 mchs composites increased with the decreased addition amount of mose2 namely 103 0 286 1 and 403 1 m2 g 1 for mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 respectively the significantly enhanced ssa of mose2 mchs composites compared to pure mose2 was attributed to the high specific surface area provided by the mchs mesoporous walls and the dispersed few layered nanosheet structure the hysteresis curves exhibited type ⅳ shape of isotherms with strip hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure suggesting a predominance of mesopores it has been previously reported that the dominant mesoporous structures of electrodes in cdi could favorably facilitate mass transfer wang et al 2019 according to the bjh pore size analysis the pore size distribution shifted toward smaller size pores with the increase of mose2 content fig 4b the major pore size distribution of mose2 mchs 1 was about 6 5 nm and a large pore volume of 1 20 cm3 g 1 was retained while mose2 mchs 2 displayed significant coverage of mesopores 5 6 nm 0 360 cm3 g 1 due to the stacking of mose2 nanosheets on the surface fig 4b inset and more details are given in table s1 therefore the reasonable arrangement of mose2 aided in maintaining the high specific surface area and suitable pore size distribution of mchs while boosting the electrochemically active surface area and active sites for na adsorption moreover the preserved mesopores could limit the dissolution of selenides during charging discharging cycles and increase the electrode s durability kim and kang 2020 xiao et al 2021 xrd raman spectra and xps characterization were also conducted to analyze the crystal structure and chemical state of all the synthesized materials the prepared mose2 mchs composite samples displayed characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to mose2 fig 4c and the 002 peak showed a slightly left shift verifying the extended structure of layered mose2 in mose2 mchs the weak peak and the shift of the 004 100 and 110 planes jc pdf 29 0914 2h mose2 may be attributed to the low crystallinity the presence of biphase 1t 2h mose2 and amorphous carbon formed during solvothermal synthesis deng et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 roy et al 2021 raman spectra of mose2 and mose2 mchs showed characteristic peaks of a1g 237 cm 1 e1 2g 282 cm 1 and b2g mode 335 cm 1 belonging to 2h mose2 fig 4d inset ojha and deepa 2019 xiao et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 the additional stretching resonance peak at 147 cm 1 can be identified as the j2 peak of 1t mose2 gupta et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 the presence of these characteristic peaks confirmed the existence of 1t 2h mose2 hybrid phase owing to the metallic properties of 1t mose2 hybridization with the stable 2h phase could obtain higher electrical conductivity promote charge transfer and reduce the activation energy barrier ge et al 2018 zhao et al 2022a it was observed a red shift of e1 2g and the difference between the wave numbers of a1g and e1 2g corresponded to the decrease of the layer count of mose2 nanosheets peng et al 2021 which demonstrated the effect of mchs on the suppression of the layer count of mose2 nanosheets with fewer layers could provide more accessible active sites for ion storage liu et al 2018 wang et al 2022b zhao et al 2022b the two carbon matrix peaks located near 1354 cm 1 d band and 1590 cm 1 g band were assigned to the introduction of mchs fig 4d the id ig values of mose2 mchs showed an upward tendency with the increasing mose2 content namely 0 99 1 01 and 1 06 for mose2 mchs 0 5 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 2 respectively which means that the incorporation of mose2 could produce more defects and the extent of structural disorder increased zhang et al 2022a additionally the intensity of the d peak was slightly larger than the g peak indicating a small graphitization of mose2 mchs han et al 2019 different degrees of blue shift were observed in the d band of mose2 mchs compared to mchs 1330 cm 1 which could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction and van der waals interaction between the carbon spheres and mose2 nanosheets enhancing the sp3 hybridized carbon thus leading to the d peak shifting to a higher energy ojha and deepa 2019 xps spectra of mose2 mchs with different synthesis ratios verified the presence of molybdenum mo selenium se and carbon c elements which is consistent with the element mapping results in fig 3g additionally mose2 mchs composites showed the characteristic peak of mose2 spectra and the c 1s signal was much higher than that in pure mose2 confirming the effective combination of mose2 and mchs fig 4e and the specific atomic contents are given in table s2 the occurrence of extra oxygen o element may be ascribed to oxidation during the material synthesis process the high resolution c 1s spectrum of mose2 mchs 1 fig 4f can be deconvoluted into five peaks at 284 6 286 4 287 3 288 8 and 289 6 ev representing the c c c o c o o c o and se c bonds respectively kong et al 2022 liu et al 2023 xiao et al 2023 zhang et al 2021b the peak around 295 3 ev was typical peak of the π delocalization chen et al 2020b huang et al 2021 the se c bond indicated the possible formation of covalent bonds between mose2 and the hollow carbon sphere at the interface cui et al 2022 which was favorable to the improvement in the stability of mose2 mchs composite and the electrochemical performance the mo 3d spectrum can be fitted with three pairs of peaks 228 88 ev 1t mo4 3d5 2 and 231 93 ev 1t mo4 3d3 2 at relatively lower binding energies 229 12 ev 2h mo4 3d5 2 and 232 47 ev 2h mo4 3d3 2 at medium energies deng et al 2019 ge et al 2018 xiang et al 2017 as well as the two broad peaks centered at 230 45 ev and 233 50 ev which were assigned to the mo c bond fig 4g yu et al 2021 fig 4h showed that the se 3d spectra can be divided into two pairs of peaks corresponding to 1t mose2 53 79 ev for se 3d5 2 and 54 36 ev for se 3d3 2 and 2h mose2 54 71 ev for se 3d5 2 and 55 51 ev for se 3d3 2 jiang et al 2016 the above results further revealed that the mose2 nanosheets in the mose2 mchs composites were biphase 1t 2h mose2 which is consistent with the raman results the additional peak at 236 33 ev was attributed to co mo which assisted in controlling volume expansion and facilitating electron transfer ge et al 2018 moreover mose2 mchs displayed extra peaks at 54 96 ev se c in se 3d spectrum when compared to the pure mose2 spectra fig s3 cui et al 2022 the existence of mo c bond co mo bond and se c bond reflects the formation of strong chemical interactions between mose2 and mchs which benefits the preservation of the structure during the charging discharging cycling operation the high resolution xps spectra for c 1 s mo 3d and se 3d of mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 showed similar characteristic peaks to mose2 mchs 1 fig s4 whereas there was a change in the composition of the surface moieties as the ratio of mose2 increased 1 the contribution of cc and o c o bonds decreased while the relative amount of c o and π π bonding increased in the c 1s spectrum table s3 2 the total relative amount of mo and se atoms increased on the surface while the relative amount of carbon decreased table s2 thermogravimetric analysis tga and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes were used to measure the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs composites see fig 4i and table s4 based on tga characterization the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs 1 was calculated to be about 54 wt more details in supporting information which is consistent with the icp oes measurements the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 was about 44 wt and 75 wt respectively these results further confirmed that mose2 was successfully loaded on the hollow carbon spheres which matched the results of tem and elemental mapping images 3 2 electrochemical performance cyclic voltammetry cv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and galvanostatic charge discharge gcd were conducted to examine the electrochemical performance of electrodes cv curves were utilized to investigate the electrochemical behavior of electrodes in nacl solution the quasi rectangular cv curves of mchs indicated capacitive behavior mainly from ideal edlc guo et al 2022 while the pure mose2 had leaf like curves without redox peaks which was mainly controlled by the intercalation pseudocapacitance fig s5a s5b chen et al 2022 shrivastava et al 2022 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the shape of the cv curves of mose2 mchs is the consequence of the synergistic response of the intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc fig 5 a b moreover the properties of cv curves did not change with increased sweep rate reflecting the good electrochemical reversibility of mose2 mchs electrodes figs 5b s5c s5d the minor peak at a low sweep rate of 2 mv s 1 was related to the interaction of sodium ions and mose2 in the nanopore environment fleischmann et al 2022 mose2 mchs 1 possessed the largest integration area and realized a great capacity retention rate of 84 at a low sweep rate of 20 mv s 1 even after 100 cycles fig 5c the good capacity retention could be ascribed to the inhibition of selenide dissolution and volume expansion by the preservation of mesoporous and hollow structure in a cyclic voltammogram cv when the current i at any given voltage varies linearly with the sweep rate v as shown in eq 1 it is considered as capacitive controlled process when the current i at any given voltage varies with the square root of the sweep rate v as shown in eq 2 it is considered as diffusion controlled process augustyn et al 2014 brezesinski et al 2010 li et al 2021 tian et al 2020 1 capacitive controlled process i k 1 v 2 diffusion controlled process i k 2 v 1 2 where i represents the current at a specific potential v is the sweep rate k 1 and k 2 represent adjustable parameters varying with the applied voltages generally for a given electrode material the current in the cv is contributed by both capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process except for ideal edlc and battery materials and it can be expressed as follows 3 i i capacitive i diffusion k 1 v k 2 v 1 2 for analytical purposes this equation can be rearranged to 4 i v 1 2 k 1 v 1 2 k 2 solving for k 1 and k 2 from the slope and the y axis intercept point of a fitting straight line across multiple sweep rates at each specific potential gives the quantitative fraction of the current caused by capacitive controlled or diffusion controlled process this method allows for separation of the cv into capacitive controlled and diffusion controlled regions the capacitive controlled process represents the fast surface controlled kinetic behaviors while the diffusion controlled process represents the relatively slow kinetic behaviors and is limited by mass transfer and solid state diffusion augustyn et al 2014 brezesinski et al 2010 tian et al 2020 a larger capacitive controlled contribution percentage indicates a larger proportion of active sites exposed which is conductive to fast reversible ion storage li et al 2021 meanwhile it should be noted that the capacitive controlled contribution percentage has no relationship with the total capacitance because both capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process contribute to the total capacitance the obtained data were formed into a closed cv curve as shown in figs 5d and s6 the calculated results suggested that for mose2 mchs 1 electrode operated at 5 mv s 1 the contribution of capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process was 74 88 and 25 12 respectively the capacitive controlled and diffusion controlled contribution percentages of all the prepared electrodes at 2 mv s 1 and 5 mv s 1 were summarized in fig 5e from which we can know that with the decrease of mose2 content the capacitive controlled contribution percentage increased which is beneficial to fast reversible ion storage however it should be noted that a low mose2 content would result in a relatively low specific capacitance fig s7 because the pseudocapacitive ion intercalation available from mose2 diminished among the three composites mose2 mchs 1 displayed high capacitive controlled contribution fig 5e and the largest specific capacitance at different sweep rates fig s7 which suggested that an optimal design for the interfacial structure is favorable to attaining rapid kinetic process and a high total capacitance the eis curves were composed of a circular curve in the high frequency region and an approximately straight line in the low frequency region the quasi semicircle in the high frequency region is associated with the interfacial resistance between the electrode surface and the electrolyte bulk han et al 2019 while the slope line in the low frequency region is associated with ion diffusivity on the surface of the electrode gao et al 2022 a larger semicircle implies a greater interfacial charge transfer resistance and a steeper slope implies a faster ion diffusion ability from figs 5f and s8 it was observed that mose2 mchs 1 had a relatively small semicircle radius revealing small interfacial charge transfer resistance in addition it was found that introduction of appropriate amount of mchs significantly improved the ion diffusion ability of mose2 with mose2 mchs 1 producing the maximum slope and obtaining a comparatively ideal ion transfer and diffusion ability the slower ion diffusion rate of mose2 mchs 2 can be ascribed to the stacked mose2 nanosheets on the surface of mchs blocking the original mesoporous channels of mchs gcd tests were performed to check the electrode capacitance performance the discharge curves of gcd for all the prepared electrodes were almost linear without significant plateaus which were consistent with the cv curves reflecting the excellent capacitive characteristics and electrochemical reversibility fig s9 hartmann et al 2022 at a high current density of 1 a g 1 mose2 mchs 1 sustained a long discharge time of 204 0 s fig 5g and exhibited the maximum discharge time at all current densities which implies that mose2 mchs 1 holds the maximum specific capacitance the capacitance of mose2 mchs 1 253 3 f g 1 was improved by a factor of 2 25 and 1 3 relative to mchs 112 5 f g 1 and pure mose2 194 7 f g 1 respectively at a current density of 0 5 a g 1 fig 5h which was superior to most of current cdi electrode materials moreover as the ir drop is positively correlated with the internal resistance of the electrodes hao et al 2014 zhao et al 2022b it can be found that the internal resistance of mose2 mchs was significantly reduced compared to pure mose2 fig 5i which was because of the small intrinsic internal resistance of the hollow carbon spheres and the aligned distribution of mose2 nanosheets on the carbon spheres the inset of fig 5i showed the ir drop of mose2 mchs 1 at different current densities which indicated that the ir drop increased almost linearly with the current density this was attributed to the insufficient discharge in edl at the beginning of the discharging step han et al 2019 in summary the exceptional electrochemical performance of mose2 mchs may be associated with the following several aspects 1 the total capacitance of mose2 mchs was derived from the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc 2 ion movement was fast and efficient owing to the vertically aligned and appropriate distribution of mose2 nanosheets on the mchs surface 3 mchs and biphase 1t 2h mose2 offered high electrical conductivity to the composite electrode 4 hollow carbon sphere structure acted as a buffer container during cycling enhancing the rate capability and ensuring cyclic performance for cdi applications 3 3 hcdi performance 3 3 1 desalination performance mose2 mchs is a very good candidate for sodium ion storage according to its exceptional electrochemical properties to evaluate its desalination performance and explore the adsorption mechanism we prepared various hcdi cathodes made of mchs pure mose2 and mose2 mchs composites with different ratios of mose2 to mchs respectively while using ac electrodes as the anode in the batch mode operation the desalination performance of each cathode material was firstly tested at 1 2 v and an initial nacl concentration of 500 mg l 1 under a fixed pump flow rate of 15 ml min 1 as shown in fig 6 a the conductivity of the solution dropped rapidly when a charging voltage was applied indicative of a quick electrosorption of sodium and chloride ions by the electrodes as the operation time proceeded the solution conductivity declined more gently because the active sites of the electrodes enabling ion adsorption were gradually occupied given the extraordinarily high specific surface area 1133 8 m2 g 1 and abundant mesoporosity of mchs na was adsorbed to mchs by edlc under electric field conditions with a salt adsorption capacity sac of 25 5 mg g 1 achieved a comparable sac 25 0 mg g 1 was also acquired from a pure mose2 electrode with na mainly embedded between the se mo se layers via intercalation from fig 6b it can be further observed that the synergistic effects between mose2 and mchs could significantly improve the desalination performance of mchs or pure mose2 in the hcdi cell as for mose2 mchs composites with three different ratios of mose2 to mchs in the batch mode operation the sac of mose2 mchs 1 45 25 mg g 11 was the largest improving the sac of pure mose2 and mchs by a factor of 1 81 and 1 77 respectively mose2 mchs 0 5 exhibited a relatively lower sac 38 25 mg g 1 than mose2 mchs 1 which could be explained by the fact that mose2 mchs 0 5 carried a smaller amount of mose2 compared to mose2 mchs 1 resulting in fewer na storage sites contributed by mose2 via intercalation pseudocapacitance the desalination performance of mose2 mchs 2 41 5 mg g 1 was also inferior to that of mose2 mchs 1 because when excessive mose2 nanosheets were loaded on the surface of hollow carbon sphere the stacked mose2 nanosheets would block the original mesoporous channels of mchs and reduce the specific surface area of mchs furthermore the stacked mose2 nanosheets with narrow layer spacing were not favorable to ion intercalation the kim yoon diagram where salt removal rate was plotted against salt adsorption capacity serves as an effective means for assessment of cdi performance as shown in fig 6c mose2 mchs 1 was located at the upper right region with the highest ion adsorption capacity and ion removal rate the high desalination rate largely ensures a high level desalination capacity zhang et al 2022d compared to the lower salt adsorption rate sar of pure mose2 4 mg g 1 min 1 and mchs 4 75 mg g 1 min 1 the sar of mose2 mchs 1 reached up to 7 75 mg g 1 min 1 and maintained a superior sar even at a high sac value in addition hcdi desalination experiments in the single pass mode were conducted using all the prepared materials as can be seen from fig s10 in the single pass mode the effluent conductivity dropped rapidly upon applying a voltage and then gradually rose after the minimum point was reached from fig s10 it can be also obviously observed that the mose2 mchs composites exhibited better desalination performance than pure mchs and pure mose2 the corresponding salt adsorption capacity of mchs mose2 mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 were calculated to be 34 09 mg g 1 30 48 mg g 1 47 64 mg g 1 52 37 mg g 1 and 40 37 mg g 1 respectively this trend is consistent with that of batch mode operation which further confirmed the superior desalination capabilities of the composite material for hcdi especially mose2 mchs 1 composite the operational parameters in the electrosorption process may play an important role in affecting the performance of cdi therefore we investigated the desalination performance of mose2 mchs 1 electrode at various initial nacl concentrations and applied voltages with the results presented in fig 6d as can be seen the mose2 mchs 1 electrode performed effectively within a wide range of initial nacl concentrations and applied voltages in batch mode operation moreover an increase in the applied voltage or initial nacl concentration led to an increase in the sac at least valid within the parameter variation range examined in this work a higher cell voltage enhanced the electrical driving force for ion migration at a specific initial nacl concentration which in turn enhanced the ion removal performance to avoid water electrolysis and parasitic reactions we limited the maximum applied voltage at 1 2 v mose2 mchs 1 realized a comparatively high desalination performance 45 3 mg g 1 for 500 mg l 1 nacl feed water and a sac of 26 0 mg g 1 and 31 8 mg g 1 even at 0 6 v and 0 9 v respectively which is significantly better than the other transition metal dichalcogenides carbon materials based hcdi electrodes under similar operating conditions table s5 at a low nacl concentration of 250 mg l 1 mose2 mchs 1 electrode still acquired a high sac of 33 mg g 1 in addition we investigated the influence of pump flow rate on the batch mode hcdi performance fig s11 from which it can be observed that the effect of pump flow rate on nacl electrosorption was insignificant for the studied three different flow rates this is in accordance with the previous literatures focusing on the removal of other ions such as fluoride and perchlorate tang et al 2015 since the flow rate had little impact on the nacl electrosorption a smaller flow rate is preferred because a smaller flow rate implies a smaller pumping energy requirement which is conducive to reducing the total energy consumption nevertheless what is noteworthy is that the flow rate should not be too small otherwise the continuous nacl removal would be hindered and dead zones might occur in the spacer channel of the hcdi cell leading to inferior desalination performance the outstanding sac and sar of mose2 mchs 1 verified that the vertical 2d 3d structures provided excellent mass transfer and sodium storage sites during water desalination by the hcdi cell benefited from the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc the mechanism of na pseudocapacitive intercalation by mose2 can be proven from the following several aspects 1 the capacitance of mose2 mchs and pure mose2 is higher than that of edl based mchs for storing na but their specific surface area and porosity are much less than mchs table s1 so the enhanced capacitance should be derived from the faradaic ion insertion between the mose2 layers 2 according to the nearly rectangular cv and gcd without charge discharge plateau the storage process of mose2 mchs for na is not faradaic redox reaction with valence change but non faradaic process and charge transfer dominated faradaic intercalation reaction 3 xps analysis after na adsorption and desorption were performed for the mose2 mchs 1 electrode to further confirm the mechanism of na pseudocapacitive intercalation by mose2 the xps spectra after na adsorption and desorption did not change significantly versus the fresh electrode both in elemental composition and peak positions indicating the integrity of the chemical structure after reaction fig s12 after nacl electrosorption the typical peak of na 1s appeared at 1071 93 ev the high resolution mo 3d and se 3d spectra of mose2 mchs 1 retained the mixed phase of 1t and 2h mose2 after na adsorption and desorption and the change in peak intensity is indicative of the partial transition between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 that occurs during na intercalation and de intercalation fig s13 this was also found in other tmd electrodes han et al 2019 moreover se c bond shifted to higher binding energy after na adsorption and recovered after na desorption which could be attributed to the electron transfer from na to mose2 yang et al 2021 all the above results and analysis confirmed the na pseudocapacitive intercalation mechanism by mose2 and the intercalation reaction could be expressed as follows cui et al 2022 5 mos e 2 x n a x e n a x mos e 2 3 3 2 cycling stability and energy consumption the volume expansion and exfoliation of the layered structure with the intercalation de intercalation of ions as well as the dissolution of the in situ generated polyselenides are the primary bottlenecks of two dimensional transition metal selenides during cycling tests ge et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a herein the cycling stability of mchs electrode pure mose2 electrode and mose2 mchs composite electrode during batch mode consecutive charging discharging of hcdi were examined and compared it was observed from fig 7 a that noticeable decay in the salt adsorption capacity occurred for pure mose2 electrode in continuous hcdi cycling tests the cycling stability of mose2 electrode was significantly improved after the introduction of mchs and no decrease in the sac was observed for the mose2 mchs composite electrodes within 10 cycles we also monitored the ph change of the treated water during the operation and the results were presented in fig s14 it was found that the ph increased slightly from 6 7 to 7 5 during adsorption and then gradually returned to the initial value during desorption the small ph fluctuations during the charging discharging steps were favorable to the long term operation the sem images of mose2 mchs 1 after hcdi cycling experiments suggested that the vertically aligned mose2 nanosheets on the mchs surface were still well preserved fig 2j further demonstrating the structural stability we further performed extended cycling experiments on mose2 mchs 1 to evaluate the cycling limit fig 7b shows the change in conductivity and sac during the period of 25 cycles the average sac was 51 32 mg g 1 and the maximum sac was able to reach 54 75 mg g 1 both of which were higher than the initial sac similar results were also observed for the other mose2 mchs composite electrodes i e mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 two major reasons for the improvement in sac during the hcdi cycling tests can be summarized as follows 1 the activation phenomenon of mose2 it has been reported that tmd electrode materials with similar structure and properties for ion storage in cdi and ion batteries exhibited temporarily elevated ion storage performance during early cycles before capacity decay chen et al 2022 li et al 2015 rui et al 2015 in this study due to the dispersion of mose2 nanosheets on the surface of hollow carbon spheres a structural and charge distribution reconstruction occurred during the continuous intercalation de intercalation of na which makes the previously inactive sites active while a partial transition between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 occurred consequently resulting in an increased salt adsorption capacity 2 the phase transformation between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 in the composite electrode that occurred during the reaction promoted the transport of electrons and ions han et al 2019 we also calculated the charge efficiency λ and energy consumption w to evaluate the desalination performance based on monitoring the electrical current during the constant voltage test fig s15 it can be seen from fig 7c that the mose2 mchs composite electrodes exhibited both lower energy consumption and higher charge efficiency compared to the mchs and pure mose2 electrodes in particular mose2 mchs 1 electrode showed a comparatively low energy consumption of 0 39 kwh kg 1 nacl at 1 2 v and a very high charge efficiency of 114 as a matter of fact the charge efficiency exceeding the theoretical value of 100 was also observed in other cdi studies bo et al 2022 ma et al 2021 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the high charge efficiency in our study could be mainly attributed to the following several aspects 1 the charge efficiency was above 1 might be because the hollow carbon spheres or layered mose2 could act as a reservoir of ions via physicochemical effects e g via negatively charged functional groups oh fig s16 bo et al 2022 chen et al 2020a or because the ion exchange membranes iems could store some ions in the absence of applied voltages tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b 2 co ion expulsion was significantly reduced by the presence of iems and the layer spacing was close to ion size which helps to improve the charge efficiency gao et al 2020 porada et al 2013 salanne et al 2016 3 vertical 2d 3d structure minimized the tortuosity of ion movement to sum up the properties associated with the ideal interfacial coupling take full advantage of edlc and intercalation pseudocapacitance for na adsorption desorption processes this superb electrode material outperforms the recently reported mos2 based electrodes in cdi desalination applications fig 7d table s5 demonstrating its great prospect 4 conclusions to tackle the challenge of freshwater scarcity in many places around the world it is of great necessity to search for an efficient water desalination technology hcdi has emerged as a promising water desalination technology while the electrode material plays a vital role in the hcdi desalination performance in this work a composite material with 2d 3d interconnected architectures of mose2 nanosheets and mesoporous carbon hollow spheres was creatively designed and fabricated as the hcdi cathode an excellent desalination performance has been demonstrated which could be reasonably attributed to the synergistic effects of pseudocapacitive ion intercalation and edlc electrosorption among the three mose2 mchs composites with different ratios of mose2 to mchs mose2 mchs 1 displayed the largest specific capacitance and the best desalination performance with an excellent salt adsorption capacity of 45 25 mg g 1 and a high salt removal rate of 7 75 mg g 1 min 1 achieved in 500 mg l 1 nacl feed solution at an applied voltage of 1 2 v in batch mode tests insufficient mose2 loading on the mchs would result in fewer na storage sites from mose2 nanosheets while excessive mose2 loading would generate stacked mose2 nanosheets which could block the original mesoporous channels of mchs and reduce the specific surface area of mchs furthermore the stacked mose2 nanosheets with narrow layer spacing were not favorable to mass transfer and ion intercalation

14857,transition metal dichalcogenides can be used for capacitive deionization cdi via pseudocapacitive ion intercalation de intercalation due to their unique two dimensional 2d laminar structure mos2 has been extensively studied in the hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi but the desalination performance of mos2 based electrodes remains only 20 35 mg g 1 on average benefiting from the higher conductivity and larger layer spacing of mose2 than mos2 it is expected that mose2 would exhibit a superior hcdi desalination performance herein for the first time we explored the use of mose2 in hcdi and synthesized a novel mose2 mchs composite material by utilizing mesoporous carbon hollow spheres mchs as the growth substrate to inhibit the aggregation and improve the conductivity of mose2 the as obtained mose2 mchs presented unique 2d 3d interconnected architectures allowing for synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and electrical double layer capacitance edlc an excellent salt adsorption capacity of 45 25 mg g 1 and a high salt removal rate of 7 75 mg g 1 min 1 were achieved in 500 mg l 1 nacl feed solution at an applied voltage of 1 2 v in batch mode tests moreover the mose2 mchs electrode exhibited outstanding cycling performance and low energy consumption making it suitable for practical applications this work demonstrates the promising application of selenides in cdi and provides new insights for ration design of high performance composite electrode materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capacitive deionization water desalination interconnected architectures mose2 mesoporous carbon hollow spheres data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction given the increasing demand for freshwater and the worldwide freshwater scarcity developing high performance seawater or brackish water desalination technologies to supply freshwater has attracted much research interest alkhadra et al 2022 with the advantages of environmental friendliness cost effectiveness and facile electrode regeneration capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising water desalination technology for the facile removal of ions from aqueous solutions via capacitive electrical double layer or faradaic intercalation du et al 2023a 2023b porada et al 2013 generally a cdi cell comprises a pair of oppositely charged porous carbon electrodes and a spacer in between preventing short circuit and allowing the passage of water upon applying a potential difference normally 1 5 v the salt ions would migrate and be adsorbed to the electrodes resulting in desalination and freshwater production further short circuiting the electrodes or applying polarity reversal leads to release of ions i e electrode regeneration and generation of a brine stream these decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of research aiming at improving ion removal capacity and lowering energy consumption through optimizing carbon or faradaic electrode materials that are based on electrical double layer capacitance edlc and reversible faradaic pseudocapacitance e g intercalation type surface redox type respectively guo et al 2022 singh et al 2019 optimizing the specific surface area and hierarchical pore structure of carbon materials is an attractive way to enhance the edlc kim et al 2021 however the salt adsorption capacity normally could only reach 15 30 mg g 1 constrained by the limited ion storage adsorption sites by contrast as a typical faradaic electrode material two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have a high capacitance owing to their layered architectures enabling ion intercalation de intercalation or surface redox reactions fleischmann et al 2022 srimuk et al 2017 2020 mos2 is a classical type of tmds and has attracted widespread attention due to its unique sandwich layer structure high theoretical capacitance and the variable redox states of molybdenum atom mo fleischmann et al 2022 hao et al 2020 nguyen et al 2022 nevertheless pure mos2 is inclined to agglomeration and structure collapse and suffers from low electrical conductivity in electrochemical related applications combination of mos2 and carbonaceous materials e g reduced graphene oxide mxene carbon nanotubes provides a feasible solution to tackle these challenges cai et al 2021 2022 chen et al 2022 gao et al 2020 han et al 2019 hu et al 2022 li et al 2022 peng et al 2021 however according to previous studies the desalination performance of mos2 based electrodes remains only 20 35 mg g 1 on average compared to sulfur s selenium se has a higher electrical conductivity 1 10 11 se versus 0 5 10 27 s m 1 higher polarizability and weaker energy of metal selenium m se bond for the redox reactions with na hao et al 2022 wang et al 2022a yang et al 2021 more specifically mose2 has a se mo se sandwich structure and possesses advantages over mos2 in terms of larger layer spacing 6 4 å versus 6 2 å and better electrical conductivity which facilitates rapid charge carrier migration as well as sodium ion diffusion and storage zhao et al 2022a these excellent electrochemical properties of mose2 make it a prospective cdi cathode candidate for na pseudocapacitive intercalation however to the best of our knowledge the mechanisms behind the use of selenides as a cdi electrode are still lacking and remain unclear in the meantime the aggregation tendency unsatisfactory electrical conductivity and potential volume expansion during ion embedding of mose2 still hinder its wide application yu et al 2021 utilizing two dimensional 2d or three dimensional 3d carbon materials as growth substrate materials to inhibit the aggregation and improve the conductivity of mose2 nanosheets might offer an effective solution architectures of porous materials especially carbons serving as the supporting scaffold materials for active sites need to be carefully controlled to bring the full potential of the materials kim et al 2022a 2022b 2022c lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b 2022c 3d mesoporous carbon hollow spheres mchs have been reported to possess a high specific surface area good hydrophilicity high electrical conductivity and low ion diffusion resistance thereby showing excellent edlc wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 2021a the mesopores provide sufficient sites for ion transport and on the other hand assist in the stabilization of selenides ge et al 2018 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 furthermore 3d spherical structures of mchs are believed to be able to mitigate the aggregation of mose2 nanosheets and the hollow configuration allows for buffering of mose2 vol expansion during cycling xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 therefore mchs might possess ideal structures to serve as scaffolds to support and stabilize mose2 additionally an effective combination of mose2 and mchs would be an exemplary structural template to explore the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc herein we innovatively designed and synthesized a composite with 2d 3d interconnected architectures of mose2 nanosheets and mchs and explored its hcdi application for water desalination fig 1 as expected the excellent interfacial structure expanded two dimensional layer spacing and biphase 1t 2h structure provided superior electron transfer high conductivity and large capacitance for the hcdi performance a high level salt adsorption capacity and cycling stability are demonstrated along with low energy consumption and excellent charge efficiency 2 experimental section the details of the purchased chemicals and materials characterization methods and electrochemical measurements of the prepared materials are presented in the supporting information 2 1 preparation of materials 2 1 1 synthesis of mesoporous carbon hollow spheres mchs mchs was prepared using a one pot synthesis strategy specifically 70 ml of ethanol 10 ml of ultrapure water and 3 ml of nh3 h2o were mixed and stirred for 15 min then 3 46 ml of tetrapropyl orthosilicate was dropwise added to the mixture solution and continued stirring for 15 min followed by dosing 0 4 g of resorcinol and 0 56 ml of formaldehyde 37 wt after which stirring was kept for 24 h afterward the precipitates were separated by centrifugation washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol and then dried at 60 c overnight in a vacuum oven the material mchs was finally obtained by calcination at 700 c for 5 h under nitrogen atmosphere and etching with 20 wt naoh solution to remove silica the reason why 700 c was chosen to synthesize the mchs is that intact mesoporous hollow spherical structure a larger specific surface area a larger pore volume a larger carbon content and an appropriate pore size could be obtained in comparison with the mchs prepared at other carbonization temperatures of 500 c and 900 c ghosh et al 2018 2 1 2 preparation of mose2 mchs mose2 mchs was prepared via a facile solvothermal method specifically a certain amount of the as synthesized mchs was mixed with 30 mg of moo3 and 30 mg of selenium and then added into the mixture of 15 ml of ethanol 10 ml of deionized water and 5 ml of h2n2 h2o with continuous stirring applied after stirring for 30 min the mixture was put into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and heated at 200 c for 12 h finally the mose2 mchs was collected by suction filtration with 0 22 μm millipore filter washed several times with ethanol and deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c overnight in the above synthesis process of mose2 mchs mose2 mchs composites with various ratios of mose2 to mchs were prepared in order to identify the optimal 2d 3d interconnected architectures that would exhibit excellent synergistic effects when the usage amount of mchs was 15 mg 30 mg and 60 mg making the ratio of mose2 to mchs as 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 we labeled these samples as mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 respectively see fig 2 a for reference the same synthetic procedure without the addition of mchs was adopted to prepare pure mose2 2 2 hcdi experiments as schematically shown in fig s1 in supporting information a self made single channel flow by asymmetric hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi cell with batch mode operation was used to evaluate the electrochemical desalination performance of mose2 mchs electrode the hcdi cell consisted of a pair of electrodes with activated carbon ac as the anode and mose2 mchs material as the cathode and an anion exchange membrane aem and a cation exchange membrane cem were assembled next to the anode and cathode respectively for suppressing the co ion transport the anode and cathode were separated by a 200 µm thickness non conductive nylon sheet 300 mesh for fluid flow and prevention of short circuit silicon gaskets were used to prevent water leakage all the parts were assembled with the use of acrylic plates with holes drilled on the four sides to allow for fastening with bolts the mose2 mchs or ac electrode was prepared by mixing the active material carbon black and pvdf with a mass ratio of 8 1 1 with the addition of a small amount of nmp the mixed powder was fully grounded to form a homogeneous slurry which was then uniformly coated on a graphite paper to obtain an electrode size 5 cm 5 cm the electrode was finally dried at 60 c overnight under vacuum condition the active material s mass of each electrode was controlled at about 50 mg in the batch mode operation 50 ml nacl solution with different concentrations was used to simulate the treated brackish water driven by a peristaltic pump the saline water flowed through the hcdi cell and back into the feed tank in the single pass mode operation nacl solution was continuously fed into the hcdi cell at a flow rate of 7 5 ml min 1 without recirculation during the tests physicochemical adsorption equilibrium was firstly reached in the absence of electricity and then a constant voltage was applied to realize ion electrosorption after which desorption of ions and regeneration of the electrodes were achieved via the application of a reversed voltage the solution flow rate was controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the peristaltic pump and the direct voltage was supplied by a direct current power source the temperature of the treated water was kept at 25 c during the experiment to reduce the error caused by the effect of temperature on the conductivity the conductivity and ph of the solution were constantly monitored by a conductivity meter and a ph meter while the electrical current was recorded by a current probe dcp bta connected to a data acquisition system sensordaq vernier usa the calibration curve of nacl concentration versus conductivity and the calculation methods for salt adsorption capacity sac mg g 1 salt adsorption rate sar mg g 1 min 1 charge efficiency λ and energy consumption w kwh kg 1 nacl were provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization sem and tem images were employed to visualize the morphological characteristics of the as synthesized materials as can be seen from fig 2b c pure mose2 showed a nanoflower like morphology size around 1 μm which resulted from the agglomeration of mose2 nanosheets the mchs exhibited a homogeneous spherical shape particle size around 320 nm fig 2d e hollow structure and abundant radial pore channels fig 3 d e as expected the sem morphology of mose2 mchs composites demonstrates that the introduction of mchs could effectively inhibit the agglomeration of mose2 nanosheets mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 clearly exhibited the vertical channel structure of 2d nanosheets uniformly anchored on the surface of 3d hollow carbon spheres fig 2f h which minimizes the tortuosity of ion migration process however when the addition of mose2 was twice the amount of mchs namely mose2 mchs 2 mose2 nanosheets aggregated and were adhered on the carbon spheres and blocked the pores of mchs fig 2i it might be attributed that the shell surface of mchs cannot provide sufficient growth sites when mose2 is overloaded based on the results it can be concluded that for mose2 mchs 1 the rich mesopores of the mchs surface were not completely covered by the vertically aligned interfacial structure of mose2 which is believed to promote solution penetration and create an efficient conduit for ion and electron transport and meanwhile abundant pseudocapacitive ion intercalation sites from the loaded mose2 might be provided we will confirm this later moreover this superior structure was effectively preserved after the hcdi cycling experiments fig 2j in addition according to the corresponding tem images fig 3e and elemental mappings fig 3g mose2 mchs maintained the hollow interior space and mose2 nanosheets were only dispersed on the inner and external sides of the carbon shell walls thickening the shell from 50 nm to 60 nm fig 3d e in this manner the active adsorption sites of mchs can be largely preserved to offer the best synergistic effects and the vertical distribution of mose2 effectively facilitated mass transfer the formation of the inner mose2 nanosheets may be the result of the solution penetrating inside the hollow mesoporous nanoreactor through the pore channels followed by the growth of mose2 on the inner shell walls during the synthesis process due to the carefully regulated development from the mchs substrate mose2 grown on the mose2 mchs composite exhibited a significantly less layered structure when compared to the layers of pure mose2 nanosheets fig 3c f notably the high resolution tem hrtem of mose2 mchs 1 showed the extended layer spacing lattice fringes 0 69 nm versus 0 64 nm relative to pure mose2 which can be indexed to the 002 plane of mose2 in combination with xrd characterization results the layer expansion could benefit ion diffusion and storage and meanwhile significantly lessen internal strain during ion intercalation and deintercalation gao et al 2020 these findings demonstrate the significance and excellence of mchs as a dispersion and growth limiting substrate for mose2 loading further examination of specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution of the as prepared samples was carried out through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms with the results shown in fig 4 a the specific surface area of mose2 mchs composites achieved a large enhancement against the low ssa of pure mose2 only 8 9 m2 g 1 and the ssa of the mose2 mchs composites increased with the decreased addition amount of mose2 namely 103 0 286 1 and 403 1 m2 g 1 for mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 respectively the significantly enhanced ssa of mose2 mchs composites compared to pure mose2 was attributed to the high specific surface area provided by the mchs mesoporous walls and the dispersed few layered nanosheet structure the hysteresis curves exhibited type ⅳ shape of isotherms with strip hysteresis loops at a higher relative pressure suggesting a predominance of mesopores it has been previously reported that the dominant mesoporous structures of electrodes in cdi could favorably facilitate mass transfer wang et al 2019 according to the bjh pore size analysis the pore size distribution shifted toward smaller size pores with the increase of mose2 content fig 4b the major pore size distribution of mose2 mchs 1 was about 6 5 nm and a large pore volume of 1 20 cm3 g 1 was retained while mose2 mchs 2 displayed significant coverage of mesopores 5 6 nm 0 360 cm3 g 1 due to the stacking of mose2 nanosheets on the surface fig 4b inset and more details are given in table s1 therefore the reasonable arrangement of mose2 aided in maintaining the high specific surface area and suitable pore size distribution of mchs while boosting the electrochemically active surface area and active sites for na adsorption moreover the preserved mesopores could limit the dissolution of selenides during charging discharging cycles and increase the electrode s durability kim and kang 2020 xiao et al 2021 xrd raman spectra and xps characterization were also conducted to analyze the crystal structure and chemical state of all the synthesized materials the prepared mose2 mchs composite samples displayed characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to mose2 fig 4c and the 002 peak showed a slightly left shift verifying the extended structure of layered mose2 in mose2 mchs the weak peak and the shift of the 004 100 and 110 planes jc pdf 29 0914 2h mose2 may be attributed to the low crystallinity the presence of biphase 1t 2h mose2 and amorphous carbon formed during solvothermal synthesis deng et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 roy et al 2021 raman spectra of mose2 and mose2 mchs showed characteristic peaks of a1g 237 cm 1 e1 2g 282 cm 1 and b2g mode 335 cm 1 belonging to 2h mose2 fig 4d inset ojha and deepa 2019 xiao et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 the additional stretching resonance peak at 147 cm 1 can be identified as the j2 peak of 1t mose2 gupta et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 the presence of these characteristic peaks confirmed the existence of 1t 2h mose2 hybrid phase owing to the metallic properties of 1t mose2 hybridization with the stable 2h phase could obtain higher electrical conductivity promote charge transfer and reduce the activation energy barrier ge et al 2018 zhao et al 2022a it was observed a red shift of e1 2g and the difference between the wave numbers of a1g and e1 2g corresponded to the decrease of the layer count of mose2 nanosheets peng et al 2021 which demonstrated the effect of mchs on the suppression of the layer count of mose2 nanosheets with fewer layers could provide more accessible active sites for ion storage liu et al 2018 wang et al 2022b zhao et al 2022b the two carbon matrix peaks located near 1354 cm 1 d band and 1590 cm 1 g band were assigned to the introduction of mchs fig 4d the id ig values of mose2 mchs showed an upward tendency with the increasing mose2 content namely 0 99 1 01 and 1 06 for mose2 mchs 0 5 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 2 respectively which means that the incorporation of mose2 could produce more defects and the extent of structural disorder increased zhang et al 2022a additionally the intensity of the d peak was slightly larger than the g peak indicating a small graphitization of mose2 mchs han et al 2019 different degrees of blue shift were observed in the d band of mose2 mchs compared to mchs 1330 cm 1 which could be attributed to the electrostatic attraction and van der waals interaction between the carbon spheres and mose2 nanosheets enhancing the sp3 hybridized carbon thus leading to the d peak shifting to a higher energy ojha and deepa 2019 xps spectra of mose2 mchs with different synthesis ratios verified the presence of molybdenum mo selenium se and carbon c elements which is consistent with the element mapping results in fig 3g additionally mose2 mchs composites showed the characteristic peak of mose2 spectra and the c 1s signal was much higher than that in pure mose2 confirming the effective combination of mose2 and mchs fig 4e and the specific atomic contents are given in table s2 the occurrence of extra oxygen o element may be ascribed to oxidation during the material synthesis process the high resolution c 1s spectrum of mose2 mchs 1 fig 4f can be deconvoluted into five peaks at 284 6 286 4 287 3 288 8 and 289 6 ev representing the c c c o c o o c o and se c bonds respectively kong et al 2022 liu et al 2023 xiao et al 2023 zhang et al 2021b the peak around 295 3 ev was typical peak of the π delocalization chen et al 2020b huang et al 2021 the se c bond indicated the possible formation of covalent bonds between mose2 and the hollow carbon sphere at the interface cui et al 2022 which was favorable to the improvement in the stability of mose2 mchs composite and the electrochemical performance the mo 3d spectrum can be fitted with three pairs of peaks 228 88 ev 1t mo4 3d5 2 and 231 93 ev 1t mo4 3d3 2 at relatively lower binding energies 229 12 ev 2h mo4 3d5 2 and 232 47 ev 2h mo4 3d3 2 at medium energies deng et al 2019 ge et al 2018 xiang et al 2017 as well as the two broad peaks centered at 230 45 ev and 233 50 ev which were assigned to the mo c bond fig 4g yu et al 2021 fig 4h showed that the se 3d spectra can be divided into two pairs of peaks corresponding to 1t mose2 53 79 ev for se 3d5 2 and 54 36 ev for se 3d3 2 and 2h mose2 54 71 ev for se 3d5 2 and 55 51 ev for se 3d3 2 jiang et al 2016 the above results further revealed that the mose2 nanosheets in the mose2 mchs composites were biphase 1t 2h mose2 which is consistent with the raman results the additional peak at 236 33 ev was attributed to co mo which assisted in controlling volume expansion and facilitating electron transfer ge et al 2018 moreover mose2 mchs displayed extra peaks at 54 96 ev se c in se 3d spectrum when compared to the pure mose2 spectra fig s3 cui et al 2022 the existence of mo c bond co mo bond and se c bond reflects the formation of strong chemical interactions between mose2 and mchs which benefits the preservation of the structure during the charging discharging cycling operation the high resolution xps spectra for c 1 s mo 3d and se 3d of mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 showed similar characteristic peaks to mose2 mchs 1 fig s4 whereas there was a change in the composition of the surface moieties as the ratio of mose2 increased 1 the contribution of cc and o c o bonds decreased while the relative amount of c o and π π bonding increased in the c 1s spectrum table s3 2 the total relative amount of mo and se atoms increased on the surface while the relative amount of carbon decreased table s2 thermogravimetric analysis tga and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes were used to measure the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs composites see fig 4i and table s4 based on tga characterization the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs 1 was calculated to be about 54 wt more details in supporting information which is consistent with the icp oes measurements the content of mose2 in mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 was about 44 wt and 75 wt respectively these results further confirmed that mose2 was successfully loaded on the hollow carbon spheres which matched the results of tem and elemental mapping images 3 2 electrochemical performance cyclic voltammetry cv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and galvanostatic charge discharge gcd were conducted to examine the electrochemical performance of electrodes cv curves were utilized to investigate the electrochemical behavior of electrodes in nacl solution the quasi rectangular cv curves of mchs indicated capacitive behavior mainly from ideal edlc guo et al 2022 while the pure mose2 had leaf like curves without redox peaks which was mainly controlled by the intercalation pseudocapacitance fig s5a s5b chen et al 2022 shrivastava et al 2022 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the shape of the cv curves of mose2 mchs is the consequence of the synergistic response of the intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc fig 5 a b moreover the properties of cv curves did not change with increased sweep rate reflecting the good electrochemical reversibility of mose2 mchs electrodes figs 5b s5c s5d the minor peak at a low sweep rate of 2 mv s 1 was related to the interaction of sodium ions and mose2 in the nanopore environment fleischmann et al 2022 mose2 mchs 1 possessed the largest integration area and realized a great capacity retention rate of 84 at a low sweep rate of 20 mv s 1 even after 100 cycles fig 5c the good capacity retention could be ascribed to the inhibition of selenide dissolution and volume expansion by the preservation of mesoporous and hollow structure in a cyclic voltammogram cv when the current i at any given voltage varies linearly with the sweep rate v as shown in eq 1 it is considered as capacitive controlled process when the current i at any given voltage varies with the square root of the sweep rate v as shown in eq 2 it is considered as diffusion controlled process augustyn et al 2014 brezesinski et al 2010 li et al 2021 tian et al 2020 1 capacitive controlled process i k 1 v 2 diffusion controlled process i k 2 v 1 2 where i represents the current at a specific potential v is the sweep rate k 1 and k 2 represent adjustable parameters varying with the applied voltages generally for a given electrode material the current in the cv is contributed by both capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process except for ideal edlc and battery materials and it can be expressed as follows 3 i i capacitive i diffusion k 1 v k 2 v 1 2 for analytical purposes this equation can be rearranged to 4 i v 1 2 k 1 v 1 2 k 2 solving for k 1 and k 2 from the slope and the y axis intercept point of a fitting straight line across multiple sweep rates at each specific potential gives the quantitative fraction of the current caused by capacitive controlled or diffusion controlled process this method allows for separation of the cv into capacitive controlled and diffusion controlled regions the capacitive controlled process represents the fast surface controlled kinetic behaviors while the diffusion controlled process represents the relatively slow kinetic behaviors and is limited by mass transfer and solid state diffusion augustyn et al 2014 brezesinski et al 2010 tian et al 2020 a larger capacitive controlled contribution percentage indicates a larger proportion of active sites exposed which is conductive to fast reversible ion storage li et al 2021 meanwhile it should be noted that the capacitive controlled contribution percentage has no relationship with the total capacitance because both capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process contribute to the total capacitance the obtained data were formed into a closed cv curve as shown in figs 5d and s6 the calculated results suggested that for mose2 mchs 1 electrode operated at 5 mv s 1 the contribution of capacitive controlled process and diffusion controlled process was 74 88 and 25 12 respectively the capacitive controlled and diffusion controlled contribution percentages of all the prepared electrodes at 2 mv s 1 and 5 mv s 1 were summarized in fig 5e from which we can know that with the decrease of mose2 content the capacitive controlled contribution percentage increased which is beneficial to fast reversible ion storage however it should be noted that a low mose2 content would result in a relatively low specific capacitance fig s7 because the pseudocapacitive ion intercalation available from mose2 diminished among the three composites mose2 mchs 1 displayed high capacitive controlled contribution fig 5e and the largest specific capacitance at different sweep rates fig s7 which suggested that an optimal design for the interfacial structure is favorable to attaining rapid kinetic process and a high total capacitance the eis curves were composed of a circular curve in the high frequency region and an approximately straight line in the low frequency region the quasi semicircle in the high frequency region is associated with the interfacial resistance between the electrode surface and the electrolyte bulk han et al 2019 while the slope line in the low frequency region is associated with ion diffusivity on the surface of the electrode gao et al 2022 a larger semicircle implies a greater interfacial charge transfer resistance and a steeper slope implies a faster ion diffusion ability from figs 5f and s8 it was observed that mose2 mchs 1 had a relatively small semicircle radius revealing small interfacial charge transfer resistance in addition it was found that introduction of appropriate amount of mchs significantly improved the ion diffusion ability of mose2 with mose2 mchs 1 producing the maximum slope and obtaining a comparatively ideal ion transfer and diffusion ability the slower ion diffusion rate of mose2 mchs 2 can be ascribed to the stacked mose2 nanosheets on the surface of mchs blocking the original mesoporous channels of mchs gcd tests were performed to check the electrode capacitance performance the discharge curves of gcd for all the prepared electrodes were almost linear without significant plateaus which were consistent with the cv curves reflecting the excellent capacitive characteristics and electrochemical reversibility fig s9 hartmann et al 2022 at a high current density of 1 a g 1 mose2 mchs 1 sustained a long discharge time of 204 0 s fig 5g and exhibited the maximum discharge time at all current densities which implies that mose2 mchs 1 holds the maximum specific capacitance the capacitance of mose2 mchs 1 253 3 f g 1 was improved by a factor of 2 25 and 1 3 relative to mchs 112 5 f g 1 and pure mose2 194 7 f g 1 respectively at a current density of 0 5 a g 1 fig 5h which was superior to most of current cdi electrode materials moreover as the ir drop is positively correlated with the internal resistance of the electrodes hao et al 2014 zhao et al 2022b it can be found that the internal resistance of mose2 mchs was significantly reduced compared to pure mose2 fig 5i which was because of the small intrinsic internal resistance of the hollow carbon spheres and the aligned distribution of mose2 nanosheets on the carbon spheres the inset of fig 5i showed the ir drop of mose2 mchs 1 at different current densities which indicated that the ir drop increased almost linearly with the current density this was attributed to the insufficient discharge in edl at the beginning of the discharging step han et al 2019 in summary the exceptional electrochemical performance of mose2 mchs may be associated with the following several aspects 1 the total capacitance of mose2 mchs was derived from the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc 2 ion movement was fast and efficient owing to the vertically aligned and appropriate distribution of mose2 nanosheets on the mchs surface 3 mchs and biphase 1t 2h mose2 offered high electrical conductivity to the composite electrode 4 hollow carbon sphere structure acted as a buffer container during cycling enhancing the rate capability and ensuring cyclic performance for cdi applications 3 3 hcdi performance 3 3 1 desalination performance mose2 mchs is a very good candidate for sodium ion storage according to its exceptional electrochemical properties to evaluate its desalination performance and explore the adsorption mechanism we prepared various hcdi cathodes made of mchs pure mose2 and mose2 mchs composites with different ratios of mose2 to mchs respectively while using ac electrodes as the anode in the batch mode operation the desalination performance of each cathode material was firstly tested at 1 2 v and an initial nacl concentration of 500 mg l 1 under a fixed pump flow rate of 15 ml min 1 as shown in fig 6 a the conductivity of the solution dropped rapidly when a charging voltage was applied indicative of a quick electrosorption of sodium and chloride ions by the electrodes as the operation time proceeded the solution conductivity declined more gently because the active sites of the electrodes enabling ion adsorption were gradually occupied given the extraordinarily high specific surface area 1133 8 m2 g 1 and abundant mesoporosity of mchs na was adsorbed to mchs by edlc under electric field conditions with a salt adsorption capacity sac of 25 5 mg g 1 achieved a comparable sac 25 0 mg g 1 was also acquired from a pure mose2 electrode with na mainly embedded between the se mo se layers via intercalation from fig 6b it can be further observed that the synergistic effects between mose2 and mchs could significantly improve the desalination performance of mchs or pure mose2 in the hcdi cell as for mose2 mchs composites with three different ratios of mose2 to mchs in the batch mode operation the sac of mose2 mchs 1 45 25 mg g 11 was the largest improving the sac of pure mose2 and mchs by a factor of 1 81 and 1 77 respectively mose2 mchs 0 5 exhibited a relatively lower sac 38 25 mg g 1 than mose2 mchs 1 which could be explained by the fact that mose2 mchs 0 5 carried a smaller amount of mose2 compared to mose2 mchs 1 resulting in fewer na storage sites contributed by mose2 via intercalation pseudocapacitance the desalination performance of mose2 mchs 2 41 5 mg g 1 was also inferior to that of mose2 mchs 1 because when excessive mose2 nanosheets were loaded on the surface of hollow carbon sphere the stacked mose2 nanosheets would block the original mesoporous channels of mchs and reduce the specific surface area of mchs furthermore the stacked mose2 nanosheets with narrow layer spacing were not favorable to ion intercalation the kim yoon diagram where salt removal rate was plotted against salt adsorption capacity serves as an effective means for assessment of cdi performance as shown in fig 6c mose2 mchs 1 was located at the upper right region with the highest ion adsorption capacity and ion removal rate the high desalination rate largely ensures a high level desalination capacity zhang et al 2022d compared to the lower salt adsorption rate sar of pure mose2 4 mg g 1 min 1 and mchs 4 75 mg g 1 min 1 the sar of mose2 mchs 1 reached up to 7 75 mg g 1 min 1 and maintained a superior sar even at a high sac value in addition hcdi desalination experiments in the single pass mode were conducted using all the prepared materials as can be seen from fig s10 in the single pass mode the effluent conductivity dropped rapidly upon applying a voltage and then gradually rose after the minimum point was reached from fig s10 it can be also obviously observed that the mose2 mchs composites exhibited better desalination performance than pure mchs and pure mose2 the corresponding salt adsorption capacity of mchs mose2 mose2 mchs 2 mose2 mchs 1 and mose2 mchs 0 5 were calculated to be 34 09 mg g 1 30 48 mg g 1 47 64 mg g 1 52 37 mg g 1 and 40 37 mg g 1 respectively this trend is consistent with that of batch mode operation which further confirmed the superior desalination capabilities of the composite material for hcdi especially mose2 mchs 1 composite the operational parameters in the electrosorption process may play an important role in affecting the performance of cdi therefore we investigated the desalination performance of mose2 mchs 1 electrode at various initial nacl concentrations and applied voltages with the results presented in fig 6d as can be seen the mose2 mchs 1 electrode performed effectively within a wide range of initial nacl concentrations and applied voltages in batch mode operation moreover an increase in the applied voltage or initial nacl concentration led to an increase in the sac at least valid within the parameter variation range examined in this work a higher cell voltage enhanced the electrical driving force for ion migration at a specific initial nacl concentration which in turn enhanced the ion removal performance to avoid water electrolysis and parasitic reactions we limited the maximum applied voltage at 1 2 v mose2 mchs 1 realized a comparatively high desalination performance 45 3 mg g 1 for 500 mg l 1 nacl feed water and a sac of 26 0 mg g 1 and 31 8 mg g 1 even at 0 6 v and 0 9 v respectively which is significantly better than the other transition metal dichalcogenides carbon materials based hcdi electrodes under similar operating conditions table s5 at a low nacl concentration of 250 mg l 1 mose2 mchs 1 electrode still acquired a high sac of 33 mg g 1 in addition we investigated the influence of pump flow rate on the batch mode hcdi performance fig s11 from which it can be observed that the effect of pump flow rate on nacl electrosorption was insignificant for the studied three different flow rates this is in accordance with the previous literatures focusing on the removal of other ions such as fluoride and perchlorate tang et al 2015 since the flow rate had little impact on the nacl electrosorption a smaller flow rate is preferred because a smaller flow rate implies a smaller pumping energy requirement which is conducive to reducing the total energy consumption nevertheless what is noteworthy is that the flow rate should not be too small otherwise the continuous nacl removal would be hindered and dead zones might occur in the spacer channel of the hcdi cell leading to inferior desalination performance the outstanding sac and sar of mose2 mchs 1 verified that the vertical 2d 3d structures provided excellent mass transfer and sodium storage sites during water desalination by the hcdi cell benefited from the synergistic effects of intercalation pseudocapacitance and edlc the mechanism of na pseudocapacitive intercalation by mose2 can be proven from the following several aspects 1 the capacitance of mose2 mchs and pure mose2 is higher than that of edl based mchs for storing na but their specific surface area and porosity are much less than mchs table s1 so the enhanced capacitance should be derived from the faradaic ion insertion between the mose2 layers 2 according to the nearly rectangular cv and gcd without charge discharge plateau the storage process of mose2 mchs for na is not faradaic redox reaction with valence change but non faradaic process and charge transfer dominated faradaic intercalation reaction 3 xps analysis after na adsorption and desorption were performed for the mose2 mchs 1 electrode to further confirm the mechanism of na pseudocapacitive intercalation by mose2 the xps spectra after na adsorption and desorption did not change significantly versus the fresh electrode both in elemental composition and peak positions indicating the integrity of the chemical structure after reaction fig s12 after nacl electrosorption the typical peak of na 1s appeared at 1071 93 ev the high resolution mo 3d and se 3d spectra of mose2 mchs 1 retained the mixed phase of 1t and 2h mose2 after na adsorption and desorption and the change in peak intensity is indicative of the partial transition between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 that occurs during na intercalation and de intercalation fig s13 this was also found in other tmd electrodes han et al 2019 moreover se c bond shifted to higher binding energy after na adsorption and recovered after na desorption which could be attributed to the electron transfer from na to mose2 yang et al 2021 all the above results and analysis confirmed the na pseudocapacitive intercalation mechanism by mose2 and the intercalation reaction could be expressed as follows cui et al 2022 5 mos e 2 x n a x e n a x mos e 2 3 3 2 cycling stability and energy consumption the volume expansion and exfoliation of the layered structure with the intercalation de intercalation of ions as well as the dissolution of the in situ generated polyselenides are the primary bottlenecks of two dimensional transition metal selenides during cycling tests ge et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a herein the cycling stability of mchs electrode pure mose2 electrode and mose2 mchs composite electrode during batch mode consecutive charging discharging of hcdi were examined and compared it was observed from fig 7 a that noticeable decay in the salt adsorption capacity occurred for pure mose2 electrode in continuous hcdi cycling tests the cycling stability of mose2 electrode was significantly improved after the introduction of mchs and no decrease in the sac was observed for the mose2 mchs composite electrodes within 10 cycles we also monitored the ph change of the treated water during the operation and the results were presented in fig s14 it was found that the ph increased slightly from 6 7 to 7 5 during adsorption and then gradually returned to the initial value during desorption the small ph fluctuations during the charging discharging steps were favorable to the long term operation the sem images of mose2 mchs 1 after hcdi cycling experiments suggested that the vertically aligned mose2 nanosheets on the mchs surface were still well preserved fig 2j further demonstrating the structural stability we further performed extended cycling experiments on mose2 mchs 1 to evaluate the cycling limit fig 7b shows the change in conductivity and sac during the period of 25 cycles the average sac was 51 32 mg g 1 and the maximum sac was able to reach 54 75 mg g 1 both of which were higher than the initial sac similar results were also observed for the other mose2 mchs composite electrodes i e mose2 mchs 0 5 and mose2 mchs 2 two major reasons for the improvement in sac during the hcdi cycling tests can be summarized as follows 1 the activation phenomenon of mose2 it has been reported that tmd electrode materials with similar structure and properties for ion storage in cdi and ion batteries exhibited temporarily elevated ion storage performance during early cycles before capacity decay chen et al 2022 li et al 2015 rui et al 2015 in this study due to the dispersion of mose2 nanosheets on the surface of hollow carbon spheres a structural and charge distribution reconstruction occurred during the continuous intercalation de intercalation of na which makes the previously inactive sites active while a partial transition between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 occurred consequently resulting in an increased salt adsorption capacity 2 the phase transformation between 1t and 2h phases of mose2 in the composite electrode that occurred during the reaction promoted the transport of electrons and ions han et al 2019 we also calculated the charge efficiency λ and energy consumption w to evaluate the desalination performance based on monitoring the electrical current during the constant voltage test fig s15 it can be seen from fig 7c that the mose2 mchs composite electrodes exhibited both lower energy consumption and higher charge efficiency compared to the mchs and pure mose2 electrodes in particular mose2 mchs 1 electrode showed a comparatively low energy consumption of 0 39 kwh kg 1 nacl at 1 2 v and a very high charge efficiency of 114 as a matter of fact the charge efficiency exceeding the theoretical value of 100 was also observed in other cdi studies bo et al 2022 ma et al 2021 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the high charge efficiency in our study could be mainly attributed to the following several aspects 1 the charge efficiency was above 1 might be because the hollow carbon spheres or layered mose2 could act as a reservoir of ions via physicochemical effects e g via negatively charged functional groups oh fig s16 bo et al 2022 chen et al 2020a or because the ion exchange membranes iems could store some ions in the absence of applied voltages tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b 2 co ion expulsion was significantly reduced by the presence of iems and the layer spacing was close to ion size which helps to improve the charge efficiency gao et al 2020 porada et al 2013 salanne et al 2016 3 vertical 2d 3d structure minimized the tortuosity of ion movement to sum up the properties associated with the ideal interfacial coupling take full advantage of edlc and intercalation pseudocapacitance for na adsorption desorption processes this superb electrode material outperforms the recently reported mos2 based electrodes in cdi desalination applications fig 7d table s5 demonstrating its great prospect 4 conclusions to tackle the challenge of freshwater scarcity in many places around the world it is of great necessity to search for an efficient water desalination technology hcdi has emerged as a promising water desalination technology while the electrode material plays a vital role in the hcdi desalination performance in this work a composite material with 2d 3d interconnected architectures of mose2 nanosheets and mesoporous carbon hollow spheres was creatively designed and fabricated as the hcdi cathode an excellent desalination performance has been demonstrated which could be reasonably attributed to the synergistic effects of pseudocapacitive ion intercalation and edlc electrosorption among the three mose2 mchs composites with different ratios of mose2 to mchs mose2 mchs 1 displayed the largest specific capacitance and the best desalination performance with an excellent salt adsorption capacity of 45 25 mg g 1 and a high salt removal rate of 7 75 mg g 1 min 1 achieved in 500 mg l 1 nacl feed solution at an applied voltage of 1 2 v in batch mode tests insufficient mose2 loading on the mchs would result in fewer na storage sites from mose2 nanosheets while excessive mose2 loading would generate stacked mose2 nanosheets which could block the original mesoporous channels of mchs and reduce the specific surface area of mchs furthermore the stacked mose2 nanosheets with narrow layer spacing were not favorable to mass transfer and ion intercalation additionally outstanding cycling stability was demonstrated for the mose2 mchs electrodes along with a low energy consumption and high charge efficiency supporting information ancillary experimental

effective volume and equipped with a unit for advanced oxidation treatment 5 00 l effective volume the aquaculture water in the fish aquarium was purified by bio filter followed by oxidation treatment and then recycled back to the fish tank a peristaltic pump with 250 ml min flow velocity was used to drive aquaculture water circulation an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the fish aquarium to pump air via aeration equipment and maintain dissolved oxygen concentration at 8 mg l the rass were used in a constant temperature laboratory 20 1 c to evaluate the effects of oxidation

mainly composed of excrement and smps and this material is generally toxic to fish and thus can significantly reduce overall yield tonin et al 2022 in this study reactors were operated for 51 days at the steady stage of the recirculating operation 37 days after treatment the doc concentration of aquaculture water was 40 lower than the control for both o3 and o3 uv treatments p 0 01 fig 2 b although the uv treatment accelerated the hydroxyl radical formation rate this may just promote of transformation of organic molecules to small molecular intermediates rather than achieve complete mineralization phungsai et al 2019 the reactive oxidized species ross generated by o3 and o3 uv can attack and oxidize organic compounds he et al 2022 and the refractories may also be transformed to products that are more easily biodegraded as a result organics were more completely mineralized via biodegradation in the aquaculture tanks for o3 and o3 uv protocols generally the differences between o3 and o3 uv treatment was not significant p 0 05 with almost the same doc changing trend in the rass during the 51 days operation 3 1 2 dom composition as shown in fig 3 a o3 and o3 uv processes significantly reduced soluble proteins 45 p 0 05 this is likely attributed to ros attack of tyrosine tryptophan histidine cysteine and methionine residues sharma and graham 2010 the elimination of

tryptophan like aromatic proteins fulvic acid humus soluble microbial metabolites and humic acid humus there were no significant differences in the total soluble polysaccharides in the treated rass fig 3b probably due to the presence of hexose and hexuronic acid intermediates meng et al 2016 the chemical compounds element composition and biochemical classes in the vk diagram of fig 4 a are shown in fig 4b e compared to the control the elemental compositions of rass treated with o3 and o3 uv were both 46 different and 30 of the molecules in o3 were different from those in o3 uv fig 4b we next characterized the aromaticity and unsaturation of chemical components aiwa dbe owa and dbewa all dropped significantly for o3 and o3 uv protocols table 1 due to a lower unsaturation character ratio in their chemical profiles aguilar alarcón et al 2020 oxygen rich compounds such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids may be formed during ozonation as supported by the increment of o cwa and decrement of

relative abundances of chlorinated species with o3 and o3 uv treatments 16 for both probably due to halogenation by the calcium magnesium and sodium salts present in the water wu et al 2021 lignin is the most abundant macromolecule in the terrestrial biosphere a large amount of lignin in rivers originates from the land and the large abundance of lignin fig 4e in aquaculture water may originate from the raw water from the yitong river used to set up the tanks ward et al 2013 as shown in fig 4e the relative abundances of lignin like feature were more than 30 lower in o3 and o3 uv than in the control which indicated the destruction of lignin through the effects of advanced oxidation as activated aromatic rings are vulnerable to ozonation shi et al 2020 tannins were 135 and 85 greater in o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively compared with the control fig 4e these treatments can inactivate organisms by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding of proteins ferrer gallego et al 2012 garcía estévez et al 2018 3 2 nitrogen transformation 3 2 1 nitrogen forms the changes of total nitrogen tn are shown in fig s1 after 18 days all parameters met the aquaculture water standards no2 n was accumulated in the control from day 5 to day 20 and could potentially cause oxidative damage due to the production of nitric oxide no and peroxynitrite onoo reactive nitrogen species in aquatic animal tissues lushchak and lushchak 2021 advanced oxidization treatments can readily oxidize nitrite so there was almost no no2 n accumulation when rass were treated by o3 or o3 uv likewise ammonia that is toxic to fish at low doses 1 randall and tsui 2002 was nearly completely removed however no3 n concentrations were continuously increased due to the absence of anoxic environment in the three systems fig 5 c fortunately no3 n has negligible effects on fish at concentrations less than hundreds of milligrams per liter crab et al 2007 these results confirmed effective ammonium and nitrite removals via advanced oxidation treatments compared with conventional aquaculture technology the application of advanced oxidation clearly improved the safety and stability of water quality lower doc in the rass with o3 and o3 uv treatment induced the autotrophic bacteria including aob and nob to become more competent as a result aob and nob were more abundant and activated in the aquariums for more efficient transformation of nh4 n to no3 n 3 2 2 nitrogen transforming mechanisms as shown in fig 6 the ammonia oxidizing genera nitrospira nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were 155 122 and 64 more abundant in the o3 uv treatment relative to the control the abundances were relatively low for the o3 protocol but nitrosomonas and nitrosospira abundances were 80 and 25 higher than the control these results were consistent with the above mentioned effects on nitrogen transformation multiple denitrifying bacteria were also enriched due to advanced oxidization treatments pelomonas the most dominant denitrifying bacteria in o3 uv was 400 higher than the control and methyloversatilis and sphingomonas in o3 were 230 and 930 higher than the control respectively although multiple denitrifying bacteria were enriched the accumulation rate of no3 n was greater than the denitrifying rate this is probably due to the low concentration of doc and high concentration of dissolved oxygen 8 mg l but multiple biodegradable substances formed by oxidation also increased their activation to further investigate the microbial mechanisms of nitrogen transformation n cycling associated genes abundances were determined as shown in fig 7 a and their roles in microbial n cycling pathways are shown in fig 7b there was clear enrichment of n cycling functional genes in the rass with o3 and o3 uv treatment with increases in the relative abundances of n cycling function genes of 23 and 48 p 0 05 for the o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively fig 7c glutamine synthetase glna had the greatest abundance and was 20 enriched in o3 uv compared to both control and o3 all the ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation genes path 2 and path 9 in fig 7b were more enriched in o3 uv with amoc c and nxrb increased by 300 and 200 relative to the control nearly all the denitrifying genes were enriched in o3 uv treatment paths 4 5 6 8 and 10 in fig 7a and b explaining the increased nitrogen removal in o3 uv overall o3 and o3 uv both enhanced the activity of n cycling in rass but there were greater effects for o3 uv treatment 3 3 aquatic organisms 3 3 1 fish growth and intestinal bacteria as shown in fig 8 a the average crucian carp length with o3 uv treatments 6 8 cm was significantly n 9 p 0 05 greater than the control 6 3 cm and slightly higher than the protocol with o3 alone 6 4 cm fish weight of o3 uv and o3 treatments were 16 n 9 p 0 05 and 10 higher than control respectively exhibiting the same trend as fish length we next investigated fish intestine microbiota to identify the mechanisms explaining the increased fish growth as shown in table 2 shannon and pielou index values of fish intestinal microbiota in o3 uv were promoted by 4 and 14 respectively however the pielou index in o3 was not significantly affected and the shannon index of o3 was even lower than that of the control the higher intestinal microbiota diversity can promote host immune homeostasis and health maintenance sommer and baeckhed 2013 the lower diversity of fish intestinal microbiota in o3 may be attributed to the higher relative concentration of tannins in aquarium fig 4e which affects fish health by decreasing growth hepatosomatic index and carcass lipids omnes et al 2017 the results indicate that o3 without uv treatment in ras was harmful to fish vibrio is a major inducing factor of foodborne outbreaks for fresh water fish yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b the abundances in o3 and o3 uv dropped more than 60 aeromonas is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infectious diseases in aquaculture igbinosa et al 2017 the aeromonas relative abundance accounted for more than 50 in o3 but only 20 in o3 uv cetobacterium can improve glucose homeostasis and increase insulin expression in fish wang et al 2021 there were high levels in fish intestines from o3 uv but only 3 in o3 o3 uv treatment enhanced microbial diversity and evenness with increases in the abundances of beneficial bacteria and decreases in the abundances of pathogens making fish healthier and more productive the microbial community of aquaculture water is a significant factor that affects fish intestinal microbiota roeselers et al 2011 giatsis et al 2015 to explain the increase of probiotics in fish intestines the microbiota was further explored 3 3 2 microbial community in aquiculture water the diversity and evenness index of microbiota in aquaculture water were determined and the results are listed in table 2 the shannon and pielou index values of bacteria in water were both increased by 15 under advanced oxidation treatments this is likely because advanced oxidation provides more biodegradable substrates for microorganisms de vera and wert 2019 there were other important microbial changes in the treated systems flavobacterium is an opportunistic pathogen enriched after disinfectant oxidation guarin et al 2022 as shown in fig 9 the flavobacterium relative abundance was increased 6 times and 10 times in o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively similarly hyphomicrobium attributed to formaldehyde typical o3 by product elimination kasuga et al 2016 increased by 20 times in o3 and o3 uv treatments in o3 there was significant enrichment of sphingobium and polaromonas which can degrade aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 this is consistent with the decreased uv254 fig 3c and alwa table 1 observed for the o3 treatment in the o3 uv treatment the oligotrophic environment preferring genus emticicia was enriched significantly awad et al 2016 polynucleobacter are widely distributed in freshwater jezberova et al 2010 but this genus was eliminated in o3 and o3 uv treatments probably because this genus is sensitive to oxidation treatment overall the results show that advanced oxidation enriched many bacteria 3 3 3 interactions between intestinal and water microbes fig 10 a shows a significant correlation between the bacteria community structure in water and fish intestines m2 0 048 p 0 001 the correlation network of bacteria from water and fish intestines was constructed by modularly dividing the network into nine major modules i e module i to ix fig 10b module ⅱ and module ⅲ were composed of bacteria from different habitats fish intestines and water for example rhodococcus in water was significantly correlated with streptomyces and kitasatospora in fish intestines rhodococcus bacteria can degrade persistent pollutants solyanikova and golovleva 2011 the genus streptomyces is used as a probiotic in aquaculture that can protect fish and shrimp from pathogens and increase the growth of aquatic organisms tan et al 2016 schlesneria can assimilate complex c compounds in water and act as core bacteria linking module i module vii and module viii a polysaccharide degrading bacterium cellvibrio in fish intestines linked module i module viii and module ix li et al 2019 in general procrustes analysis and microbial network analysis both indicate a significant correlation between bacteria in water and fish intestines fig 10 thus advanced oxidation treatments affected the microbiota in fish intestine such as probiotics through their regulation of the microflora in aquaculture water 3 4 antimicrobial genes we next investigated the effect of the oxidation treatments on args about 291 arg subtypes belonging to 26 arg types were detected the relative abundances of args in o3 and o3 uv were 52 p 0 05 and 28 p 0 05 higher respectively than in the control fig 11 a uv disinfection treatments typically have limited effects on antibiotic resistant bacteria due to the photoreactivation and dark repair microbial activities resulting in only partial args elimination zhang et al 2020 o3 can cause cell lysis but a lower dose of ozone is ineffective for the elimination of args and incomplete removal of genetic material can induce horizontal spread of args somensi et al 2015 the ozonation process results in toxic oxidation by products that also can induce spread of args the tannin like features of some of these oxidation by products were positively correlated with args p 0 05 fig 11b tannins have been considered as an alternative to antibiotics huang et al 2018 and the stress of tannins can induce iron chelation disrupt the cell membrane inhibit cell wall synthesis and inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis to inhibit bacterial growth farha et al 2020 in response args may be produced to overcome the pressure dbewa was negatively correlated with arg abundance p 0 05 fig 11b suggesting that some toxic oxidation by products with high saturation may enrich args compounds with low dbewa always have high saturation pulicharla et al 2020 richardson and plewa 2020 as shown in fig 12 a multidrug and beta lactams args were predominant in advanced treatment protocols adef belongs to the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family of efflux pump families which can expel thousands of structurally diverse compounds from inner to outer membranes reducing toxicity to microbes delmar et al 2014 adef was dominant in o3 with its increase likely induced by toxic ozone by products a total of 72 subtypes for beta lactam args were detected and the relative abundance of oxa 9 was the highest of the beta lactam args in o3 21 30 times and 10 times higher than in the control and o3 uv respectively the relative abundance of aminoglycoside args in o3 uv was lower than in the other two treatments the relative abundance of acrd in o3 was 3 times higher than in control and this gene was not detected in o3 uv various subtypes of args were correlated with different microorganisms fig 12b for example oxa 355 was significantly correlated with some species of streptococcus streptococcus equi streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus haemolyticus aac6 is and ling were also significantly correlated with staphylococcus saprophyticus notably many of these bacteria are pathogens chan et al 2015 hofmans et al 2015 kuvhenguhwa et al 2017 dadeboyina et al 2020 however as shown in the network fig 12b adef acrd and other args with high relative abundances were weakly correlated with the microbial community structure fig 12b indicating the spread of args was weakly correlated with microbial species thus the args may spread through horizontal transfer the above results are explained in fig 12c and table s2 the relative abundances of margs in o3 and o3 uv were 81 and 78 significantly higher than cargs which indicated that args horizontal transfer is the main reason for the spread of args such as adef and this is promoted by oxidation treatments horizontal transfer of args depends on horizontal genetic elements such as transposons integrons phages and plasmids khedkar et al 2022 although many antibiotic resistant bacteria were inactivated during oxidation treatment intact remnants of dna of cell debris could still confer resistance genotypes to new bacteria by processes of natural transformation and or transduction dodd 2012 the spreading of args is now considered an emerging ecological threat liu et al 2019 the enrichment of margs induce the nonpathogenic microbial species to serve as an ecological reservoir for pathogenic bacteria salyers and shoemaker 2006 this is a major dissemination pathway for args in the natural environment li et al 2021 and may be a particular risk in aquaculture systems with the use of oxidation treatments 4 conclusions o3 and o3 uv treatment significantly improved the recirculating aquaculture water quality but simultaneously increased biological risks both treatments efficiently removed doc and nitrogen with significant decreases in protein uv254 lignin like structure nh4 n and no2 n o3 uv treatments also increased length 8 and weight 16 of crucian carps and improved fish intestinal health through the enhancement of probiotics however the production of saturated compounds and tannin like components induced args with increased abundances of 52 and 28 respectively for o3 and o3 uv treatments horizontal transfer of args was also enhanced the results indicate we must consider the

14858,recirculating aquaculture systems rass can be efficiently used for aquaculture and oxidation treatment is commonly used to improve water quality however the effects of oxidation treatments on aquaculture water safety and fish yield in rass are poorly understood in this study we tested the effects of o3 and o3 uv treatments on aquaculture water quality and safety during culture of crucian carp o3 and o3 uv treatments reduced the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration by 40 and destroyed the refractory organic lignin like features there was enrichment of ammonia oxidizing nitrospira nitrosomonas and nitrosospira and denitrifying pelomonas methyloversatilis and sphingomonas bacteria and n cycling functional genes were enriched by 23 and 48 respectively after o3 and o3 uv treatments treatment with o3 and o3 uv reduced nh4 n and no2 n in rass o3 uv treatment increased fish length and weight as well as probiotics in fish intestine however high saturated intermediates and tannin like features induced antibiotic resistance genes args in o3 and o3 uv treatments by 52 and 28 respectively and also enhanced horizontal transfer of args overall the application of o3 uv achieved better effects however understanding the potential biological risks posed by args in rass and determining the most efficient water treatment strategies to mitigate these risks should be goals

conversion in ras holl et al 2011 accumulation of dissolved organic matter dom in rass is also a concern as these compounds induce problems of altered water flavor odor and color and can promote the growth of opportunistic pathogens spiliotopoulou et al 2018 advanced oxidation treatments such as ultraviolet uv irradiation and or ozonation o3 are often used to treat the recycling water of rass to maintain water quality attramadal et al 2012 spiliotopoulou et al 2018 teitge et al 2020 o3 treatment can enhance water quality by oxidation of either o3 or the generated reactive oxidized substances

args have been found in many aquaculture systems even without antibiotic use shah et al 2012 huang et al 2015 indicating the significant risk of args in aquaculture although previous work focused on aquaculture water quality the potential bio risks of the treatments including arg generation and spread have not been assessed the goal of this study was to comprehensively analyze the contributions and negative effects of aquaculture water and fish oxidation treatments o3 and o3 uv in a ras after long term operation the effects and pathways of the oxidation treatments were evaluated by determining dom structure and composition and nitrogen status transformation changes in the microbial community and n cycling functional genes were also explored besides measuring fish intestinal microbes fish growth and arg production and transportation the results suggest there are positive and negative effects of using advanced oxidation methods to treat recirculating aquaculture water and can provide scientific guidance for ras operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and operations as shown in fig 1 each ras was constructed with a biofilter and a fish aquarium 18 75 l effective volume and equipped with a unit for advanced oxidation treatment 5 00 l effective volume the aquaculture water in the fish aquarium was purified by bio filter followed by oxidation treatment and then recycled back to the fish tank a peristaltic pump with 250 ml min flow velocity was used to drive aquaculture water circulation an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the fish aquarium to pump air via aeration equipment and maintain dissolved oxygen concentration at 8 mg l the rass were used in a constant temperature laboratory 20 1 c to evaluate the effects of oxidation treatments on recirculating aquaculture water quality and safety three rass were established with o3 treatment o3 uv treatment and no treatment with samples designated o3 o3 uv and control there were nine fish replicates for each fish tank uv and o3 generators were on continuously throughout operation the ozone concentration in the ozone tank was controlled to 0 4 mg l this concentration was in the relatively low range of the reported rass in previous works summerfelt et al 2009 the uv was provided by an uv led 8 w with 254 nm wavelength there was 0 13 mg l residual ozone in the water that flowed into the uv tank with the recycling water the ozone in the aquarium was un detectable probably because the low dose of ozone employed in this work was quickly consumed and diluted the initial water doc 4 61 mg l tn 0 51 mg l no3 n 0 46 mg l was collected from yitong river changchun china and was screened by a sieve with 0 5 mm pores to remove coarse debris crucian carp were used as a model

cartridges the cartridge was rinsed with 25 ml acidified lc ms water for the complete removal of salts and then the dom samples were eluted from the cartridges by 15 ml hplc methanol the eluted dom was dried by n2 until the volume reached 2 ml and then the methanolic extracts were diluted with milli q water at a ratio of 1 1 all extracted samples were stored at 20 c until analysis 2 2 2

analysis of smps the soluble microbial products smps including polysaccharides protein and uv254 were measured the anthrone method was used to measure the polysaccharide content dubois et al 1956 and the lowry method was used to measure the protein content lowry et al 1951 uv254 was measured using a 1 cm quartz cell on a perkinelmer lambda 45 spectrophotometer all samples were filtered through 0

through 0 45 μm microporous membrane filters prior to analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microbial community args and aquatic organisms 2 4 1 microbial community and args microorganisms from rass were collected by filtration of recirculating aquaculture water using a 0 45 μm microporous membrane filter samples were quick frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c immediately the dna was extracted for metagenomic analysis by novogene co ltd beijing china handelsman et al 1998 detailed methods for sequencing are available in previous study feng et al 2022 specifically metagenomic sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform pe150 strategy the filtration trimming and assembly of raw reads were conducted following the manufacturer s protocols the generated sequences were categorized into a nonredundant catalog and normalized by length to calculate the abundances of unigenes the unigenes were submitted to blast using the national center for biotechnology information nonredundant protein sequences ncbi nr database with the blastn tool e value 10 4 taxonomic annotation was conducted using megan based on the lowest common ancestor algorithm the bioinformatics workflow of the metagenomic analysis is described in text s2 after preprocessing the raw data scaftigs were obtained by megahit next metagenemark and bowtie2 were used to predict the open reading frames orf on the scaftigs and obtain the unigenes used for the subsequent analysis card the ncbi plasmid database integrall and isfinder were used to align the unigenes with the args and mobile genetic elements mges plasmid integron and insertion if mges were identified on the scaftigs with the args sequence the args were classified as mge mediated args margs if mges were not identified then the args were classified as chromosome mediated args cargs 2 4 2 fish growth and intestinal bacteria the average fish length from head to tail and weight were measured for each protocol on day 51 with nine replicate samples the intestine tissues of all fish were dissected and extracted to detect intestinal bacteria through 16srrna test by novogene co ltd beijing china the total microbial genomic dna was extracted from intestinal samples by ctab method the concentration and quality of dna were detected on 1 agarose gels the polymerase chain reaction pcr primers of the v3 v4 hypervariable region gene were applied utilizing the total microbial genomic dna in each sample as a template truseq dna pcr free sample preparation kit illumina usa was used for library construction following the manufacturer s recommendations and index codes were added the qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo scientific and agilent bioanalyzer 2100 system were used to evaluate library quality the library was sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform and 250 bp paired end reads were generated 2 5 statistical analysis student s t test was used to examine the significance of the statistical difference between samples with spss 20 0 ibm usa a variety of statistical analyses were performed with indices using r v4 1 1 with vegan mass psych and ggplot2 packages including procrustes analysis network analysis and determination of pielou and shannon wiener index values the nodes bacteria or args of network analysis were considered to have a significant correlation when the pearson s r 0 6 and p 0 05 and the results were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects on organic carbons and characteristics 3 1 1 dom concentration the dom in rass is mainly composed of excrement and smps and this material is generally toxic to fish and thus can significantly reduce overall yield tonin et al 2022 in this study reactors were operated for 51 days at the steady stage of the recirculating operation 37 days after treatment the doc concentration of aquaculture water was 40 lower than the control for both o3 and o3 uv treatments p 0 01 fig 2 b although the uv treatment accelerated the hydroxyl radical formation rate this may just promote of transformation of organic molecules to small molecular intermediates rather than achieve complete mineralization phungsai et al 2019 the reactive oxidized species ross generated by o3 and o3 uv can attack and oxidize organic compounds he et al 2022 and the refractories may also be transformed to products that are more easily biodegraded as a result organics were more completely mineralized via biodegradation in the aquaculture tanks for o3 and o3 uv protocols generally the differences between o3 and o3 uv treatment was not significant p 0 05 with almost the same doc changing trend in the rass during the 51 days operation 3 1 2 dom composition as shown in fig 3 a o3 and o3 uv processes significantly reduced soluble proteins 45 p 0 05 this is likely attributed to ros attack of tyrosine tryptophan histidine cysteine and methionine residues sharma and graham 2010 the elimination of uv254 signal fig 3c reflects the decomposition of unsaturated organics containing c c and c o double bonds eem spectra fig 3d further revealed significant reduction of tyrosine like aromatic proteins tryptophan like aromatic proteins fulvic acid humus soluble microbial metabolites and humic acid humus there were no significant differences in the total soluble polysaccharides in the treated rass fig 3b probably due to the presence of hexose and hexuronic acid intermediates meng et al 2016 the chemical compounds element composition and biochemical classes in the vk diagram of fig 4 a are shown in fig 4b e compared to the control the elemental compositions of rass treated with o3 and o3 uv were both 46 different and 30 of the molecules in o3 were different from those in o3 uv fig 4b we next characterized the aromaticity and unsaturation of chemical components aiwa dbe owa and dbewa all dropped significantly for o3 and o3 uv protocols table 1 due to a lower unsaturation character ratio in their chemical profiles aguilar alarcón et al 2020 oxygen rich compounds such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids may be formed during ozonation as supported by the increment of o cwa and decrement of aiwa with advanced oxidation table 1 probably due to ring opening reactions tripathi et al 2011 zhong et al 2017 lim et al 2022 the formula classes of dom fig 4c and d show generation of greater relative abundances of chlorinated species with o3 and o3 uv treatments 16 for both probably due to halogenation by the calcium magnesium and sodium salts present in the water wu et al 2021 lignin is the most abundant macromolecule in the terrestrial biosphere a large amount of lignin in rivers originates from the land and the large abundance of lignin fig 4e in aquaculture water may originate from the raw water from the yitong river used to set up the tanks ward et al 2013 as shown in fig 4e the relative abundances of lignin like feature were more than 30 lower in o3 and o3 uv than in the control which indicated the destruction of lignin through the effects of advanced oxidation as activated aromatic rings are vulnerable to ozonation shi et al 2020 tannins were 135 and 85 greater in o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively compared with the control fig 4e these treatments can inactivate organisms by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding of proteins ferrer gallego et al 2012 garcía estévez et al 2018 3 2 nitrogen transformation 3 2 1 nitrogen forms the changes of total nitrogen tn are shown in fig s1 after 18 days all parameters met the aquaculture water standards no2 n was accumulated in the control from day 5 to day 20 and could potentially cause oxidative damage due to the production of nitric oxide no and peroxynitrite onoo reactive nitrogen species in aquatic animal tissues lushchak and lushchak 2021 advanced oxidization treatments can readily oxidize nitrite so there was almost no no2 n accumulation when rass were treated by o3 or o3 uv likewise ammonia that is toxic to fish at low doses 1 randall and tsui 2002 was nearly completely removed however no3 n concentrations were continuously increased due to the absence of anoxic environment in the three systems fig 5 c fortunately no3 n has negligible effects on fish at concentrations less than hundreds of milligrams per liter crab et al 2007 these results confirmed effective ammonium and nitrite removals via advanced oxidation treatments compared with conventional aquaculture technology the application of advanced oxidation clearly improved the safety and stability of water quality lower doc in the rass with o3 and o3 uv treatment induced the autotrophic bacteria including aob and nob to become more competent as a result aob and nob were more abundant and activated in the aquariums for more efficient transformation of nh4 n to no3 n 3 2 2 nitrogen transforming mechanisms as shown in fig 6 the ammonia oxidizing genera nitrospira nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were 155 122 and 64 more abundant in the o3 uv treatment relative to the control the abundances were relatively low for the o3 protocol but nitrosomonas and nitrosospira abundances were 80 and 25 higher than the control these results were consistent with the above mentioned effects on nitrogen transformation multiple denitrifying bacteria were also enriched due to advanced oxidization treatments pelomonas the most dominant denitrifying bacteria in o3 uv was 400 higher than the control and methyloversatilis and sphingomonas in o3 were 230 and 930 higher than the control respectively although multiple denitrifying bacteria were enriched the accumulation rate of no3 n was greater than the denitrifying rate this is probably due to the low concentration of doc and high concentration of dissolved oxygen 8 mg l but multiple biodegradable substances formed by oxidation also increased their activation to further investigate the microbial mechanisms of nitrogen transformation n cycling associated genes abundances were determined as shown in fig 7 a and their roles in microbial n cycling pathways are shown in fig 7b there was clear enrichment of n cycling functional genes in the rass with o3 and o3 uv treatment with increases in the relative abundances of n cycling function genes of 23 and 48 p 0 05 for the o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively fig 7c glutamine synthetase glna had the greatest abundance and was 20 enriched in o3 uv compared to both control and o3 all the ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation genes path 2 and path 9 in fig 7b were more enriched in o3 uv with amoc c and nxrb increased by 300 and 200 relative to the control nearly all the denitrifying genes were enriched in o3 uv treatment paths 4 5 6 8 and 10 in fig 7a and b explaining the increased nitrogen removal in o3 uv overall o3 and o3 uv both enhanced the activity of n cycling in rass but there were greater effects for o3 uv treatment 3 3 aquatic organisms 3 3 1 fish growth and intestinal bacteria as shown in fig 8 a the average crucian carp length with o3 uv treatments 6 8 cm was significantly n 9 p 0 05 greater than the control 6 3 cm and slightly higher than the protocol with o3 alone 6 4 cm fish weight of o3 uv and o3 treatments were 16 n 9 p 0 05 and 10 higher than control respectively exhibiting the same trend as fish length we next investigated fish intestine microbiota to identify the mechanisms explaining the increased fish growth as shown in table 2 shannon and pielou index values of fish intestinal microbiota in o3 uv were promoted by 4 and 14 respectively however the pielou index in o3 was not significantly affected and the shannon index of o3 was even lower than that of the control the higher intestinal microbiota diversity can promote host immune homeostasis and health maintenance sommer and baeckhed 2013 the lower diversity of fish intestinal microbiota in o3 may be attributed to the higher relative concentration of tannins in aquarium fig 4e which affects fish health by decreasing growth hepatosomatic index and carcass lipids omnes et al 2017 the results indicate that o3 without uv treatment in ras was harmful to fish vibrio is a major inducing factor of foodborne outbreaks for fresh water fish yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b the abundances in o3 and o3 uv dropped more than 60 aeromonas is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infectious diseases in aquaculture igbinosa et al 2017 the aeromonas relative abundance accounted for more than 50 in o3 but only 20 in o3 uv cetobacterium can improve glucose homeostasis and increase insulin expression in fish wang et al 2021 there were high levels in fish intestines from o3 uv but only 3 in o3 o3 uv treatment enhanced microbial diversity and evenness with increases in the abundances of beneficial bacteria and decreases in the abundances of pathogens making fish healthier and more productive the microbial community of aquaculture water is a significant factor that affects fish intestinal microbiota roeselers et al 2011 giatsis et al 2015 to explain the increase of probiotics in fish intestines the microbiota was further explored 3 3 2 microbial community in aquiculture water the diversity and evenness index of microbiota in aquaculture water were determined and the results are listed in table 2 the shannon and pielou index values of bacteria in water were both increased by 15 under advanced oxidation treatments this is likely because advanced oxidation provides more biodegradable substrates for microorganisms de vera and wert 2019 there were other important microbial changes in the treated systems flavobacterium is an opportunistic pathogen enriched after disinfectant oxidation guarin et al 2022 as shown in fig 9 the flavobacterium relative abundance was increased 6 times and 10 times in o3 and o3 uv treatments respectively similarly hyphomicrobium attributed to formaldehyde typical o3 by product elimination kasuga et al 2016 increased by 20 times in o3 and o3 uv treatments in o3 there was significant enrichment of sphingobium and polaromonas which can degrade aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 this is consistent with the decreased uv254 fig 3c and alwa table 1 observed for the o3 treatment in the o3 uv treatment the oligotrophic environment preferring genus emticicia was enriched significantly awad et al 2016 polynucleobacter are widely distributed in freshwater jezberova et al 2010 but this genus was eliminated in o3 and o3 uv treatments probably because this genus is sensitive to oxidation treatment overall the results show that advanced oxidation enriched many bacteria 3 3 3 interactions between intestinal and water microbes fig 10 a shows a significant correlation between the bacteria community structure in water and fish intestines m2 0 048 p 0 001 the correlation network of bacteria from water and fish intestines was constructed by modularly dividing the network into nine major modules i e module i to ix fig 10b module ⅱ and module ⅲ were composed of bacteria from different habitats fish intestines and water for example rhodococcus in water was significantly correlated with streptomyces and kitasatospora in fish intestines rhodococcus bacteria can degrade persistent pollutants solyanikova and golovleva 2011 the genus streptomyces is used as a probiotic in aquaculture that can protect fish and shrimp from pathogens and increase the growth of aquatic organisms tan et al 2016 schlesneria can assimilate complex c compounds in water and act as core bacteria linking module i module vii and module viii a polysaccharide degrading bacterium cellvibrio in fish intestines linked module i module viii and module ix li et al 2019 in general procrustes analysis and microbial network analysis both indicate a significant correlation between bacteria in water and fish intestines fig 10 thus advanced oxidation treatments affected the microbiota in fish intestine such as probiotics through their regulation of the microflora in aquaculture water 3 4 antimicrobial genes we next investigated the effect of the oxidation treatments on args about 291 arg subtypes belonging to 26 arg types were detected the relative abundances of args in o3 and o3 uv were 52 p 0 05 and 28 p 0 05 higher respectively than in the control fig 11 a uv disinfection treatments typically have limited effects on antibiotic resistant bacteria due to the photoreactivation and dark repair microbial activities resulting in only partial args elimination zhang et al 2020 o3 can cause cell lysis but a lower dose of ozone is ineffective for the elimination of args and incomplete removal of genetic material can induce horizontal spread of args somensi et al 2015 the ozonation process results in toxic oxidation by products that also can induce spread of args the tannin like features of some of these oxidation by products were positively correlated with args p 0 05 fig 11b tannins have been considered as an alternative to antibiotics huang et al 2018 and the stress of tannins can induce iron chelation disrupt the cell membrane inhibit cell wall synthesis and inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis to inhibit bacterial growth farha et al 2020 in response args may be produced to overcome the pressure dbewa was negatively correlated with arg abundance p 0 05 fig 11b suggesting that some toxic oxidation by products with high saturation may enrich args compounds with low dbewa always have high saturation pulicharla et al 2020 richardson and plewa 2020 as shown in fig 12 a multidrug and beta lactams args were predominant in advanced treatment protocols adef belongs to the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family of efflux pump families which can expel thousands of structurally diverse compounds from inner to outer membranes reducing toxicity to microbes delmar et al 2014 adef was dominant in o3 with its increase likely induced by toxic ozone by products a total of 72 subtypes for beta lactam args were detected and the relative abundance of oxa 9 was the highest of the beta lactam args in o3 21 30 times and 10 times higher than in the control and o3 uv respectively the relative abundance of aminoglycoside args in o3 uv was lower than in the other two treatments the relative abundance of acrd in o3 was 3 times higher than in control and this gene was not detected in o3 uv various subtypes of args were correlated with different microorganisms fig 12b for example oxa 355 was significantly correlated with some species of streptococcus streptococcus equi streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus haemolyticus aac6 is and ling were also significantly correlated with staphylococcus saprophyticus notably many of these bacteria are pathogens chan et al 2015 hofmans et al 2015 kuvhenguhwa et al 2017 dadeboyina et al 2020 however as shown in the network fig 12b adef acrd and other args with high relative abundances were weakly correlated with the microbial community structure fig 12b indicating the spread of args was weakly correlated with microbial species thus the args may spread through horizontal transfer the above results are explained in fig 12c and table s2 the relative abundances of margs in o3 and o3 uv were 81 and 78 significantly higher than cargs which indicated that args horizontal transfer is the main reason for the spread of args such as adef and this is promoted by oxidation treatments horizontal transfer of args depends on horizontal genetic elements such as transposons integrons phages and plasmids khedkar et al 2022 although many antibiotic resistant bacteria were inactivated during oxidation treatment intact remnants of dna of cell debris could still confer resistance genotypes to new bacteria by processes of natural transformation and or transduction dodd 2012 the spreading of args is now considered an emerging ecological threat liu et al 2019 the enrichment of margs induce the nonpathogenic microbial species to serve as an ecological reservoir for pathogenic bacteria salyers and shoemaker 2006 this is a major dissemination pathway for args in the natural environment li et al 2021 and may be a particular risk in aquaculture systems with the use of oxidation treatments 4 conclusions o3 and o3 uv treatment significantly improved the recirculating aquaculture water quality but simultaneously increased biological risks both treatments efficiently removed doc and nitrogen with significant decreases in protein uv254 lignin like structure nh4 n and no2 n o3 uv treatments also increased length 8 and weight 16 of crucian carps and improved fish intestinal health through the enhancement of probiotics however the production of saturated compounds and tannin like components induced args with increased abundances of 52 and 28 respectively for o3 and o3 uv treatments horizontal transfer of args was also enhanced the results indicate we must consider the

14859,heterogeneous fenton reactions of zero valent iron zvi requires the sufficient release of fe ii to catalyze the h2o2 decomposition however the rate limiting step of proton transfer through the passivation layer of zvi restricted the fe ii release via fe0 core corrosion herein we modified the shell of zvi with highly proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o by ball milling oa zvibm and demonstrated its high heterogeneous fenton performance of thiamphenicol tap removal with 500 times enhancement of the rate constant more importantly the oa zvibm h2o2 showed little attenuation of the fenton activity during 13 successive cycles and was applicable across a wide ph range of 3 5 9 5 interestingly the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction showed ph self adapting ability which initially reduced and then sustained the solution ph in the range of 3 5 5 2 the abundant intrinsic surface fe ii of oa zvibm 45 54 vs 27 52 in zvibm according to fe 2p xps profiles was oxidized by h2o2 and hydrolyzed to generate protons and the fec2o4 2h2o shell favored the fast transfer of protons to inner fe0 therefore the consumption regeneration cycle of protons were accelerated to drove the production of fe ii for fenton reactions demonstrated by the more prominent h2 evolution and nearly 100 h2o2 decomposition by oa zvibm furthermore the fec2o4 2h2o shell was stable and slightly decreased from 1 9 to 1 7 after the fenton reaction this study clarified the significance of proton transfer on the reactivity of zvi and provided an efficient strategy to achieve the highly efficient and robust heterogeneous fenton reaction of zvi for pollution control graphical abstract the proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell accelerates the cycle of h and the heterogeneous fenton reaction of oa zvibm h2o2 image graphical abstract keywords zero valent iron oxalic acid heterogeneous fenton reaction proton transfer thiamphenicol data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the strong reducibility inexpensiveness easy manufacture convenient storage and transportation as well as environmental benignancy endowed zvi with great potential in catalyzing heterogeneous fenton reactions basically ferrous species including both the soluble fe2 and the surface bounded fe ii were essential for h2o2 activation during heterogeneous fenton reactions he et al 2016b rezaei and vione 2018 xu et al 2017 generally ferrous species would generate from the oxidation of zvi in water eq 1 he et al 2016a among which the proton played vital roles stoichiometrically protons were consumed by fe0 and fe ii eqs 1 2 but equal molar protons could be regenerated by fe iii reactions via eqs 3 4 therefore the protons should undergo effective cycling accompanied by the continuous transformation of iron species fe0 fe ii fe iii fe oh 3 as well as the electron transfer and h2o2 activation however conventional zvi materials were always passivated due to the intrinsic iron hydr oxides shell which would significantly restrict the transport of protons from solution to fe core hu et al 2020 thereby kinetically governed the generation rate of fe ii and the subsequent fenton activity which were modeled by the previous reports of zanoelo et al de souza et al 2020 vialich et al 2022 their results as well as many other reports chen et al 2021 donadelli et al 2020 donadelli et al 2018 he et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 wang and tang 2021 suggested the heterogeneous fenton reactivity of zvi was highly ph dependent which attenuated sharply with the increase of ph to circumneutral conditions since the poor proton conductivity of the hydr oxides layer required the driving force of high proton concentrations to achieve sufficient access of proton to the inner fe core alowitz and scherer 2002 apparently the need of adjusting acidic ph conditions would greatly restrict the application of zvi heterogeneous fenton reactions for water treatment and pollution control therefore strategies are urgently desired to tackle this problem 1 f e 0 2 h fe ii h 2 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh oh 3 fe iii 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 4 2 fe iii h 2 o 2 2 fe ii o 2 2 h over the past decades much effort has been done to destroy the passivation layer and to accelerate the reactivity of iron core including ultrasonic treatment liu et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 weak magnetic jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 acid washing lin and lin 2017 ma et al 2016 bimetallic galvanic cell cao et al 2014 cwiertny et al 2007 and surface chemical modification cai et al 2021 garcia et al 2021 hu et al 2021 jia et al 2018 li et al 2017 liao et al 2021 malik et al 2021 xu et al 2021 nevertheless these methods did not regard the key problem in poor proton conductivity of zvi passivation layer as the rate limiting factor of zvi heterogeneous fenton reactions therefore to enhance the proton conductivity of zvi shell may be a much more straight forward and effective strategy in 2009 yamada et al reported that ferrous oxalate dihydrate fec2o4 2h2o possessed extremely high proton conductivity of 1 3 ms cm 1 comparable with that of nafion film yamada et al 2009 therefore by chemically modifying the composition of zvi shell with fec2o4 2h2o may improve the proton conductivity which will then accelerate the proton cycle fe ii release and the subsequent fenton reactivity recently our group successfully fabricated the zvi with fec2o4 2h2o shell via mechanically ball milling the mixture of zvi and oxalic acid dihydrate oa denoted as oa zvibm which showed remarkable cr vi removal capacity hu et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to expect the good performance of oa zvibm in heterogeneous fenton reactions but this remains unexplored herein we systematically investigated the heterogeneous fenton reactivity of oa zvibm and the counterpart ball milled zvi zvibm with a typical antibiotic thiamphenicol tap used as the model contaminant owing to its wide application and frequent detection azzouz et al 2011 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 xie et al 2018 by comparing the tap degradation efficiencies the ph profiles the iron leaching and transformation the proton conductivity and electron donating capacity of the zvi samples we evaluated the impact of oxalic acid modification on the heterogeneous fenton reaction and interestingly revealed the proton self adapting ability of the oa zvibm h2o2 system which reduced the solution ph to weak acidic conditions that were conducive for the fenton reaction and then steadily maintained the ph throughout the long term reaction we proposed the mechanism of accelerated proton cycling driven iron oxidation and heterogeneous fenton reaction in the oa zvibm h2o2 system the reactive oxygen species ros and tap degradation pathways were also investigated and the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 system were also evaluated by assessing the long term performance stability of oa zvibm and the impact of co existing water constituents 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials detailed information of the chemicals used were provided in text s1 of the supplementary materials 2 2 synthesis of zvibm and oa zvibm samples zvibm and oa zvibm were prepared by the ball milling method as previously reported hu et al 2020 typically 5 6 g of commercial iron powder was mixed with different amounts of oxalic acid dihydrate oa 0 063 g 0 126 g and 0 252 g to achieve oa fe molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 respectively after 4 h of ball milling the obtained samples were washed with water and absolute ethanol dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h and stored in a vacuum bag for subsequent characterization and use the samples were denoted as oa zvibm meanwhile the control sample of zvibm was also prepared under the same conditions without the addition of oxalic acid dihydrate detailed information of the ball milling was presented in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 3 characterization of the materials detailed information of the materials characterization results was presented in text s3 of the supplementary materials 2 4 batch experiments of tap degradation in a typical tap degradation experiment 0 05 g of zvibm or oa zvibm powder and 27 2 μl h2o2 30 wt were added into a conical flask containing 50 ml of tap solution 20 mg l 1 without ph adjustment to initiate the heterogeneous fenton reaction the initial ph of the tap solution was 6 6 the reaction flasks were placed on an orbital shaker with 200 rpm at 22 c during the degradation process 1 ml of the solution was sampled at regular intervals and then filtrated by 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter the nylon filter membrane was rinsed with tap solution and the adsorption of tap has been saturated before using subsequently 0 9 ml sample was mixed with 0 1 ml ethanol to terminate the fenton reaction meanwhile we also evaluated the tap degradation efficiency at different initial ph values ranged from 3 5 to 10 5 adjusted by naoh 1 mol l 1 or h2so4 1 mol l 1 for the multiple cycles of tap degradation reactions 5 ml tap stock solution 0 2 g l 1 2 ml deionized water and 27 2 μl h2o2 30 wt were supplemented into the conical flask at the end of each fenton cycle when the initial tap was completely removed the tap concentrations were monitored with the high performance liquid chromatography hplc method with the details described in text s4 all the experiments were repeated three times to investigate the effect of fe ii 1 10 phenanthroline was added to complex fe ii before the tap degradation to verify the roles of different reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments were conducted with the details described in text s4 to analyze the influences of coexisting ions and natural organic matter nom on tap degradation various ions and humic acid ha were added according to the published literatures liao et al 2021 typically the initial concentrations used were 0 01 g l 1 ha 2 mmol l 1 kno3 na2co3 nahco3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 respectively 2 5 analytical and statistical methods details of the analytical methods were presented in text s4 of the supplementary materials pearson statistics were performed with the origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of oa zvibm the as fabricated zvibm and oa zvibm samples were firstly characterized sem images showed that zvibm particles were relatively smooth fig s1 a b whereas the surface of oa zvibm was rougher with smaller particle diameters fig s1 c d xrd patterns only showed two peaks at 44 6 and 64 8 attributed to crystalline α fe jcpds file no 1 1262 iron without any signs of oa or fec2o4 2h2o fig s2a indicating no significant change of the crystal structure of zvi after the ball milling process ftir spectra showed the peaks ascribed to fec2o4 2h2o in oa zvibm fig s2b suggesting the successful modification of zvi surface with fec2o4 2h2o by ball milling details of ftir analysis were provided in text s5 hu et al 2020 57fe mössbauer spectroscopies were further utilized to quantify the phase compositions of zvibm and oa zvibm fig s2c and s2d and the corresponding parameters were summarized in tables s1 and s2 the proportions of components including fe0 fe2o3 and fec2o4 2h2o were calculated according to the area of each component suggesting 97 8 fe0 core and 2 2 fe2o3 shell in zvibm whereas oa zvibm contained 95 9 fe0 2 1 fe2o3 and 1 9 fec2o4 2h2o further confirming the successful fabrication of oa zvibm with fec2o4 2h2o shell tables s1 s2 3 2 performance of the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction we prepared oa zvibm with different oa contents and examined their heterogeneous fenton reactivities toward tap degradation at the ambient temperature without adjusting the initial solution ph as shown in fig 1 a only 2 of tap was removed within 20 min in the control experiment of zvibm h2o2 whereas the tap degradation efficiencies of the oa zvibm h2o2 reactions elevated along with increasing oa contents and tap was completely removed when the molar ratio of oa fe reached 2 the kinetics analysis illustrated that all the tap degradation curves obeyed the pseudo first order model and the apparent rate constants were 7 74 10 5 3 81 10 3 1 44 10 2 and 4 21 10 1 min 1 for zvibm h2o2 oa zvibm h2o2 with 0 5 1 0 and 2 oa fe molar ratios respectively fig 1b considering that the specific surface area ssa of zvi might affect the heterogeneous fenton performance we measured the ssa of both zvibm and oa zvibm referred to the sample prepared with 2 oa molar ratio hereafter with the n2 adsorption desorption and the brunauer emmett teller bet isotherm fig s3 the ssa of zvibm and oa zvibm were 0 997 and 9 263 m2 g 1 and the ssa normalized tap degradation rate constants in the zvibm h2o2 and oa zvibm h2o2 fenton systems were 7 74 10 5 g min 1 m 2 and 4 54 10 2 g min 1 m 2 respectively indicating that oa zvibm significantly enhanced the tap degradation by nearly 500 times the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide during the heterogeneous fenton experiments were determined with tioso4 method to further demonstrate the high reactivity of oa zvibm experiments details were presented in text s6 of the supplementary materials ruales lonfat et al 2014 wang et al 2021 as shown in fig s4 negligible hydrogen peroxide was decomposed in the zvibm h2o2 system whereas the hydrogen peroxide was almost completely decomposed within 20 min in the oa zvibm h2o2 system this was consistent with the higher fenton performance of oa zvibm h2o2 as the durability of the h2o2 activator was critical in heterogeneous fenton reactions we evaluated the recycling performance of oa zvibm in tap degradation by feeding fresh tap and h2o2 at the end of each 20 min cycle impressively oa zvibm exhibited excellent durability in catalyzing the heterogeneous fenton reaction showing no obvious attenuation of tap removal efficiencies even in the 13th successive experiment 240 260 min 1 although the efficiency of tap degradation decreased gradually thereafter the tap degradation percentage still reached 80 even after 15 successive experiments the decreased performance may be due to the gradual depletion of oa zvibm on the contrary the zvibm h2o2 reaction always showed negligible tap removal efficiencies during the recycling experiments fig 1c therefore the oa zvibm is a promising heterogeneous fenton catalyst with outstanding activity and durability the heterogeneous fenton performance of oa zvibm h2o2 was also evaluated at different initial ph values the counterpart zvibm h2o2 reaction only showed significant tap removal at acidic conditions with about 100 35 and 8 tap degraded within 60 min at the initial ph of 3 5 4 5 and 5 5 respectively and the tap removal efficiencies were negligible above ph 5 5 fig 2 a these results were consistent with previous reports chen et al 2021 donadelli et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 indicating that high proton concentrations were desired to achieve the effective fe core corrosion eq 1 due to the restricted transport of proton through the passivation layer of zvibm surprisingly the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton systems exhibited much higher tap removal performance over the wide initial ph range of 3 5 9 5 with 100 tap degraded in 60 min and the lower initial ph also facilitated the tap degradation e g 100 removal of tap only took 2 min at the initial ph of 3 5 in the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction fig 2b the 60 min tap degradation efficiency at the initial ph 10 5 significantly decreased to 18 possibly because the accelerated generation of iron hydroxyl oxides which shall deposit on the surface of oa zvibm and inhibit h2o2 adsorption and activation rezaei and vione 2018 these results revealed that oa zvibm could serve as the robust heterogeneous fenton catalyst to deal with wastewater of wide ph ranges besides the wide ph adaptation of oa zvibm h2o2 suggested its strong proton utilizing ability probably thanks to the high proton conductivity of the fec2o4 2h2o shell which allowed the fast diffusion of proton to fe core for fe ii production to catalyze the fenton reaction this assumption will be demonstrated in the following parts 3 3 mechanism of the oa zvibm h2o2 fenton reaction regarding the essential role of proton in fe0 corrosion and fenton reaction we monitored the ph values during the heterogeneous fenton reactions surprisingly the solution ph in the oa zvibm h2o2 system sharply decreased from the initial 6 6 to ca 4 2 within 2 min of reaction and maintained thereafter until 80 min then decreased gradually to ca 3 6 until 200 min on the contrary the solution ph of the zvibm h2o2 system only slightly decreased to 6 3 at 2 min and then gradually increased back to 6 9 with prolonged reaction time fig 3 a these results indicated that the oa zvibm h2o2 system could achieve the real time and persistent regulation of solution ph to the appropriate acidic range for heterogeneous fenton reactions to confirm this hypothesis we monitored the trend of ph values during oa zvibm h2o2 reactions by employing different initial solution ph the zvibm h2o2 system can only decrease the solution ph at initial ph values higher than 6 5 for instance to reduce the ph from 10 5 9 5 8 5 and 7 5 to 7 9 7 4 7 1 and 7 0 respectively it was possibly due to the weak acidity of hydrogen peroxide pka 11 62 and the proton of hydrogen peroxide may be consumed by hydroxyl ions at alkaline condition abbot and brown 1990 špalek et al 1982 moreover we monitored the ph variation by adding only h2o2 without zvibm and the results fig s5 showed that the ph variation trends were consistent with those in the zvibm h2o2 system fig 3b therefore h2o2 was responsible for the decrease of ph in zvibm h2o2 system at alkaline conditions when the initial ph was below 6 5 negligible ph decrease was observed in the zvibm h2o2 reaction fig 3b impressively the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction significantly reduced the solution ph except for the case of initial ph 3 5 besides the solution ph could be maintained in the range of 3 5 5 2 during the heterogeneous fenton reactions fig 3c the exception was that with the initial ph of 10 5 the solution ph slowly decreased to 7 5 which was responsible for its poor tap removal performance in fig 2b this ph self adapting ability of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction shall offer great advantages during the water treatment processes the hydrogen evolution experiments of zvibm and oa zvibm were conducted to further demonstrate the high proton conductivity and proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm in aqueous reactions the details of experiments were presented in text s7 of the supplementary materials the results were shown in fig s6 negligible hydrogen was produced by zvibm and the hydrogen production by oa zvibm increased with time with 17 5 μmol produced within 2 h therefore the higher hydrogen producing capacity of oa zvibm than zvibm further demonstrated the high proton conductivity and proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm in aqueous reactions to elucidate the cause of the fast decrease of ph at the beginning stage of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction we monitored the leaching of iron ions during the heterogeneous fenton reactions since the consumption and re generation of proton were closely related with the conversion of iron species e g the hydrolysis of fe iii and the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 are supposed to cause the release of h and the decrease of ph eqs 3 4 as expected the iron dissolution of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction was much more significant than the case of zvibm h2o2 control the released iron was dominated by the dissolved fe iii whose concentrations were in the range of 0 16 0 36 mmol l 1 and basically increased with the prolonged reacting duration the concentration of dissolved fe ii was 0 058 mmol l 1 at 5 min and gradually decreased to ca 0 024 mmol l 1 after 200 min fig 4 a on the contrary the zvibm h2o2 reaction released only 0 01 mmol l 1 ferric ions and negligible ferrous ions fig 4c besides in the absence of h2o2 the oa zvibm h2o system gradually released 0 17 mmol l 1 fe ii during the first 20 min and then decreased to 0 022 mmol l 1 but without significant increase of fe iii concentrations fig 4b indicating that the released fe ii may undergo re adsorption on the surface of oa zvibm or involved with the generation of fe ii bearing corrosion products hu et al 2020 nevertheless both ferric ions and ferrous ions were negligible at the concentration below 0 005 mmol l 1 for zvibm in the absence of h2o2 fig 4d these results indicated that h2o2 played essential role in the fast oxidation of fe ii to fe iii eq 2 which further hydrolyzed to cause the ph decrease as also evidenced by the less extent of ph downfall in the absence of h2o2 fig 3a however the initial release of iron ions should not stem from the oxidation of fe0 eq 1 because we did not observe the increase of ph therefore the iron release in the initial step should be due to the dissolution of the intrinsic surface bound iron ions according to the results of fig s7 the oa zvibm contained much more surface fe ii 45 54 that may be produced during the ball mill process with oa when compared with the case 27 52 of zvibm therefore could immediately leach plenty of fe ii into solution which then oxidized and hydrolyzed to cause the fast decrease of ph to the acidic range to demonstrate this control experiments were conducted by adding 0 17 mmol l 1 feso4 7h2o or fec2o4 2h2o to the h2o2 solution the ph of feso4 7h2o h2o2 system sharply decreased to about 3 5 in 2 min and keep constant thereafter the ph of fec2o4 2h2o h2o2 system decreased more slowly to about 4 7 fig s8 we analyzed the cause of slower ph change in fec2o4 2h2o h2o2 system as follows one reason is the lower solubility of fec2o4 2h2o than that of feso4 7h2o therefore the fec2o4 2h2o dissolved much more slowly resulting in lower concentrations of ferrous ions which hydrolyzed to generate fewer protons besides oxalate possibly complexed with the generated fe iii leaving less unsaturated sites for oh coordination to decrease the ph keenan and sedlak 2008 suter et al 1988 since the iron released by oa zvibm may contain both free fe ii and oxalate chelated fe ii the fall of ph to 4 2 was reasonable to evaluate the contribution of initial ph decrease to the enhanced tap degradation in oa zvibm h2o2 we adjusted the initial ph of zvibm h2o2 to 4 1 with sulfuric acid sa and oa and the solution ph remained almost constant throughout the 20 min reactions fig s9a however only 8 and 3 of tap were degraded with sa and oa fig s9b therefore the high performance of oa zvibm h2o2 was not only due to the initial decrease of solution ph besides the contribution of the leaching oa from the oa zvibm which might complex with iron ions was also ruled out because of the even poorer tap degradation with oa than with sa these results were consistent with fig 2a and further suggested our hypothesis that the higher proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm may play essential roles to confirm we first characterized the proton conductivity σ of the oa zvibm sample since σ is inversely proportional to impedance rm bureekaew et al 2010 hu et al 2020 we monitored the impedance of zvibm and oa zvibm the semicircle diameter of the zvibm eis was much larger than that of oa zvibm fig 5 a hence the impedance of oa zvibm sample was much lower than that of zvibm suggesting that protons could more easily transfer through the fec2o4 2h2o shell moreover as the proton induced corrosion of fe0 was always accompanied with the electron transfer process we further employed the tafel scan to characterize the electron transfer ability of zvibm and oa zvibm samples as shown in fig 5b the self corrosion potentials of zvibm and oa zvibm were 0 43 v and 0 83 v with the maximum self corrosion current of 10 5 09 a and 10 4 55 a respectively these results implied that oa zvibm was more likely to donate electrons consistent with its high proton conductive shell based on the above results the mechanism of the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction could be proposed fig 5c stage i due to the more surface confined fe ii of oa zvibm produced during the ball milling process oa zvibm released plenty of fe ii to the solution at the starting stage of reaction and the fe ii was instantly oxidized by h2o2 via eq 2 to fe iii which underwent hydrolysis eq 4 protons were consumed during eq 2 and re generated by eq 4 and the net increase of proton was 2 moles per molar fe ii consumption stage ii the increased proton concentrations in the solution further promoted the diffusion of protons across the zvi shell to fe0 core which was proposed to be the rate limiting step of the zvi h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction the high proton conductivity of the fec2o4 2h2o shell greatly accelerated this process and the subsequent fe0 oxidation eq 1 consumption of protons which released abundant fe ii to catalyze the fenton reaction eq 2 consumption of protons for tap degradation the generated fe iii then re generate the protons eq 4 remarkably the oa zvibm h2o2 could first decrease the ph to more conducive conditions because the weak acidity could accelerate the corrosion of zvi to generate more ferrous species for h2o2 activation and keep ferrous species from precipitation li et al 2014 liang and guo 2010 besides oa zvibm h2o2 effectively maintained the cycling of protons accompanied by the successive oxidation of fe0 to fe ii and then fe iii for fenton oxidation of tap both stages were necessary to achieve the high heterogeneous fenton reaction performance this effective cycle could not be achieved by the zvibm h2o2 system because 1 the intrinsic surface fe ii was minor thus cannot mediate the decrease of ph at the starting stage of reaction 2 the proton conductivity of the zvibm shell was poor to impede the transport and utilization of protons from the outer solution to further confirm the proposed mechanism the correlation between proton concentrations leached fe ii and fe iii concentrations were analyzed by using the pearson statistical method all the relevant data in zvibm h2o oa zvibm h2o zvibm h2o2 and oa zvibm h2o2 reactions conducted with the initial ph of 6 6 were included in the statistical analysis the results indicated that the proton concentration was highly correlated with ferric ions concentration in all situations r 0 997 p 0 001 but neither the proton concentration nor the ferric ions concentration were correlated with the ferrous ions concentration fig 5d these results proved the proton generation pathway of ferric hydrolysis in the zvi heterogeneous fenton systems 3 4 mechanism of tap degradation and robustness of oa zvibm h2o2 scavenging experiments were conducted to reveal the dominant reactive oxygen species for tap degradation we applied etoh tba 1 10 phenanthroline phen to scavenge oh and fe iv oh and ferrous ions li et al 2022 lin and lin 2017 wang et al 2020 as shown in fig s10a the tap degradation was almost completely inhibited with the addition of etoh tba and phen implying the dominant roles of oh and ferrous ions wang et al 2020 besides phen inhibited the oxidation of fe ii by h2o2 because of the strong chelation of fe ii and prevented the ph decrease fig s10b further demonstrating the mechanism proposed epr spectra analysis was also carried out to confirm the reactive oxygen species by using dmpo as a spin trapping agent li et al 2022 no obvious epr signal was obtained in the zvibm h2o2 system fig s10c however the dmpo oh adduct appeared in the oa zvibm h2o2 system fig s10d ling et al 2021 shi et al 2020 therefore it could be concluded that oh was the dominant ros for tap degradation to probe the pathways of tap degradation by oa zvibm h2o2 we identified the degradation intermediates of tap by hplc ms ms as shown in fig s11 5 intermediates were detected including the dechlorination product of tap p the branch chain oxidized products of tap p p1 p4 and the methanesulfonic acid p5 due to the strong oxidizing properties of oh the molecular structure of tap was severely destroyed chu et al 2016 kong et al 2015 and we proposed the possible degradation pathways of tap in the oa zvibm h2o2 scheme 1 liu et al 2015 marciniec et al 2010 to evaluate the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction for real water treatment the effects of coexisting ions and natural organic matter nom on tap degradation were investigated qiao et al 2018 typical coexisting ions including ca2 mg2 no3 cl so4 2 sio3 2 co3 2 hco3 po4 3 and ha were added as shown in fig s12 ca2 mg2 no3 cl and so4 2 exhibited negligible influence on tap degradation while the tap degradation efficiency decreased with the addition of sio3 2 co3 2 hco3 and po4 3 which might be attributed to the increased ph caused by the hydrolysis of these anions rezaei and vione 2018 the ph of the solution raised to 10 7 8 6 10 8 and 11 4 in the presence of 2 0 mmol l 1 carbonate bicarbonate silicate and phosphate respectively we did not adjust the initial ph to 6 6 when evaluating the impact of these ions because that will greatly change the distribution forms of these ions for instance at ph 6 6 most of the carbonate added will transform to bicarbonate regarding the h2co3 pka of 6 38 and 10 25 ha competed with tap for reactive oxygen species and inhibited the tap degradation but tap could still be completely removed within 60 min these results indicated that the heterogeneous fenton reaction with oa zvibm exhibited good performance for tap degradation in the presence of various co existing ions and nom furthermore the environmental water sample was collected from nanhu lake in wuhan city 30 30 9 n 114 21 10 e to evaluate the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction the lake water was used without further treatment except the addition of tap as shown in fig s13 negligible tap was degraded in the zvibm h2o2 system the degradation of tap by the zvibm h2o2 system in lake water was slower than that with pure water and consistent with the results of ha coexistence nevertheless more than 96 tap degradation could still be achieved within 30 min therefore it could demonstrate the robustness and the practical application potential of oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction to evaluate the removal performance of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction for other antibiotics we selected chloramphenicol cap metronidazole mnz tinidazole tnz and sulfadimidine sm2 to test their degradation in the oa zvibm h2o2 and zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reactions and the results were shown in fig s14 all four antibiotics could be almost completely degraded within 20 min in the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction but were seldomly removed by the zvibm h2o2 reaction therefore the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction could effectively remove a variety of antibiotics from water moreover the stability of oa zvibm during the successive runs were also investigated the sem images of zvibm fig s15a s15b and oa zvibm fig s15c s15d after heterogeneous fenton reaction revealed that the surfaces after reaction were covered by fragments indicating the oxidation of zvi xrd patterns of oa zvibm after reaction indicated the constant decreasing trend of fe0 diffraction peak intensities along with recycling time fig s16 but no peaks assigned to iron oxides could be observed which might be attributed to the consumption of fe0 and the amorphous structure of the oxidation products respectively fe 2p xps profiles of oa zvibm samples collected after the successive fenton reactions revealed the peak attributed to fe0 disappeared as successive experiments proceeded fig 6 a hu et al 2020 although the content of surface fe ii decreased significantly from 45 54 to 17 09 after the initial 2 cycles due to the diffusion and oxidation by h2o2 it was interesting that the fe ii ratio kept almost constant at ca 19 during the following cycles suggesting that the surface bounded fe ii could be effectively regenerated via the proton driven fe0 oxidation thereby maintained the outstanding fenton reactivity throughout the long term experiments fig 6b huang et al 2021 yuan et al 2018 the 57fe mössbauer spectra of oa zvibm before and after the fenton reaction were also monitored and the proportion of fec2o4 2h2o only decreased from 1 9 to 1 7 suggesting the stability of the fec2o4 2h2o shell during the reaction fig 6c hu et al 2020 we speculated that the stability of fec2o4 2h2o may be a dynamic equilibrium i e the surface bound ferrous ions dissolved and diffused into the solution and then the ferrous ions produced by the inner iron core recombined with the surface oxalate to form new fec2o4 2h2o this may be similar with the mechanism raised by previous reports katz et al 2012 yanina and rosso 2008 where the electron of inner ferrous ions could be transfer through iron hydr oxides shell to the outer ferric ions resulting in the regeneration of surface bound ferrous ions nevertheless more investigation should be made in the future to clarify the exact mechanism of the stable fec2o4 2h2o shell 4 conclusions in summary we synthesized zero valent iron with a high proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell by ball milling and achieved highly efficient heterogeneous fenton reactivity oa zvibm h2o2 to degrade tap with outstanding stability and wide ph range the oa zvibm possessed abundant surface fe ii which instantly released to solution and initiated the fenton reaction with the hydrolysis of resulting fe iii to cause the ph decrease the decreased solution ph and the high proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell of oa zvibm further promoted the transfer of protons to fe0 core and its corrosion releasing more fe ii for h2o2 activation protons then would be re generated via the hydrolysis of fe iii and ph would be maintained at acidic condition when the consumption and generation of proton were close to equilibrium the ph self adapting ability accelerated proton cycle and the sufficient re generation of surface fe ii rendered the oa zvibm as a durable heterogeneous fenton catalyst that was resistant to the interference of water matrices therefore the oa zvibm h2o2 represents a promising technique for the pre oxidation or the advanced treatment of refractory wastewater nevertheless the detailed reacting mechanism of the oa zvibm is still ambiguous at this moment for instance the release process of ferrous across the fec2o4 2h2o shell besides kinetic modeling of the proton transfer process is necessary de souza et al 2020 vialich et al 2022 in

14859,heterogeneous fenton reactions of zero valent iron zvi requires the sufficient release of fe ii to catalyze the h2o2 decomposition however the rate limiting step of proton transfer through the passivation layer of zvi restricted the fe ii release via fe0 core corrosion herein we modified the shell of zvi with highly proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o by ball milling oa zvibm and demonstrated its high heterogeneous fenton performance of thiamphenicol tap removal with 500 times enhancement of the rate constant more importantly the oa zvibm h2o2 showed little attenuation of the fenton activity during 13 successive cycles and was applicable across a wide ph range of 3 5 9 5 interestingly the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction showed ph self adapting ability which initially reduced and then sustained the solution ph in the range of 3 5 5 2 the abundant intrinsic surface fe ii of oa zvibm 45 54 vs 27 52 in zvibm according to fe 2p xps profiles was oxidized by h2o2 and hydrolyzed to generate protons and the fec2o4 2h2o shell favored the fast transfer of protons to inner fe0 therefore the consumption regeneration cycle of protons were accelerated to drove the production of fe ii for fenton reactions demonstrated by the more prominent h2 evolution and nearly 100 h2o2 decomposition by oa zvibm furthermore the fec2o4 2h2o shell was stable and slightly decreased from 1 9 to 1 7 after the fenton reaction this study clarified the significance of proton transfer on the reactivity of zvi and provided an efficient strategy to achieve the highly efficient and robust heterogeneous fenton reaction of zvi for pollution control graphical abstract the proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell accelerates the cycle of h and the heterogeneous fenton reaction of oa zvibm h2o2 image graphical abstract keywords zero valent iron oxalic acid heterogeneous fenton reaction proton transfer thiamphenicol data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the strong reducibility inexpensiveness easy manufacture convenient storage and transportation as well as environmental benignancy endowed zvi with great potential in catalyzing heterogeneous fenton reactions basically ferrous species including both the soluble fe2 and the surface bounded fe ii were essential for h2o2 activation during heterogeneous fenton reactions he et al 2016b rezaei and vione 2018 xu et al 2017 generally ferrous species would generate from the oxidation of zvi in water eq 1 he et al 2016a among which the proton played vital roles stoichiometrically protons were consumed by fe0 and fe ii eqs 1 2 but equal molar protons could be regenerated by fe iii reactions via eqs 3 4 therefore the protons should undergo effective cycling accompanied by the continuous transformation of iron species fe0 fe ii fe iii fe oh 3 as well as the electron transfer and h2o2 activation however conventional zvi materials were always passivated due to the intrinsic iron hydr oxides shell which would significantly restrict the transport of protons from solution to fe core hu et al 2020 thereby kinetically governed the generation rate of fe ii and the subsequent fenton activity which were modeled by the previous reports of zanoelo et al de souza et al 2020 vialich et al 2022 their results as well as many other reports chen et al 2021 donadelli et al 2020 donadelli et al 2018 he et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 wang and tang 2021 suggested the heterogeneous fenton reactivity of zvi was highly ph dependent which attenuated sharply with the increase of ph to circumneutral conditions since the poor proton conductivity of the hydr oxides layer required the driving force of high proton concentrations to achieve sufficient access of proton to the inner fe core alowitz and scherer 2002 apparently the need of adjusting acidic ph conditions would greatly restrict the application of zvi heterogeneous fenton reactions for water treatment and pollution control therefore strategies are urgently desired to tackle this problem 1 f e 0 2 h fe ii h 2 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh oh 3 fe iii 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 4 2 fe iii h 2 o 2 2 fe ii o 2 2 h over the past decades much effort has been done to destroy the passivation layer and to accelerate the reactivity of iron core including ultrasonic treatment liu et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 weak magnetic jiang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 acid washing lin and lin 2017 ma et al 2016 bimetallic galvanic cell cao et al 2014 cwiertny et al 2007 and surface chemical modification cai et al 2021 garcia et al 2021 hu et al 2021 jia et al 2018 li et al 2017 liao et al 2021 malik et al 2021 xu et al 2021 nevertheless these methods did not regard the key problem in poor proton conductivity of zvi passivation layer as the rate limiting factor of zvi heterogeneous fenton reactions therefore to enhance the proton conductivity of zvi shell may be a much more straight forward and effective strategy in 2009 yamada et al reported that ferrous oxalate dihydrate fec2o4 2h2o possessed extremely high proton conductivity of 1 3 ms cm 1 comparable with that of nafion film yamada et al 2009 therefore by chemically modifying the composition of zvi shell with fec2o4 2h2o may improve the proton conductivity which will then accelerate the proton cycle fe ii release and the subsequent fenton reactivity recently our group successfully fabricated the zvi with fec2o4 2h2o shell via mechanically ball milling the mixture of zvi and oxalic acid dihydrate oa denoted as oa zvibm which showed remarkable cr vi removal capacity hu et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to expect the good performance of oa zvibm in heterogeneous fenton reactions but this remains unexplored herein we systematically investigated the heterogeneous fenton reactivity of oa zvibm and the counterpart ball milled zvi zvibm with a typical antibiotic thiamphenicol tap used as the model contaminant owing to its wide application and frequent detection azzouz et al 2011 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 xie et al 2018 by comparing the tap degradation efficiencies the ph profiles the iron leaching and transformation the proton conductivity and electron donating capacity of the zvi samples we evaluated the impact of oxalic acid modification on the heterogeneous fenton reaction and interestingly revealed the proton self adapting ability of the oa zvibm h2o2 system which reduced the solution ph to weak acidic conditions that were conducive for the fenton reaction and then steadily maintained the ph throughout the long term reaction we proposed the mechanism of accelerated proton cycling driven iron oxidation and heterogeneous fenton reaction in the oa zvibm h2o2 system the reactive oxygen species ros and tap degradation pathways were also investigated and the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 system were also evaluated by assessing the long term performance stability of oa zvibm and the impact of co existing water constituents 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials detailed information of the chemicals used were provided in text s1 of the supplementary materials 2 2 synthesis of zvibm and oa zvibm samples zvibm and oa zvibm were prepared by the ball milling method as previously reported hu et al 2020 typically 5 6 g of commercial iron powder was mixed with different amounts of oxalic acid dihydrate oa 0 063 g 0 126 g and 0 252 g to achieve oa fe molar ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 respectively after 4 h of ball milling the obtained samples were washed with water and absolute ethanol dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h and stored in a vacuum bag for subsequent characterization and use the samples were denoted as oa zvibm meanwhile the control sample of zvibm was also prepared under the same conditions without the addition of oxalic acid dihydrate detailed information of the ball milling was presented in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 3 characterization of the materials detailed information of the materials characterization results was presented in text s3 of the supplementary materials 2 4 batch experiments of tap degradation in a typical tap degradation experiment 0 05 g of zvibm or oa zvibm powder and 27 2 μl h2o2 30 wt were added into a conical flask containing 50 ml of tap solution 20 mg l 1 without ph adjustment to initiate the heterogeneous fenton reaction the initial ph of the tap solution was 6 6 the reaction flasks were placed on an orbital shaker with 200 rpm at 22 c during the degradation process 1 ml of the solution was sampled at regular intervals and then filtrated by 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter the nylon filter membrane was rinsed with tap solution and the adsorption of tap has been saturated before using subsequently 0 9 ml sample was mixed with 0 1 ml ethanol to terminate the fenton reaction meanwhile we also evaluated the tap degradation efficiency at different initial ph values ranged from 3 5 to 10 5 adjusted by naoh 1 mol l 1 or h2so4 1 mol l 1 for the multiple cycles of tap degradation reactions 5 ml tap stock solution 0 2 g l 1 2 ml deionized water and 27 2 μl h2o2 30 wt were supplemented into the conical flask at the end of each fenton cycle when the initial tap was completely removed the tap concentrations were monitored with the high performance liquid chromatography hplc method with the details described in text s4 all the experiments were repeated three times to investigate the effect of fe ii 1 10 phenanthroline was added to complex fe ii before the tap degradation to verify the roles of different reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments were conducted with the details described in text s4 to analyze the influences of coexisting ions and natural organic matter nom on tap degradation various ions and humic acid ha were added according to the published literatures liao et al 2021 typically the initial concentrations used were 0 01 g l 1 ha 2 mmol l 1 kno3 na2co3 nahco3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 respectively 2 5 analytical and statistical methods details of the analytical methods were presented in text s4 of the supplementary materials pearson statistics were performed with the origin 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of oa zvibm the as fabricated zvibm and oa zvibm samples were firstly characterized sem images showed that zvibm particles were relatively smooth fig s1 a b whereas the surface of oa zvibm was rougher with smaller particle diameters fig s1 c d xrd patterns only showed two peaks at 44 6 and 64 8 attributed to crystalline α fe jcpds file no 1 1262 iron without any signs of oa or fec2o4 2h2o fig s2a indicating no significant change of the crystal structure of zvi after the ball milling process ftir spectra showed the peaks ascribed to fec2o4 2h2o in oa zvibm fig s2b suggesting the successful modification of zvi surface with fec2o4 2h2o by ball milling details of ftir analysis were provided in text s5 hu et al 2020 57fe mössbauer spectroscopies were further utilized to quantify the phase compositions of zvibm and oa zvibm fig s2c and s2d and the corresponding parameters were summarized in tables s1 and s2 the proportions of components including fe0 fe2o3 and fec2o4 2h2o were calculated according to the area of each component suggesting 97 8 fe0 core and 2 2 fe2o3 shell in zvibm whereas oa zvibm contained 95 9 fe0 2 1 fe2o3 and 1 9 fec2o4 2h2o further confirming the successful fabrication of oa zvibm with fec2o4 2h2o shell tables s1 s2 3 2 performance of the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction we prepared oa zvibm with different oa contents and examined their heterogeneous fenton reactivities toward tap degradation at the ambient temperature without adjusting the initial solution ph as shown in fig 1 a only 2 of tap was removed within 20 min in the control experiment of zvibm h2o2 whereas the tap degradation efficiencies of the oa zvibm h2o2 reactions elevated along with increasing oa contents and tap was completely removed when the molar ratio of oa fe reached 2 the kinetics analysis illustrated that all the tap degradation curves obeyed the pseudo first order model and the apparent rate constants were 7 74 10 5 3 81 10 3 1 44 10 2 and 4 21 10 1 min 1 for zvibm h2o2 oa zvibm h2o2 with 0 5 1 0 and 2 oa fe molar ratios respectively fig 1b considering that the specific surface area ssa of zvi might affect the heterogeneous fenton performance we measured the ssa of both zvibm and oa zvibm referred to the sample prepared with 2 oa molar ratio hereafter with the n2 adsorption desorption and the brunauer emmett teller bet isotherm fig s3 the ssa of zvibm and oa zvibm were 0 997 and 9 263 m2 g 1 and the ssa normalized tap degradation rate constants in the zvibm h2o2 and oa zvibm h2o2 fenton systems were 7 74 10 5 g min 1 m 2 and 4 54 10 2 g min 1 m 2 respectively indicating that oa zvibm significantly enhanced the tap degradation by nearly 500 times the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide during the heterogeneous fenton experiments were determined with tioso4 method to further demonstrate the high reactivity of oa zvibm experiments details were presented in text s6 of the supplementary materials ruales lonfat et al 2014 wang et al 2021 as shown in fig s4 negligible hydrogen peroxide was decomposed in the zvibm h2o2 system whereas the hydrogen peroxide was almost completely decomposed within 20 min in the oa zvibm h2o2 system this was consistent with the higher fenton performance of oa zvibm h2o2 as the durability of the h2o2 activator was critical in heterogeneous fenton reactions we evaluated the recycling performance of oa zvibm in tap degradation by feeding fresh tap and h2o2 at the end of each 20 min cycle impressively oa zvibm exhibited excellent durability in catalyzing the heterogeneous fenton reaction showing no obvious attenuation of tap removal efficiencies even in the 13th successive experiment 240 260 min 1 although the efficiency of tap degradation decreased gradually thereafter the tap degradation percentage still reached 80 even after 15 successive experiments the decreased performance may be due to the gradual depletion of oa zvibm on the contrary the zvibm h2o2 reaction always showed negligible tap removal efficiencies during the recycling experiments fig 1c therefore the oa zvibm is a promising heterogeneous fenton catalyst with outstanding activity and durability the heterogeneous fenton performance of oa zvibm h2o2 was also evaluated at different initial ph values the counterpart zvibm h2o2 reaction only showed significant tap removal at acidic conditions with about 100 35 and 8 tap degraded within 60 min at the initial ph of 3 5 4 5 and 5 5 respectively and the tap removal efficiencies were negligible above ph 5 5 fig 2 a these results were consistent with previous reports chen et al 2021 donadelli et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 indicating that high proton concentrations were desired to achieve the effective fe core corrosion eq 1 due to the restricted transport of proton through the passivation layer of zvibm surprisingly the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton systems exhibited much higher tap removal performance over the wide initial ph range of 3 5 9 5 with 100 tap degraded in 60 min and the lower initial ph also facilitated the tap degradation e g 100 removal of tap only took 2 min at the initial ph of 3 5 in the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction fig 2b the 60 min tap degradation efficiency at the initial ph 10 5 significantly decreased to 18 possibly because the accelerated generation of iron hydroxyl oxides which shall deposit on the surface of oa zvibm and inhibit h2o2 adsorption and activation rezaei and vione 2018 these results revealed that oa zvibm could serve as the robust heterogeneous fenton catalyst to deal with wastewater of wide ph ranges besides the wide ph adaptation of oa zvibm h2o2 suggested its strong proton utilizing ability probably thanks to the high proton conductivity of the fec2o4 2h2o shell which allowed the fast diffusion of proton to fe core for fe ii production to catalyze the fenton reaction this assumption will be demonstrated in the following parts 3 3 mechanism of the oa zvibm h2o2 fenton reaction regarding the essential role of proton in fe0 corrosion and fenton reaction we monitored the ph values during the heterogeneous fenton reactions surprisingly the solution ph in the oa zvibm h2o2 system sharply decreased from the initial 6 6 to ca 4 2 within 2 min of reaction and maintained thereafter until 80 min then decreased gradually to ca 3 6 until 200 min on the contrary the solution ph of the zvibm h2o2 system only slightly decreased to 6 3 at 2 min and then gradually increased back to 6 9 with prolonged reaction time fig 3 a these results indicated that the oa zvibm h2o2 system could achieve the real time and persistent regulation of solution ph to the appropriate acidic range for heterogeneous fenton reactions to confirm this hypothesis we monitored the trend of ph values during oa zvibm h2o2 reactions by employing different initial solution ph the zvibm h2o2 system can only decrease the solution ph at initial ph values higher than 6 5 for instance to reduce the ph from 10 5 9 5 8 5 and 7 5 to 7 9 7 4 7 1 and 7 0 respectively it was possibly due to the weak acidity of hydrogen peroxide pka 11 62 and the proton of hydrogen peroxide may be consumed by hydroxyl ions at alkaline condition abbot and brown 1990 špalek et al 1982 moreover we monitored the ph variation by adding only h2o2 without zvibm and the results fig s5 showed that the ph variation trends were consistent with those in the zvibm h2o2 system fig 3b therefore h2o2 was responsible for the decrease of ph in zvibm h2o2 system at alkaline conditions when the initial ph was below 6 5 negligible ph decrease was observed in the zvibm h2o2 reaction fig 3b impressively the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction significantly reduced the solution ph except for the case of initial ph 3 5 besides the solution ph could be maintained in the range of 3 5 5 2 during the heterogeneous fenton reactions fig 3c the exception was that with the initial ph of 10 5 the solution ph slowly decreased to 7 5 which was responsible for its poor tap removal performance in fig 2b this ph self adapting ability of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction shall offer great advantages during the water treatment processes the hydrogen evolution experiments of zvibm and oa zvibm were conducted to further demonstrate the high proton conductivity and proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm in aqueous reactions the details of experiments were presented in text s7 of the supplementary materials the results were shown in fig s6 negligible hydrogen was produced by zvibm and the hydrogen production by oa zvibm increased with time with 17 5 μmol produced within 2 h therefore the higher hydrogen producing capacity of oa zvibm than zvibm further demonstrated the high proton conductivity and proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm in aqueous reactions to elucidate the cause of the fast decrease of ph at the beginning stage of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction we monitored the leaching of iron ions during the heterogeneous fenton reactions since the consumption and re generation of proton were closely related with the conversion of iron species e g the hydrolysis of fe iii and the reduction of fe iii by h2o2 are supposed to cause the release of h and the decrease of ph eqs 3 4 as expected the iron dissolution of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction was much more significant than the case of zvibm h2o2 control the released iron was dominated by the dissolved fe iii whose concentrations were in the range of 0 16 0 36 mmol l 1 and basically increased with the prolonged reacting duration the concentration of dissolved fe ii was 0 058 mmol l 1 at 5 min and gradually decreased to ca 0 024 mmol l 1 after 200 min fig 4 a on the contrary the zvibm h2o2 reaction released only 0 01 mmol l 1 ferric ions and negligible ferrous ions fig 4c besides in the absence of h2o2 the oa zvibm h2o system gradually released 0 17 mmol l 1 fe ii during the first 20 min and then decreased to 0 022 mmol l 1 but without significant increase of fe iii concentrations fig 4b indicating that the released fe ii may undergo re adsorption on the surface of oa zvibm or involved with the generation of fe ii bearing corrosion products hu et al 2020 nevertheless both ferric ions and ferrous ions were negligible at the concentration below 0 005 mmol l 1 for zvibm in the absence of h2o2 fig 4d these results indicated that h2o2 played essential role in the fast oxidation of fe ii to fe iii eq 2 which further hydrolyzed to cause the ph decrease as also evidenced by the less extent of ph downfall in the absence of h2o2 fig 3a however the initial release of iron ions should not stem from the oxidation of fe0 eq 1 because we did not observe the increase of ph therefore the iron release in the initial step should be due to the dissolution of the intrinsic surface bound iron ions according to the results of fig s7 the oa zvibm contained much more surface fe ii 45 54 that may be produced during the ball mill process with oa when compared with the case 27 52 of zvibm therefore could immediately leach plenty of fe ii into solution which then oxidized and hydrolyzed to cause the fast decrease of ph to the acidic range to demonstrate this control experiments were conducted by adding 0 17 mmol l 1 feso4 7h2o or fec2o4 2h2o to the h2o2 solution the ph of feso4 7h2o h2o2 system sharply decreased to about 3 5 in 2 min and keep constant thereafter the ph of fec2o4 2h2o h2o2 system decreased more slowly to about 4 7 fig s8 we analyzed the cause of slower ph change in fec2o4 2h2o h2o2 system as follows one reason is the lower solubility of fec2o4 2h2o than that of feso4 7h2o therefore the fec2o4 2h2o dissolved much more slowly resulting in lower concentrations of ferrous ions which hydrolyzed to generate fewer protons besides oxalate possibly complexed with the generated fe iii leaving less unsaturated sites for oh coordination to decrease the ph keenan and sedlak 2008 suter et al 1988 since the iron released by oa zvibm may contain both free fe ii and oxalate chelated fe ii the fall of ph to 4 2 was reasonable to evaluate the contribution of initial ph decrease to the enhanced tap degradation in oa zvibm h2o2 we adjusted the initial ph of zvibm h2o2 to 4 1 with sulfuric acid sa and oa and the solution ph remained almost constant throughout the 20 min reactions fig s9a however only 8 and 3 of tap were degraded with sa and oa fig s9b therefore the high performance of oa zvibm h2o2 was not only due to the initial decrease of solution ph besides the contribution of the leaching oa from the oa zvibm which might complex with iron ions was also ruled out because of the even poorer tap degradation with oa than with sa these results were consistent with fig 2a and further suggested our hypothesis that the higher proton utilizing ability of oa zvibm may play essential roles to confirm we first characterized the proton conductivity σ of the oa zvibm sample since σ is inversely proportional to impedance rm bureekaew et al 2010 hu et al 2020 we monitored the impedance of zvibm and oa zvibm the semicircle diameter of the zvibm eis was much larger than that of oa zvibm fig 5 a hence the impedance of oa zvibm sample was much lower than that of zvibm suggesting that protons could more easily transfer through the fec2o4 2h2o shell moreover as the proton induced corrosion of fe0 was always accompanied with the electron transfer process we further employed the tafel scan to characterize the electron transfer ability of zvibm and oa zvibm samples as shown in fig 5b the self corrosion potentials of zvibm and oa zvibm were 0 43 v and 0 83 v with the maximum self corrosion current of 10 5 09 a and 10 4 55 a respectively these results implied that oa zvibm was more likely to donate electrons consistent with its high proton conductive shell based on the above results the mechanism of the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction could be proposed fig 5c stage i due to the more surface confined fe ii of oa zvibm produced during the ball milling process oa zvibm released plenty of fe ii to the solution at the starting stage of reaction and the fe ii was instantly oxidized by h2o2 via eq 2 to fe iii which underwent hydrolysis eq 4 protons were consumed during eq 2 and re generated by eq 4 and the net increase of proton was 2 moles per molar fe ii consumption stage ii the increased proton concentrations in the solution further promoted the diffusion of protons across the zvi shell to fe0 core which was proposed to be the rate limiting step of the zvi h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction the high proton conductivity of the fec2o4 2h2o shell greatly accelerated this process and the subsequent fe0 oxidation eq 1 consumption of protons which released abundant fe ii to catalyze the fenton reaction eq 2 consumption of protons for tap degradation the generated fe iii then re generate the protons eq 4 remarkably the oa zvibm h2o2 could first decrease the ph to more conducive conditions because the weak acidity could accelerate the corrosion of zvi to generate more ferrous species for h2o2 activation and keep ferrous species from precipitation li et al 2014 liang and guo 2010 besides oa zvibm h2o2 effectively maintained the cycling of protons accompanied by the successive oxidation of fe0 to fe ii and then fe iii for fenton oxidation of tap both stages were necessary to achieve the high heterogeneous fenton reaction performance this effective cycle could not be achieved by the zvibm h2o2 system because 1 the intrinsic surface fe ii was minor thus cannot mediate the decrease of ph at the starting stage of reaction 2 the proton conductivity of the zvibm shell was poor to impede the transport and utilization of protons from the outer solution to further confirm the proposed mechanism the correlation between proton concentrations leached fe ii and fe iii concentrations were analyzed by using the pearson statistical method all the relevant data in zvibm h2o oa zvibm h2o zvibm h2o2 and oa zvibm h2o2 reactions conducted with the initial ph of 6 6 were included in the statistical analysis the results indicated that the proton concentration was highly correlated with ferric ions concentration in all situations r 0 997 p 0 001 but neither the proton concentration nor the ferric ions concentration were correlated with the ferrous ions concentration fig 5d these results proved the proton generation pathway of ferric hydrolysis in the zvi heterogeneous fenton systems 3 4 mechanism of tap degradation and robustness of oa zvibm h2o2 scavenging experiments were conducted to reveal the dominant reactive oxygen species for tap degradation we applied etoh tba 1 10 phenanthroline phen to scavenge oh and fe iv oh and ferrous ions li et al 2022 lin and lin 2017 wang et al 2020 as shown in fig s10a the tap degradation was almost completely inhibited with the addition of etoh tba and phen implying the dominant roles of oh and ferrous ions wang et al 2020 besides phen inhibited the oxidation of fe ii by h2o2 because of the strong chelation of fe ii and prevented the ph decrease fig s10b further demonstrating the mechanism proposed epr spectra analysis was also carried out to confirm the reactive oxygen species by using dmpo as a spin trapping agent li et al 2022 no obvious epr signal was obtained in the zvibm h2o2 system fig s10c however the dmpo oh adduct appeared in the oa zvibm h2o2 system fig s10d ling et al 2021 shi et al 2020 therefore it could be concluded that oh was the dominant ros for tap degradation to probe the pathways of tap degradation by oa zvibm h2o2 we identified the degradation intermediates of tap by hplc ms ms as shown in fig s11 5 intermediates were detected including the dechlorination product of tap p the branch chain oxidized products of tap p p1 p4 and the methanesulfonic acid p5 due to the strong oxidizing properties of oh the molecular structure of tap was severely destroyed chu et al 2016 kong et al 2015 and we proposed the possible degradation pathways of tap in the oa zvibm h2o2 scheme 1 liu et al 2015 marciniec et al 2010 to evaluate the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction for real water treatment the effects of coexisting ions and natural organic matter nom on tap degradation were investigated qiao et al 2018 typical coexisting ions including ca2 mg2 no3 cl so4 2 sio3 2 co3 2 hco3 po4 3 and ha were added as shown in fig s12 ca2 mg2 no3 cl and so4 2 exhibited negligible influence on tap degradation while the tap degradation efficiency decreased with the addition of sio3 2 co3 2 hco3 and po4 3 which might be attributed to the increased ph caused by the hydrolysis of these anions rezaei and vione 2018 the ph of the solution raised to 10 7 8 6 10 8 and 11 4 in the presence of 2 0 mmol l 1 carbonate bicarbonate silicate and phosphate respectively we did not adjust the initial ph to 6 6 when evaluating the impact of these ions because that will greatly change the distribution forms of these ions for instance at ph 6 6 most of the carbonate added will transform to bicarbonate regarding the h2co3 pka of 6 38 and 10 25 ha competed with tap for reactive oxygen species and inhibited the tap degradation but tap could still be completely removed within 60 min these results indicated that the heterogeneous fenton reaction with oa zvibm exhibited good performance for tap degradation in the presence of various co existing ions and nom furthermore the environmental water sample was collected from nanhu lake in wuhan city 30 30 9 n 114 21 10 e to evaluate the robustness of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction the lake water was used without further treatment except the addition of tap as shown in fig s13 negligible tap was degraded in the zvibm h2o2 system the degradation of tap by the zvibm h2o2 system in lake water was slower than that with pure water and consistent with the results of ha coexistence nevertheless more than 96 tap degradation could still be achieved within 30 min therefore it could demonstrate the robustness and the practical application potential of oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction to evaluate the removal performance of the oa zvibm h2o2 reaction for other antibiotics we selected chloramphenicol cap metronidazole mnz tinidazole tnz and sulfadimidine sm2 to test their degradation in the oa zvibm h2o2 and zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reactions and the results were shown in fig s14 all four antibiotics could be almost completely degraded within 20 min in the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction but were seldomly removed by the zvibm h2o2 reaction therefore the oa zvibm h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction could effectively remove a variety of antibiotics from water moreover the stability of oa zvibm during the successive runs were also investigated the sem images of zvibm fig s15a s15b and oa zvibm fig s15c s15d after heterogeneous fenton reaction revealed that the surfaces after reaction were covered by fragments indicating the oxidation of zvi xrd patterns of oa zvibm after reaction indicated the constant decreasing trend of fe0 diffraction peak intensities along with recycling time fig s16 but no peaks assigned to iron oxides could be observed which might be attributed to the consumption of fe0 and the amorphous structure of the oxidation products respectively fe 2p xps profiles of oa zvibm samples collected after the successive fenton reactions revealed the peak attributed to fe0 disappeared as successive experiments proceeded fig 6 a hu et al 2020 although the content of surface fe ii decreased significantly from 45 54 to 17 09 after the initial 2 cycles due to the diffusion and oxidation by h2o2 it was interesting that the fe ii ratio kept almost constant at ca 19 during the following cycles suggesting that the surface bounded fe ii could be effectively regenerated via the proton driven fe0 oxidation thereby maintained the outstanding fenton reactivity throughout the long term experiments fig 6b huang et al 2021 yuan et al 2018 the 57fe mössbauer spectra of oa zvibm before and after the fenton reaction were also monitored and the proportion of fec2o4 2h2o only decreased from 1 9 to 1 7 suggesting the stability of the fec2o4 2h2o shell during the reaction fig 6c hu et al 2020 we speculated that the stability of fec2o4 2h2o may be a dynamic equilibrium i e the surface bound ferrous ions dissolved and diffused into the solution and then the ferrous ions produced by the inner iron core recombined with the surface oxalate to form new fec2o4 2h2o this may be similar with the mechanism raised by previous reports katz et al 2012 yanina and rosso 2008 where the electron of inner ferrous ions could be transfer through iron hydr oxides shell to the outer ferric ions resulting in the regeneration of surface bound ferrous ions nevertheless more investigation should be made in the future to clarify the exact mechanism of the stable fec2o4 2h2o shell 4 conclusions in summary we synthesized zero valent iron with a high proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell by ball milling and achieved highly efficient heterogeneous fenton reactivity oa zvibm h2o2 to degrade tap with outstanding stability and wide ph range the oa zvibm possessed abundant surface fe ii which instantly released to solution and initiated the fenton reaction with the hydrolysis of resulting fe iii to cause the ph decrease the decreased solution ph and the high proton conductive fec2o4 2h2o shell of oa zvibm further promoted the transfer of protons to fe0 core and its corrosion releasing more fe ii for h2o2 activation protons then would be re generated via the hydrolysis of fe iii and ph would be maintained at acidic condition when the consumption and generation of proton were close to equilibrium the ph self adapting ability accelerated proton cycle and the sufficient re generation of surface fe ii rendered the oa zvibm as a durable heterogeneous fenton catalyst that was resistant to the interference of water matrices therefore the oa zvibm h2o2 represents a promising technique for the pre oxidation or the advanced treatment of refractory wastewater nevertheless the detailed reacting mechanism of the oa zvibm is still ambiguous at this moment for instance the release process of ferrous across the fec2o4 2h2o shell besides kinetic modeling of the proton transfer process is necessary de souza et al 2020 vialich et al 2022 in future studies to quantitively reveal the role of fec2o4 2h2o shell in breaking through this rate limiting step of the heterogeneous fenton reaction declaration of competing interest the authors
