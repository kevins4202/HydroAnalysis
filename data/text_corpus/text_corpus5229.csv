26145,water quality models wqms can be difficult to calibrate due to the complexity and heteroscedasticity of model errors with the aim to address error heteroscedasticity and produce more accurate and reliable probabilistic predictions this research develops a framework for improved uncertainty analysis and bayesian inference of wqms in the context of total suspended solids tss models along with error formulations applying data transformations in traditional time space we introduce an error model based on flow corrected time in which clock time is expanded during high values and compressed during low values the results for four case study catchments show that proper data transformation can change the calibration emphasis on the parts of interest which can modify the simulation reliability and improve the accuracy of critical condition judgments overall this data transformation framework can help to select appropriate residual error models for water resource models and associated water quality predictions keywords total suspended solids bayesian inference residual error box cox transformation flow corrected time log sinh transformation 1 introduction in the last decade considerable attention has been given to the analysis and simulation of water quality variables total suspended solids tss as a measure of water clarity is commonly used to assess water quality deterioration because suspended solids exert an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems tss block sunlight and subsequently decrease photosynthesis of hydrophytes bilotta and brazier 2008 what is more solids absorb more heat than water and an aquatic environment with higher temperature can hold less dissolved oxygen do upsetting the balance of the water ecosystem bilotta and brazier 2008 suspended solids can also serve as a carrier of pollutants such as phosphorus russell et al 1998 mercury heavy metals dawson and macklin 1998 and hydrophobic organic compounds above all high tss indicates potential water quality hazards in any water body sound water management needs precise predictions of tss loads or concentrations when observations are infrequent recently the build up wash off model bwmod has been widely applied to simulate tss transport at the catchment scale liu et al 2010 shaw et al 2010 hossain et al 2012 sikorska et al 2015 bonhomme and petrucci 2017 this model imitates two natural processes that the sediments are built up in a dry period and washed off by the runoff in a wet period many studies have focused on how to improve the expressions of these two processes and how to aggregate different land uses for a whole catchment response bonhomme and petrucci 2017 hossain et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015 however an additional concern is the uncertainty associated with the model processes and prediction the bwmod structure exhibits complex uncertainty arising from structural uncertainty due to an oversimple model structure for simulating tss generation observation uncertainty caused by the weak representativeness of the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow and sediments in the river and parametric uncertainty due to the difficulties in identifying model parameters sikorska et al 2015 evaluating bwmod reliability needs proper acknowledgment of the model uncertainty and its characteristics bayesian inference can address uncertainty estimation in the process of parameter calibration and has been extensively applied in the field of hydrology kuczera 1983 bates and campbell 2001 montanari et al 2009 kuczera and parent 1998 but in tss modeling uncertainty analysis is still in its infancy tss modeling suffers more complex uncertainties than in hydrologic modeling the release of sediments is less identifiable than runoff generation schmelter et al 2011 similarly tss data are generally rare and may not be representative of the pollutants dynamics throughout the overall water system ashley et al 2004 kanso et al 2006 tss data indicates a higher variability than streamflow in space and time cheviron et al 2014 model complexity and data limitations increase the uncertainties of the bwmod output such difficulties also arise in specifying an appropriate bayesian framework for inference of water quality models such as bwmod any bayesian approach to parameter inference requires specification of the model likelihood function which assumes the model errors can be characterised by a parametric probability distribution one of the most commonly made assumptions is that they are independent and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with zero mean and a constant variance however model residual errors are often correlated and nonstationary not just in the hydrologic field kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 but also in water quality modeling beck 1987 non stationarity is an additional common form of heteroscedasticity to solve this problem data transformations are commonly used aimed at transforming non gaussian distributions of observed and predicted responses to near gaussian shape before applying constant variance error model such data transformations as the logarithmic log and box cox transformation which have had promising results in hydrologic modeling bates and campbell 2001 kuczera 1983 mclnerney et al 2017 morawietz et al 2011 smith et al 2015 recently wang et al 2012 explored the ability of the log sinh transformation in tempering the explosive growth in error variance for hydrologic applications and in this situation its performance is superior to the box cox transformation these transformations were only systematically examined and compared in the hydrologic field mclnerney et al 2017 their suitability for heteroscedastic water quality errors such as in simulating tss is not widely known in addition to this data transformations typically focus on the data domain more recently a new time transformation referred to as the flow corrected time fct transformation has been suggested for improved calibration of hydrologic models smith et al 2014 the approach attempts to transform the data from the traditional clock time with a uniform time interval to so called flow time in which the time interval is expanded during high values and compressed during low values to address the assumption of time invariance and constant volume by implicitly adding more weight in the time period with larger hydrologic flux fct transformation can produce a better fit for peak simulations and worsen the performance when the low value events are of interest smith et al 2014 the fct approach then holds promise specifically for water quality models where the probability of exceeding a certain water quality threshold is frequently of interest in the model s application rather than low values applying a heteroscedasticity transformation in fct space has not been considered in previous research for hydrologic or water quality models examining the potential of this combination in the scope of tss simulations is the main objective of this study applying these transformations necessitates rebuilding the residual error model the likelihood function in bayesian calibration thus starting from fulfilling the error s assumption aiming to establish robust approaches with data transformations for improving tss simulation the specific aims in this study can be summarised as follows 1 modify the likelihood function within the context of each data transformation 2 compare systematically the impacts of different data transformations to tss prediction across various metrics for measuring the model performance especially considering their influences in fct space 3 build a stepwise approach to likelihood selection to help to choose the most suitable likelihood function for not only tss prediction but also other models the remainder of the paper is organized as follows part 2 addresses the aim of step 1 by outlining the improvements of residual error models in the bayesian framework in a context of various transformations in the data domain and time domain fig 1 part 3 introduces the data model and algorithm applied in the case study part 4 addresses the aim of step 2 by presenting the compared results over four catchments part 5 addresses the aim in step 3 by exploring the ability of data transformations in promoting the model performance finally part 6 draws the conclusions and recommends more factors needing to be considered in improving the water quality model wqm predictions 2 methods 2 1 bayesian methods for parameter estimation the calibration of a water quality model wqm can be seen as a nonlinear regression problem 1 y o y m θ x ε where y o is the observed output y m θ x is the simulated output by the model m with a parameter set θ and input x and ε is the residual the optimal parameter θ can be estimated through their posterior probability calculated with bayes theorem 2 p θ x y o p θ p y o θ x p θ is the prior probability of parameters θ p y o θ x represents the likelihood function that measures the probability that data y o could be simulated by the model m given the input x and a parameter set θ sampled randomly from p θ in the simplest bayesian inference ε is modelled as a vector of random variables with the assumption that they are mutually independent normally distributed with constant variance the likelihood function can be computed using box and tiao 2011 3 p y o θ x 1 2 π σ ε 2 n t 1 n exp y o t y m t θ x 2 2 σ ε 2 where σ ε is the standard deviation of error ε and n is the length of observed data while formulating the likelihood function under these assumptions is a convenient and well established approach it is likely to lead to poor representations of model uncertainty for hydrologic and water quality models where it is well known that model errors are heteroscedastic and complex kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 beck 1987 to address this we apply data transformations in the bayesian inference of wqms specifically tss models and derive a suite of likelihood functions that can be tested in an iterative fashion 2 2 transformation in data domain we introduce and compare here some of the most widely used transformations in addressing error heteroscedasticity in natural systems including the box cox transformation log transformation and log sinh transformation table 1 2 2 1 box cox transformation the box cox transformation has been well established in the hydrologic literature as a suitable approach to data transformation for positively skewed hydrologic variables bates and campbell 2001 gallagher and doherty 2007 kuczera 1983 mclnerney et al 2017 morawietz et al 2011 in the field of water quality modeling it has the same impact and can reduce perceived uncertainty due to addressing the errors heteroscedasticity problem freni and mannina 2012 sikorska et al 2015 a box cox transformation has two parameters λ 1 and λ 2 table 1 λ 1 is the shape parameter and reducing λ 1 emphasises the effect of the transformation when λ 1 0 the transformation becomes a log transformation box and cox 1964 λ 2 is defined to ensure y λ 2 0 in table 1 and make the logarithm transformation available 2 2 2 log transformation the log transformation a special case of box cox transformation has been widely used in tss data because in log transformed space tss concentrations tend to have a stable and measurable relationship with other variables for example log transformed tss can be modelled by the quadratic model of the ratio of red band and near infrared band in remotely sensed tss observations wang et al 2016 and by a linear model of the turbidity baldwin et al 2013 however the influence of a log transformation in the parameter calibration of tss simulations has not been discussed in previous research 2 2 3 log sinh transformation the log sinh transformation has been more recently introduced as an appropriate alternative to box cox transformation to alleviate the explosive growth in error variance wang et al 2012 its application in hydrologic modeling is promising wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 but it has not applied in a water quality calibration a log sinh transformation has two parameters λ 1 and λ 2 table 1 1 λ 1 is the upper reference output when the output y is bigger than 1 λ 1 the data scaling d y t d y coth λ 1 y λ 2 λ 1 becomes approximately equal to 1 0 which means there is no obvious difference between the transformed and original data therefore a smaller value of λ 1 leads to a stronger transformation of the data λ 2 λ 1 is the lower reference output which controls the growing relationship between error and low values del giudice et al 2013 in order to investigate the influence of these different data transformations and their corresponding likelihood functions nine calibration schemes table 1 are compared data transformations can be divided into two types log sinh transformation and box cox transformation considering a log transformation as a special case of box cox transformation with λ 1 0 five approaches are considered for evaluating the influence of the box cox parameters including two schemes with joint calibrated parameters bc 2 and bc 1 and three schemes with fixed parameters log bc0 2 and bc0 5 the fixed parameter values are specified based on their frequent use in hydrologic studies bates and campbell 2001 mclnerney et al 2017 three approaches are carried out to explore the impacts of the parameters of the log sinh transformation including one scheme with joint calibrated parameters logsinh and two schemes with fixed parameters logsinh1 and logsinh2 a calibration with no transformation is set as the control group 2 3 flow corrected time fct transformation transformation in time domain an alternative to traditional data transformations that holds promise for water quality variables is one focused on the time domain rather than the data domain in traditional clock time the time interval is uniform a flow corrected time fct transformation smith et al 2014 aims to provide a larger interval to more massive flux with the assumptions of time invariance and constant volume therefore the flow time t f is defined as 4 t f t 0 t y o t d t y o that means for the clock time interval from t 0 to t the equivalent flow time t f is the sum of observations from t 0 to t divided by the mean of observations of the whole data period y o therefore larger observations holds longer flow time a in fig 1 in order to compare the impacts of the fct transformation with other transformations in the data domain we project the data of fct space onto equal time steps the transformed observations in clock time can be calculated via 5 y t w f c t y t y t y y t y t 2 y where y t is the fct data in the uniform clock time step y t is the original data and y is the mean of data for a whole period w f c t is the fct weights t 1 n w f c t t t 1 n y t y t 1 n y t y n y y n the sum of w f c t is equal to n the number of observations y t 2 4 residual error models likelihood functions under the assumed data transformations data transformations are incorporated in the bayesian parameter estimation approach via the formal likelihood function considering the data transformation ϕ the likelihood function can be derived via the following equation 6 p y o θ x 1 2 π σ ε 2 n t 1 n exp y o t y m t 2 2 σ ε 2 t 1 n d ϕ d y y y o t based on previous work on developing appropriate likelihoods in hydrologic applications kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 bates and campbell 2001 schaefli et al 2007 schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2015 here we propose a general conceptual framework for a suite of likelihood functions to test within a wqm exercise table 1 the derivation of a likelihood function in fct space requires extra attention following eq 5 7 t 1 n d ϕ d y y y o t t 1 n d y o t 2 y o d y o t t 1 n 2 y o t y o 2 n y o 1 y o 2 y o 3 y o n y o n this jacobian function only depends on the observations and will not affect the parameter estimation and can therefore be ignored when specifying the likelihood for parameter estimation however this likelihood element does mean that a fct likelihood value cannot be compared to a clock time likelihood value in contrast the likelihood under different transformations in data domain can be compared directly 2 5 model performance measures the identification of a suitable data transformation needs measurements to evaluate the model performance libera et al 2018 this study assesses the likelihood functions in their ability to address heteroscedasticity of errors improve model fit and quantify uncertainty table 2 lists these characteristics and their associated formula value ranges and expected values following previous research in the context of streamflow simulations mclnerney et al 2017 the data transformations impose trade off impacts between high and low values therefore we divided the output into two groups high values 40 top and low values 60 bottom to investigate the simulation performance in different value ranges where model performance statistics are estimated using a deterministic model output we use the maximum likelihood parameter set to simulate the model output 2 5 1 addressing heteroscedasticity of errors the filliben r statistic filliben 1975 quantifies the linearity of quantile quantile qq plots and therefore can be used to test the degree of the data following a normal distribution a value closer to 1 0 implies the error is closer to a gaussian distribution meaning the data transformation has appropriately addressed heteroscedasticity of errors 2 5 2 prediction unbiasedness from a hydrological perspective volumetric bias vbias aims to check the long term water balance about the error of predictions coron et al 2012 it can be applied in sediment simulations to check the total mass balance positive or negative bias estimations indicate the model tends to over or under estimate the measured data respectively with an ideal value of zero 2 5 3 model efficiency the rmse standard deviation ratio rsr is a modified assessment tool to check model efficiency it can be applied to systems with different variance inherent in the observed data by weighting the traditional rmse by the standard deviation of the observed values moriasi et al 2007 it measures the ability of a model to explain the variance of observations compared with using their mean as the prediction a value as zero indicates perfect explanation while a value larger than 1 0 indicates the performance is worse than simply using the mean 2 5 4 uncertainty quantification the appropriateness of the uncertainty quantification can be judged based on the reliability and sharpness statistics yadav et al 2007 smith et al 2010 reliability represents the percentage of observations captured by a prediction interval and sharpness is the mean width of the prediction band here we choose 90 prediction interval and reliability referred to r 90 because the sharpness varied extensively when reliability is above 90 according to research in the hydrologic field yadav et al 2007 in ideal conditions the reliability should be equal to 90 and with the narrowest possible sharpness 2 5 5 critical conditions judgment high tss concentration indicates potential water quality hazards to control the pollutant input a threshold for the maximum receivable amount of pollutants should be set like the total maximum daily load tmdl in the u s clean water act copeland 1999 the event of tss concentration passing a threshold can be judged as triggering a contamination alarm after comparing the judgments of simulated observed events concurrently the number of occurrences of yes yes yes no no no or no yes is defined as hits false alarms correct negatives and misses respectively bennett et al 2013 accuracy is calculated by the ratio of correct judgments including hits and correct negatives in total judgment to assess the overall behavior of the model regarding the critical conditions a perfect prediction should have the same judgment as the observation where the accuracy is 1 0 3 case study 3 1 research catchment and measured data we illustrate our approach with four test catchments in the usa their locations are shown in fig 2 catchment 06892360 and 06892495 are the catchments of two nearby rivers located in johnson county northeast kansas the climate is classified as humid continental the mean annual temperature is about 12 8 with a mean monthly range from 2 2 in january to 25 6 in july mean annual precipitation 1961 1990 is about 1016 mm with 68 of the rain occurring during the growing season from april through september rasmussen et al 2008 catchment 04087030 and 04087142 are the upstream and downstream catchment in the menomonee river basin located in southeast wisconsin baldwin et al 2013 we collected daily tss concentration and streamflow data for two years from the usgs database on national real time water quality https nrtwq usgs gov the description in table 3 demonstrates the tss concentration and streamflow observation of four test catchments is right skewed heavy tailed with considerable variability 3 2 build up wash off model bwmod the dynamics of tss in the study catchments are simulated via the build up wash off model bwmod fig 3 the model broadly simulates two processes the build up of sediments during dry periods eq 8 and wash off process during wet periods modelled as a power law function of streamflow eq 9 8 d d t s a κ s m a x s a t s s a t where s a t kg is the sediment amount available on the catchment surface to be washed off at time t s s a t kg s 1 is the amount of sediment in the stream at time t and the function is 9 s s a t a max 0 q t q c r b s a t the output tss concentration c t s s t kg m 3 is derived via 10 c t s s t s s a t q t bwmod has five parameters to estimate table 4 one input streamflow q and one output tss concentration c t s s 3 3 parameter estimation via mcmc parameters in hydrologic and likelihood function were sampled with the adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm proposed by haario et al 2001 convergence was achieved after about 100000 iterations assessed by a visual graphical analysis of parameter trace when the mean and variance of parameter samples were stable in order to remove the influence of antecedent conditions due to unknown initial sediment loads we set 30 days as a warm up period for the tss simulation 4 results the resulting simulated tss concentrations are compared using the optimum maximum likelihood parameter set for each assumed data transformation fig 4 it is evident that simulations are highly dependent on the assumed likelihood when the likelihood parameter λ 1 is fixed before calibration including the cases of no bc0 5 bc0 2 log logsinh1 and logsinh2 in table 1 different values of λ 1 in data transformation influence the parameter estimation and cause the significant differences in optimal predictions generally the simulation after fct transformation is bigger than no transformation in the time domain in contrast when λ 1 is calibrated with the bwmod parameters including the cases of the logsinh bc 2 and bc 1 transformation in table 1 these data transformations lead to the similar optimal simulations regardless of the data domain and time domain and they are close to the simulation after log transformation thus in the following analysis we consider bc 2 bc 1 and logsinh transformation to effectively be the same 4 1 addressing error s heteroscedasticity as the no bc0 5 bc0 2 and log transformations are implemented sequentially the value of λ 1 reduces and for logsinh logsinh1 and logsinh2 transformations the value of λ 1 increases with λ 1 reducing the values of filliben r statistic becomes closer to 1 0 fig 5 indicating the stronger ability of the transformation in addressing the errors heteroscedasticity this was noticed to occur in all the catchments and both time spaces when λ 1 is almost zero e g log and logsinh in fig 5 there is little difference in carrying out the fct transformation or not a larger value of λ 1 introduce more changes in the results after different time transformations and the fct space shows less error normality than original time space 4 2 volumetric bias vbias the vbias is compared across low and high tss values in clock time and flow corrected time fig 6 the results demonstrate that without time transformation for all data transformations the vbias of low values is greater than 0 while the vbias of high values is below 0 this indicates that the simulations of low values are overestimated while the simulations of high values are underestimated the overall vbias is a compromise of low and high parts the vbias after fct transformation demonstrates similar results however overall the magnitude of bias is higher when transforming in flow corrected time space fig 6 also demonstrates that excluding the results for no transformation a smaller λ 1 will lead to smaller vbias regardless of other factors in the case of the exception when calibrating with no transformation the bias is reduced although λ 1 is biggest as it is controlled by λ 2 above all the vbias of tss concentration represents the long term sediment balance error generally reducing λ 1 in data transformation pushes the tss load in bwmod simulation to exhibit a higher degree of underestimation of observations while a fct transformation increase the value of vbias 4 3 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr in a similar fashion the rsr is estimated for low tss values high tss values and across all values fig 7 for each calibration strategy the results show that the overall rsr shows a similar trend when estimated on all tss values and high tss values implying that high values have more influences in calibration even though high values represent fewer time steps the number of low and high values takes 60 and 40 of observations respectively in original time space when λ 1 reduces the rsr for all data and high values alone become worse while rsr for low values improves after fct transformation no transformation in the data domain shows the worst rsr values bc0 2 performances best in the box cox transformation family and logsinh1 performances best in the log sinh transformation family 4 4 uncertainty quantification in this research the most reliable estimation occurs when observations are captured by prediction intervals with the smallest possible interval width i e the best simulation will be sharp and reliable here we estimate reliability at the 90 limit and present reliability as a deviation from the optimum value i e deviation from 90 fig 8 fig 8 demonstrates that the reliability for all tss values tends to reflect the reliability estimated for low values because reliability is calculated based on the number of time steps rather than the data magnitude when λ 1 reduces the reliability of all values and low values alone decrease to around 90 however for high values there is no apparent changing trend fig 8 demonstrates that sharpness mainly depends on the variation of the sample data according to table 3 the tss concentration in kansas catchments 06892360 and 06892495 have much larger variances than wisconsin catchments 04087030 and 04087142 and therefore the sharpness is much bigger among the different transformations when λ 1 reduces sharpness increases in original space and decreases in fct space indicating that the variation of transformed data increases in original space and decreases in fct space on the whole log transformation performs best in uncertainty quantification although it has the most considerable sharpness in original space the difference with other transformations is not significant in fct time space log transformation has the smallest sharpness what s more its reliability is best in both time spaces 4 5 critical conditions judgment the tmdl warning target value for tss concentration is 12 mg l in wisconsin u s environmental protection agency 2018 and 50 mg l in kansas kansas department of health and environment 2014 when tss concentration passes this threshold the situation is analogous to an alarm to compare the transformation performance under different criteria we set the criteria values as per table 5 fig 9 presents the overall accuracy of each calibration strategy the performances are better when the selected thresholds are closer to the marginal values because it is easier to form the same judgments between observations and simulations when the threshold equals the median which is the common situation log and logsinh transformation with λ 1 close to 0 shows the best accuracy in general 5 discussion bayesian inference can be a useful tool for uncertainty analysis in water resource modeling the mathematical elegance it offers has resulted in a history of innovative hydrological applications pertaining to amongst others parameter sampling kuczera 1983 bates and campbell 2001 marshall et al 2004 jeremiah et al 2011 input errors quantification kavetski et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 multi model combination abrahart and see 2002 georgakakos et al 2004 hoeting et al 1999 shamseldin et al 1997 and improved likelihood functions kuczera 1983 schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 smith et al 2015 while a direct translation of these methods to wqm is possible actual implementation becomes complicated due to the differences in sampling uncertainty and characterisation of wqm variables for instance the presence of multiple often disjointly sampled observations with considerable uncertainties in measurement along with multiple modelled responses makes inference challenging options requiring multi objective calibration careful consideration of uncertainties and more complex residual errors characterisations become necessary addressing these concerns needs developing appropriate likelihood functions specific to wqm which forms the main motivation for this study in addition wqm often focuses on not just on continuous time series but also sporadic extreme events in pollutant loads beck 1987 requiring likelihood functions designed to cater to the specific variables being characterised to date uncertainty analysis in water quality modeling has focussed on improving model specification using data that is increasingly more uncertain there is a need for methods that diagnose and quantify errors in wqm this study provides an insight into this issue in the context of tss modeling it offers specific contributions on how transformations could be used in time and data domain to accommodate heteroscedasticity in the modelled responses as with any study certain simplifications are made the implications of some of these simplifications are discussed below 5 1 the impact of transformation parameters in the results section earlier fig 4 demonstrated that when λ 1 is calibrated along with bwmod parameters all data transformations led to similar optimal simulations the likelihood function was based on the assumption that the error has a constant variance therefore homoscedastic errors will have the maximum likelihood according to fig 5 a smaller λ 1 allevated the error heteroscedasticity to an improved extent however no data transformations was found to eliminate heteroscedasticity entirely as demonstrated via the filliben r statistic which was not able to reach to 1 in order to reach the optimal likelihood in each case study catchment λ 1 must effectively reduce to 0 when λ 1 reduces to 0 the box cox transformation and log sinh transformation asymptote towards the log transformation and hence lead to the same simulation this point is further elaborated on in the appendix additionally as discussed earlier in section 2 2 λ 1 plays a key role in the performance of data transformations the reason why these transformations in the data domain can address heterocedastic residuals fig 5 is that they can compress the scale of high values and thereby reduce their variance del giudice et al 2013 a smaller λ 1 means a stronger reduction in the amplitude of the high values this impact is the same as reducing the weights of high values in calibration therefore a smaller λ 1 shifts the emphasis of calibration to the lower values at the expense of poorly fitting high values a summary of the changing trends in performance metrics with reducing λ 1 is shown in table 6 a smaller λ 1 pushes the calibration to focus on the low values causing rsr and vbias to get worse because high values impact these more table 2 the limited identifiability of the bwmod parameters leads to the underestimation of high value observations and overestimation of low values fig 6 the fitting to low values causes the entire simulation to decrease in magnitude besides the residual errors become closer to a normal distribution which improves reliability fig 10 when using the log and logsinh transformation with the smallest λ 1 the highest accuracy results as the low values of the data impact outcomes most in above all there is a balance among the calibration of different parts because we can not improve the simulation of all the parts together 5 2 the influence of flow corrected time space according to eq 5 in section 2 3 converting the values from the original time space to fct space is analogous to the use of a square transformation when λ 1 is calibrated although the optimal values of calibrated λ 1 is not exactly half of the value in the original space the features of the same transformation in both time spaces are similar that means the effects of the fct space conversion is offset by the flexibility in λ 1 when λ 1 is fixed generally log transformation performs best which is the same as in the original time space besides changing of rsr for all data and high values alone creates differences between the original time space and fct space results in fct space the best performance occurs when λ 1 assumes an intermediate value bc0 2 for box cox transformation logsinh1 for log sinh transformation while in original time space it occurs when λ 1 is largest as the fct space conversion has a similar effect as the use of the square transformation the impact is equivalent to doubling λ 1 in original space when λ 1 increases high values assume more weight resulting in the simulation fitting to peak values at the expense of more bias in smaller values smith et al 2014 5 3 trade off between multiple performance metrics in order to make a comparison among different metrics simpler a summary is presented in table 7 where the optimal value of any metric is the smallest one a radar plot of these multiple performance metrics is then presented in fig 11 fig 11 indicates that none of the data transformations can improve all the performance metrics because different metrics mainly depends on different parts of the prediction a stronger transformation will make the simulation tend to fit the low values demonstrated via r90 at the expense of a poorer fit for high values demonstrated via vbias and rsr in original space rsr and vbias exhibit the same trend for different transformations but an opposite trend in reliability and filliben r statistics it is consistent with the above conclusion when the calibration focuses on high values reliability and filliben r become worse and model fits better in fct space the data variance is more so the distribution of performance metrics changes generally no transformation performance is the worst and log transformation is the best 5 4 selecting the most suitable data transformation if the residual error is homoscedastic there is no need to carry out the data transformation because data transformation introduces more vbias fig 6 the primary purpose of applying data transformation is to normalize the residuals and thereby improve predictive uncertainty estimates across the range of simulated values according to table 6 transformations in this study can also improve the model fit in the low value range improving reliability and increasing the accuracy of assessment of critical conditions moreover a smaller λ 1 will lead to better performance in the above features across the various data transformations considered a log transformation with the smallest λ 1 performs best however this occurs at the cost of a poor fit for high values if the high values are of interest λ 1 should be fixed in wang et al 2012 log sinh transformation performance is found to be superior to box cox transformation when the variance of the prediction variables is suddenly increased however in work presented here the log sinh transformation does not outperform box cox transformation this conclusion is also found in the research of mclnerney et al 2017 if only the small part of peak values are of interest no transformation in fct space can be chosen but could introduce large biases for baseflow events fig 4 an overall framework to select the most suitable transformation is depicted in fig 12 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the ability of various data transformations in improving tss simulations on the basis of the four case studies presented we can make the following conclusions 1 λ 1 the power parameter of box cox transformation and coefficient of the log sinh transformation determines the calibration emphasis and plays the main role in the performance of data transformation a smaller λ 1 suggests the whole calibration will tend to fit to the low values at the expense of a worse fit for higher parts 2 different performance metrics have dependencies across each other the vbias and rsr will be improved together with larger λ 1 because their calculation depends more on the subset of high value data while reliability and error s normality will be increased with smaller λ 1 as reducing λ 1 increases the ability of addressing heterocsedacity 3 none of the transformations provide the best performance across all metrics in a typical situation a log transformation with the smallest λ 1 gives the best performance 4 when λ 1 is calibrated with model parameters its optimal value will be very close to 0 and the box cox transformation and log sinh transformation will have the same contribution as a log transformation based on the general conclusions above a framework for choosing a data transformation fig 12 along with their modified likelihood functions table 1 has been developed this framework however should not be confined to tss simulations alone but can also be applied in the context of hydrologic modeling and other water quality predictions besides normalizing residual errors bwmod needs further modifications to deal with systematic bias due to limited parameter identifiability the tss simulation via bwmod generally is of larger magnitude than observations in the small value range and smaller than observations in the high value range it is likely that structural improvements of bwmod will alleviate this further it should be noted that methods other than transformation may be more suitable for dealing with error heteroscedasticity resulting in better simulations direct representation conditioning the variance of the errors directly on the runoff magnitude or on other covariates has been discussed in the literature and noted to hold promise sorooshian and dracup 1980 thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 renard et al 2011 therefore more elaborate comparisons

26145,water quality models wqms can be difficult to calibrate due to the complexity and heteroscedasticity of model errors with the aim to address error heteroscedasticity and produce more accurate and reliable probabilistic predictions this research develops a framework for improved uncertainty analysis and bayesian inference of wqms in the context of total suspended solids tss models along with error formulations applying data transformations in traditional time space we introduce an error model based on flow corrected time in which clock time is expanded during high values and compressed during low values the results for four case study catchments show that proper data transformation can change the calibration emphasis on the parts of interest which can modify the simulation reliability and improve the accuracy of critical condition judgments overall this data transformation framework can help to select appropriate residual error models for water resource models and associated water quality predictions keywords total suspended solids bayesian inference residual error box cox transformation flow corrected time log sinh transformation 1 introduction in the last decade considerable attention has been given to the analysis and simulation of water quality variables total suspended solids tss as a measure of water clarity is commonly used to assess water quality deterioration because suspended solids exert an adverse impact on aquatic ecosystems tss block sunlight and subsequently decrease photosynthesis of hydrophytes bilotta and brazier 2008 what is more solids absorb more heat than water and an aquatic environment with higher temperature can hold less dissolved oxygen do upsetting the balance of the water ecosystem bilotta and brazier 2008 suspended solids can also serve as a carrier of pollutants such as phosphorus russell et al 1998 mercury heavy metals dawson and macklin 1998 and hydrophobic organic compounds above all high tss indicates potential water quality hazards in any water body sound water management needs precise predictions of tss loads or concentrations when observations are infrequent recently the build up wash off model bwmod has been widely applied to simulate tss transport at the catchment scale liu et al 2010 shaw et al 2010 hossain et al 2012 sikorska et al 2015 bonhomme and petrucci 2017 this model imitates two natural processes that the sediments are built up in a dry period and washed off by the runoff in a wet period many studies have focused on how to improve the expressions of these two processes and how to aggregate different land uses for a whole catchment response bonhomme and petrucci 2017 hossain et al 2010 sikorska et al 2015 however an additional concern is the uncertainty associated with the model processes and prediction the bwmod structure exhibits complex uncertainty arising from structural uncertainty due to an oversimple model structure for simulating tss generation observation uncertainty caused by the weak representativeness of the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow and sediments in the river and parametric uncertainty due to the difficulties in identifying model parameters sikorska et al 2015 evaluating bwmod reliability needs proper acknowledgment of the model uncertainty and its characteristics bayesian inference can address uncertainty estimation in the process of parameter calibration and has been extensively applied in the field of hydrology kuczera 1983 bates and campbell 2001 montanari et al 2009 kuczera and parent 1998 but in tss modeling uncertainty analysis is still in its infancy tss modeling suffers more complex uncertainties than in hydrologic modeling the release of sediments is less identifiable than runoff generation schmelter et al 2011 similarly tss data are generally rare and may not be representative of the pollutants dynamics throughout the overall water system ashley et al 2004 kanso et al 2006 tss data indicates a higher variability than streamflow in space and time cheviron et al 2014 model complexity and data limitations increase the uncertainties of the bwmod output such difficulties also arise in specifying an appropriate bayesian framework for inference of water quality models such as bwmod any bayesian approach to parameter inference requires specification of the model likelihood function which assumes the model errors can be characterised by a parametric probability distribution one of the most commonly made assumptions is that they are independent and identically distributed according to a normal distribution with zero mean and a constant variance however model residual errors are often correlated and nonstationary not just in the hydrologic field kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 but also in water quality modeling beck 1987 non stationarity is an additional common form of heteroscedasticity to solve this problem data transformations are commonly used aimed at transforming non gaussian distributions of observed and predicted responses to near gaussian shape before applying constant variance error model such data transformations as the logarithmic log and box cox transformation which have had promising results in hydrologic modeling bates and campbell 2001 kuczera 1983 mclnerney et al 2017 morawietz et al 2011 smith et al 2015 recently wang et al 2012 explored the ability of the log sinh transformation in tempering the explosive growth in error variance for hydrologic applications and in this situation its performance is superior to the box cox transformation these transformations were only systematically examined and compared in the hydrologic field mclnerney et al 2017 their suitability for heteroscedastic water quality errors such as in simulating tss is not widely known in addition to this data transformations typically focus on the data domain more recently a new time transformation referred to as the flow corrected time fct transformation has been suggested for improved calibration of hydrologic models smith et al 2014 the approach attempts to transform the data from the traditional clock time with a uniform time interval to so called flow time in which the time interval is expanded during high values and compressed during low values to address the assumption of time invariance and constant volume by implicitly adding more weight in the time period with larger hydrologic flux fct transformation can produce a better fit for peak simulations and worsen the performance when the low value events are of interest smith et al 2014 the fct approach then holds promise specifically for water quality models where the probability of exceeding a certain water quality threshold is frequently of interest in the model s application rather than low values applying a heteroscedasticity transformation in fct space has not been considered in previous research for hydrologic or water quality models examining the potential of this combination in the scope of tss simulations is the main objective of this study applying these transformations necessitates rebuilding the residual error model the likelihood function in bayesian calibration thus starting from fulfilling the error s assumption aiming to establish robust approaches with data transformations for improving tss simulation the specific aims in this study can be summarised as follows 1 modify the likelihood function within the context of each data transformation 2 compare systematically the impacts of different data transformations to tss prediction across various metrics for measuring the model performance especially considering their influences in fct space 3 build a stepwise approach to likelihood selection to help to choose the most suitable likelihood function for not only tss prediction but also other models the remainder of the paper is organized as follows part 2 addresses the aim of step 1 by outlining the improvements of residual error models in the bayesian framework in a context of various transformations in the data domain and time domain fig 1 part 3 introduces the data model and algorithm applied in the case study part 4 addresses the aim of step 2 by presenting the compared results over four catchments part 5 addresses the aim in step 3 by exploring the ability of data transformations in promoting the model performance finally part 6 draws the conclusions and recommends more factors needing to be considered in improving the water quality model wqm predictions 2 methods 2 1 bayesian methods for parameter estimation the calibration of a water quality model wqm can be seen as a nonlinear regression problem 1 y o y m θ x ε where y o is the observed output y m θ x is the simulated output by the model m with a parameter set θ and input x and ε is the residual the optimal parameter θ can be estimated through their posterior probability calculated with bayes theorem 2 p θ x y o p θ p y o θ x p θ is the prior probability of parameters θ p y o θ x represents the likelihood function that measures the probability that data y o could be simulated by the model m given the input x and a parameter set θ sampled randomly from p θ in the simplest bayesian inference ε is modelled as a vector of random variables with the assumption that they are mutually independent normally distributed with constant variance the likelihood function can be computed using box and tiao 2011 3 p y o θ x 1 2 π σ ε 2 n t 1 n exp y o t y m t θ x 2 2 σ ε 2 where σ ε is the standard deviation of error ε and n is the length of observed data while formulating the likelihood function under these assumptions is a convenient and well established approach it is likely to lead to poor representations of model uncertainty for hydrologic and water quality models where it is well known that model errors are heteroscedastic and complex kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 beck 1987 to address this we apply data transformations in the bayesian inference of wqms specifically tss models and derive a suite of likelihood functions that can be tested in an iterative fashion 2 2 transformation in data domain we introduce and compare here some of the most widely used transformations in addressing error heteroscedasticity in natural systems including the box cox transformation log transformation and log sinh transformation table 1 2 2 1 box cox transformation the box cox transformation has been well established in the hydrologic literature as a suitable approach to data transformation for positively skewed hydrologic variables bates and campbell 2001 gallagher and doherty 2007 kuczera 1983 mclnerney et al 2017 morawietz et al 2011 in the field of water quality modeling it has the same impact and can reduce perceived uncertainty due to addressing the errors heteroscedasticity problem freni and mannina 2012 sikorska et al 2015 a box cox transformation has two parameters λ 1 and λ 2 table 1 λ 1 is the shape parameter and reducing λ 1 emphasises the effect of the transformation when λ 1 0 the transformation becomes a log transformation box and cox 1964 λ 2 is defined to ensure y λ 2 0 in table 1 and make the logarithm transformation available 2 2 2 log transformation the log transformation a special case of box cox transformation has been widely used in tss data because in log transformed space tss concentrations tend to have a stable and measurable relationship with other variables for example log transformed tss can be modelled by the quadratic model of the ratio of red band and near infrared band in remotely sensed tss observations wang et al 2016 and by a linear model of the turbidity baldwin et al 2013 however the influence of a log transformation in the parameter calibration of tss simulations has not been discussed in previous research 2 2 3 log sinh transformation the log sinh transformation has been more recently introduced as an appropriate alternative to box cox transformation to alleviate the explosive growth in error variance wang et al 2012 its application in hydrologic modeling is promising wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 but it has not applied in a water quality calibration a log sinh transformation has two parameters λ 1 and λ 2 table 1 1 λ 1 is the upper reference output when the output y is bigger than 1 λ 1 the data scaling d y t d y coth λ 1 y λ 2 λ 1 becomes approximately equal to 1 0 which means there is no obvious difference between the transformed and original data therefore a smaller value of λ 1 leads to a stronger transformation of the data λ 2 λ 1 is the lower reference output which controls the growing relationship between error and low values del giudice et al 2013 in order to investigate the influence of these different data transformations and their corresponding likelihood functions nine calibration schemes table 1 are compared data transformations can be divided into two types log sinh transformation and box cox transformation considering a log transformation as a special case of box cox transformation with λ 1 0 five approaches are considered for evaluating the influence of the box cox parameters including two schemes with joint calibrated parameters bc 2 and bc 1 and three schemes with fixed parameters log bc0 2 and bc0 5 the fixed parameter values are specified based on their frequent use in hydrologic studies bates and campbell 2001 mclnerney et al 2017 three approaches are carried out to explore the impacts of the parameters of the log sinh transformation including one scheme with joint calibrated parameters logsinh and two schemes with fixed parameters logsinh1 and logsinh2 a calibration with no transformation is set as the control group 2 3 flow corrected time fct transformation transformation in time domain an alternative to traditional data transformations that holds promise for water quality variables is one focused on the time domain rather than the data domain in traditional clock time the time interval is uniform a flow corrected time fct transformation smith et al 2014 aims to provide a larger interval to more massive flux with the assumptions of time invariance and constant volume therefore the flow time t f is defined as 4 t f t 0 t y o t d t y o that means for the clock time interval from t 0 to t the equivalent flow time t f is the sum of observations from t 0 to t divided by the mean of observations of the whole data period y o therefore larger observations holds longer flow time a in fig 1 in order to compare the impacts of the fct transformation with other transformations in the data domain we project the data of fct space onto equal time steps the transformed observations in clock time can be calculated via 5 y t w f c t y t y t y y t y t 2 y where y t is the fct data in the uniform clock time step y t is the original data and y is the mean of data for a whole period w f c t is the fct weights t 1 n w f c t t t 1 n y t y t 1 n y t y n y y n the sum of w f c t is equal to n the number of observations y t 2 4 residual error models likelihood functions under the assumed data transformations data transformations are incorporated in the bayesian parameter estimation approach via the formal likelihood function considering the data transformation ϕ the likelihood function can be derived via the following equation 6 p y o θ x 1 2 π σ ε 2 n t 1 n exp y o t y m t 2 2 σ ε 2 t 1 n d ϕ d y y y o t based on previous work on developing appropriate likelihoods in hydrologic applications kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 bates and campbell 2001 schaefli et al 2007 schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2015 here we propose a general conceptual framework for a suite of likelihood functions to test within a wqm exercise table 1 the derivation of a likelihood function in fct space requires extra attention following eq 5 7 t 1 n d ϕ d y y y o t t 1 n d y o t 2 y o d y o t t 1 n 2 y o t y o 2 n y o 1 y o 2 y o 3 y o n y o n this jacobian function only depends on the observations and will not affect the parameter estimation and can therefore be ignored when specifying the likelihood for parameter estimation however this likelihood element does mean that a fct likelihood value cannot be compared to a clock time likelihood value in contrast the likelihood under different transformations in data domain can be compared directly 2 5 model performance measures the identification of a suitable data transformation needs measurements to evaluate the model performance libera et al 2018 this study assesses the likelihood functions in their ability to address heteroscedasticity of errors improve model fit and quantify uncertainty table 2 lists these characteristics and their associated formula value ranges and expected values following previous research in the context of streamflow simulations mclnerney et al 2017 the data transformations impose trade off impacts between high and low values therefore we divided the output into two groups high values 40 top and low values 60 bottom to investigate the simulation performance in different value ranges where model performance statistics are estimated using a deterministic model output we use the maximum likelihood parameter set to simulate the model output 2 5 1 addressing heteroscedasticity of errors the filliben r statistic filliben 1975 quantifies the linearity of quantile quantile qq plots and therefore can be used to test the degree of the data following a normal distribution a value closer to 1 0 implies the error is closer to a gaussian distribution meaning the data transformation has appropriately addressed heteroscedasticity of errors 2 5 2 prediction unbiasedness from a hydrological perspective volumetric bias vbias aims to check the long term water balance about the error of predictions coron et al 2012 it can be applied in sediment simulations to check the total mass balance positive or negative bias estimations indicate the model tends to over or under estimate the measured data respectively with an ideal value of zero 2 5 3 model efficiency the rmse standard deviation ratio rsr is a modified assessment tool to check model efficiency it can be applied to systems with different variance inherent in the observed data by weighting the traditional rmse by the standard deviation of the observed values moriasi et al 2007 it measures the ability of a model to explain the variance of observations compared with using their mean as the prediction a value as zero indicates perfect explanation while a value larger than 1 0 indicates the performance is worse than simply using the mean 2 5 4 uncertainty quantification the appropriateness of the uncertainty quantification can be judged based on the reliability and sharpness statistics yadav et al 2007 smith et al 2010 reliability represents the percentage of observations captured by a prediction interval and sharpness is the mean width of the prediction band here we choose 90 prediction interval and reliability referred to r 90 because the sharpness varied extensively when reliability is above 90 according to research in the hydrologic field yadav et al 2007 in ideal conditions the reliability should be equal to 90 and with the narrowest possible sharpness 2 5 5 critical conditions judgment high tss concentration indicates potential water quality hazards to control the pollutant input a threshold for the maximum receivable amount of pollutants should be set like the total maximum daily load tmdl in the u s clean water act copeland 1999 the event of tss concentration passing a threshold can be judged as triggering a contamination alarm after comparing the judgments of simulated observed events concurrently the number of occurrences of yes yes yes no no no or no yes is defined as hits false alarms correct negatives and misses respectively bennett et al 2013 accuracy is calculated by the ratio of correct judgments including hits and correct negatives in total judgment to assess the overall behavior of the model regarding the critical conditions a perfect prediction should have the same judgment as the observation where the accuracy is 1 0 3 case study 3 1 research catchment and measured data we illustrate our approach with four test catchments in the usa their locations are shown in fig 2 catchment 06892360 and 06892495 are the catchments of two nearby rivers located in johnson county northeast kansas the climate is classified as humid continental the mean annual temperature is about 12 8 with a mean monthly range from 2 2 in january to 25 6 in july mean annual precipitation 1961 1990 is about 1016 mm with 68 of the rain occurring during the growing season from april through september rasmussen et al 2008 catchment 04087030 and 04087142 are the upstream and downstream catchment in the menomonee river basin located in southeast wisconsin baldwin et al 2013 we collected daily tss concentration and streamflow data for two years from the usgs database on national real time water quality https nrtwq usgs gov the description in table 3 demonstrates the tss concentration and streamflow observation of four test catchments is right skewed heavy tailed with considerable variability 3 2 build up wash off model bwmod the dynamics of tss in the study catchments are simulated via the build up wash off model bwmod fig 3 the model broadly simulates two processes the build up of sediments during dry periods eq 8 and wash off process during wet periods modelled as a power law function of streamflow eq 9 8 d d t s a κ s m a x s a t s s a t where s a t kg is the sediment amount available on the catchment surface to be washed off at time t s s a t kg s 1 is the amount of sediment in the stream at time t and the function is 9 s s a t a max 0 q t q c r b s a t the output tss concentration c t s s t kg m 3 is derived via 10 c t s s t s s a t q t bwmod has five parameters to estimate table 4 one input streamflow q and one output tss concentration c t s s 3 3 parameter estimation via mcmc parameters in hydrologic and likelihood function were sampled with the adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm proposed by haario et al 2001 convergence was achieved after about 100000 iterations assessed by a visual graphical analysis of parameter trace when the mean and variance of parameter samples were stable in order to remove the influence of antecedent conditions due to unknown initial sediment loads we set 30 days as a warm up period for the tss simulation 4 results the resulting simulated tss concentrations are compared using the optimum maximum likelihood parameter set for each assumed data transformation fig 4 it is evident that simulations are highly dependent on the assumed likelihood when the likelihood parameter λ 1 is fixed before calibration including the cases of no bc0 5 bc0 2 log logsinh1 and logsinh2 in table 1 different values of λ 1 in data transformation influence the parameter estimation and cause the significant differences in optimal predictions generally the simulation after fct transformation is bigger than no transformation in the time domain in contrast when λ 1 is calibrated with the bwmod parameters including the cases of the logsinh bc 2 and bc 1 transformation in table 1 these data transformations lead to the similar optimal simulations regardless of the data domain and time domain and they are close to the simulation after log transformation thus in the following analysis we consider bc 2 bc 1 and logsinh transformation to effectively be the same 4 1 addressing error s heteroscedasticity as the no bc0 5 bc0 2 and log transformations are implemented sequentially the value of λ 1 reduces and for logsinh logsinh1 and logsinh2 transformations the value of λ 1 increases with λ 1 reducing the values of filliben r statistic becomes closer to 1 0 fig 5 indicating the stronger ability of the transformation in addressing the errors heteroscedasticity this was noticed to occur in all the catchments and both time spaces when λ 1 is almost zero e g log and logsinh in fig 5 there is little difference in carrying out the fct transformation or not a larger value of λ 1 introduce more changes in the results after different time transformations and the fct space shows less error normality than original time space 4 2 volumetric bias vbias the vbias is compared across low and high tss values in clock time and flow corrected time fig 6 the results demonstrate that without time transformation for all data transformations the vbias of low values is greater than 0 while the vbias of high values is below 0 this indicates that the simulations of low values are overestimated while the simulations of high values are underestimated the overall vbias is a compromise of low and high parts the vbias after fct transformation demonstrates similar results however overall the magnitude of bias is higher when transforming in flow corrected time space fig 6 also demonstrates that excluding the results for no transformation a smaller λ 1 will lead to smaller vbias regardless of other factors in the case of the exception when calibrating with no transformation the bias is reduced although λ 1 is biggest as it is controlled by λ 2 above all the vbias of tss concentration represents the long term sediment balance error generally reducing λ 1 in data transformation pushes the tss load in bwmod simulation to exhibit a higher degree of underestimation of observations while a fct transformation increase the value of vbias 4 3 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr in a similar fashion the rsr is estimated for low tss values high tss values and across all values fig 7 for each calibration strategy the results show that the overall rsr shows a similar trend when estimated on all tss values and high tss values implying that high values have more influences in calibration even though high values represent fewer time steps the number of low and high values takes 60 and 40 of observations respectively in original time space when λ 1 reduces the rsr for all data and high values alone become worse while rsr for low values improves after fct transformation no transformation in the data domain shows the worst rsr values bc0 2 performances best in the box cox transformation family and logsinh1 performances best in the log sinh transformation family 4 4 uncertainty quantification in this research the most reliable estimation occurs when observations are captured by prediction intervals with the smallest possible interval width i e the best simulation will be sharp and reliable here we estimate reliability at the 90 limit and present reliability as a deviation from the optimum value i e deviation from 90 fig 8 fig 8 demonstrates that the reliability for all tss values tends to reflect the reliability estimated for low values because reliability is calculated based on the number of time steps rather than the data magnitude when λ 1 reduces the reliability of all values and low values alone decrease to around 90 however for high values there is no apparent changing trend fig 8 demonstrates that sharpness mainly depends on the variation of the sample data according to table 3 the tss concentration in kansas catchments 06892360 and 06892495 have much larger variances than wisconsin catchments 04087030 and 04087142 and therefore the sharpness is much bigger among the different transformations when λ 1 reduces sharpness increases in original space and decreases in fct space indicating that the variation of transformed data increases in original space and decreases in fct space on the whole log transformation performs best in uncertainty quantification although it has the most considerable sharpness in original space the difference with other transformations is not significant in fct time space log transformation has the smallest sharpness what s more its reliability is best in both time spaces 4 5 critical conditions judgment the tmdl warning target value for tss concentration is 12 mg l in wisconsin u s environmental protection agency 2018 and 50 mg l in kansas kansas department of health and environment 2014 when tss concentration passes this threshold the situation is analogous to an alarm to compare the transformation performance under different criteria we set the criteria values as per table 5 fig 9 presents the overall accuracy of each calibration strategy the performances are better when the selected thresholds are closer to the marginal values because it is easier to form the same judgments between observations and simulations when the threshold equals the median which is the common situation log and logsinh transformation with λ 1 close to 0 shows the best accuracy in general 5 discussion bayesian inference can be a useful tool for uncertainty analysis in water resource modeling the mathematical elegance it offers has resulted in a history of innovative hydrological applications pertaining to amongst others parameter sampling kuczera 1983 bates and campbell 2001 marshall et al 2004 jeremiah et al 2011 input errors quantification kavetski et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 multi model combination abrahart and see 2002 georgakakos et al 2004 hoeting et al 1999 shamseldin et al 1997 and improved likelihood functions kuczera 1983 schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 smith et al 2015 while a direct translation of these methods to wqm is possible actual implementation becomes complicated due to the differences in sampling uncertainty and characterisation of wqm variables for instance the presence of multiple often disjointly sampled observations with considerable uncertainties in measurement along with multiple modelled responses makes inference challenging options requiring multi objective calibration careful consideration of uncertainties and more complex residual errors characterisations become necessary addressing these concerns needs developing appropriate likelihood functions specific to wqm which forms the main motivation for this study in addition wqm often focuses on not just on continuous time series but also sporadic extreme events in pollutant loads beck 1987 requiring likelihood functions designed to cater to the specific variables being characterised to date uncertainty analysis in water quality modeling has focussed on improving model specification using data that is increasingly more uncertain there is a need for methods that diagnose and quantify errors in wqm this study provides an insight into this issue in the context of tss modeling it offers specific contributions on how transformations could be used in time and data domain to accommodate heteroscedasticity in the modelled responses as with any study certain simplifications are made the implications of some of these simplifications are discussed below 5 1 the impact of transformation parameters in the results section earlier fig 4 demonstrated that when λ 1 is calibrated along with bwmod parameters all data transformations led to similar optimal simulations the likelihood function was based on the assumption that the error has a constant variance therefore homoscedastic errors will have the maximum likelihood according to fig 5 a smaller λ 1 allevated the error heteroscedasticity to an improved extent however no data transformations was found to eliminate heteroscedasticity entirely as demonstrated via the filliben r statistic which was not able to reach to 1 in order to reach the optimal likelihood in each case study catchment λ 1 must effectively reduce to 0 when λ 1 reduces to 0 the box cox transformation and log sinh transformation asymptote towards the log transformation and hence lead to the same simulation this point is further elaborated on in the appendix additionally as discussed earlier in section 2 2 λ 1 plays a key role in the performance of data transformations the reason why these transformations in the data domain can address heterocedastic residuals fig 5 is that they can compress the scale of high values and thereby reduce their variance del giudice et al 2013 a smaller λ 1 means a stronger reduction in the amplitude of the high values this impact is the same as reducing the weights of high values in calibration therefore a smaller λ 1 shifts the emphasis of calibration to the lower values at the expense of poorly fitting high values a summary of the changing trends in performance metrics with reducing λ 1 is shown in table 6 a smaller λ 1 pushes the calibration to focus on the low values causing rsr and vbias to get worse because high values impact these more table 2 the limited identifiability of the bwmod parameters leads to the underestimation of high value observations and overestimation of low values fig 6 the fitting to low values causes the entire simulation to decrease in magnitude besides the residual errors become closer to a normal distribution which improves reliability fig 10 when using the log and logsinh transformation with the smallest λ 1 the highest accuracy results as the low values of the data impact outcomes most in above all there is a balance among the calibration of different parts because we can not improve the simulation of all the parts together 5 2 the influence of flow corrected time space according to eq 5 in section 2 3 converting the values from the original time space to fct space is analogous to the use of a square transformation when λ 1 is calibrated although the optimal values of calibrated λ 1 is not exactly half of the value in the original space the features of the same transformation in both time spaces are similar that means the effects of the fct space conversion is offset by the flexibility in λ 1 when λ 1 is fixed generally log transformation performs best which is the same as in the original time space besides changing of rsr for all data and high values alone creates differences between the original time space and fct space results in fct space the best performance occurs when λ 1 assumes an intermediate value bc0 2 for box cox transformation logsinh1 for log sinh transformation while in original time space it occurs when λ 1 is largest as the fct space conversion has a similar effect as the use of the square transformation the impact is equivalent to doubling λ 1 in original space when λ 1 increases high values assume more weight resulting in the simulation fitting to peak values at the expense of more bias in smaller values smith et al 2014 5 3 trade off between multiple performance metrics in order to make a comparison among different metrics simpler a summary is presented in table 7 where the optimal value of any metric is the smallest one a radar plot of these multiple performance metrics is then presented in fig 11 fig 11 indicates that none of the data transformations can improve all the performance metrics because different metrics mainly depends on different parts of the prediction a stronger transformation will make the simulation tend to fit the low values demonstrated via r90 at the expense of a poorer fit for high values demonstrated via vbias and rsr in original space rsr and vbias exhibit the same trend for different transformations but an opposite trend in reliability and filliben r statistics it is consistent with the above conclusion when the calibration focuses on high values reliability and filliben r become worse and model fits better in fct space the data variance is more so the distribution of performance metrics changes generally no transformation performance is the worst and log transformation is the best 5 4 selecting the most suitable data transformation if the residual error is homoscedastic there is no need to carry out the data transformation because data transformation introduces more vbias fig 6 the primary purpose of applying data transformation is to normalize the residuals and thereby improve predictive uncertainty estimates across the range of simulated values according to table 6 transformations in this study can also improve the model fit in the low value range improving reliability and increasing the accuracy of assessment of critical conditions moreover a smaller λ 1 will lead to better performance in the above features across the various data transformations considered a log transformation with the smallest λ 1 performs best however this occurs at the cost of a poor fit for high values if the high values are of interest λ 1 should be fixed in wang et al 2012 log sinh transformation performance is found to be superior to box cox transformation when the variance of the prediction variables is suddenly increased however in work presented here the log sinh transformation does not outperform box cox transformation this conclusion is also found in the research of mclnerney et al 2017 if only the small part of peak values are of interest no transformation in fct space can be chosen but could introduce large biases for baseflow events fig 4 an overall framework to select the most suitable transformation is depicted in fig 12 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the ability of various data transformations in improving tss simulations on the basis of the four case studies presented we can make the following conclusions 1 λ 1 the power parameter of box cox transformation and coefficient of the log sinh transformation determines the calibration emphasis and plays the main role in the performance of data transformation a smaller λ 1 suggests the whole calibration will tend to fit to the low values at the expense of a worse fit for higher parts 2 different performance metrics have dependencies across each other the vbias and rsr will be improved together with larger λ 1 because their calculation depends more on the subset of high value data while reliability and error s normality will be increased with smaller λ 1 as reducing λ 1 increases the ability of addressing heterocsedacity 3 none of the transformations provide the best performance across all metrics in a typical situation a log transformation with the smallest λ 1 gives the best performance 4 when λ 1 is calibrated with model parameters its optimal value will be very close to 0 and the box cox transformation and log sinh transformation will have the same contribution as a log transformation based on the general conclusions above a framework for choosing a data transformation fig 12 along with their modified likelihood functions table 1 has been developed this framework however should not be confined to tss simulations alone but can also be applied in the context of hydrologic modeling and other water quality predictions besides normalizing residual errors bwmod needs further modifications to deal with systematic bias due to limited parameter identifiability the tss simulation via bwmod generally is of larger magnitude than observations in the small value range and smaller than observations in the high value range it is likely that structural improvements of bwmod will alleviate this further it should be noted that methods other than transformation may be more suitable for dealing with error heteroscedasticity resulting in better simulations direct representation conditioning the variance of the errors directly on the runoff magnitude or on other covariates has been discussed in the literature and noted to hold promise sorooshian and dracup 1980 thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 renard et al 2011 therefore more elaborate comparisons

than previously thought though it may take multiple years to produce measurable declines in hypoxia due to hydro meteorological variability keywords hypoxia dissolved oxygen modeling bayesian inference neuse river estuary stratification oxygen demand 1 introduction hypoxia is an increasing ecological problem in many estuarine and coastal systems worldwide diaz 2001 it often occurs due to a combination of excessive nutrient inputs and hydro meteorological factors buzzelli et al 2002 rabalais et al 2010 in particular hypoxia occurs when dissolved oxygen do in the bottom layer of a stratified water body is consumed due to organic matter om decomposition faster than it can be replenished from the surface waters officer et al 1984 hypoxia is usually defined by do concentrations of less than 2 g m3 2 mg l which is a physiologically critical level for many estuarine species eby and crowder 2002 selberg et al 2001 eutrophication algal blooms and subsequent hypoxia in estuarine systems can cause fish kills and reduce biodiversity with potential implications for coastal economies pietrafesa et al 2018 rose et al 2009 thomas and rahman 2009 the neuse river estuary nre is a shallow eutrophic estuary paerl et al 1998 with a mean depth of 4 m mean width of 6 5 km and length of 70 km located in southeastern north carolina nc hypoxia algal blooms and fish kills have been documented in the nre since the 1970s christian et al 1991 paerl 1990 phosphorus load to the estuary was substantially reduced in the late 1980s but given no concurrent management action regarding nitrogen phytoplankton blooms continued to occur but shifted downstream paerl et al 2004 and low bottom water do levels have continued to be regularly observed burkholder et al 2006 in the 1990s nitrogen was identified as the primary nutrient limiting biomass production in the estuary rudek et al 1991 and the nc department of environmental quality ncdeq established a total maximum daily load tmdl which required a 30 reduction in the total nitrogen delivered to the head of the estuary by 2009 ncdwq 2001 however by 2009 46 of the estuary area remained impaired due to chlorophyll a and ph violations deamer 2009 and nutrient loading particularly from non point agricultural sources remained elevated strickling and obenour 2018 the nre tmdl development was accompanied by the formulation of three different models stow and borsuk 2003 two of these models bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 had similar mechanistic formulations and provided spatially and temporally detailed simulations of hydrodynamic chemical and biological processes the third model was a bayesian network model borsuk et al 2003 based on a combination of regression and process based approaches borsuk et al 2001a 2001b 2004 in subsequent years alternative modeling approaches have been developed and applied to other waterbodies combining the key features of mechanistic models with bayesian data assimilation and inference for eutrophic lakes malve et al 2007 wu et al 2017 and coastal systems fiechter et al 2013 obenour et al 2015 however there has been limited progress toward dynamically simulating estuarine hypoxia within a bayesian framework despite the need for rigorous uncertainty quantification in the development of water quality models and tmdls arhonditsis and brett 2004 reckhow and chapra 1999 robson 2014 understanding how changes in meteorology hydrology and nutrient loads interact to control eutrophication and hypoxia development is critical for assessing progress toward meeting water quality improvement objectives each driver may influence do dynamics in multiple ways for instance increased flows not only bring more nutrients into the estuary kemp et al 2009 scavia et al 2013 but also reduce residence times while increasing stratification limiting reoxygenation rates of the water column chu and jirka 2003 obenour et al 2015 hybrid modeling approaches where a mechanistic formulation ensures representation of key biophysical processes and bayesian inference accommodates data driven parameter estimation can help reveal the most influential processes leading to hypoxia formation and thus be suitable for decision support the intent of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a hybrid of mechanistic and statistical bayesian inference approaches for assessing and simulating the effects of natural processes and human perturbations on hypoxia formation in a shallow river dominated estuary the study aims to advance dynamic hypoxia simulation within a bayesian framework allowing for a systematic accounting of prior information hypothesis testing and probabilistic forecasting arhonditsis et al 2008 ramin et al 2011 this model is applied to simulate summer nre do dynamics on a daily scale over a 19 year study period 1997 2015 the main objectives of the model application are to i understand the relative importance of major anthropogenic and hydro meteorological drivers of estuary hypoxia ii describe the temporal variability of subpycnocline oxygen demand iii provide a rigorous characterization of process and predictive uncertainty and iv assist in revealing possible management options for hypoxia mitigation in the nre 2 materials and methods this section first introduces data sources necessary for model construction then the design of the mechanistic model is provided in four steps first parsimonious differential equations are formulated representing the primary biophysical processes controlling bottom layer subpycnocline dissolved oxygen bldo dynamics second a process of identifying drivers of long term sediment mediated oxygen demand ltod is introduced third vertical mixing using an empirical sub model for water column stability potential is formulated fourth longitudinal dispersion of estuary water quality constituents is introduced finally methods for calibration within a bayesian framework assessment of model skill and characterization of model sensitivities to biophysical forcings are explained 2 1 data a variety of datasets were compiled for model development bathymetry data with 30 m resolution were retrieved from the digital elevation model portal noaa daily neuse river discharge at fort barnwell fb located 35 km upstream of the upper model boundary fig 1 was obtained from the united states geographical survey usgs water quality data included monthly measurements of total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from fb collected by ncdeq which were retrieved from epa also biweekly once every 2 weeks observations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen particulate nitrogen and orthophosphate for streets ferry bridge sf were obtained from the nre modeling and monitoring program modmon the same water quality measurements along with vertical profiles of salinity temperature and do were also provided by modmon at nine sampling locations along the nre fig 1 meteorological data consisting of air temperature wind speed and wind direction were supplied by the ncco hourly measurements at cherry point knkt were used as the primary meteorological input and missing knkt data were imputed based on regressions with data from trent woods nnwb and new bern kewn these regressions as well as nutrient loading and boundary conditions are specified in supporting material sections s1 and s2 2 2 mechanistic model formulation bldo dynamics for the nre were described with a parsimonious process based model developed from a series of ordinary differential equations these equations included nutrient transport organic matter production and bldo consumption and reaeration differential equations were solved numerically with a daily time step as absolute daily changes in oxygen were generally small averaging less than 0 6 g m3 d using forward euler s method chapra 2008 numerical dispersion was calculated and considered negligible averaging only 1 of physical longitudinal dispersion model segmentation was based on dividing the estuary into six compartments assuming each a well mixed reactor fig 2 this conceptual formulation was motivated by the analysis of gradients in water quality and bathymetry data the estuary was longitudinally divided into upper middle and lower segments and vertically divided by the average pycnocline depth into surface and bottom layers compartment volumes areas and thicknesses were estimated using gis grass 2017 table s1 2 2 1 mass balance equations for nutrients bldo nitrogen and phosphorus in surface waters are delivered via river flow and used in production of om thus the differential equation for bioavailable nitrogen or phosphorus concentration x g m3 in the surface layer had the following form 1 d x i d t q x i 1 x i v s i ν s x i h s i d s i 1 i v s i x i x i 1 d s i i 1 v s i x i 1 x i hereinafter i represents model segments 1 2 and 3 upper middle and lower respectively dx dt g m3 d is the time rate of change for bioavailable nutrient concentration q m3 d is neuse river discharge ν s m d is an effective settling velocity representing production and settling of organic matter associated with these nutrients h s m is surface layer thickness v s m3 is volume of the surface layer and d s m3 d is a bulk longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the surface layer here d s i 1 i d a s i 1 i l i 1 i and d s i i 1 d a s i i 1 l i i 1 where d m2 d is a dispersion coefficient described in section 2 2 4 a s m2 is the cross sectional area between model compartments and l m is the length across which the mixing takes place based on the distance between segment midpoints chapra 2008 for the upper segment i 1 indicates the upper boundary while for the lower segment i 1 corresponds to the lower model boundary thus x i 1 g m3 for the upper segment is the incoming bioavailable nitrogen or phosphorus concentration bioavailable nitrogen included dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in and a portion of organic nitrogen on in such that x i 1 din in f n on in with parameter f n determining the bioavailable fraction of on in phosphorus loading input consisted of orthophosphate op in and a portion of nonreactive phosphorus np in calculated by subtracting orthophosphate loading at sf from total phosphorus loading at fb thus the bioavailable phosphorus concentration entering the upper segment is determined as x i 1 op in f p np in with parameter f p representing the bioavailable fraction of np in both f n and f p were calibrated within the bayesian framework section 2 3 for the upper segment the limiting nutrient was determined by comparing the ratio of bioavailable nitrogen to phosphorus concentrations at the upper boundary to the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio required for organic matter production r n p gn gp which was set to an expected value of 7 2 gn gp redfield et al 1963 as the estuary is always nitrogen limited during may october in its middle and lower segments pinckney et al 1999 rudek et al 1991 a mass balance on phosphorus was performed only for the freshwater dominated upper segment nitrogen limitation is typical for more saline coastal waters due to efficient recycling of phosphorus and high denitrification rates howarth and marino 2006 nixon 1995 when phosphorus was limiting in the upper segment nitrogen was reduced proportionally to phosphorus based on r n p om produced from bioavailable nutrients eventually settles to the bottom compartments the differential equation for om in the bottom layer represented in units of carbon c g m3 was 2 d c i d t ν s r c n n i h b i k c c i θ c t 20 d b i 1 i v b i c i c i 1 d b i i 1 v b i c i 1 c i here dc dt g m3 d is the time rate of change in carbon concentration and h b m and v b m3 are thickness and volume of the bottom compartment respectively organic carbon decomposes at rate k c d 1 and r c n gc gn is the ratio of organic carbon to nitrogen based on redfield ratio 5 68 gc gn d b m3 d is a bulk longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the bottom layer determined similarly to d s in eq 1 the rates of most reactions are dependent on temperature t c via the arrhenius equation with θ c representing the temperature constant for om decay which is set to 1 047 chapra 2008 daily water temperature was estimated via linear regression with meteorological variables eq s6 current velocities tidally oscillate from upstream to downstream in nre bottom waters but there is little net advection mcninch and luettich 2000 therefore dispersion but not advection was included in eq 2 bldo is consumed by decomposition of om and it is replenished via reaeration through the pycnocline the differential equation for bldo represented as o b g m3 had the following form 3 d o b i d t o s i o b i θ r t 20 k l i h b i r o c k c c i θ c t 20 l j θ l t 20 h b i o b i k s o o b i d b i 1 i v b i o b i o b i 1 d b i i 1 v b i o b i 1 o b i here do b dt g m3 d is the

1996 θ r and θ l are temperature adjustment parameters for reaeration and oxygen demand which were set to typical values of 1 024 and 1 065 respectively chapra 2008 as bldo levels approach zero oxygen demands were inhibited as represented with a monod relationship with k so g m3 being the half saturation constant monod 1949 set to a value of 1 4 g m3 based on previous studies epa 1985 lam et al 1987 at low bldo om continued to diminish eq 2 assuming organic carbon decomposition via anaerobic processes including denitrification and reduction of sulfate to sulfide canfield 1994 chapra 2008 further discussed in section 4 1 2 2 2 2 yearly ltod variation one goal of this study was to explore hypotheses regarding factors influencing ltod which includes oxidation of less labile and refractory om accumulated in the sediments ltod may vary temporally due to changes in primary productivity flow and nutrient loading but over longer time scales than stod kemp et al 1992 rucinski et al 2014 ltod with index j indicating year was determined using the following equation 4 l j l 1 γ x j here l g m2 d is the average ltod for the study period x j is a candidate covariate and γ is a corresponding ltod adjustment coefficient estimated through bayesian calibration several potentially relevant covariates were proposed and tested total nitrogen and phosphorus loads and concentrations and longitudinal velocities i e discharge normalized by segment cross sectional area for efficiency the process of covariate selection included the following steps first the mechanistic model was calibrated assuming no ltod variation l j l second yearly bias was calculated i e yearly average difference between predicted and observed values based on the constant ltod model third the yearly bias was regressed on the candidate predictor variables various running averages of each candidate predictor up to 12 months for each year were considered to assess different temporal scales on which the proposed variables might affect ltod the running averages were calculated based on periods leading up to 1 may as subsequent loads and flows were represented in the model as stod the covariate most strongly correlated with the annual bias was then evaluated in the bayesian modeling framework using eq 4 and the significance of γ was assessed 2 2 3 reaeration and water column stability potential reaeration of bottom water layers was represented by vertical oxygen diffusion through the pycnocline vertical diffusion is dependent on the interaction of multiple factors including meteorological conditions flow regime and estuary depth for instance wind stress may increase horizontal shear in the water column thereby producing higher rates of diffusion borsuk et al 2001b buzzelli et al 2002 at the same time elevated river discharges provide fresh water that generally promotes density stratification obenour et al 2012 scully 2013 except in cases of hurricanes when estuaries are completely flushed and destratified burkholder et al 2004 paerl et al 2001 here water column stability is represented in the form of richardson number ri that was estimated using the following formulation henderson sellers 1984 5 r i g ρ ρ z ω 2 z 2 here ρ z g m4 is the pycnocline density gradient g is acceleration due to gravity ρ g m3 is water density z m is pycnocline depth and ω m s is wind shear velocity which can be estimated from wind speed henderson sellers 1984 spigel and imberger 1987 eq 5 can be rewritten as ri ϕ g ρ ω 2 where ϕ is defined here as stability potential ρ z z 2 which was determined from density profile data estimated from measured profiles of temperature and salinity millero and poisson 1981 as daily inputs of ϕ were required for model simulations and density profiles were only available on a biweekly basis linear regressions were developed for each segment to estimate stability potential candidate covariates included wind speed ws river discharge q and air temperature t a wind blowing along the longitudinal axis of the lower nre was previously found to affect saltwater intrusion in the estuary giese et al 1985 and therefore a longitudinal wind velocity lwv predictor representing the component of wind velocity along this axis was also included the process of variables selection and prescreening is described in section s4 the response ϕ was cube root transformed to minimize heteroscedasticity of residuals faraway 2015 standardized regression residuals were examined to confirm an even distribution lack of substantial bias or heteroscedasticity fig s1 vertical diffusion coefficient e m2 s controlling the exchange of oxygen through the pycnocline was estimated as a function of richardson number martin and mccutcheon 1999 munk and anderson 1948 6 e e 0 1 α r i β here e 0 m2 s is the diffusion coefficient at neutral stability defined as ω h 34 where h m is total water column depth martin and mccutcheon 1999 dimensionless parameters α and β were calibrated within the bayesian framework transfer coefficient k l m d was calculated dividing e by the mixing length which was set to 0 5 m after analysis of vertical density profiles the assumption of the constant mixing length is consistent with previous hypoxia modeling studies justić et al 2002 obenour et al 2015 2 2 4 estuary longitudinal dispersion to account for longitudinal mixing between segments a dispersion coefficient d m2 d was utilized longitudinal dispersion may be explained by a number of processes including tidal interaction with bathymetry wind induced currents or internal circulation due to buoyancy fischer 1976 cross section average salinities were employed to estimate d in this study as salt is a conservative tracer details can be found in supporting material section s5 2 3 prior information and model calibration the mechanistic model included 9 parameters that could not be well constrained based on prior research alone and which were thus estimated through bayesian inference table s2 the bayesian framework allowed parameter estimation considering existing knowledge i e prior distribution updated based on the model and bldo calibration data i e likelihood function resulting in probabilistic posterior parameter estimates gelman et al 2013 bayesian inference was performed using rstan software rstan 2017 which applies hamiltonian monte carlo hmc sampling kruschke 2015 three parallel sampling chains were run each consisting of 7500 iterations convergence among chains was considered satisfactory when the square root of the ratio between the total variance and variance within the chains was equal to one gelman and rubin 1992 after convergence 5000 posterior samples were kept for posterior analyses to avoid computational instabilities during the hmc process the limiting nutrient was selected based on f p and f n from a preliminary hmc run and updated iteratively in successive runs until the initial and posterior estimate converged to within a 10 difference prior parameter distributions were determined from previous field observations laboratory experiments and other literature the lower bounds for the first 8 parameters in table s2 were set to zero as negative values are mechanistically unrealistic the prior for the average ltod represented as l was derived from in situ fisher et al 1982 sauber 1998 and laboratory alperin et al 2000 rizzo and christian 1996 estimates of sediment oxygen demand however in situ measurements of sediment oxygen demand might also include stod i e seasonal om production that settles all of the way to the bottom therefore l was assigned a wide left skew normal distribution azzalini 2013 with mean of 0 51 g m2 d average from lab studies and mode of 0 80 g m2 d overall average an informative prior for the organic carbon decomposition rate k c was introduced as a normal distribution centered on 0 03 d 1 with standard deviation of 0 01 d 1 based on reported rates of phytoplankton decomposition harvey and macko 1997 hopkinson et al 2002 as phytoplankton account for at least 80 of particulate om in the nre paerl et al 2004 effective settling velocity ν s which represents the growth and sinking of phytoplankton was assigned a wider normal prior with mean of 0 2 m d and standard deviation of 0 05 m d based on previous studies chapra et al 2016 obenour et al 2015 parameter f p influencing phosphorus bioavailability received a normally distributed prior with mean 0 30 and standard deviation 0 10 with outer limits of zero and one based on previous studies related to bioavailability of particulate phosphorus ellison and brett 2006 gerdes and kunst 1998 parameter f n influencing nitrogen bioavailability was defined using a beta distribution alpha 2 05 and beta 5 83 having a mean of 0 3 and 97 5 quantile at 0 65 this upper quantile corresponded to the upper level of dissolved organic nitrogen bioavailability bronk et al 2007 seitzinger 1997 as reported values for dimensionless parameters α and β affecting vertical diffusion in eq 6 range over two orders of magnitude martin and mccutcheon 1999 their priors were set to have weakly informative normal distributions with zero mean and standard deviations of 10 and 100 respectively the prior for residual standard deviation σ was set as a weakly informative normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviations of 10 g m3 ltod adjustment coefficient γ in eq 4 had a weakly informative prior normal distribution centered at zero and unlike other parameters negative values were allowed 2 4 model assessment sensitivity and scenario analysis the model was assessed for predictive skill using root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which is the fraction of observational variance explained by the model faraway 2015 r2 values were calculated for biweekly observations and for bimonthly mean value for 2 months bldo rmse and r2 are intuitive measures of predictive skill but are not useful for characterizing predictive uncertainty as they employ only the means of predictive distributions therefore posterior parameters distributions were also used to derive 90 credible and prediction intervals credible intervals accounted for parameter uncertainties while prediction intervals considered both parameter uncertainty and residual standard deviation gelman et al 2013 mcelreath 2016 to test the robustness of the model a threefold cross validation was performed stone 1974 the cross validation procedure consisted of removal of three test periods in turn 1997 2003 2004 2009 2010 2015 and recalibrating the model for the remaining training years after recalibration model predictions were made for the removed test periods and compared to observations additionally to explore the relative importance of different drivers of hypoxia bldo sensitivities to meteorological input wind and temperature and riverine input flows and nutrient loads were assessed section s7 the model was also applied to examine the effect of near term i e seasonal nutrient loading reductions on mean july august midsummer bldo concentrations and number of hypoxic days bldo 2 g m3 scenarios were simulated by adjusting daily riverine nutrient loads by fixed percentages under 3 different ltod conditions low average and high corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of yearly ltod respectively loading reductions were simulated over the entire 19 year study period and results were averaged across years 3 results 3 1 bldo model calibration eight mechanistic model parameters were probabilistically estimated within the bayesian framework for all parameters marginal posterior distributions are narrower than the prior distributions fig 3 suggesting that the model formulation is appropriate for leveraging calibration data to refine knowledge of key rates through bayesian inference brun et al 2001 del giudice et al 2015 results exhibit negligible correlations between most parameters however there is a notable correlation between dimensionless parameters α and β r 0 90 used in vertical diffusion coefficient calculation eq 6 indicating that these parameters cannot be well identified independently of each other the best estimate mean of the posterior distribution of effective settling velocity ν s describing the rate at which nutrients are converted to om and subsequently sink through the pycnocline is 0 20 m d this estimate is within the range of previously reported settling rates for the nre bales and robbins 1999 bowen and hieronymus 2000 lung and paerl 1988 and is consistent with the mean estimate of effective settling velocity documented for the northern gulf of mexico hypoxic zone obenour et al 2015 and for the great lakes chapra et al 2016 at the same time the standard deviation of the posterior estimate is 80 smaller than that of the prior distribution indicating the calibration data strongly reinforce the prior the best estimate for k c 0 035 d 1 is notably higher than the prior with substantially reduced uncertainty i e standard deviation decreases by 90 suggesting a decomposition rate typical of labile phytoplankton garber 1984 the best estimates for parameters α and β relating water column stability to vertical diffusion and reaeration are 19 9 and 0 516 with standard deviations of 6 6 and 0 017 respectively the best estimate of mean ltod l is 0 46 g m2 d which is somewhat lower than the prior estimate section 4 1 2 bioavailable fractions of nonreactive phosphorus and organic nitrogen in the nutrient loadings f p and f n have best estimates 0 29 and 0 38 which are within previously reported ranges ellison and brett 2006 fan et al 2003 the model was calibrated with and without the annual ltod adjustment via the γ parameter discussed more in section 3 2 inclusion of ltod adjustment decreases the best estimate of l by only 4 9 and does not strongly affect other parameter distributions fig 3 3 2 ltod yearly variation and role in bldo balance in order to parameterize the ltod adjustment various predictors that plausibly influence ltod were analyzed correlations between these predictors and yearly mean model bias in predicted subpycnocline do i e bldo obtained from the constant ltod model were compared the strongest correlation was found with november april longitudinal velocity table s3 and fig s2 this relationship is the highest in the upstream segment r 0 55 where it is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level other notable correlations include a positive relationship between bias and total phosphorus concentration dec apr in the upper segment r 0 36 and a positive relationship between bias and total nitrogen concentration aug apr in the middle segment r 0 25 though both are not significant p 0 05 as opposed to concentrations nutrient loadings displayed a negative relationship with model bias however negative relationships between nutrient loadings and model bias are mechanistically implausible and likely the result of a confounding high correlation between flow and velocity and load due to these mechanistic and statistical considerations longitudinal velocities were selected as a potential control of ltod variability in the bayesian model longitudinal velocities were centered on zero by subtracting mean velocity of each segment such that under mean flow the ltod in each segment is l parameter γ had a best estimate of 0 376 d km and standard deviation 0 107 d km as the 99 quantile of γ did not cross zero 0 117 d km fig 3 this strongly indicated that high november april longitudinal velocities were associated with low summer ltod fig s3 the model allowed for comparing actual to inhibited oxygen demand and for partitioning bldo consumption between stod and ltod inhibition of both stod and ltod occurs when the bldo concentration approaches zero so there is little available do to support aerobic om decomposition section 2 2 1 and eq 3 the model results indicate that on average 43 40 and 33 of potential may october oxygen demand in the upper middle and lower segments is inhibited actual after adjustment for inhibition may october combined volumetric stod and ltod has mean values of 0 93 0 88 and 0 79 g m3 d for upper middle and lower segments respectively during july august when hypoxia is most severe inhibition is higher averaging 50 46 and 37 in upper middle and lower segments respectively the percentage of average midsummer volumetric oxygen demand attributed to stod which represents decomposition of near term produced labile organic carbon is 34 34 and 40 for upper middle and lower segments the rest of oxygen demand is ltod fig 4 which is associated with decomposition of less labile and refractory om primarily within the sediment layer we note that particulate organic carbon sampled in the bottom water layer of the estuary averages 1 67 g m3 based on modmon data and predicted organic carbon averages 4 25 g m3 the latter value which is associated with stod is expected to be higher because it includes both particulate and dissolved organic matter as well as recently produced labile particulate matter that has settled all of the way to the estuary bottom which would not be retrieved in water column samples according to the model phosphorus limitation of stod related production occurred 82 of the time in the upper segment being most common in may and october otherwise nitrogen was limiting 3 3 vertical diffusion and longitudinal dispersion vertical diffusion controlling bldo reaeration in the water quality model was determined as a function of stability potential ϕ section 2 2 3 cube root transformed stability potential was predicted by linear regression for each estuary segment with covariates selected via exhaustive search process penalizing for overfitting using bic criterion section s4 7 ϕ u 3 3 69 1 97 ln q 2 1 29 ln q 60 0 36 ln q 2

segments respectively while subscripts for covariates represent number of days averaged before an observation the best performing model for the upper segment eq 7 includes positive relationships with natural log transformed 2 and 60 day averaged flows and negative relationships with 10 day wind speed and 60 day longitudinal wind velocity as well as a negative interaction between the two flow variables the best performing models for the middle and lower segments eqs 8 and 9 include positive relationships with natural log transformed 2 day flow and 2 day temperature and negative relationships with 10 day longitudinal wind velocity in general when predicting stability potential discharge has the major influence on the response for the upper and middle model segments whereas longitudinal wind velocity is the more important explanatory variable for the lower segment compare coefficients for 2 day flow among eqs 7 9 all coefficients are statistically significant p 0 05 the resulting regressions explain 27 21 and 36 variability in biweekly cube root ϕ observations for upper middle and lower segments respectively daily estimates of stability potential were used for calculating vertical diffusion in eq 6 and oxygen transfer coefficients k l mean values of k l calculated dividing vertical diffusion coefficient by mixing length are 0 14 0 15 and 0 18 m d for upper middle and lower segments respectively similar rates have been reported for hypoxic regions in the northern gulf of mexico justić et al 1996 and black sea podymov et al 2017 average longitudinal dispersion for the model was estimated from the salinity model eq s7 the calibrated mean longitudinal dispersion d is 362 m2 s which is within the range of previously reported values for estuaries chapra 2008 kashefipour and falconer 2002 shaha et al 2011 the model explained 78 of the variability in observed salinities 3 4 model skill model performance for bldo was assessed in terms of r2 i e percent variance explained and rmse in addition time series plots with 90 credible and predictive intervals fig 5 were visually examined on average predictive uncertainty associated with model residuals reflecting model simplifications and measurement errors is 2 09 times greater than that of parameter uncertainty overall the model explains 40 46 and 57 of variability in biweekly observations of bldo for the upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 top row corresponding rmse values are 1 87 1 72 1 57 g m3 respectively remaining bldo variability might be due to sudden wind induced mixing events including lateral mixing and other spatio temporal fluctuations that cannot be captured given the coarse resolution of the model and available input data the model calibrated to biweekly data also performs well at aggregated bimonthly scale when comparing and averaging the corresponding days of observations and predictions the model explains 47 62 and 78 of bimonthly mean bldo for upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 middle row and 62 across segments for the case where instead of averaging predictions on observation days only all daily predictions in a given bimonthly period are averaged the model explains 48 67 and 68 of observed variance for upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 bottom row in addition model results indicate that hypoxia peaks in july august consistent with observations model skill was further tested in a threefold cross validation that evaluates performance when predicting observations excluded from the calibration data set in cross validation where each fold represents one third of the study period the model explains 44 58 and 76 of bimonthly variability in bldo in all three segments this is just slightly lower than model performance when calibrated to the full dataset 47 62 and 78 suggesting robustness of the model to potential long term system variability in addition only 9 7 of the observations are outside of the 90 prediction intervals in the cross validated model consistent with fig 5 indicating uncertainty is realistically quantified 3 5 bldo sensitivity to wind flow and nutrient loading sensitivity analysis suggests that riverine inputs flow and load have higher impact than local meteorological inputs wind and temperature on the interannual variability in midsummer bldo fig 7 standard deviation of the year to year variability of july august bldo for the full model accounting for both riverine and meteorological variability is 0 63 g m3 in comparison the standard deviation attributable to riverine inputs is 0 53 g m3 and the standard deviation for meteorological inputs is only 0 38 g m3 this indicates that riverine inputs control more of the interannual variability in hypoxia than meteorological inputs influencing reaeration and temperature dependent rates results also indicate that in some years meteorological and riverine inputs combine to amplify e g 2012 or minimize e g 1998 hypoxia fig 7 in other years e g 2014 meteorological and riverine inputs have compensating effects resulting in moderate bldo conditions overall midsummer bldo variability due to riverine inputs is mildly correlated with meteorological inputs r 0 36 3 6 nutrient loading reduction scenarios nutrient load reduction scenarios indicate increases in midsummer bldo concentration and decreases in number of hypoxic days by virtue of stod reduction fig 8 however there is a varying effect of loading reductions on midsummer bldo depending on the ltod level for example a 30 reduction in nutrient loadings will result in average midsummer bldo increases of 0 31 0 25 and 0 21 g m3 across all segments given low average and high ltod conditions respectively fig 8 top row for the same load reduction the number of hypoxic days averaged across segments will decrease by 33 5 23 4 and 18 7 respectively fig 8 bottom row clearly bldo is more strongly affected by near term nutrient loadings reduction for low ltod as compared to high ltod conditions for small reductions in nutrient load i e 30 or less the bldo response is approximately linear such that each 10 decrease in nutrient supply relative to current conditions would result in an average 0 12 g m3 and 0 08 g m3 midsummer bldo increase for low and high ltod conditions respectively similarly each 10 nutrient reduction would approximately result in 9 8 2 1 day and 5 3 1 8 day decrease in the number of hypoxic days for low and high ltod conditions respectively results indicate that higher reductions in nutrient load i e 30 have a stronger non linear effect on both midsummer bldo and the number of hypoxic days 4 discussion this study illustrates a hybrid water quality modeling approach where dynamic mechanistic simulation and statistical inference are combined to study hypoxia dynamics in a shallow coastal water body bayesian inference provides an opportunity to probabilistically estimate unknown model parameters while accounting for prior knowledge in addition the approach makes it possible to distinguish and quantify the effects of both parameter uncertainty and residual uncertainty in model predictions while some past dynamic nre modeling efforts have been developed considering only a few reference years bales and robbins 1999 bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 this nre model is calibrated over a substantially longer period 1997 2015 which includes a wide range of hydro meteorological conditions as supported by our cross validation analysis this helps ensure robust characterization of mechanisms causing variability in subpycnocline do across multiple temporal scales a previous probabilistic process based model of nre hypoxia borsuk et al 2001b considered an 11 year period of record but did not simulate relationships between nutrient loading and oxygen demand compared to previous bayesian hypoxia models based largely on steady state relationships liu and scavia 2010 obenour et al 2015 this study advances numerical simulation of oxygen dynamics within the bayesian framework at the same time we recognize the limitations of our parsimonious mechanistic approach relative to high dimensionality water quality models wool et al 2003 the coarse model resolution only distinguishes three longitudinal segments and no lateral variability also the 1 day time step cannot account for diel cycles in dissolved oxygen or sudden wind events in addition the model simplifies biogeochemical processes such that phytoplankton production and sediment diagenesis are not explicitly simulated see section 4 1 2 despite these strategic simplifications the model captures important drivers of bldo dynamics and performs well in cross validation in addition the parsimonious mechanistic approach is computationally efficient which helps accommodate a long calibration period bayesian inference of process rates and uncertainty quantification the model is transferable to other estuaries where hydro meteorological and nutrient input data are available water column calibration data are also important though the posterior parameter distributions developed here could be used as informative prior information for applications to data poor systems 4 1 mechanisms driving hypoxia 4 1 1 water column reaeration model results indicate that both flow and meteorological conditions play important roles in controlling vertical diffusion in the estuary stability potential ϕ which is a function of pycnocline depth and gradient is estimated from linear regressions with river discharge wind speed longitudinal wind velocity and air temperature as covariates section 3 3 increased freshwater discharge generally leads to increased stability in all three segments however results for the upper segment eq 7 indicate a negative interaction term between 2 and 60 day flows such that under very high flow conditions for both 2 and 60 day stability is reduced this interaction is consistent with the expectation that extreme flow events will completely flush saltwater from the upper estuary thus eliminating density stratification buzzelli et al 2002 in addition longitudinal wind velocity lwv which represents the northeasterly component of wind velocity is found to be negatively related to stability in all three segments this result is consistent with the expectation that northeasterly winds reduce stability by pushing saltwater upstream giese et al 1985 while southwesterly winds move freshwater downstream over the surface of the estuary mcninch and luettich 2000 this straining effect of longitudinal winds has been reported for other estuaries as well li and li 2011 scully et al 2005 finally wind speed independent of direction was negatively related to stability in the upper segment and water temperature was positively related to stability in the middle and lower segments consistent with mechanistic expectations and previous studies identifying the nre as intermittently mixed system borsuk et al 2001b martin and mccutcheon 1999 mcninch and luettich 2000 selberg et al 2001 overall bldo model performance in terms of r2 increases by 12 on average across segments when using these regressions for stability potential as opposed to using constant segment specific median values for stability potential this is remarkable given that the regressions eqs 7 9 explain less than 40 of the variability in stability potential the low regression performance may be due to short term noisiness of density profiles spatial mismatch of the meteorological and observation stations and the limitations of using simple linear relationships relative to a hydrodynamic circulation model nonetheless the regressions for stability potential appear to capture changes in stratification relevant to bldo dynamics these results demonstrate how empirical relationships for water column stability can be integrated within a mechanistic water quality model to improve predictive capabilities 4 1 2 sources and variation of oxygen demand there is notable annual and intersegmental variability in both stod and ltod fig 4 this variability is controlled in part by high oxygen demand inhibition due to low summer bldo concentrations inhibition is less severe in the lower segment due to higher average bldo concentrations compared to the upper and middle segments these results are influenced by the morphology of the estuary as thinner bottom layers in the upper and middle segments table s1 are depleted of oxygen more quickly than the thicker bottom layer of the lower segment paerl et al 1998 furthermore results indicate that oxygen demand per unit volume is typically higher in the upper and middle segments than in the lower fig 4 across segments may october areal oxygen demand is found to average 0 71 and 1 16 g m2 d for actual and total including inhibited oxygen demand respectively these values are similar to the combined benthic and lower water column oxygen demand of 1 02 g m2 d estimated previously borsuk et al 2001b this previous estimate is a year round average without considering inhibition about one third of july august oxygen demand is attributed to stod in this study while the rest is due to ltod which was estimated through calibration to historical data fig 4 these results support the idea that long term benthic processes dominate bldo demand alperin et al 2000 eldridge and morse 2008 kemp et al 1992 compared to decomposition of near term seasonally produced om that is reflected as stod in the model the calibrated estimate of mean ltod is similar to oxygen demands derived from laboratory benthic flux experiments rizzo and christian 1996 but lower than in situ sediment oxygen demand measurements fisher et al 1982 sauber 1998 this was expected as in situ measurements likely include seasonally produced organic matter that has settled to the estuary bottom which is attributed to stod in this study in addition in situ measurements were taken at deeper locations in the estuary where higher oxygen demand is typically expected fear et al 2004 a limitation of this model is that it explicitly represents only aerobic decomposition of organic matter i e oxygen demand not inhibited by low bldo the organic matter associated with inhibited oxygen demand is assumed to be decomposed anaerobically driven by sulfate reduction denitrification and methanogenesis fear et al 2005 matson and brinson 1985 it is implicitly assumed that the products of these reactions either escape to the surface layer during mixing events where they are oxidized sulfide methane escape to atmosphere nitrogen gas methane gas chapra 2008 or precipitate to the sediment iron sulfide matson et al 1983 and are subsumed in ltod representation of the above mentioned processes would require a complex sediment diagenetic model di toro 2001 and the addition of several state variables that are not regularly monitored which is beyond the scope of this study but could be beneficial in future research 4 1 3 temporal ltod variability in the model ltod is inferred to be influenced by the year to year variability in november april longitudinal velocities via parameter γ section 3 2 higher river discharge intensifies longitudinal velocities leading to increased flushing and reduced time to produce and settle om in the nre this effect may be especially pronounced in winter when colder temperatures slow biological processes and reduce growth rates of some phytoplankton species reynolds 2006 these results are in line with previous studies that indicated the strong effect of flow on residence times and spatio temporal variability of biomass in the nre borsuk et al 2004 peierls et al 2012 which will then affect accumulation of organic matter in the sediment westrich and berner 1984 at the same time results do not indicate any long term temporal trend in ltod or stod which suggests that the system has neither significantly improved nor worsened during the last 19 years 4 2 implications for hypoxia forecasting and management riverine model inputs account for 62 of the simulated year to year variability in july august bldo concentration while remaining variability can be attributed largely to meteorology fig 7 the prevailing role of flow and nutrient loadings can be explained by the fact that the neuse river controls both ltod and stod while also influencing reaeration rates short term meteorology on the other hand affects only reaeration and temperature dependent rates with mean july august temperature varying little from year to year 0 7 c standard deviation thus the model naturally lends itself to be applied for forecasting hypoxia throughout the summer given riverine flows and nutrient loads which could potentially be obtained through watershed modeling the model also provides a means for testing watershed nutrient loading reduction scenarios under various levels of ltod fig 8 while stod is directly influenced by seasonal nutrient loading ltod varies over longer time scales understanding the drivers and time scales of oxygen demand is important for developing realistic expectations for hypoxia mitigation in general less severe hypoxia is expected in years with high winter flows and longitudinal velocities and low nutrient loadings in may october this result further highlights the important role of the river flow in controlling estuary eutrophication borsuk et al 2004 past modeling efforts supported a 30 reduction in total nitrogen load to improve water quality in the nre by mitigating high chlorophyll levels deamer 2009 stow et al 2003 this modeling effort while not explicitly representing chlorophyll suggests that a 30 reduction in seasonal nutrient loadings will lead to substantial reductions in the number of hypoxic days in all segments of the estuary fig 8 this outcome contrasts with previous modeling that suggested a non significant change in the number of hypoxic days in response to even 60 nitrogen loading reduction borsuk et al 2003 other nre modeling studies bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 only reported how nutrient management would reduce chlorophyll not hypoxia thus the quantitative linkage between riverine nutrient loading and hypoxia via organic matter production as provided in this study could be an important consideration for estuarine management at the same time reductions in nutrient loading may not immediately produce improvements in hypoxia as much of the temporal variability in bldo is controlled by hydrometeorology nutrient loading reduction scenarios suggest it would take about 3 years to be 90 confident of producing an increase in mean may october bldo in the nre relative to the current mean of 3 2 g m3 following a 30 nutrient loading reduction fig 9 solid orange line furthermore if samples are only collected at a biweekly twice per month frequency as is currently the case it will take about 10 years to be 90 confident of actually observing such an improvement fig 9 dashed orange line as intra annual stochasticity adds more uncertainty to estimated mean bldo this temporal stochasticity is likely attributable to small scale hydrodynamic variations deficiencies in model input and calibration data e g measurement error and biophysical processes that are not fully represented within the mechanistic model in this study the effect of nutrient loading reductions on both mean bldo and the number of hypoxic days is the greatest for low ltod conditions fig 8 high ltod conditions facilitate midsummer hypoxia and increased oxygen demand inhibition such that variations in stod driven by seasonal nutrient loading are less relevant because they are largely inhibited while a significant positive relationship between nutrient loading and ltod was not observed in this study results of other studies suggest that persistent loading reductions may eventually lead to decreases in ltod as om stored in the sediment is depleted faster than it is replenished from the water column borsuk et al 2001a del giudice et al 2018 greening and janicki 2006 kemp et al 2009 mallin et al 2005 further research is required to quantify the time scales over which benthic oxygen demands respond to changes in watershed nutrient loading 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the utility of a hybrid mechanistic bayesian model for simulating estuary hypoxia its mechanistic structure provides a dynamic representation of oxygen demand and reaeration while the bayesian framework allows for including prior information about system processes while characterizing model uncertainties to our knowledge this is the first study to simulate hypoxia based on a numerical solution to a series of mass balance differential equations within a bayesian framework for the 19 year study period the model explains roughly half of variability in biweekly bldo observations from may to october and higher percentages in the variability of bimonthly averages results of cross validation indicate the robustness of the model so that it can be applied for forecasting and long term scenario analysis serving as a supportive tool for watershed managers interannual ltod variation was found to be associated with average november to april longitudinal velocities which indicates that elevated winter flows flush nutrients and organic matter from the estuary lowering subsequent summer ltod rates from a management perspective the results demonstrate that seasonal loading reductions will reduce stod and the intensity and duration of summer hypoxia for instance a 30 loading reduction would increase the average july august bldo concentration by 11 and decrease the amount of hypoxic days by 25 further reductions in hypoxia could be achieved if ltod can also be ameliorated potentially by reducing rates of organic matter accumulation in sediments over the long term data availability all data are publicly available as described in section 2 1 code generated during the study is available

seasonal primary production while the rest is depleted meeting long term oxygen demand ltod associated with storage of organic matter in estuary sediments interannual ltod variation is associated with november april longitudinal velocities suggesting elevated flushing in winter decreases oxygen demands in summer results also indicate that the system is more responsive to nutrient loading reductions

inference neuse river estuary stratification oxygen demand 1 introduction hypoxia is an increasing ecological problem in many estuarine and coastal systems worldwide diaz 2001 it often occurs due to a combination of excessive nutrient inputs and hydro meteorological factors buzzelli et al 2002 rabalais et al 2010 in particular hypoxia occurs when dissolved oxygen do in the bottom layer of a stratified water body is consumed due to organic matter om decomposition faster than it can be replenished from the surface waters officer et al 1984 hypoxia is usually defined by do concentrations of less than 2 g m3 2 mg l which is a physiologically critical level for many estuarine species eby and crowder 2002 selberg et al 2001 eutrophication algal blooms and subsequent hypoxia in estuarine systems can cause fish kills and reduce biodiversity with potential implications for coastal economies pietrafesa et al 2018 rose et al 2009 thomas and rahman 2009 the neuse river estuary nre is a shallow eutrophic estuary paerl et al 1998 with a mean depth of 4 m mean width of 6 5 km and length of 70 km located in southeastern north carolina nc hypoxia algal blooms and fish kills have been documented in the nre since the 1970s christian et al 1991 paerl 1990 phosphorus load to the estuary was substantially reduced in the late 1980s but given no concurrent management action regarding nitrogen phytoplankton blooms continued to occur but shifted downstream paerl et al 2004 and low bottom water do levels have continued to be regularly observed burkholder et al 2006 in the 1990s nitrogen was identified as the primary nutrient limiting biomass production in the estuary rudek et al 1991 and the nc department of environmental quality ncdeq established a total maximum daily load tmdl which required a 30 reduction in the total nitrogen delivered to the head of the estuary by 2009 ncdwq 2001 however by 2009 46 of the estuary area remained impaired due to chlorophyll a and ph violations deamer 2009 and nutrient loading particularly from non point agricultural sources remained elevated strickling and obenour 2018 the nre tmdl development was accompanied by the formulation of three different models stow and borsuk 2003 two of these models bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 had similar mechanistic formulations and provided spatially and temporally detailed simulations of hydrodynamic chemical and biological processes the third model was a bayesian network model borsuk et al 2003 based on a combination of regression and process based approaches borsuk et al 2001a 2001b 2004 in subsequent years alternative modeling approaches have been developed and applied to other waterbodies combining the key features of mechanistic models with bayesian data assimilation and inference for eutrophic lakes malve et al 2007 wu et al 2017 and coastal systems fiechter et al 2013 obenour et al 2015 however there has been limited progress toward dynamically simulating estuarine hypoxia within a bayesian framework despite the need for rigorous uncertainty quantification in the development of water quality models and tmdls arhonditsis and brett 2004 reckhow and chapra 1999 robson 2014 understanding how changes in meteorology hydrology and nutrient loads interact to control eutrophication and hypoxia development is critical for assessing progress toward meeting water quality improvement objectives each driver may influence do dynamics in multiple ways for instance increased flows not only bring more nutrients into the estuary kemp et al 2009 scavia et al 2013 but also reduce residence times while increasing stratification limiting reoxygenation rates of the water column chu and jirka 2003 obenour et al 2015 hybrid modeling approaches where a mechanistic formulation ensures representation of key biophysical processes and bayesian inference accommodates data driven parameter estimation can help reveal the most influential processes leading to hypoxia formation and thus be suitable for decision support the intent of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a hybrid of mechanistic and statistical bayesian inference approaches for assessing and simulating the effects of natural processes and human perturbations on hypoxia formation in a shallow river dominated estuary the study aims to advance dynamic hypoxia simulation within a bayesian framework allowing for a systematic accounting of prior information hypothesis testing and probabilistic forecasting arhonditsis et al 2008 ramin et al 2011 this model is applied to simulate summer nre do dynamics on a daily scale over a 19 year study period 1997 2015 the main objectives of the model application are to i understand the relative importance of major anthropogenic and hydro meteorological drivers of estuary hypoxia ii describe the temporal variability of subpycnocline oxygen demand iii provide a rigorous characterization of process and predictive uncertainty and iv assist in revealing possible management options for hypoxia mitigation in the nre 2 materials and methods this section first introduces data sources necessary for model construction then the design of the mechanistic model is provided in four steps first parsimonious differential equations are formulated representing the primary biophysical processes controlling bottom layer subpycnocline dissolved oxygen bldo dynamics second a process of identifying drivers of long term sediment mediated oxygen demand ltod is introduced third vertical mixing using an empirical sub model for water column stability potential is formulated fourth longitudinal dispersion of estuary water quality constituents is introduced finally methods for calibration within a bayesian framework assessment of

were retrieved from the digital elevation model portal noaa daily neuse river discharge at fort barnwell fb located 35 km upstream of the upper model boundary fig 1 was obtained from the united states geographical survey usgs water quality data included monthly measurements of total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from fb collected by ncdeq which were retrieved from epa also biweekly once every 2 weeks observations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen particulate nitrogen and orthophosphate for streets ferry bridge sf were obtained from the nre modeling and monitoring program modmon the same water quality measurements along with vertical profiles of salinity temperature and do were also provided by modmon at nine sampling locations along the nre fig 1 meteorological data consisting of air temperature wind speed and wind direction were supplied by the ncco hourly measurements at cherry point knkt were used as the primary meteorological input and missing knkt data were imputed based on regressions with data from trent woods nnwb and new bern kewn these regressions as well as nutrient loading and boundary conditions are specified in supporting material sections s1 and s2 2 2 mechanistic model formulation bldo dynamics for the nre were described with a parsimonious process based model developed from a series of ordinary differential equations these equations included nutrient transport organic matter production and bldo consumption and reaeration differential equations were solved numerically with a daily time step as absolute daily changes in oxygen were generally small averaging less than 0 6 g m3 d using forward euler s method chapra 2008 numerical dispersion was calculated and considered negligible averaging only 1 of physical longitudinal dispersion model segmentation was based on dividing the estuary into six compartments assuming each a well mixed reactor fig 2 this conceptual formulation was motivated by the analysis of gradients in water quality and bathymetry data the estuary was longitudinally divided into upper middle and lower segments and vertically divided by the average pycnocline depth into surface and bottom layers compartment volumes areas and thicknesses were estimated using gis grass 2017 table s1 2 2 1 mass balance equations for nutrients bldo nitrogen and phosphorus in surface waters are delivered via river flow and used in production of om thus the differential equation for bioavailable nitrogen or phosphorus concentration x g m3 in the surface layer had the following form 1 d x i d t q x i 1 x i v s i ν s x i h s i d s i 1 i v s i x i x i 1 d s i i 1 v s i x i 1 x i hereinafter i represents model segments 1 2 and 3 upper middle and lower respectively dx dt g m3 d is the time rate of change for bioavailable nutrient concentration q m3 d is neuse river discharge ν s m d is an effective settling velocity representing production and settling of organic matter associated with these nutrients h s m is surface layer thickness v s m3 is volume of the surface layer and d s m3 d is a bulk longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the surface layer here d s i 1 i d a s i 1 i l i 1 i and d s i i 1 d a s i i 1 l i i 1 where d m2 d is a dispersion coefficient described in section 2 2 4 a s m2 is the cross sectional area between model compartments and l m is the length across which the mixing takes place based on the distance between segment midpoints chapra 2008 for the upper segment i 1 indicates the upper boundary while for the lower segment i 1 corresponds to the lower model boundary thus x i 1 g m3 for the upper segment is the incoming bioavailable nitrogen or phosphorus concentration bioavailable nitrogen included dissolved inorganic nitrogen din in and a portion of organic nitrogen on in such that x i 1 din in f n on in with parameter f n determining the bioavailable fraction of on in phosphorus loading input consisted of orthophosphate op in and a portion of nonreactive phosphorus np in calculated by subtracting orthophosphate loading at sf from total phosphorus loading at fb thus the bioavailable phosphorus concentration entering the upper segment is determined as x i 1 op in f p np in with parameter f p representing the bioavailable fraction of np in both f n and f p were calibrated within the bayesian framework section 2 3 for the upper segment the limiting nutrient was determined by comparing the ratio of bioavailable nitrogen to phosphorus concentrations at the upper boundary to the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio required for organic matter production r n p gn gp which was set to an expected value of 7 2 gn gp redfield et al 1963 as the estuary is always nitrogen limited during may october in its middle and lower segments pinckney et al 1999 rudek et al 1991 a mass balance on phosphorus was performed only for the freshwater dominated upper segment nitrogen limitation is typical for more saline coastal waters due to efficient recycling of phosphorus and high denitrification rates howarth and marino 2006 nixon 1995 when phosphorus was limiting in the upper segment nitrogen was reduced proportionally to phosphorus based on r n p om produced from bioavailable nutrients eventually settles to the bottom compartments the differential equation for om in the bottom layer represented in

arrhenius equation with θ c representing the temperature constant for om decay which is set to 1 047 chapra 2008 daily water temperature was estimated via linear regression with meteorological variables eq s6 current velocities tidally oscillate from upstream to downstream in nre bottom waters but there is little net advection mcninch and luettich 2000 therefore dispersion but not advection was included in eq 2 bldo is consumed by decomposition of om and it is replenished via reaeration through the pycnocline the differential equation for bldo represented as o b g m3 had the following

further discussed in section 4 1 2 2 2 2 yearly ltod variation one goal of this study was to explore hypotheses regarding factors influencing ltod which includes oxidation of less labile and refractory om accumulated in the sediments ltod may vary temporally due to changes in primary productivity flow and nutrient loading but over longer time scales than stod kemp et al 1992 rucinski et al 2014 ltod with index j indicating year was determined using the following equation 4 l j l 1 γ x j here l g m2 d is the average ltod for the study period x j is a candidate covariate and γ is a corresponding ltod adjustment coefficient estimated through bayesian calibration several potentially relevant covariates were proposed and tested total nitrogen and phosphorus loads and concentrations and longitudinal velocities i e discharge normalized by segment cross sectional area for efficiency the process of covariate selection included the following steps first the mechanistic model was calibrated assuming no ltod variation l j l second yearly bias was calculated i e yearly average difference between predicted and observed values based on the constant ltod model third the yearly bias was regressed on the candidate predictor variables various running averages of each candidate predictor up to 12 months for each year were considered to assess different temporal scales on which the proposed variables might affect ltod the running averages were calculated based on periods leading up to 1 may as subsequent loads and flows were represented in the model as stod the covariate most strongly correlated with the annual bias was then evaluated in the bayesian modeling framework using eq 4 and the significance of γ was assessed 2 2 3 reaeration and water column stability potential reaeration of bottom water layers was represented by vertical oxygen diffusion through the pycnocline vertical diffusion is dependent on the interaction of multiple factors including meteorological conditions flow regime and estuary depth for instance wind stress may increase horizontal shear in the water column thereby producing higher rates of diffusion borsuk et al 2001b buzzelli et al 2002 at the same time elevated river discharges provide fresh water that generally promotes density stratification obenour et al 2012 scully 2013 except in cases of hurricanes when estuaries are completely flushed and destratified burkholder et al 2004 paerl et al 2001 here water column stability is represented in the form of richardson number ri that was estimated using the following formulation henderson sellers 1984 5 r i g ρ ρ z ω 2 z 2 here ρ z g m4 is the pycnocline density gradient g is acceleration due to gravity ρ g m3 is water density z m is pycnocline depth and ω m s is wind shear velocity which can be estimated from wind speed henderson sellers 1984 spigel and imberger 1987 eq 5 can be rewritten as ri ϕ g ρ ω 2 where ϕ is defined here as stability potential ρ z z 2 which was determined from density profile data estimated from measured profiles of temperature and salinity millero and poisson 1981 as daily inputs of ϕ were required for model simulations and density profiles were only available on a biweekly basis linear regressions were developed for each segment to estimate stability potential candidate covariates included wind speed ws river discharge q and air temperature t a wind blowing along the longitudinal axis of the lower nre was previously found to affect saltwater intrusion in the estuary giese et al 1985 and therefore a longitudinal wind velocity lwv predictor representing the component of wind velocity along this axis was also included the process of variables selection and prescreening is described in section s4 the response ϕ was cube root transformed to minimize heteroscedasticity of residuals faraway 2015 standardized regression residuals were examined to confirm an even distribution lack of substantial bias or heteroscedasticity fig s1 vertical diffusion coefficient e m2 s controlling the exchange of oxygen through the pycnocline was estimated as a function of richardson number martin and mccutcheon 1999 munk and anderson 1948 6 e e 0 1 α r i β here e 0 m2 s is the diffusion coefficient at neutral stability defined as ω h 34 where h m is total water column depth martin and mccutcheon 1999 dimensionless parameters α and β were calibrated within the bayesian framework transfer coefficient k l m d was calculated dividing e by the mixing length which was set to 0 5 m after analysis of vertical density profiles the assumption of the constant mixing length is consistent with previous hypoxia modeling studies justić et al 2002 obenour et al 2015 2 2 4 estuary longitudinal dispersion to account for longitudinal mixing between segments a dispersion coefficient d m2 d was utilized longitudinal dispersion may be explained by a number of processes including tidal interaction with bathymetry wind induced currents or internal circulation due to buoyancy fischer 1976 cross section average salinities were employed to estimate d in this study as salt is a conservative tracer details can be found in supporting material section s5 2 3 prior information and model calibration the mechanistic model included 9 parameters that could not be well constrained based on prior research alone and which were thus estimated through bayesian inference table s2 the bayesian framework allowed parameter estimation considering existing knowledge i e prior distribution updated based on the model and bldo calibration data i e likelihood function resulting in probabilistic posterior parameter estimates gelman et al 2013 bayesian inference was performed using rstan software rstan 2017 which applies hamiltonian monte carlo hmc sampling kruschke 2015 three parallel sampling chains were run each consisting of 7500 iterations convergence among chains was considered satisfactory when the square root of the ratio between the total variance and variance within the chains was equal to one gelman and rubin 1992 after convergence 5000 posterior samples were kept for posterior analyses to avoid computational instabilities during the hmc process the limiting nutrient was selected based on f p and f n from a preliminary hmc run and updated iteratively in successive runs until the initial and posterior estimate converged to within a 10 difference prior parameter distributions were determined from previous field observations laboratory experiments and other literature the lower bounds for the first 8 parameters in table s2 were set to zero as negative values are mechanistically unrealistic the prior for the average ltod represented as l was derived from in situ fisher et al 1982 sauber 1998 and laboratory alperin et al 2000 rizzo and christian 1996 estimates of sediment oxygen demand however in situ measurements of sediment oxygen demand might also include stod i e seasonal om production that settles all of the way to the bottom therefore l was assigned a wide left skew normal distribution azzalini 2013 with mean of 0 51 g m2 d average from lab studies and mode of 0 80 g m2 d overall average an informative prior for the organic carbon decomposition rate k c was introduced as a normal distribution centered on 0 03 d 1 with standard deviation of 0 01 d 1 based on reported rates of phytoplankton decomposition harvey and macko 1997 hopkinson et al 2002 as phytoplankton account for at least 80 of particulate om in the nre paerl et al 2004 effective settling velocity ν s which represents the growth and sinking of phytoplankton was assigned a wider normal prior with mean of 0 2 m d and standard deviation of 0 05 m d based on previous studies chapra et al 2016 obenour et al 2015 parameter f p influencing phosphorus bioavailability received a normally distributed prior with mean 0 30 and standard deviation 0 10 with outer limits of zero and one based on previous studies related to bioavailability of particulate phosphorus ellison and brett 2006 gerdes and kunst 1998 parameter f n influencing nitrogen bioavailability was defined using a beta distribution alpha 2 05 and beta 5 83 having a mean of 0 3 and 97 5 quantile at 0 65 this upper quantile corresponded to the upper level of dissolved organic nitrogen bioavailability bronk et al 2007 seitzinger 1997 as reported values for dimensionless parameters α and β affecting vertical diffusion in eq 6 range over two orders of magnitude martin and mccutcheon 1999 their priors were set to have weakly informative normal distributions with zero mean and standard deviations of 10 and 100 respectively the prior for residual standard deviation σ was set as a weakly informative normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviations of 10 g m3 ltod adjustment coefficient γ in eq 4 had a weakly informative prior normal distribution centered at zero and unlike other parameters negative values were allowed 2 4 model assessment sensitivity and scenario analysis the model was assessed for predictive skill using root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which is the fraction of observational variance explained by the model faraway 2015 r2 values were calculated for biweekly observations and for bimonthly mean value for 2 months bldo rmse and r2 are intuitive measures of predictive skill but are not useful for characterizing predictive uncertainty as they employ only the means of predictive distributions therefore posterior parameters distributions were also used to derive 90 credible and prediction intervals credible intervals accounted for parameter uncertainties while prediction intervals considered both parameter uncertainty and residual standard deviation gelman et al 2013 mcelreath 2016 to test the robustness of the model a threefold cross validation was performed stone 1974 the cross validation procedure consisted of removal of three test periods in turn 1997 2003 2004 2009 2010 2015 and recalibrating the model for the remaining training years after recalibration model predictions were made for the removed test periods and compared to observations additionally to explore the relative importance of different drivers of hypoxia bldo sensitivities to meteorological input wind and temperature and riverine input flows and nutrient loads were assessed section s7 the model was also applied to examine the effect of near term i e seasonal nutrient loading reductions on mean july august midsummer bldo concentrations and number of hypoxic days bldo 2 g m3 scenarios were simulated by adjusting daily riverine nutrient loads by fixed percentages under 3 different ltod conditions low average and high corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of yearly ltod respectively loading reductions were simulated over the entire 19 year study period and results were averaged across years 3 results 3 1 bldo model calibration eight mechanistic model parameters were probabilistically estimated within the bayesian framework for all parameters marginal posterior distributions are narrower than the prior distributions fig 3 suggesting that the model formulation is appropriate for leveraging calibration data to refine knowledge of key rates through bayesian inference brun et al 2001 del giudice et al 2015 results exhibit negligible correlations between most parameters however there is a notable correlation between dimensionless parameters α and β r 0 90 used in vertical diffusion coefficient calculation eq 6 indicating that these parameters cannot be well identified independently of each other the best estimate mean of the posterior distribution of effective settling velocity ν s describing the rate at which nutrients are converted to om and subsequently sink through the pycnocline is 0 20 m d this estimate is within the range of previously reported settling rates for the nre bales and robbins 1999 bowen and hieronymus 2000 lung and paerl 1988 and is consistent with the mean estimate of effective settling velocity documented for the northern gulf of mexico hypoxic zone obenour et al 2015 and for the great lakes chapra et al 2016 at the same time the standard deviation of the posterior estimate is 80 smaller than that of the prior distribution indicating the calibration data strongly reinforce the prior the best estimate for k c 0 035 d 1 is notably higher than the prior with substantially reduced uncertainty i e standard deviation decreases by 90 suggesting a decomposition rate typical of labile phytoplankton garber 1984 the best estimates for parameters α and β relating water column stability to vertical diffusion and reaeration are 19 9 and 0 516 with standard deviations of 6 6 and 0 017 respectively the best estimate of mean ltod l is 0 46 g m2 d which is somewhat lower than the prior estimate section 4 1 2 bioavailable fractions of nonreactive phosphorus and organic nitrogen in the nutrient loadings f p and f n have best estimates 0 29 and 0 38 which are within previously reported ranges ellison and brett 2006 fan et al 2003 the model was calibrated with and without the annual ltod adjustment via the γ parameter discussed more in section 3 2 inclusion of ltod adjustment decreases the best estimate of l by only 4 9 and does not strongly affect other parameter distributions fig 3 3 2 ltod yearly variation and role in bldo balance in order to parameterize the ltod adjustment various predictors that plausibly influence ltod were analyzed correlations between these predictors and yearly mean model bias in predicted subpycnocline do i e bldo obtained from the constant ltod model were compared the strongest correlation was found with november april longitudinal velocity table s3 and fig s2 this relationship is the highest in the upstream segment r 0 55 where it is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level other notable correlations include a positive relationship between bias and total phosphorus concentration dec apr in the upper segment r 0 36 and a positive relationship between bias and total nitrogen concentration aug apr in the middle segment r 0 25 though both are not significant p 0 05 as opposed to concentrations nutrient loadings displayed a negative relationship with model bias however negative relationships between nutrient loadings and model bias are mechanistically implausible and likely the result of a confounding high correlation between flow and velocity and load due to these mechanistic and statistical considerations longitudinal velocities were selected as a potential control of ltod variability in the bayesian model longitudinal velocities were centered on zero by subtracting mean velocity of each segment such that under mean flow the ltod in each segment is l parameter γ had a best estimate of 0 376 d km and standard deviation 0 107 d km as the 99 quantile of γ did not cross zero 0 117 d km fig 3 this strongly indicated that high november april longitudinal velocities were associated with low summer ltod fig s3 the model allowed for comparing actual to inhibited oxygen demand and for partitioning bldo consumption between stod and ltod inhibition of both stod and ltod occurs when the bldo concentration approaches zero so there is little available do to support aerobic om decomposition section 2 2 1 and eq 3 the model results indicate that on average 43 40 and 33 of potential may october oxygen demand in the upper middle and lower segments is inhibited actual after adjustment for inhibition may october combined volumetric stod and ltod has mean values of 0 93 0 88 and 0 79 g m3 d for upper middle and lower segments respectively during july august when hypoxia is most severe inhibition is higher averaging 50 46 and 37 in upper middle and lower segments respectively the percentage of average midsummer volumetric oxygen demand attributed to stod which represents decomposition of near term produced labile organic carbon is 34 34 and 40 for upper middle and lower segments the rest of oxygen demand is ltod fig 4 which is associated with decomposition of less labile and refractory om primarily within the sediment layer we note that particulate organic carbon sampled in the bottom water layer of the estuary averages 1 67 g m3 based on modmon data and predicted organic carbon averages 4 25 g m3 the latter value which is associated with stod is expected to be higher because it includes both particulate and dissolved organic matter as well as recently produced labile particulate matter that has settled all of the way to the estuary bottom which would not be retrieved in water column samples according to the model phosphorus limitation of stod related production occurred 82 of the time in the upper segment being most common in may and october otherwise nitrogen was limiting 3 3 vertical diffusion and longitudinal dispersion vertical diffusion controlling bldo reaeration in the water quality model was determined as a function of stability potential ϕ section 2 2 3 cube root transformed stability potential was predicted by linear regression for each estuary segment with covariates selected via exhaustive search process penalizing for overfitting using bic criterion section s4 7 ϕ u 3 3 69 1 97 ln q 2 1 29 ln q 60 0 36 ln q 2 ln q 60 0 14 w s 10 0 08 l w v 60 8 ϕ m 3 0 45 0 45 ln q 2 0 04 t a 2 0 05 l w v 10 9 ϕ l 3 1 97 0 002 ln q 2 0 07 t a 2 0 27 l w v 10 subscripts u m l in eqs 7 9 denote upper middle and lower segments respectively while subscripts for covariates represent number of days averaged before an observation the best performing model for the upper segment eq 7 includes positive relationships with natural log transformed 2 and 60 day averaged flows and negative relationships with 10 day wind speed and 60 day longitudinal wind velocity as well as a negative interaction between the two flow variables the best performing models for the middle and lower segments eqs 8 and 9 include positive relationships with natural log transformed 2 day flow and 2 day temperature and negative relationships with 10 day longitudinal wind velocity in general when predicting stability potential discharge has the major influence on the response for the upper and middle model segments whereas longitudinal wind velocity is the more important explanatory variable for the lower segment compare coefficients for 2 day flow among eqs 7 9 all coefficients are statistically significant p 0 05 the resulting regressions explain 27 21 and 36 variability in biweekly cube root ϕ observations for upper middle and lower segments respectively daily estimates of stability potential were used for calculating vertical diffusion in eq 6 and oxygen transfer coefficients k l mean values of k l calculated dividing vertical diffusion coefficient by mixing length are 0 14 0 15 and 0 18 m d for upper middle and lower segments respectively similar rates have been reported for hypoxic regions in the northern gulf of mexico justić et al 1996 and black sea podymov et al 2017 average longitudinal dispersion for the model was estimated from the salinity model eq s7 the calibrated mean longitudinal dispersion d is 362 m2 s which is within the range of previously reported values for estuaries chapra 2008 kashefipour and falconer 2002 shaha et al 2011 the model explained 78 of the variability in observed salinities 3 4 model skill model performance for bldo was assessed in terms of r2 i e percent variance explained and rmse in addition time series plots with 90 credible and predictive intervals fig 5 were visually examined on average predictive uncertainty associated with model residuals reflecting model simplifications and measurement errors is 2 09 times greater than that of parameter uncertainty overall the model explains 40 46 and 57 of variability in biweekly observations of bldo for the upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 top row corresponding rmse values are 1 87 1 72 1 57 g m3 respectively remaining bldo variability might be due to sudden wind induced mixing events including lateral mixing and other spatio temporal fluctuations that cannot be captured given the coarse resolution of the model and available input data the model calibrated to biweekly data also performs well at aggregated bimonthly scale when comparing and averaging the corresponding days of observations and predictions the model explains 47 62 and 78 of bimonthly mean bldo for upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 middle row and 62 across segments for the case where instead of averaging predictions on observation days only all daily predictions in a given bimonthly period are averaged the model explains 48 67 and 68 of observed variance for upper middle and lower segments respectively fig 6 bottom row in addition model results indicate that hypoxia peaks in july august consistent with observations model skill was further tested in a threefold cross validation that evaluates performance when predicting observations excluded from the calibration data set in cross validation where each fold represents one third of the study period the model explains 44 58 and 76 of bimonthly variability in bldo in all three segments this is just slightly lower than model performance when calibrated to the full dataset 47 62 and 78 suggesting robustness of the model to potential long term system variability in addition only 9 7 of the observations are outside of the 90 prediction intervals in the cross validated model consistent with fig 5 indicating uncertainty is realistically quantified 3 5 bldo sensitivity to wind flow and nutrient loading sensitivity analysis suggests that riverine inputs flow and load have higher impact than local meteorological inputs wind and temperature on the interannual variability in midsummer bldo fig 7 standard deviation of the year to year variability of july august bldo for the full model accounting for both riverine and meteorological variability is 0 63 g m3 in comparison the standard deviation attributable to riverine inputs is 0 53 g m3 and the standard deviation for meteorological inputs is only 0 38 g m3 this indicates that riverine inputs control more of the interannual variability in hypoxia than meteorological inputs influencing reaeration and temperature dependent rates results also indicate that in some years meteorological and riverine inputs combine to amplify e g 2012 or minimize e g 1998 hypoxia fig 7 in other years e g 2014 meteorological and riverine inputs have compensating effects resulting in moderate bldo conditions overall midsummer bldo variability due to riverine inputs is mildly correlated with meteorological inputs r 0 36 3 6 nutrient loading reduction scenarios nutrient load reduction scenarios indicate increases in midsummer bldo concentration and decreases in number of hypoxic days by virtue of stod reduction fig 8 however there is a varying effect of loading reductions on midsummer bldo depending on the ltod level for example a 30 reduction in nutrient loadings will result in average midsummer bldo increases of 0 31 0 25 and 0 21 g m3 across all segments given low average and high ltod conditions respectively fig 8 top row for the same load reduction the number of hypoxic days averaged across segments will decrease by 33 5 23 4 and 18 7 respectively fig 8 bottom row clearly bldo is more strongly affected by near term nutrient loadings reduction for low ltod as compared to high ltod conditions for small reductions in nutrient load i e 30 or less the bldo response is approximately linear such that each 10 decrease in nutrient supply relative to current conditions would result in an average 0 12 g m3 and 0 08 g m3 midsummer bldo increase for low and high ltod conditions respectively similarly each 10 nutrient reduction would approximately result in 9 8 2 1 day and 5 3 1 8 day decrease in the number of hypoxic days for low and high ltod conditions respectively results indicate that higher reductions in nutrient load i e 30 have a stronger non linear effect on both midsummer bldo and the number of hypoxic days 4 discussion this study illustrates a hybrid water quality modeling approach where dynamic mechanistic simulation and statistical inference are combined to study hypoxia dynamics in a shallow coastal water body bayesian inference provides an opportunity to probabilistically estimate unknown model parameters while accounting for prior knowledge in addition the approach makes it possible to distinguish and quantify the effects of both parameter uncertainty and residual uncertainty in model predictions while some past dynamic nre modeling efforts have been developed considering only a few reference years bales and robbins 1999 bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 this nre model is calibrated over a substantially longer period 1997 2015 which includes a wide range of hydro meteorological conditions as supported by our cross validation analysis this helps ensure robust characterization of mechanisms causing variability in subpycnocline do across multiple temporal scales a previous probabilistic process based model of nre hypoxia borsuk et al 2001b considered an 11 year period of record but did not simulate relationships between nutrient loading and oxygen demand compared to previous bayesian hypoxia models based largely on steady state relationships liu and scavia 2010 obenour et al 2015 this study advances numerical simulation of oxygen dynamics within the bayesian framework at the same time we recognize the limitations of our parsimonious mechanistic approach relative to high dimensionality water quality models wool et al 2003 the coarse model resolution only distinguishes three longitudinal segments and no lateral variability also the 1 day time step cannot account for diel cycles in dissolved oxygen or sudden wind events in addition the model simplifies biogeochemical processes such that phytoplankton production and sediment diagenesis are not explicitly simulated see section 4 1 2 despite these strategic simplifications the model captures important drivers of bldo dynamics and performs well in cross validation in addition the parsimonious mechanistic approach is computationally efficient which helps accommodate a long calibration period bayesian inference of process rates and uncertainty quantification the model is transferable to other estuaries where hydro meteorological and nutrient input data are available water column calibration data are also important though the posterior parameter distributions developed here could be used as informative prior information for applications to data poor systems 4 1 mechanisms driving hypoxia 4 1 1 water column reaeration model results indicate that both flow and meteorological conditions play important roles in controlling vertical diffusion in the estuary stability potential ϕ which is a function of pycnocline depth and gradient is estimated from linear regressions with river discharge wind speed longitudinal wind velocity and air temperature as covariates section 3 3 increased freshwater discharge generally leads to increased stability in all three segments however results for the upper segment eq 7 indicate a negative interaction term between 2 and 60 day flows such that under very high flow conditions for both 2 and 60 day stability is reduced this interaction is consistent with the expectation that extreme flow events will completely flush saltwater from the upper estuary thus eliminating density stratification buzzelli et al 2002 in addition longitudinal wind velocity lwv which represents the northeasterly component of wind velocity is found to be negatively related to stability in all three segments this result is consistent with the expectation that northeasterly winds reduce stability by pushing saltwater upstream giese et al 1985 while southwesterly winds move freshwater downstream over the surface of the estuary mcninch and luettich 2000 this straining effect of longitudinal winds has been reported for other estuaries as well li and li 2011 scully et al 2005 finally wind speed independent of direction was negatively related to stability in the upper segment and water temperature was positively related to stability in the middle and lower segments consistent with mechanistic expectations and previous studies identifying the nre as intermittently mixed system borsuk et al 2001b martin and mccutcheon 1999 mcninch and luettich 2000 selberg et al 2001 overall bldo model performance in terms of r2 increases by 12 on average across segments when using these regressions for stability potential as opposed to using constant segment specific median values for stability potential this is remarkable given that the regressions eqs 7 9 explain less than 40 of the variability in stability potential the low regression performance may be due to short term noisiness of density profiles spatial mismatch of the meteorological and observation stations and the limitations of using simple linear relationships relative to a hydrodynamic circulation model nonetheless the regressions for stability potential appear to capture changes in stratification relevant to bldo dynamics these results demonstrate how empirical relationships for water column stability can be integrated within a mechanistic water quality model to improve predictive capabilities 4 1 2 sources and variation of oxygen demand there is notable annual and intersegmental variability in both stod and ltod fig 4 this variability is controlled in part by high oxygen demand inhibition due to low summer bldo concentrations inhibition is less severe in the lower segment due to higher average bldo concentrations compared to the upper and middle segments these results are influenced by the morphology of the estuary as thinner bottom layers in the upper and middle segments table s1 are depleted of oxygen more quickly than the thicker bottom layer of the lower segment paerl et al 1998 furthermore results indicate that oxygen demand per unit volume is typically higher in the upper and middle segments than in the lower fig 4 across segments may october areal oxygen demand is found to average 0 71 and 1 16 g m2 d for actual and total including inhibited oxygen demand respectively these values are similar to the combined benthic and lower water column oxygen demand of 1 02 g m2 d estimated previously borsuk et al 2001b this previous estimate is a year round average without considering inhibition about one third of july august oxygen demand is attributed to stod in this study while the rest is due to ltod which was estimated through calibration to historical data fig 4 these results support the idea that long term benthic processes dominate bldo demand alperin et al 2000 eldridge and morse 2008 kemp et al 1992 compared to decomposition of near term seasonally produced om that is reflected as stod in the model the calibrated estimate of mean ltod is similar to oxygen demands derived from laboratory benthic flux experiments rizzo and christian 1996 but lower than in situ sediment oxygen demand measurements fisher et al 1982 sauber 1998 this was expected as in situ measurements likely include seasonally produced organic matter that has settled to the estuary bottom which is attributed to stod in this study in addition in situ measurements were taken at deeper locations in the estuary where higher oxygen demand is typically expected fear et al 2004 a limitation of this model is that it explicitly represents only aerobic decomposition of organic matter i e oxygen demand not inhibited by low bldo the organic matter associated with inhibited oxygen demand is assumed to be decomposed anaerobically driven by sulfate reduction denitrification and methanogenesis fear et al 2005 matson and brinson 1985 it is implicitly assumed that the products of these reactions either escape to the surface layer during mixing events where they are oxidized sulfide methane escape to atmosphere nitrogen gas methane gas chapra 2008 or precipitate to the sediment iron sulfide matson et al 1983 and are subsumed in ltod representation of the above mentioned processes would require a complex sediment diagenetic model di toro 2001 and the addition of several state variables that are not regularly monitored which is beyond the scope of this study but could be beneficial in future research 4 1 3 temporal ltod variability in the model ltod is inferred to be influenced by the year to year variability in november april longitudinal velocities via parameter γ section 3 2 higher river discharge intensifies longitudinal velocities leading to increased flushing and reduced time to produce and settle om in the nre this effect may be especially pronounced in winter when colder temperatures slow biological processes and reduce growth rates of some phytoplankton species reynolds 2006 these results are in line with previous studies that indicated the strong effect of flow on residence times and spatio temporal variability of biomass in the nre borsuk et al 2004 peierls et al 2012 which will then affect accumulation of organic matter in the sediment westrich and berner 1984 at the same time results do not indicate any long term temporal trend in ltod or stod which suggests that the system has neither significantly improved nor worsened during the last 19 years 4 2 implications for hypoxia forecasting and management riverine model inputs account for 62 of the simulated year to year variability in july august bldo concentration while remaining variability can be attributed largely to meteorology fig 7 the prevailing role of flow and nutrient loadings can be explained by the fact that the neuse river controls both ltod and stod while also influencing reaeration rates short term meteorology on the other hand affects only reaeration and temperature dependent rates with mean july august temperature varying little from year to year 0 7 c standard deviation thus the model naturally lends itself to be applied for forecasting hypoxia throughout the summer given riverine flows and nutrient loads which could potentially be obtained through watershed modeling the model also provides a means for testing watershed nutrient loading reduction scenarios under various levels of ltod fig 8 while stod is directly influenced by seasonal nutrient loading ltod varies over longer time scales understanding the drivers and time scales of oxygen demand is important for developing realistic expectations for hypoxia mitigation in general less severe hypoxia is expected in years with high winter flows and longitudinal velocities and low nutrient loadings in may october this result further highlights the important role of the river flow in controlling estuary eutrophication borsuk et al 2004 past modeling efforts supported a 30 reduction in total nitrogen load to improve water quality in the nre by mitigating high chlorophyll levels deamer 2009 stow et al 2003 this modeling effort while not explicitly representing chlorophyll suggests that a 30 reduction in seasonal nutrient loadings will lead to substantial reductions in the number of hypoxic days in all segments of the estuary fig 8 this outcome contrasts with previous modeling that suggested a non significant change in the number of hypoxic days in response to even 60 nitrogen loading reduction borsuk et al 2003 other nre modeling studies bowen and hieronymus 2003 wool et al 2003 only reported how nutrient management would reduce chlorophyll not hypoxia thus the quantitative linkage between riverine nutrient loading and hypoxia via organic matter production as provided in this study could be an important consideration for estuarine management at the same time reductions in nutrient loading may not immediately produce improvements in hypoxia as much of the temporal variability in bldo is controlled by hydrometeorology nutrient loading reduction scenarios suggest it would take about 3 years to be 90 confident of producing an increase in mean may october bldo in the nre relative to the current mean of 3 2 g m3 following a 30 nutrient loading reduction fig 9 solid orange line furthermore if samples are only collected at a biweekly twice per month frequency as is currently the case it will take about 10 years to be 90 confident of actually observing such an improvement fig 9 dashed orange line as intra annual stochasticity adds more uncertainty to estimated mean bldo this temporal stochasticity is likely attributable to small scale hydrodynamic variations deficiencies in model input and calibration data e g measurement error and biophysical processes that are not fully represented within the mechanistic model in this study the effect of nutrient loading reductions on both mean bldo and the number of hypoxic days is the greatest for low ltod conditions fig 8 high ltod conditions facilitate midsummer hypoxia and increased oxygen demand inhibition such that variations in stod driven by seasonal nutrient loading are less relevant because they are largely inhibited while a significant positive relationship between nutrient loading and ltod was not observed in this study results of other studies suggest that persistent loading reductions may eventually lead to decreases in ltod as om stored in the sediment is depleted faster than it is replenished from the water column borsuk et al 2001a del giudice et al 2018 greening and janicki 2006 kemp et al 2009 mallin et al 2005 further research is required to quantify the time scales over which benthic oxygen demands respond to changes in watershed nutrient loading 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the utility of a hybrid mechanistic bayesian model for simulating estuary hypoxia its mechanistic structure provides a dynamic representation of oxygen demand and reaeration while the bayesian framework allows for including prior information about system processes while characterizing model uncertainties to our knowledge this is the first study to simulate hypoxia based on a numerical solution to a series of mass balance differential equations within a bayesian framework for the 19 year study period the model explains roughly half of variability in biweekly bldo observations from may to october and higher percentages in the variability of bimonthly averages results of cross validation indicate the robustness of the model so that it can be applied for forecasting and long term scenario analysis serving as a supportive tool for watershed managers interannual ltod variation was found to be associated with average november to april longitudinal velocities which indicates that elevated winter flows flush nutrients and organic matter from the estuary lowering subsequent summer ltod rates from a management perspective the results demonstrate that seasonal loading reductions will reduce stod and the intensity and duration of summer hypoxia for instance a 30 loading reduction would increase the average july august bldo concentration by 11 and decrease the amount of hypoxic days by 25 further reductions in hypoxia could be achieved if ltod can also be ameliorated potentially by reducing rates of organic matter accumulation in sediments over the long term data availability all data are publicly available as described in section 2 1 code generated during the study is available

treated as part of the integrated approach which can be used not only for model calibrations and validations but also for correction of model outputs through implementation of data assimilation techniques kim et al 2014 voinov and shugart 2013 the dataset can be used not just as driving force to the model input but also used to calibrate the model and correct model output components voinov and cerco 2010 the sources of dataset can be from grab samples and lab experiments measurements real time sensors or output of model simulation results integrated process based modelling is a combination of six linked models in which output in one model is used as input for another model essential inputs to the models are the spatial schematizations of the sources the drains and the receiving water body the level of detail and the accuracy of these schematizations determine to a large degree upon how realistic simulations can be the rainfall runoff model e g sobek and the generic emission model both operate at catchment scale te linde et al 2010 zhang et al 2012b de lange et al 2014 these models generate the loads of water and pollutant substances into drains and receiving water body the emission model contains point and non point sources such as sewerage treatment plants industries as well as diffuse sources sewerage system atmosphere agriculture etc the 1d hydraulic model e g sobek flow provides the water flow through the drains into the water body the 3d hydrodynamic model e g delft3d flow simulates water flow both horizontally and vertically and dispersion within the water body it also considers both thermal and salinity stratification the hydraulic and hydrodynamic models can be coupled both off line and on line where the latter provides data to the former on the basis of which the flow through the gates in the dam is controlled when used for the freshwater body the simulated water flows are delivered to the emission model the 1d transport model e g sobek waq eco and the 3d water quality model e g delft3d eco loads of substances arising from the catchments are transported through the drains in the 1d models of emission model and transport model as presented in fig 1 the 3d water quality model computes the concentration patterns and mass flows of nutrients phytoplankton organic matter dissolved oxygen sediment salinity coliform bacteria e coli and enterococci both in the water and in the top sediment of the reservoirs smits and van beek 2013 each individual model can be run standalone or either online or offline coupled with other models the integrated modelling framework can produce annual simulations to capture seasonal differences in long term predictions and can also be used for real time forecasting in short time simulations when combined with online sensor data and other inputs which feed the model and function as initial conditions for next timestep prediction data assimilation a technique to combine information from numerical models with observations is also incorporated into this integrated framework to further improve the accuracy of process based model prediction up till now various data assimilation procedures can be applied babovic et al 2005 i e a updating inputs b updating model parameters c updating state variables and d updating output of variables in method a the input uncertainties are addressed by certain iterative procedures method b may be computer intensive as the involved parameters are updated by calibration procedures the main difference between methods c and d is that the data assimilation procedure in method c is integrated with the process model and will need the model to be recalled to run with the adjustment in contrast method d will detach the solution procedure of the process model and the original process model does not necessarily need to be re run every time in the data assimilation procedure for a complex water quality model it may be more convenient to apply a data assimilation scheme to correct the model without interfacing with and rerunning the water quality model this efficiency is especially necessary for a real time forecasting system it is implemented by constructing data driven models to approximate the uncertainties of numerical models based on available measurements this is normally performed in two steps error forecasting and spatial distribution the error forecasting can update the model error at stations with measurements and the other stations without measurements can be updated by employing the technique of spatial distribution by doing this both the temporal and spatial dynamics of the model uncertainties will be estimated and assimilated to the original numerical model to update their outputs le provost et al 1998 wang et al 2016 one of the most widely used data assimilation approaches is the kalman filter and its derivatives however the requirements regarding prior statistics of the stochastic errors in both state processes and observation processes limit the application of the approach to real world problems zhang et al 2006 the other limitation is its requirements for iterative model re run and costly heavy computational demand another kind of data assimilation is model error residual correction it is performed through error forecasting and spatial distribution local model lm and modified local model mlm amour and kauranne 2017 wang et al 2016 inspired by chaos theory have been proven effective for model error forecasting and tested in our water quality model updating technique the operational management system will be discussed separately in section 3 7 3 applications of the integrated approach we applied the integrated approach in different case studies and demonstrated how the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used for describing different mechanisms and driving factors influencing changes of water quality and facilitating research and management in this section as mentioned in the previous section the integrated approach can be used in both coastal and freshwater systems we discussed its applications based on two testbeds as shown in fig 2 one is in singapore s coastal waters fig 2 b another is in one of the freshwater bodies in singapore fig 2 c it should be noted that a necessary modification of each individual model should be considered when applied to a specific case study for instance a multiple layer sediment model is incorporated into the 3d waq model in order to account for the sediment impacts in shallow freshwater systems whereas a simple two layer sediment model is considered in the coastal 3d waq model 3 1 assessing impact of catchment discharges and ocean dynamics on change in water quality altered freshwater inflows in the catchment areas can have a significant influence on spatiotemporal dynamics of nutrients and other water quality indicators in coastal waters resulting in fate and transport of pollutants and organisms with dilution or mobilization of contaminants changing salinity distributions causing stratification and hypoxia breitburg et al 2008 kimmerer 2002 sklar and browder 1998 we applied the integrated approach to test how discharge and pollutants from catchment areas influence the change in water quality in singapore s coastal zone area fig 3 a calibrated 3d waq with 10 layers in the water column was applied for this test wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 in the northern part of singapore s coastal zone salinity is significantly influenced by freshwater discharges from local catchment areas which dilute the salinity and result in a lower level of salinity concentration around 10 psu whereas in the southern part of the singapore straits the tidal flow controls the dynamics of salinity with high concentrations between 30 and 35 psu the different flow patterns result in an increased trend of salinity from north to south fig 3 similar patterns can also be found in the dynamics of total nitrogen in coastal waters where local catchment freshwater inflows with high pollutant concentrations lead to high concentrations of nitrogen in the northern coastal waters also known as the johor straits the influence of local catchment discharge on nitrogen dynamics is also reflected in the southwest coast where pollutant loadings from industry in jurong island result in high concentrations of nutrient concentrations in the coastal waters surrounding the island fig 4 the higher concentrations of pollutants such as nutrients and bacteria in the freshwater are diluted by the saline water while the catchment freshwater discharges result in lower salinity concentration in the coastal waters enrichment of nutrients associated with loadings from the local catchment areas can also cause severe hypoxia in bottom waters less than 0 5 mgo2 l and aberrant behavior of benthic fauna diaz and rosenberg 2008 high discharges of freshwaters from local catchment rivers can also increase the water circulations and nutrient loads that in turn increase the oxygen concentrations in the top layer but also result in very low oxygen concentrations in bottom layers of the water column due to mineralized detritus and stratification process as demonstrated in fig 5 where the dissolved oxygen in bottom layers in northern coastal waters could reach less than 2 0 mgo2 l due to the possibly combined effects of different physical chemical and biological processes involved 3 2 combining small and large sizes of datasets for improving accuracy of model predictions and reducing long term monitoring costs a good performance of the model is dependent on how well the model is calibrated which is always a challenge zhang et al 2003c this requires not only satisfactory techniques and expert knowledge but also sufficient amounts and quality of the available data janssen and heuberger 1995 however the datasets from field survey and lab measurements are always limited by budget and manpower which are usually monthly or bimonthly data at low frequency such observed data do provide useful information for model calibrations and validations but the low frequency may limit modelers from fully understanding the actual dynamics and preventing capture of real behavior jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 a typical pattern is demonstrated in fig 6 in general the model captures the trend in state variables of oxygen chlorophyll a and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the water column over 6 month simulation period when compared with the observations compared to the simulation based on the calibration with the intensive datasets large size of dataset in fig 7 the dynamic behaviors which were driven by spring neap tidal cycles bergondo et al 2005 were overlooked with the monthly datasets in fig 6 combing small and large dataset approach can have advantages during the model development the procedure of the model calibration with those dataset are as follows 1 first the model set up and pre calibration are based on the sparse data with small size which can not only reduce the demanding on large size dataset but also determine what kind of further measurements are needed 2 once intensive data with large sample size are available e g further measurements during model development those data can be combined with data driven modelling techniques for parameter optimizations during calibration and correcting the prediction results wang et al 2016 in our modelling framework the model calibration is divided into 3 phases especially for the 3d water quality 1 a one year dataset with monthly frequency was used to develop and pre calibrate the model 2 two monthly dataset at every 10 minute frequency was applied to recalibrate validate the model after the sensor data were available and 3 based on the collected data from online sensors a data driven model was implemented to correct and improve the outputs of the processed models at stations where the deterministic models have relatively poor performance as shown in fig 7 the calibrated model compared with every 10 min data from one of the sensors located in the southern part of singapore s coastal area reproduces the dynamics of chlorophyll a and oxygen however to maintain a large number of sensors and to save and process data is extremely costly de zoysa et al 2007 madden and franklin 2002 therefore in order to reflect the trend and dynamics of water quality it is advised to combine both lab measurements small size dataset with low frequency and real time sensor data large size dataset with high frequency during the model calibration 3 3 study of multiple phytoplankton species dynamics and competition harmful algal blooms habs may be driven by chemical biological and physical factors or their combined influence although ecophysiological characteristics of harmful species can be observed through laboratory studies the results are not sufficient when applied to predict the succession of phytoplankton species and harmful algal blooms in the aquatic ecosystems as their complex interactions with other organisms cannot exactly be reproduced in laboratory experiments zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 to address the dynamics and mechanisms of the algal blooms ecological and environmental models are considered very useful in the assessment of changes in water quality influenced by external environmental conditions and effective restoration of aquatic ecosystems gurkan et al 2006b leon et al 2011 moll and radach 2003 zhang et al 2003b however to predict and forecast habs requires accurate estimates of nutrient inputs well calibrated and integrated ecosystem models glibert et al 2010 traditional eutrophication models may only focus on one or another aspect without considering species competition and adaptation to the prevailing environmental conditions and catchment scale influence which are critical to better understanding the phenomenon of phytoplankton dynamics the integrated modelling approach based on the delft3d water quality modelling suite incorporating the bloom model los 2009 was applied to study harmful algal bloom dynamics in one of tropical freshwater bodies in singapore as shown in fig 2 c the bloom model is based on optimizing phytoplankton biomass under consideration of environmental constraints where species most adaptable to environmental change will have higher biomass and finally become dominant species the bloom model can have as many as eight phytoplankton species groups including freshwater diatoms including synedra green algae including ankistrodesmus and cosmarium and six representative groups of cyanobacteria microcystis pseudanabaena cylindrospermopsis arthrospira planktothrix and planktolyngbya ecophysiological parameters e g maximum growth rates mortality respiration rates etc of representative phytoplankton species were characterized based on either temperate or tropical regions from both literature and experiments in the bloom model as demonstrated in fig 8 the stacked area percentage chat shows that the coexistence of several phytoplankton species and distributions are well simulated in the tropical reservoir 3 4 modelling fate and transport and risk assessment of emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems widespread occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs in aquatic ecosystems has brought new problems of water resource management and challenges in terms of the occurrence and treatment methods for these contaminants brack et al 2015 luo et al 2014 qu et al 2013 since they are typically in a range of 1 0 ng l 1 0 μg l and are potential threats to environmental and public health organization 2000 pal et al 2014 schriks et al 2010 emerging contaminants comprising of compounds belonging to a wide variety of chemical classes such as hormones antibiotics pesticides surfactants human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors may come from different sources and have different transport pathways transfer times fate and mixture effects which also pose major challenges in modelling and assessing ecs in the environment brack et al 2015 the integrated framework was also applied in modelling fate and transport of ecs in one of the freshwater bodies in singapore the catchment modelling that consists of rainfall runoff and emission models provides inputs of flow discharge and emerging contaminant loads into the receiving water bodies a 3d hydrodynamic model 3d water quality and ecs models with four layers in the water column and seven layers in the sediment were also built into the system to simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of distributions of ecs both in the water bodies and sediments as demonstrated in fig 9 where per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and two major components pfoa and pfos have been modelled in this approach in the water body fig 2 c a further step towards assessing the potential risks at ecosystem and human health levels and providing advice for policy makers can also be incorporated into the system as demonstrated in fig 10 where bisphenol a bpa was simulated under different loading scenarios from the catchment area the predicted concentrations of bpa were subsequently compared with the predicted no effect concentration pnec of 60 μg l for assessing the potential risks of bpa in the water body 3 5 application of catchment scale modelling in describing change of water quality in response to events change of rainfall patterns such as storm events may have dramatic impacts on changes in water quality noble et al 2003 especially for faecal indicator bacteria in urban areas which are associated with urban runoff colford et al 2007 given the complex generation and transport of pollutants in multiple media and spatiotemporal dynamic distributions of pollutants during storm events it is difficult to predict changes in water quality without consideration of influences at catchment scales ahyerre et al 1998 bach et al 2014 liu et al 2013 the integrative approach facilitates the prediction as demonstrated in fig 11 the model was not only used for predicting long term change in bacteria concentrations fig 11 but also applied to predict the change in bacteria concentration during storm events which were highly correlated with rainfall patterns fig 12 shows how the model responds to the storm events it can be seen that the higher rainfall at around 120 mm on december 7 resulting in higher bacteria concentrations has been well reproduced by the model 3 6 application of data simulation techniques in improving model performance as discussed in section 2 data assimilation da techniques have been proven effective in improving water quality forecasting either through updating initial conditions or correcting output of model results when combined with process based numerical models amour 2016 kim et al 2014 wang et al 2016 an example is shown here for forecasting one of the eutrophication water quality parameters i e chlorophyll a in singapore s coastal waters in both top and bottom layers at one of the selected stations in the eastern coastal area where the deterministic model has relatively poorer performance when compared to the results in fig 7 it shows the rmse was reduced by 58 from 5 96 to 2 49 and 14 from 3 18 to 2 73 in the two day forecasting for both top and bottom layers respectively fig 13 the improved forecasting of chlorophyll a concentrations was also obtained in the 2 h forecasting where 48 and 12 improvements in the average rmse in predicting chlorophyll a for both top and the bottom layers fig 14 the incorporated da in the numerical models can remove the hidden uncertainties of the original model and significantly improve the predicted change in water quality especially for real time prediction in the future the data assimilation techniques can help improve the performance of the deterministic model when a large size of dataset is available and the parameterization proves difficult to fit the observations 3 7 application in operational management system oms for daily operation and management of water quality to address complex environmental issues associated with different disciplines there is a need to link data models and tools jagers 2010 especially for real time water quality forecasting bedri et al 2014 however many challenges remain when an integrated modelling is used for real time forecasting and management purposes bedri et al 2014 a flood forecasting system delft fews has been widely used for simulating real time change of water quantity and quality as well as management of water resources gijsbers et al 2008 buurman et al 2014 dhondia et al 2014 restrepo et al 2010 the various models together with monitoring data have also been integrated into the operational management system oms and used in singapore water quality management nauta et al 2008 as demonstrated in fig 15 data from online sensors together with weather forecasting are sent to the computer platform where the combined process and data driven models not only simulate the current status of water quality parameters but also predict the future change in water quality the results are compared and assessed based on the reference levels as demonstrated by different coloured zones in the dashboard in fig 15 the combined approach of the monitoring with the integrated modelling system provides scientific support for decision makers based on the assessed status of water quality parameters against the criteria set by local authorities the system can give early warning if guidelines or criteria are not met so that the decision makers or mangers can be informed to take necessary appropriate actions different mitigation measures e g aeration recirculation source control and combination of measures can also be examined and recommended through the running of different scenarios this system can be used for both short term and long term predictions it is capable of doing the following nauta et al 2008 providing an online state of current water quality parameters and thereby giving warnings if the criteria are not met predicting the expected state of water quality variation based on different mitigation measures and examining the effects of selected management measures real time data streaming from different sources and models checking and optimizing performance and visualizing the results use for daily operational and management of water quality 4 conclusions the comprehensive integrated catchment scale monitoring and modelling approach has successfully been applied in different case studies suggesting that the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used not only for long term planning and management of water quality but also for real time forecasting of change in water quality and predicting event driven aquatic ecosystem change the approach produces synergistic effects in modelling capability in facilitating research and applications and provides a useful framework for the future sound management of water quality it is a good example of translational activity of scientists and researchers in close collaboration with policy makers we can use the integrated approach as a generic tool to better understand aquatic ecosystem properties and processes and generate predictions to support policy makers 5 software

receiving water body the level of detail and the accuracy of these schematizations determine to a large degree upon how realistic simulations can be the rainfall runoff model e g sobek and the generic emission model both operate at catchment scale te linde et al 2010 zhang et al 2012b de lange et al 2014 these models generate the loads of water and pollutant substances into drains and receiving water body the emission model contains point and non point sources such as sewerage treatment plants industries as well as diffuse sources sewerage system atmosphere agriculture etc the 1d hydraulic model e g sobek flow provides the water flow through the drains into the water body the 3d hydrodynamic model e g delft3d flow simulates water flow both horizontally and vertically and dispersion within the water body it also considers both thermal and salinity stratification the hydraulic and hydrodynamic models can be coupled both off line and on line where the latter provides data to the former on the basis of which the flow through the gates in the dam is controlled when used for the freshwater body the simulated water flows are delivered to the emission model the 1d transport model e g sobek waq eco and the 3d water quality model e g delft3d eco loads of substances arising from the catchments are transported through the drains in the 1d models of emission model and transport model as presented in fig 1 the 3d water quality model computes the concentration patterns and mass flows of nutrients phytoplankton organic matter dissolved oxygen sediment salinity coliform bacteria e coli and enterococci both in the water and in the top sediment of the reservoirs smits and van beek 2013 each individual model can be run standalone or either online or offline coupled with other models the integrated modelling framework can produce annual simulations to capture seasonal differences in long term predictions and can also be used for real time forecasting in short time simulations when combined with online sensor data and other inputs which feed the model and function as initial conditions for next timestep prediction data assimilation a technique to combine information from numerical models with observations is also incorporated into this integrated framework to further improve the accuracy of process based model prediction up till now various data assimilation procedures can be applied babovic et al 2005 i e a updating inputs b updating model parameters c updating state variables and d updating output of variables in method a the input uncertainties are addressed by certain iterative procedures method b may be computer intensive as the involved parameters are updated by calibration procedures the main difference between methods c and d is that the data assimilation procedure in method c is integrated with the process model and will need the model to be recalled to run with the adjustment in contrast method d will detach the solution procedure of the process model and the original process model does not necessarily need to be re run every time in the data assimilation procedure for a complex water quality model it may be more convenient to apply a data assimilation scheme to correct the model without interfacing with and rerunning the water quality model this efficiency is especially necessary for a real time forecasting system it is implemented by constructing data driven models to approximate the uncertainties of numerical models based on available measurements this is normally performed in two steps error forecasting and spatial distribution the error forecasting can update the model error at stations with measurements and the other stations without measurements can be updated by employing the technique of spatial distribution by doing this both the temporal and spatial dynamics of the model uncertainties will be estimated and assimilated to the original numerical model to update their outputs le provost et al 1998 wang et al 2016 one of the most widely used data assimilation approaches is the kalman filter and its derivatives however the requirements regarding prior statistics of the stochastic errors in both state processes and observation processes limit the application of the approach to real world problems zhang et al 2006 the other limitation is its requirements for iterative model re run and costly heavy computational demand another kind of data assimilation is model error residual correction it is performed through error forecasting and spatial distribution local model lm and modified local model mlm amour and kauranne 2017 wang et al 2016 inspired by chaos theory have been proven effective for model error forecasting and tested in our water quality model updating technique the operational management system will be discussed separately in section 3 7 3 applications of the integrated approach we applied the integrated approach in different case studies and demonstrated how the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used for describing different mechanisms and driving factors influencing changes of water quality and facilitating research and management in this section as mentioned in the previous section the integrated approach can be used in both coastal and freshwater systems we discussed its applications based on two testbeds as shown in fig 2 one is in singapore s coastal waters fig 2 b another is in one of the freshwater bodies in singapore fig 2 c it should be noted that a necessary modification of each individual model should be considered when applied to a specific case study for instance a multiple layer sediment model is incorporated into the 3d waq model in order to account for the sediment impacts in shallow freshwater systems whereas a simple two layer sediment model is considered in the coastal 3d waq model 3 1 assessing impact of catchment discharges and ocean dynamics on change in water quality altered freshwater inflows in the catchment areas can have a significant influence on spatiotemporal dynamics of nutrients and other water quality indicators in coastal waters resulting in fate and transport of pollutants and organisms with dilution or mobilization of contaminants changing salinity distributions causing stratification and hypoxia breitburg et al 2008 kimmerer 2002 sklar and browder 1998 we applied the integrated approach to test how discharge and pollutants from catchment areas influence the change in water quality in singapore s coastal zone area fig 3 a calibrated 3d waq with 10 layers in the water column was applied for this test wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 in the northern part of singapore s coastal zone salinity is significantly influenced by freshwater discharges from local catchment areas which dilute the salinity and result in a lower level of salinity concentration around 10 psu whereas in the southern part of the singapore straits the tidal flow controls the dynamics of salinity with high concentrations between 30 and 35 psu the different flow patterns result in an increased trend of salinity from north to south fig 3 similar patterns can also be found in the dynamics of total nitrogen in coastal waters where local catchment freshwater inflows with high pollutant concentrations lead to high concentrations of nitrogen in the northern coastal waters also known as the johor straits the influence of local catchment discharge on nitrogen dynamics is also reflected in the southwest coast where pollutant loadings from industry in jurong island result in high concentrations of nutrient concentrations in the coastal waters surrounding the island fig 4 the higher concentrations of pollutants such as nutrients and bacteria in the freshwater are diluted by the saline water while the catchment freshwater discharges result in lower salinity concentration in the coastal waters enrichment of nutrients associated with loadings from the local catchment areas can also cause severe hypoxia in bottom waters less than 0 5 mgo2 l and aberrant behavior of benthic fauna diaz and rosenberg 2008 high discharges of freshwaters from local catchment rivers can also increase the water circulations and nutrient loads that in turn increase the oxygen concentrations in the top layer but also result in very low oxygen concentrations in bottom layers of the water column due to mineralized detritus and stratification process as demonstrated in fig 5 where the dissolved oxygen in bottom layers in northern coastal waters could reach less than 2 0 mgo2 l due to the possibly combined effects of different physical chemical and biological processes involved 3 2 combining small and large sizes of datasets for improving accuracy of model predictions and reducing long term monitoring costs a good performance of the model is dependent on how well the model is calibrated which is always a challenge zhang et al 2003c this requires not only satisfactory techniques and expert knowledge but also sufficient amounts and quality of the available data janssen and heuberger 1995 however the datasets from field survey and lab measurements are always limited by budget and manpower which are usually monthly or bimonthly data at low frequency such observed data do provide useful information for model calibrations and validations but the low frequency may limit modelers from fully understanding the actual dynamics and preventing capture of real behavior jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 a typical pattern is demonstrated in fig 6 in general the model captures the trend in state variables of oxygen chlorophyll a and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the water column over 6 month simulation period when compared with the observations compared to the simulation based on the calibration with the intensive datasets large size of dataset in fig 7 the dynamic behaviors which were driven by spring neap tidal cycles bergondo et al 2005 were overlooked with the monthly datasets in fig 6 combing small and large dataset approach can have advantages during the model development the procedure of the model calibration with those dataset are as follows 1 first the model set up and pre calibration are based on the sparse data with small size which can not only reduce the demanding on large size dataset but also determine what kind of further measurements are needed 2 once intensive data with large sample size are available e g further measurements during model development those data can be combined with data driven modelling techniques for parameter optimizations during calibration and correcting the prediction results wang et al 2016 in our modelling framework the model calibration is divided into 3 phases especially for the 3d water quality 1 a one year dataset with monthly frequency was used to develop and pre calibrate the model 2 two monthly dataset at every 10 minute frequency was applied to recalibrate validate the model after the sensor data were available and 3 based on the collected data from online sensors a data driven model was implemented to correct and improve the outputs of the processed models at stations where the deterministic models have relatively poor performance as shown in fig 7 the calibrated model compared with every 10 min data from one of the sensors located in the southern part of singapore s coastal area reproduces the dynamics of chlorophyll a and oxygen however to maintain a large number of sensors and to save and process data is extremely costly de zoysa et al 2007 madden and franklin 2002 therefore in order to reflect the trend and dynamics of water quality it is advised to combine both lab measurements small size dataset with low frequency and real time sensor data large size dataset with high frequency during the model calibration 3 3 study of multiple phytoplankton species dynamics and competition harmful algal blooms habs may be driven by chemical biological and physical factors or their combined influence although ecophysiological characteristics of harmful species can be observed through laboratory studies the results are not sufficient when applied to predict the succession of phytoplankton species and harmful algal blooms in the aquatic ecosystems as their complex interactions with other organisms cannot exactly be reproduced in laboratory experiments zingone and oksfeldt enevoldsen 2000 to address the dynamics and mechanisms of the algal blooms ecological and environmental models are considered very useful in the assessment of changes in water quality influenced by external environmental conditions and effective restoration of aquatic ecosystems gurkan et al 2006b leon et al 2011 moll and radach 2003 zhang et al 2003b however to predict and forecast habs requires accurate estimates of nutrient inputs well calibrated and integrated ecosystem models glibert et al 2010 traditional eutrophication models may only focus on one or another aspect without considering species competition and adaptation to the prevailing environmental conditions and catchment scale influence which are critical to better understanding the phenomenon of phytoplankton dynamics the integrated modelling approach based on the delft3d water quality modelling suite incorporating the bloom model los 2009 was applied to study harmful algal bloom dynamics in one of tropical freshwater bodies in singapore as shown in fig 2 c the bloom model is based on optimizing phytoplankton biomass under consideration of environmental constraints where species most adaptable to environmental change will have higher biomass and finally become dominant species the bloom model can have as many as eight phytoplankton species groups including freshwater diatoms including synedra green algae including ankistrodesmus and cosmarium and six representative groups of cyanobacteria microcystis pseudanabaena cylindrospermopsis arthrospira planktothrix and planktolyngbya ecophysiological parameters e g maximum growth rates mortality respiration rates etc of representative phytoplankton species were characterized based on either temperate or tropical regions from both literature and experiments in the bloom model as demonstrated in fig 8 the stacked area percentage chat shows that the coexistence of several phytoplankton species and distributions are well simulated in the tropical reservoir 3 4 modelling fate and transport and risk assessment of emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems widespread occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs in aquatic ecosystems has brought new problems of water resource management and challenges in terms of the occurrence and treatment methods for these contaminants brack et al 2015 luo et al 2014 qu et al 2013 since they are typically in a range of 1 0 ng l 1 0 μg l and are potential threats to environmental and public health organization 2000 pal et al 2014 schriks et al 2010 emerging contaminants comprising of compounds belonging to a wide variety of chemical classes such as hormones antibiotics pesticides surfactants human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors may come from different sources and have different transport pathways transfer times fate and mixture effects which also pose major challenges in modelling and assessing ecs in the environment brack et al 2015 the integrated framework was also applied in modelling fate and transport of ecs in one of the freshwater bodies in singapore the catchment modelling that consists of rainfall runoff and emission models provides inputs of flow discharge and emerging contaminant loads into the receiving water bodies a 3d hydrodynamic model 3d water quality and ecs models with four layers in the water column and seven layers in the sediment were also built into the system to simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of distributions of ecs both in the water bodies and sediments as demonstrated in fig 9 where per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass and two major components pfoa and pfos have been modelled in this approach in the water body fig 2 c a further step towards assessing the potential risks at ecosystem and human health levels and providing advice for policy makers can also be incorporated into the system as demonstrated in fig 10 where bisphenol a bpa was simulated under different loading scenarios from the catchment area the predicted concentrations of bpa were subsequently compared with the predicted no effect concentration pnec of 60 μg l for assessing the potential risks of bpa in the water body 3 5 application of catchment scale modelling in describing change of water quality in response to events change of rainfall patterns such as storm events may have dramatic impacts on changes in water quality noble et al 2003 especially for faecal indicator bacteria in urban areas which are associated with urban runoff colford et al 2007 given the complex generation and transport of pollutants in multiple media and spatiotemporal dynamic distributions of pollutants during storm events it is difficult to predict changes in water quality without consideration of influences at catchment scales ahyerre et al 1998 bach et al 2014 liu et al 2013 the integrative approach facilitates the prediction as demonstrated in fig 11 the model was not only used for predicting long term change in bacteria concentrations fig 11 but also applied to predict the change in bacteria concentration during storm events which were highly correlated with rainfall patterns fig 12 shows how the model responds to the storm events it can be seen that the higher rainfall at around 120 mm on december 7 resulting in higher bacteria concentrations has been well reproduced by the model 3 6 application of data simulation techniques in improving model performance as discussed in section 2 data assimilation da techniques have been proven effective in improving water quality forecasting either through updating initial conditions or correcting output of model results when combined with process based numerical models amour 2016 kim et al 2014 wang et al 2016 an example is shown here for forecasting one of the eutrophication water quality parameters i e chlorophyll a in singapore s coastal waters in both top and bottom layers at one of the selected stations in the eastern coastal area where the deterministic model has relatively poorer performance when compared to the results in fig 7 it shows the rmse was reduced by 58 from 5 96 to 2 49 and 14 from 3 18 to 2 73 in the two day forecasting for both top and bottom layers respectively fig 13 the improved forecasting of chlorophyll a concentrations was also obtained in the 2 h forecasting where 48 and 12 improvements in the average rmse in predicting chlorophyll a for both top and the bottom layers fig 14 the incorporated da in the numerical models can remove the hidden uncertainties of the original model and significantly improve the predicted change in water quality especially for real time prediction in the future the data assimilation techniques can help improve the performance of the deterministic model when a large size of dataset is available and the parameterization proves difficult to fit the observations 3 7 application in operational management system oms for daily operation and management of water quality to address complex environmental issues associated with different disciplines there is a need to link data models and tools jagers 2010 especially for real time water quality forecasting bedri et al 2014 however many challenges remain when an integrated modelling is used for real time forecasting and management purposes bedri et al 2014 a flood forecasting system delft fews has been widely used for simulating real time change of water quantity and quality as well as management of water resources gijsbers et al 2008 buurman et al 2014 dhondia et al 2014 restrepo et al 2010 the various models together with monitoring data have also been integrated into the operational management system oms and used in singapore water quality management nauta et al 2008 as demonstrated in fig 15 data from online sensors together with weather forecasting are sent to the computer platform where the combined process and data driven models not only simulate the current status of water quality parameters but also predict the future change in water quality the results are compared and assessed based on the reference levels as demonstrated by different coloured zones in the dashboard in fig 15 the combined approach of the monitoring with the integrated modelling system provides scientific support for decision makers based on the assessed status of water quality parameters against the criteria set by local authorities the system can give early warning if guidelines or criteria are not met so that the decision makers or mangers can be informed to take necessary appropriate actions different mitigation measures e g aeration recirculation source control and combination of measures can also be examined and recommended through the running of different scenarios this system can be used for both short term and long term predictions it is capable of doing the following nauta et al 2008 providing an online state of current water quality parameters and thereby giving warnings if the criteria are not met predicting the expected state of water quality variation based on different mitigation measures and examining the effects of selected management measures real time data streaming from different sources and models checking and optimizing performance and visualizing the results use for daily operational and management of water quality 4 conclusions the comprehensive integrated catchment scale monitoring and modelling approach has successfully been applied in different case studies suggesting that the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used not only for long term planning and management of water quality but also for real time forecasting of change in water quality and predicting event driven aquatic ecosystem change the approach produces synergistic effects in modelling capability in facilitating research and applications and provides a useful framework for the future sound management of water quality it is a good example of translational activity of scientists and researchers in close collaboration with policy makers we can use the integrated approach as a generic tool to better understand aquatic ecosystem properties and processes and generate predictions to support policy makers 5 software

26148,modelling is key to adapting agriculture to climate change cc facilitating evaluation of the impacts and efficacy of adaptation measures and the design of optimal strategies although there are many challenges to modelling agricultural cc adaptation it is unclear whether these are novel or whether adaptation merely adds new motivations to old challenges here qualitative analysis of modellers views revealed three categories of challenge content use and capacity triangulation of findings with reviews of agricultural modelling and climate change risk assessment was then used to highlight challenges specific to modelling adaptation these were refined through literature review focussing attention on how the progressive nature of cc affects the role and impact of modelling specific challenges identified were scope of adaptations modelled information on future adaptation collaboration to tackle novel challenges optimisation under progressive change with thresholds and responsibility given the sensitivity of future outcomes to initial choices under progressive change graphical abstract image 1 keywords adaptation agricultural modelling climate change research

2000 models need to incorporate adaptation to test the effectiveness of adaptive responses and reveal synergies and trade offs between adaptation to cc and other objectives del prado et al 2013 kipling et al 2016a lobell et al 2008 in relation to any specific modelled system cc adaptations can be autonomous responses occurring without external intervention or non autonomous planned actions taken pre emptively or due to experience of cc impacts fao 2007 reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 for example in a regional scale model autonomous adaptation might include predicted responses of farmers to environmental change such as altering sowing dates while a policy decision to fund irrigation systems might be a non autonomous adaptation investigated by altering model inputs in addition modelling strategies investigated as potential cc adaptations might include responses to non climatic systemic pressures with adaptive or maladaptive consequences grüneis et al 2016 mitter et al 2018 in the context of this study cc adaptation is defined as including non autonomous adaptations any strategy explored by modellers as a potential cc adaptation and autonomous human adaptations autonomous biophysical responses of the system and actions not recognised as cc adaptations within a specific modelling exercise are considered to be part of the context within which cc adaptation occurs the literature on agricultural modelling of cc impacts and adaptive responses is vast and growing challinor et al 2014 özkan et al 2016 rötter et al 2018 ruiz ramos et al 2018 wheeler and reynolds 2013 zhang et al 2017 with diversity in scope and focus this complexity makes it hard to unpick the nature of the modelling challenges the question arises as to whether efforts to model cc impacts and to improve agricultural modelling in general are sufficient to support adaptive actions by stakeholders and policymakers or whether there are agricultural modelling challenges specific to cc adaptation and thus requiring focussed attention from researchers and modellers the aim of the current study was to search for and if found define challenges specific to cc adaptation modelling in agriculture research was based on the gathering and analysis of agricultural modellers views of challenges to modelling agricultural cc adaptation 2 materials and methods the study proceeded in three stages i modelling challenges were identified by modellers within workshops and analysed to identify challenge themes and categories ii findings were triangulated by comparing the identified themes with modelling challenges described in existing reviews this process was used to validate the workshop data and to identify themes likely to include elements specific to modelling cc adaptation iii the subset of challenges considered to have cc adaptation specific aspects was considered in the light of a review of the wider literature on cc adaptation to highlight those novel elements 2 1 identifying challenge themes and categories two workshops were held to understand and explore modellers views on the challenges to modelling cc adaptation bringing together researchers from across the modelling european agriculture with climate change for food security macsur knowledge hub http macsur eu the workshops engaged 22 modellers from 21 institutes across 11 european countries with participants representing a purposive sample of agricultural modellers with a specific interest in modelling cc adaptation yin 1989 within this sample 16 agricultural modelling groups were represented appendix a from across crop grassland livestock farm scale and economic modelling disciplines workshops gathered participants views through two structured discussions in which attendees were asked to map adaptation strategies for agriculture and related modelling challenges participants were asked what the challenges to modelling climate change adaptation were they recorded their ideas on sticky notes one challenge per note to reduce bias towards the views of vocal participants which can arise in group discussions kitzinger 1995 notes were collected and reviewed by the group to remove duplicates clarify unclear contributions and give participants a chance to add further ideas after considering the question during the session and in the light of other responses data responses recorded by participants on sticky notes were analysed following a grounded theory approach using thematic coding ritchie et al 2014 grounded theory seeks to draw information from data rather than fitting them to a pre conceived categorisation themes in the data are identified by thematic coding for example identifying that several contributions relate to data quality themes are then compared and contrasted to identify underlying characteristics linking them into broader categories relevant to the research question in this way categories are grounded in derived from the original data ensuring relevance and openness to emerging issues charmaz 2014 qualitative approaches have been widely used to investigate the views perspectives and characteristics of agricultural stakeholders mitter et al 2018 morris et al 2017 but to a lesser extent to explore agricultural research processes themselves exceptions include reed et al 2014 who used a grounded theory approach to identify key principles of knowledge exchange in environmental management and kipling and özkan et al 2016 who analysed questionnaire data to reveal discourses underlying the perspectives of agricultural modellers on the challenges to communication with stakeholders these examples demonstrate the practical value of grounded theory in revealing underlying patterns in complex topics after the identification of themes through coding of the workshop data these themes were compared and contrasted to reveal underlying categories with relevance to the research topic ritchie et al 2014 to ensure that the identified categories were robust and properly grounded in the data results were checked by co authors not involved in the analysis following bitsch 2005 in addition intermediate findings were presented and discussed at an internal macsur project meeting an important aspect of grounded theory methodology is to ensure data saturation morris et al 2017 where no new themes or issues arise from the data to check this specific modelling challenges were identified in the text of a global review focussed on crop modelling of the impacts of and adaptation to cc rötter et al 2018 these challenges were coded to ascertain whether any new themes were present or whether workshop themes were sufficient to accommodate the challenges described indicating saturation the article also defined challenges specific to modelling tropical plant production systems providing a test of whether themes arising from the contributions of european modellers involved in the present study have relevance beyond the region 2 2 triangulation with previous reviews and the identification of cc adaptation specific challenges a recent review of challenges for climate change risk assessment ccra for adaptation policy adger et al 2018 offered a comparison between the data from the current study and challenges identified within a discipline focussed specifically on cc adaptation but which encompasses change in all sectors not only agriculture and which may but does not necessarily draw on modelling this comparison could therefore reveal or expand on challenges related to cc adaptation itself that modellers may not have considered themes were identified in the review using thematic coding following the method applied to the data from the workshops 2 1 the themes defined in this process were then compared with the themes derived from the current study to identify similarities and differences a second set of comparisons were made between workshop data and two recent reviews of modelling challenges in the context of cc for grassland modelling and for animal health and disease modelling kipling et al 2016b özkan et al 2016 these two articles were chosen as they applied a similar approach to that used here in order to derive the challenges they presented allowing a straight comparison with the themes identified in the current study the disciplines of grassland and health and disease modelling lie within the broader agricultural modelling community focussed on in this study but the reviews reflected on cc in general only briefly treating cc adaptation they could therefore be used to reveal which of the challenges from the current study were also wider challenges for modellers and therefore not specific to cc adaptation modelling in the context of a wider review of literature on cc adaptation triangulation of these different comparisons was used to draw out specific cc adaptation challenges for agricultural modelling 3 results and discussion 3 1 challenges to modelling adaptation grounded theory analysis of challenges to modelling adaptation expressed by modellers identified 18 themes see appendix a for full description of each and three underlying categories content use and capacity fig 1 3 1 1 content of models many comments made by participants related to the fundamental question of how and how well models characterise systems for some the effects of external processes on systems was important not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible how to assess the impacts at farm scale including top down political influences changes in policies can make previous changes in farm strategic planning investments useless other comments highlighted challenges of modelling different types of change over time solutions can be applied in many different ways gradually in one step in a series of steps timeframe of choices so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity and in particular sudden change in biophysical systems the length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices and this is hard to model e g a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought but previous droughts or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available and changes in the adaptive choices available disruptive technology one of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural issues were also raised relating to when choices are made when it becomes preferable to change the system production rather than to adapt underlying these challenges were those relating to modelling interactions within systems in general e g the application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change with adaptation adding further complexity incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure participants reflected on unevenness in the coverage of different systems by modelling which may be limited in regions currently facing the most negative cc impacts difficulties in modelling mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self reseeding species the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands or in relation to previously marginal production approaches that might be important adaptation strategies nitrogen cycle to create a zero sum long term n balance what happens in a semi arid soil what happens under agro forestry what happens in ley plus arable the category is bound together by a sense from the data of a research community that is itself being asked to adapt this mirrors the progressive nature of cc how this is changing modelling priorities and how it disrupts a research community of previously discrete specialised modelling groups forcing them to broaden their focus and the application of their models see also section 3 1 3 3 1 2 use of models many participants raised issues that related to how modelling could and should be interpreted and applied some considered the need to highlight different outcomes adaptation to protect ecosystem services social context motive of farmers values policy context market failure etc demonstration of importance of these services while others viewed modelling as part of a wider process demonstrate use of modelling in participatory projects with the capacity to alter the focus of stakeholders and also of research modelling imagined situations to produce simulations can draw attention to a problem and stimulate the data production required to improve such estimates while these comments view the role of models as stimulating understanding and interest others focussed on how to fit findings to users needs policy makers are asking how do we do x while scientists are answering what happens if questions this can create communication problems and understanding of the requirements of key players policy farmers some specific interests believed to be important for stakeholders were highlighted along with the challenge of tailoring outputs to specific conditions cooling ventilation adaptation designs are very farm specific e g requirement for a very detailed design and approach other comments considered how stakeholder engagement and model relevance were related actors e g farmers have to be involved in the research pathway from the beginning in order to co design research questions and co develop win win adaptation strategies a final element was the challenge of communicating findings which may be related to the complexity of the results distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive normative information and results or the skills of modellers talking is important modellers can put too little effort into communication skills some participants suggested ways to overcome communication barriers when sharing results e g incorporation into media products like animated films the use of models category therefore has both pragmatic what do stakeholders want how to communicate and normative what should be modelled and explored elements 3 1 3 capacity of models in contrast to comments about what models characterise and how content a distinct set of contributions were related to information and support for modelling many participants highlighted historical and resource related reasons for model limitations some model limitations come from the development of models over time e g model name was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in what now seems a limited way management experts then moved on to other projects and model name became more biophysical model evolution was seen to create problems in the capacity of successive generations of researchers to use models effectively most models contain vast amounts of implicit knowledge continuity of human capital is too short this rapidly degrades the future utility of models despite huge latent potential some participants referred to how model capacity can be shaped by the interests of funders which may not align with priorities identified by researchers with disease endemic diseases are more important than incursions but less attractive to funders e g liver fluke collaboration was seen as a way to tackle issues of capacity by drawing on wider expertise linking groups interdisciplinarily to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user a distinct capacity related element in responses referred to the data on which models rely a particular focus was issues relating to data on the impacts of future cc conditions on modelled systems lack of data for forage crops response to fertilizer under varied extreme event conditions future climatic conditions focussed climate scenarios needed e g northern europe is likely to face wetter conditions and heat stress is not an issue and the likely adaptive behaviour of stakeholders data on risk perception of farmers are they likely to use the strategy why past experiences there was awareness that data issues often related to a lack of interaction between researchers in different regions and disciplines there are examples of systems in extreme climates we in north western europe have little sense about them or data that may exist on them and to variation in available data quality heat stress modelling work requires wider data availability to capture differences in impacts between regions eu database some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability rather than real differences in conditions the need for data about projected futures was raised and particularly limitations in approaches to gaining such information subjective expert knowledge on probability of events and shocks comments on data sometimes focussed on the need for better data sharing systems inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information and barriers to this often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and or obtain cash and rights again the underlying thread in this category was how tackling cc adaptation created a need to overcome the constraints of fragmented research structures 3 1 4 evaluation of analysis comparing the challenges identified here with those defined for crop modelling by rötter et al 2018 appendix c no new challenge themes were discovered indicating data saturation in relation to the themes and categories derived from our workshop data challenges from rötter et al 2018 aligned with a subset of six of the 18 themes identified from workshops the article also discussed the use of model ensembles to tackle issues related to uncertainty with this topic treated as an aspect of progress rather than a future challenge if included as a challenge to modelling this topic would be accommodated within the uncertainty modelling theme identified in the workshop appendix c as the article included specific challenges for modelling tropical plant production the fact that no new themes were revealed also provides an indication that the themes presented here are also relevant to adaptation modelling in non european contexts although specific challenges within themes are likely to vary further investigations of challenges to modelling other non european farming systems would be important to confirm this wider applicability of the categorisation presented 3 2 triangulation with previous reviews consolidating challenges to modelling cc adaptation into three categories model content use and capacity provided a useful conceptual overview however many issues raised related to broader modelling challenges in particular modelling cc impacts on agriculture is a complex challenge in itself that has been recently reviewed by a number of authors kipling et al 2016a 2016b özkan et al 2016 rötter et al 2018 comparisons with previous work therefore sought to further elaborate and differentiate cc adaptation specific issues from wider modelling challenges 3 2 1 ccra review comparison comparison of the challenge themes derived from workshop data with the ccra review adger et al 2018 identified workshop challenges also recognised as issues for the adaptation but not agriculture specific field of ccra for adaptation policy the aim was to highlight challenges with potentially adaptation specific aspects for further consideration for full details of themes from the ccra review and of the comparison see appendix d in relation to the category of capacity in the current study several themes were found in both modelling and ccra studies specifically collaboration data availability data quality novel scenarios and uncertainty fig 2 challenges identified by modellers relating to resource availability resources for modelling and data accessibility i e due to communication and ownership of data rather than due to whether they exist were not raised in relation to ccra for adaptation policy this difference may reflect the very specific data requirements of models and the fact that agricultural modelling must come together across specific disciplines to incorporate cc adaptation while ccra is already a united community explicitly focused on this aim and working in direct support of policy in general these two challenge themes are clearly not a specific issue for modelling cc adaptation in agriculture but broader challenges to model development and application in relation to the category of model content the ccra review highlighted challenges relating to the interdependence of systems and how adaptations and their impacts cascade outwards this theme overlaps with the modelling challenges of interactions scale interactions external limitations modelling and dynamic change modelling in relation to the latter the specific issue of accounting for time lags in adaptation was highlighted there is no ccra theme that relates to discrete events except for a reference within the collaboration theme to the benefits of linking to disaster risk management researchers in relation to management modelling the ccra review focused on the specific issue of cognitive bias and how it affects decision making the biggest differences between the current study and the ccra review were found in the category of use of models participants in the current study expressed awareness of practical challenges relating to how to improve model relevance user focus the engagement approaches that modellers need to use the role of modelling when and how to engage and the challenge of effective communication with stakeholders however they did not consider how such issues might interact with differing stakeholder limitations and agendas which was highlighted in the ccra review within several different themes fig 2 a black boxes these differences in relation to use may reflect the different characteristics of modelling versus risk assessment in a ccra data form the core content with the scope of the assessment and understanding of interactions biophysical political and economic across scales and sectors etc explicit in the subsequent interpretation of those data an issue relating to the capacity to carry out this interpretation in contrast in modelling data are required to develop and use the model relating to the category capacity while scope and understanding of how systems work form the content of the model as a result model outputs may be shared and used by decision makers without these underlying issues contained within the model being considered interpretation of results becomes a much more contested space within ccra with uncertainty and limitations of knowledge interacting with the sometimes conflicting subjective agendas of stakeholders adger et al 2018 comparison of the ccra review and the present study therefore highlights the importance for agricultural cc adaptation modelling of taking better account of ethical issues relating to the presentation of findings what they include and exclude and with whom they are shared i e issues relating to the diverse motives perspectives and values of different societal groups 3 2 2 comparison with modelling reviews comparing challenges to grassland modelling and animal health and disease modelling under cc with the workshop data appendix d revealed two themes highlighted only in relation to cc adaptation not as wider challenges to modelling the first was the development of novel scenarios of future adaption fig 2 novel scenarios relate to the challenges of model scope with the difference being between elements of future change provided as model inputs scenarios and elements that are endogenous to models scope the second theme only arising in relation to cc adaptation was management modelling however it is apparent that incorporating all relevant aspects of decision making including cognitive bias into models is a general challenge for modellers seeking to represent any form of decision making studies of approaches to incorporating management into agricultural models moore et al 2014 robert et al 2016 suggest that technical solutions exist in modelling to characterise adaptation including constraints and changes that take place over time but that actually representing proactive management is difficult the fact that management modelling was not framed as a general challenge in the reviews used in the comparison exercise may relate to their focus on biophysical challenges reflecting the implicit nature of decision making assumptions in biophysical modelling i e as rational responses to biophysical cues with perfect knowledge this view is reinforced by the consideration in both reviews of interactions between management and biophysical and economic systems suggesting a greater focus on biophysical impacts and triggers of choices than on characterisation of the decision making process itself again although interactions modelling was considered as both a general and an adaptation specific challenge in the reviews improving how the interactions of biophysical economic and management systems are characterised is a general modelling challenge with only the scope of the systems modelled increasing to facilitate the modelling of novel adaptations data accessibility was another theme identified as a challenge for both general and cc adaptation modelling in the grassland and livestock health and disease reviews the need to collate available data on future adaptations however overcoming issues of data accessibility ownership sharing is clearly a general challenge for modellers and no specific elements of it were detailed in the reviews or the literature taking account of the discussions above ten of the original challenges were either not mentioned in the modelling reviews only mentioned as general challenges to modelling under cc or were determined to be general after further consideration fig 2 white boxes a cc adaptation specific element was suggested for three of these fig 2 a white boxes as a result of their relation to the ccra challenges associated with subjective aspects of dealing with stakeholders seven more of the original challenges were given both adaptation specific and wider relevance fig 2 light grey boxes determining the precise nature of the adaptation specific elements within these challenges required further consideration in the context of understanding from the wider literature which is the focus of the following section 3 3 identifying challenges specific to modelling adaptation the challenges identified in the previous section as having cc adaptation specific elements as well as associated themes from the ccra review fig 2 boxes within dashed ovals are explored below in the light of key characteristics of cc adaptation in order to focus on the underlying specific issues they present climate change differs from most other issues in that it overlays pre existing socio economic iglesias and garrote 2015 and environmental challenges and represents a progressive and sustained change over time as cc affects the biophysical systems on which we rely in multiple ways it produces cascades of interacting impacts and feedbacks within and between sectors making studies of cc issues particularly complex terzi et al 2019 so while other types of change affecting farming may also be progressive e g increasing demand for meat and dairy products advances in technology cc is unique as a sustained progressive change in the biophysical systems that farmers rely on rather than just in the socio economic context in which farming takes place path dependency in relation to processes of economic and political change over time including in agricultural systems kay 2003 see martin and sunley 2006 for a critical review means that our iterative responses to progressive cc may lead us down particular pathways each with different implications for different societal groups regions and biophysical systems for example investment to install and improve irrigation systems may make increasing crop water supply more cost effective for a farmer than changing towards more water efficient systems as cc advances with implications for other water users and the environment in sardinia dono et al 2016 found that intensive dairy farming reliant on irrigation systems is likely to be less vulnerable to cc than traditional low input sheep production reliant on natural water supplies therefore pathways of adaptive response to progressive cc need to be explored in order to facilitate informed and reflective decision making that take such issues into account in this light the scope of models to explore the future consequences of cc adaptation strategies is revealed as a cc adaptation specific element of the workshop theme of scope fig 3 b the issue of path dependency is also relevant to the use of models challenge category in the literature on cc adaptation even the need for intervention to ensure agricultural adaptation to cc is contested with some suggesting that market forces will automatically adjust systems to change while others argue that progressive cc will require well planned responses beyond the autonomous incremental change already undertaken by agricultural stakeholders anwar et al 2013 reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 relying on autonomous responses or intervening to completely manage cc adaptation are two extremes in a continuum of approaches which adaptive pathway different types of planned response or reliance on autonomous change appears most favourable depends on chosen system boundaries e g biophysical processes economic processes social processes and the nature of cc change reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 but also on desired outcomes and on whose desires are considered although profit or production maximising objectives may be assumed in hard systems van paassen et al 2007 research approaches this assumption has been described as representing an implicit sociology jansen 2009 of unexplored motives and opinions if particular motives and objectives for change have already been assumed in a model this represents a move towards more instrumental engagement with stakeholders to improve research outcomes or increase the implementation of recommendations and away from normative engagement involvement of stakeholders and incorporation of their views and needs as a right reed et al 2009 using freeman s 1984 classification of affected and affecting stakeholders this focus shifts attention from those who may be affected by change towards those that can affect change in this context and given that the quantification of information e g in models is understood to fundamentally alter how things are perceived and valued espeland and stevens 2008 it is important that the aims modellers focus on what models include who they are for and how they are communicated are critically reflected on by modellers in general within the current study the more normative aspects of the use of models challenge category reflected awareness among modellers of the potential for models to affect the direction of choices including adaptive responses and of how in some cases modellers are facing the challenge of assuming new roles e g recognising a paradigm shift in the research praxis from observer to co researchers knowledge brokers much previous work considers these issues with recent reviews focussing on best practice in stakeholder involvement model development use and evaluation fulton et al 2015 hamilton et al 2019 jakeman et al 2006 voinov et al 2016 including the development of specific engagement processes drawing on understanding of soft systems approaches martin 2015 however with pathway dependency in the context of progressive cc the potential impacts of model findings beyond the implementation of a given modelled choice add an extra dimension to issues of model use this additional element can be seen as a cc adaptation specific challenge to model use as discussed above cc adaptation modellers including biophysical modellers as well as bio economic modellers need to consider how social conflicts power relations and sectoral interests may influence their work and its use lang et al 2012 newell and taylor 2018 reed et al 2009 in the context of progressive cc and escalating adaptive responses such considerations enable modellers to recognise the implications of their focus on which stakeholders which objectives which adaptations and which impacts and to identify ways to ensure that the wider context of non modelled strategies and impacts is conveyed to stakeholders this may be carried out by the modellers themselves where they have the required expertise and sufficient resources but may also be achieved through collaboration with social scientists to try to avoid unintended consequences arising from the use of model outputs and to achieve best practice fig 3 e taken together these considerations represent the specific cc adaptation aspects of the challenges of communication engagement approaches role of modelling and user focus grouped as responsibilities of modelling under progressive climate change in fig 3 a related to the progressive nature of cc and adaptive responses to it a second key characteristic of cc adaptation was revealed explicitly in workshop data modellers expressed the need to better understand and incorporate likely stakeholder choices under progressive cc in which their expectations and experiences of cc evolve over time distinct from likely responses to other types of change such as one off shocks or opportunities to increase efficiency one participant for example highlighted the importance of understanding reasons or other triggers for farmer decisions on the number of cattle they have and the type of grassland management they apply and the point when they begin to care about climate change and take action addressing this issue which contributes to the adaptation specific elements optimisation and information fig 3 of challenge themes in groups c and d in fig 1 requires the development of cc adaptation scenarios which are relevant to likely future conditions and which provide data about the context of decision making and depending on the type of model define at least some aspects of decision making itself constructing adaptation scenarios is complex not least because of the issue of path dependency in iterative adaptive responses to progressive cc discussed above in addition choices are likely to be affected by dynamic changes in stakeholder understanding as conditions change anwar et al 2013 data for scenarios may come from social science models or be gathered from stakeholders or experts and will therefore incorporate uncertainty in addition data needed for scenarios includes information on the likely efficacy and impacts of adaptation strategies themselves which can also be considered to be cc adaptation specific given that participants in the current study highlighted the limitations to the data on adaptation efficacy including relating to reliance on expert views uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of cc adaptation strategies can also be considered an adaptation specific challenge within the cluster of challenges relating to information available for model development testing and use fig 3 d however uncertainty relating to models themselves is common to modelling in general while issues around the quality of data from climate models are important for both adaptation and cc impact modelling cammarano et al 2017 scenario development therefore brings together the cc adaptation specific elements of data availability and quality uncertainty and novel scenarios as information on adaptive responses to progressive change fig 3 d under progressive cc the period over which stakeholders seek to optimise systemic outputs is important as long term and short term goals may not align how this trade off is viewed is likely to alter with the considered time periods or the assumed pace and certainty of cc reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 this is a specific challenge for cc adaptation modelling with the goal of optimisation fig 3 c and represents the cc adaptation specific aspect of dynamic change modelling recent work has started to consider the application of approaches from other disciplines to agricultural settings in order to build understanding of how changes in the efficacy of cc adaptations over time and uncertainty in conditions and outcomes can be incorporated into assessments of adaptation strategies dittrich et al 2017 barriers to inter disciplinary research collaboration have been well documented siedlok and hibbert 2014 and the need for coordination across disciplines and institutes to tackle cc challenges has been recognised soussana et al 2012 key to challenges a and c fig 3 is collaboration with social scientists with expertise in managing stakeholder engagement nguyen et al 2014 reed et al 2014 and particularly those with expertise in normative and critical engagement approaches however inter disciplinary research communities require time resources appropriate structures and the application of specific skillsets to flourish kipling et al 2016c tomassini and luthi 2007 initiatives such as macsur and the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip rosenzweig et al 2013 have driven progress in agricultural model development and use ewert et al 2015 sándor et al 2017 and supported the application of inter disciplinary expertise to region specific cc issues dono et al 2016 özkan gülzari et al 2017 schönhart et al 2016 the need to characterise a wider range of sometimes transformative adaptations in agricultural models makes it essential to include smaller and geographically marginal research groups in inter disciplinary networks to capture the diversity of expertise in the research community these groups are vital to fully leveraging existing expertise along with core research groups that may find it easier to engage saetnan and kipling 2016 although differences in context may prevent data on management responses to cc conditions in one location being used as a reliable predictor of change in another reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 linking local research expertise across regions offers the opportunity to explore novel solutions cross pollinating ideas between scientific communities within and between disciplines the need for integrated modelling approaches to investigate cc impacts and adaptation has been widely recognised reidsma et al 2015a b rötter et al 2018 and the closer involvement of stakeholders in modelling processes is vital to the generation of model outputs with real world relevance bellocchi et al 2015 hamilton et al 2019 the distinct aspect of collaboration for cc adaptation fig 3 e is therefore the urgency of the need to work together resulting from the progressive nature of cc hallegatte 2009 focussing efforts on the specific challenges to agricultural modelling identified above fig 3 a d illustrative reviews of the five cc adaptation specific modelling challenges identified fig 3 are provided in appendix e giving richer descriptions of how they are tackled by specific modelling communities 4 conclusions this study sought to answer the question to what extent is cc adaptation a novel challenge for agricultural modellers the findings indicate that there are a number of cc adaptation specific aspects to the challenges of adaptation modelling identified by modellers within the three challenge categories of use content and capacity derived from the data the theme of creating novel adaptation scenarios was found to be entirely specific to cc adaptation modelling seven challenge themes such as resources for modelling and scale interactions represented essential pre requisites for cc adaptation modelling but were not considered specific to it ten other themes were considered general modelling challenges but with cc adaptation specific aspects most fundamentally the importance of understanding and managing the influence of model focus limitations use and presentation on adaptive responses and their consequences was highlighted for both bio economic modellers and biophysical modellers cc adaptation modelling draws agricultural modellers into social and political contexts in which their approaches and findings affect who wins and who loses what is valued and what sacrificed in the adaptation of agriculture to progressive cc in modelling cc adaptation in agriculture there is a need for the agricultural modelling community to focus on the aspects of model content and capacity relating to scope optimisation and information on collaboration across

in the data data accessibility this theme relates to data ownership and its effect on the ability to use data that have been collected for modelling work data has a value to those who hold it which may mean that it is not used to the full extent possible intellectual property and turf secrecy and privacy often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and or obtain cash and rights limited accessibility may also be a more straightforward issue of communication and knowledge with modellers who have many demands on their time looking for data capture from readily available sources to reduce time spent getting outputs to tackle this challenge the need for shared resources was highlighted inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information data availability limitations in available data were commented on with respect to most aspects of adaptation modelling table b 1 the examples in the table indicate the division by the part of the system management economic biophysical and by different data types relating to future and current systems table b 1 types of data availability challenge table b 1 data type management economic biophysical current systems data on risk perception of farmers are they likely to use the strategy why past experiences information on economic costs of disease and treatment limited knowledge on the interactions between grassland productivity and associated ecosystem services different systems few long term datasets on mediterranean grasslands lack of data for low input grassland systems different systems as predictors of extremes lack of data for forage crops response to fertilizer under varied extreme event conditions there are examples of systems in extreme climates we in nw europe have little sense about them or data that may exist on them different scales scarcity of data is an important problem we need to know what the business as usual state of a farm is usually very few data on management practices and productivity at territorial scale future predictions cost and availability of new technologies e g breeds soil management options also the change in management required e g new feed regime for new breeds focussed climate scenarios needed e g northern europe is likely to face wetter conditions and heat stress is not an issue limited knowledge on the interactions between grassland productivity and associated ecosystem services data quality some modellers raised the issue of data quality with respect to both standards and uncertainty heat stress modelling work requires wider data availability to capture differences in impacts between regions eu database some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability rather than real differences in conditions subjective expert knowledge on probability of events and shocks collaboration participants identified issues of a lack of interaction and understanding between modellers in different communities for example between disease modellers and other agricultural systems modellers as a particular issue disease modellers do not consider other modelling groups as potential users of their models outputs there is a gap between the modelling communities important challenge for modelling adaptation and a lack of interaction between empirical researchers and modellers was also raised as a challenge no insight or insufficient insight on data availability from other disciplines several participants highlighted the need for work across disciplines and this was associated with the need to provide models that met the requirements of users linking groups interdisciplinarity to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user collaboration is underpinned by the need to improve how information about models source codes etc is shared between researchers communication modelling can produce complex findings that are a challenge to communicate to end users with certain procedures not intuitively understandable for non modellers comprehensible sensitivity analysis participants recognised the importance of communication skills in relation to ensuring outputs are easy to take in for different groups policy makers want to receive a simplified summary of key outputs not to be given complex model details other stakeholders also require simplified outputs how can we make material digestible for stakeholders how to communicate suggested feed changes to farmers communication skills were emphasized as a challenge the process of transferring information might limit its accessibility for stakeholders care is needed in the communication process and also the importance of more integrated engagement to enable users and modellers to understand each other better organising dynamic learning and communication processes discrete events modelling one off or extreme events are shocks to a system that may be hard to predict risk and timing of extreme events and the effects of which may alter both future states of the system and the ability of decision makers to implement adaptation options the length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices and this is hard to model e g a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought but previous droughts or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available discrete events also include the challenge of modelling threshold changes in behaviour the appearance and implementation of a new disruptive technology or the point at which stakeholders move from adaptation of current systems to transformation to new systems in relation to causes timing and impacts of such changes disruptive technology one of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural for example a transition to food derived from bio reactors dynamic change modelling adaptations can be implemented in different ways which are likely to influence how they affect the system and this presents a challenge for modelling solutions can be applied in many different ways gradually in one step in a series of steps timeframe of choices so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity for modellers at the same time biophysical processes themselves may occur over different short and long term time scales which can be hard to capture short term eg annual versus long term eg decadal simulations e g soil carbon soil organic matter long term dynamics not well addressed engagement approach participants highlighted the challenge of engaging in meaningful ways with stakeholders how to build long term connections between interested farmers and scientists that go way beyond usual project durations a range of approaches and tools for improved engagement with stakeholders was shared for example typical farms as anchor for simulating and presenting my results thinking about a game in which effects and feedbacks can be explored in a kind of what happens when machine external limitations modelling this theme focuses on changes to policy or biophysical constraints beyond the system that affect the implementation of adaptation options and its consequences policy limitations to model adaptation strategies change feeding increases milk yield but milk quota consideration of temporary regional constraints e g regional silage market in case of drought interactions modelling this theme encompasses challenges relating to i a lack of underlying understanding of the interactions between factors and mechanisms in agricultural systems too many interacting factors and interacting mechanisms are still not well enough understood to be modelled e g heat stress on animal productivity includes many confounding effects and studies generally do not separate these effects sufficiently ii challenges relating to the computational power required in characterising complex interactions involving a number of inter dependent types of mechanism computability to integrate inter dependent sectors scales spatial ecosystem services scales temporal adaptations future scenario space uncertainty etc these issues relate to biophysical interactions grassland models are not able to simulate the diversity of species and inter specific interactions that characterise grasslands to economic and management interactions such as the cost availability of novel options and the changes in management required when they are implemented cost and availability of new technologies e g breeds soil management options also including the change in management required e g new feed regime for new breeds and to the effects of implementation on the biophysical system the application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change and finally to feedback arising from management changes incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models at all in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure management modelling this theme refers to the challenge of understanding and then modelling the decision to implement change what factors values knowledge age economics influence these stakeholder choices and how can these be incorporated into models adaptation is related to the perception of farmers and their sensitivity to change in a specific aspect of management e g they are likely to be more willing to change some practices than others the uptake of adaptation measures is therefore dependent on culture and knowledge as well as external risk differentiation was made between reactive and proactive change farmers have to face actual events not the risk of events after such events a range of actions will be required for a system to recover these represent reactive adaptation which is not the same as pre emptive adaptation to reduce future impacts with a question as to how biophysical models can incorporate adaptation when choices to adapt are made in advance of biophysical triggers to change how do biophysical models include the costs of anticipatory strategies novel scenarios under climate change models will be faced with the need to characterise new circumstances and their impacts under climate change relationships between variables may not remain the same e g under more extreme conditions than tested for and we need to try to understand these potential changes one challenge is to represent the impacts of climate change on the biophysical system differential effect of increasing co2 on mixed swards and their downstream impacts on production roughage quality analysis not future proof mixed sward quality under climate change on top of this is the need to then understand how the implementation of adaptation options will affect such changed systems model limitations for allocating land to feed types plus protein feeds e g forage versus cereal crops adaptation through changing feeding patterns this may include the introduction of new production options nitrogen cycle to create a zero sum long term n balance what happens in a semi arid soil what happens under agro forestry what happens in ley plus arable resources for modelling this theme covers three main areas 1 the way that models develop over time and how this affects their capabilities e g if some parts are based on older research and the capacity of their users to understand them some model limitations come from the development of models over time for example model name was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in what now seems a limited way management experts then moved on to other projects and model name became more biophysical especially when the agricultural modelling field may not have the space to nurture many careers agricultural systems modellers very narrow resource pool very different funding too few can form a career at the coal face many just pass through 2 issues relating to computability and the need to incorporate more and more complexity while handling the trade off with usability computability to integrate inter dependent sectors scales spatial ecosystem services scales temporal adaptations future scenario space uncertainty etc finally modelling resources may not be distributed equally across specific topics and this unevenness may not reflect the importance of individual topics in relation to adaptation with disease endemic diseases are more important than incursions but less attractive to funders e g liverfluke role of modellers focuses on the different ways in which modellers engage with real world problems this includes various roles for model outputs to demonstrate the importance of something to allowing comparisons of systems benchmarking to informing decision making and in the development of new ideas and also includes changes in the role of the modellers themselves not just their tools paradigm shift in the research praxis from observer to co researchers knowledge brokers scale interactions the theme consists of challenges to modelling how change at one scale affects that at another including the need to predict the farm scale impacts of wider changes not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible how to assess the impacts at farm scale and the importance of scaling up detailed farm level modelling to provide regional scale predictions upscaling issues e g modelling at farm scale and impacts at landscape scale participants highlighted how such effects cross the boundaries between economic and biophysical modelling need to start with farm level adaptations farmers may observe regional water issues and pay for own storage or find it better to reduce water dependence by using different crops etc scope this theme focuses on the extent to which models cover different regions and systems difficulties in modelling mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self reseeding species the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands mainly dominated by perennials elements of systems demonstrate how biodiversity impacts productivity e g by showing influence of pest predation on yield and impact of beneficial fauna on this acceptance and better understanding of feedback effects between production biodiversity and ecosystem services societal value and the extent to which they are able to span or take into account interactions between biophysical management and economic elements of change which are central to understanding adaptation biophysical models ignore economic life e g if all farms use more imported feed then feed prices will rise people will move out of farming and animal prices will fall these are important interactions requiring anticipatory actions by farmers to minimise costs user focus these challenges related to the need to ensure models and their outputs were mindful of the needs of stakeholders who may differ from modellers in relation to the timescale they are considering or type of questions they want answered policy makers are asking how do we do x while scientists are answering what happens if questions this can create communication problems the theme includes the challenge of providing tailored models cooling ventilation adaptation designs are very farm specific e g requirement for a very detailed design and approach to the extent of modelling on demand applied research by demand i e farmer associations demanding to play with their real data modellers need to consider who their users are and what they need and working with them can be part of achieving this define end users target groups and work with them throughout finally some participants referred to the need to ensure that outputs were interpreted correctly distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive normative information and results uncertainty modelling the need for models to be able to deal with uncertainty from biophysical and economic systems and from models themselves was commented upon by several participants e g integration of deviation coming from the biological world in the correctness of the model appendix c comparison of workshop findings with a review of crop modelling in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation rötter et al 2018 specific challenges were extracted from the text of the review article and coded contrasting and comparing these challenges with workshop data and themes to develop or add themes where required no new themes emerged from the data with all challenges being compatible with themes identified from workshop data without further development table c 1 the article identified some challenges specific to tropical systems table c 1 these challenges were also compatible with themes identified from analysis of workshop data table c 1 text relating to challenges to modelling agricultural impacts of and adaptations to climate change identified by rötter et al 2018 and its relation to themes identified in workshop data ts challenges identified by rötter et al 2018 as specific to tropical plant production systems table c 1 text extracts from rötter et al 2018 relating to modelling challenges themes economic models need to be combined with crop simulation models in whole farm assessments to better evaluate management practices collaboration interactions management and land use does not only respond to climate change but also to changing socio economic conditions such as liberalization of markets or changes in dietary habits crop simulation modelling thus needs to be integrated into a larger modelling framework collaboration interactions scale interactions statistical models are constrained in many cases by the availability of adequate representative yield data data availability data quality substantial mismatches between crop simulation models and statistical models may indicate knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms processes that cause under overestimation of yield et cetera data availability interactions despite some efforts the effect of tillage on carbon storage has so far only been modelled with limited success mainly due to insufficient field data to develop mechanistic descriptions in the models data availability interactions at larger scales crop simulation modelling is severely hampered by lack of data for parameterization and calibration and management systems are often unknown large uncertainties persist especially related to variability in managerial practices and spatial response patterns data availability likewise important tropical crops have been much less investigated in experiments regarding their exposure to agro climatic extremes than those for temperate systems even with some progress in data availability there is a need for both more experiments and modelling as propagated by tropags see fig 3 to understand the underlying mechanisms ts data availability a key constraint to realistically upscaling the productivity of such systems and how it is affected by climate change to region level is for instance that fields of smallholder systems are not clearly defined and a wide range of crop types can be found within a field ts data availability besides improving crop models fast track methods are needed to characterise and inventory smallholder fields as a basis for upscaling thereby the typical simplistic focus of modelling climate change impacts on sole crops usually maize in smallholder systems of africa can be overcome ts data availability we need much better understanding of how climate effects scale with changes in low input systems ts data availability still by far the majority of crop simulation models deal with single season single crop runs dynamic change there is also an increasing interest in the role that agricultural management has on environmental impact such as carbon sequestration or ghg emissions however carbon stocks need years to build up thus long term simulation over multiple years that also reflect the current deviation from the equilibrium state are necessary to capture that dynamic change while ensemble approaches helped to make model predictions more robust and quantify the uncertainties the next logical step was to improve responses to heat and the fundamental temperature functions in individual models to eventually reduce the uncertainty by proposing improved functions and parameterization interactions modelling and also lack information on critical interactions of factors such as weather soil and management practices interactions modelling so far crop models are not capable of capturing the multi species interactions within one field and the associated services delivered ts interactions modelling moreover many systems are integrated crop livestock systems which makes the common use of the model output variable yield produced per unit area difficult ts interactions modelling one advantage of this method use of statistical models is that it inherently covers also indirect yield limiting factors which are linked to climate variables like pest and diseases process based crop models so far largely ignore their effects and thus fail to estimate farmer yields accurately in regions and years where biotic stresses are significant scope while these multi model ensemble approaches can be the basis for systematically exploring critical parameters and assumptions they do not compensate for exploring missing mechanisms scope global model runs suggest strong effects of climate change on the crop production systems in the global south especially in africa however such runs were done mainly for water limited and or nutrient limited yield hence with yields not limited by biotic stresses that makes the results of little use to understand the actual effect of climate change on these systems as many tropical plant production systems are heavily restricted by combinations of severe abiotic and biotic stresses ts scope many tropical systems are arguably more complex including agroforestry intercropping unfortunately crop models have been rarely tested applied in such systems ts scope appendix d comparison of workshop findings with a review of challenges for climate change risk assessment ccra for adaptation policy adger et al 2018 and challenges identified by kipling et al 2016 grassland modelling özkan et al 2016 livestock health and disease modelling d1 themes from the adger et al 2018 review of challenges to ccra for adaptation policy the themes below summarise the text of the adger et al 2018 review gathering it into intuitive groupings that enabled easier comparison with the challenges identified in the current study the themes were extracted from the paper using a thematic coding approach ritchie et al 2014 themes were then compared with challenges identified by modellers in the workshops to highlight any cc adaptation specific issues that modellers also need to tackle gaps in coverage of identified adaptation modelling challenges how the ccra for adaptation policy themes and those identified by modellers overlapped and complemented each other is described in section d2 and table d1 below and explained and visualised in main text fig 2 in fig 2 some of the themes below are grouped according to their type indicated in brackets next to their title e g incorporating biophysical knowledge into ccra relates to the availability and quality of data biophysical knowledge data availability biophysical systems will respond to climate change in complex ways that interact across systems and over different time scales including feedback effects on climate change itself these interactions are not fully understood including for example potential for critical transitions recent studies provide improved assessments of the extent to which specific events can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and predictions about the magnitude and frequency of extreme events cognitive bias human choices are often made using mental short cuts which allow decisions to be made despite limits to available information of the ability to gather and process it these cognitive factors can bias the choices according to pre existing preferences and can lead to inconsistency across scales and contexts of decision making they may be the result of cultural or inherited traits communication the challenge of communicating uncertainties assumptions and limitations given that the choice of adaptive response is often controversial and liable to scrutiny is important to address this includes the need to avoid over technical approaches that might not fit well with some examples of risk to explain constraints in order to avoid the development of unrealistic expectations around outcomes to ensure the relevance of outcomes to decision makers e g focussing on urgency relating risks to current policy outcomes the presentation of ccras can affect their effectiveness in stimulating change examples from text were the assessment of risks associated with current policy and how current objectives might be threatened by climate change and the use of risk registers that use the dimensions of likelihood and impact to bring together rank highlight and communicate a range of risks transparency and close engagement with users of ccra outputs are highlighted data on adaptation availability and quality the need to better incorporate into ccra information on the viability of adaptation options and on the way their effectiveness varies with different scenarios of future change sensitivity in the context of uncertainty lack of data is an important limitation to ccra for example relating to monitoring or evaluation of adaptation options to biophysical systems their responses and the impacts of human actions on them and on adaptive capacity there is a need for improved data quality to move on from piecemeal and or qualitative subjective assessments e g expert judgements or stakeholder exercises to systemized data collection appraisal and presentation monitoring and evaluation data are in many cases limited in terms of survey size and sample type e g only early adopters consistency is needed in framing risks and uncertainties and the criteria on which adaptations are evaluated needs to be considered see also under ethics approaches have been developed and used to apply global data to more localised ccra to overcome some challenges relating to a lack of data developing new ccra methods risk registers can be useful but may become over technical leading to frames being fitted to risks that they are not suited to in italy the climate risk index improved model ensemble data and applied a more robust analysis to rank administrative areas in relation to different climate change impacts in order to support the allocation of funds for adaptation in ccra methodological advances such as the business function framework for business and industry risks are mentioned diversity and number of factors diversity is present in i the context of adaptation including the perspectives of those involved what they value or feel concerned about different types of change and impact different timescales of change ii the diversity of evidence types on which ccras must be based iii the different underlying assumptions uses of scenarios and scope of ccras iv the diversity of risks and adaptive options which means that fitting risks into strict technical parameters for ccra may not be appropriate large numbers of options are also likely to be available for adaptive change ethics why intervention should take place and in what form how ccras are presented including scope uncertainty limitations framing recognition of risk as subjective and perceived differently by different groups is mentioned and aspects such as how adaptations are evaluated e g effectiveness and fairness are relevant expectations decision makers are expecting more from ccras including for example information on the adaptive impacts of current policies and assessments of how to make adaptations more effective some examples of ccras used in practical policy processes include the climate risk index for italy which used detailed ensemble modelling and analysis to rank administrative areas according to the risks they faced in relation to specific climate change impacts outcomes informed the distribution of financial resources for adaptation those using ccras need to recognise that complete avoidance of risk is not likely to be practical engaging throughout the process of ccra can help build understanding and reduce differences in expectation between those producing and using the ccra experience of decision makers a challenge for climate change adaptation ccra is that decision makers often have limited experience of dealing with problems with large numbers of alternative options and high uncertainty while past experience of change often used to quantify risk in ccras is not adequate under climate change conditions interdependence challenge to understanding i how risks cascade through interdependent systems biophysical and human and ii how adaptive actions on the ground policy and risk levels interact in relation to i work is needed to better understand linkages and critical transitions within systems including biophysical human system interactions such interactions and the incorporation of multiple time scales are beyond conventional ra methods but need to be understood to address systemic risks using expert stakeholder knowledge can provide a route to understanding how risks are transmitted across sectors and scales risk transmission framing is mentioned as a specific methodological advance in relation to assessing cascading risks interdisciplinary and trans disciplinary approaches collaboration challenge of dealing with the wide and interacting impacts of climate change and adaptive responses including the key integration of biophysical and socio economic aspects of exposure and vulnerability and the linking of disaster risk management and cc adaptation expertise challenges for research and decision makers at policy level can be addressed by considering the experiences of ccra in specific sectors and approaches used to address other complex issues can also be learned from ccra approaches for infrastructure and business risks are mentioned as methodological advances relating to specific sectors stakeholders can provide expert knowledge to complement scientific understanding links across disciplines need to be integrated with links to the needs of adaptation policymakers at a strategic level interests individuals and groups vary in how they respond to risk and the types of risk and types of things affected are likely to be qualitatively different so that attempts at objective comparisons can lead to choices that are suboptimal in terms of people s needs e g irreversible changes value related to attachment to places and systems with cultural significance the interests of some groups may trade off with those of others and may be sub optimal when considered more broadly e g policy drive to incentivise food production over environmental protection priorities may also link to deeper underlying values that may not be explicit these issues create a challenge at points where objective ccras and subjective perspectives interact taken together the issue of interests raises the important issue of who should be involved in determining the scope and nature of ccra and the extent and type of response given that those making choices may not wish to take precautions scenarios the interactions of climate change with global change in systems resulting from a variety of stressors is a big challenge for scenarios that will need to incorporate how different drivers of change co evolve for example by pooling data to discover confounding factors scenarios can be used to represent diverse pathways exceeding those accessible through conventional prediction facilitating understanding of the consequences of change presenting a range of scenarios including extremes is also a strategy to deal with uncertainty in predictions see uncertainty scope the scope of an ccra can affect how it is used and how risks are perceived as well as affecting the accuracy with which incorporated risks are assessed more recent ccras have incorporated socio economic drivers of vulnerability and ccras are being widened to incorporate climate change opportunities to improve balance in decision making there has been recognition of issues relating to impacts and adaptive responses that cross political borders relates also to interdependence and how these can affect risk and adaptive responses inclusion of the impact of current adaptation actions on future risk from policy aspirations to action and adaptive capacity is important including how different policy drivers might interact with adaptation needs to positively or negatively effect risk finally a need to characterise risks and issues related to different coping potentials was identified scope interacts with expectations of what ccras should provide for policy makers as well as what they incorporate into their conclusions with an emphasis on the need to engage with policy and implementation in addition to publishing reports the review also highlights a modelling challenge also raised by modellers that the variety and diversity of adaptations is a challenge for integrated assessment models that do not incorporate all the required parameters or interactions socio economic drivers data availability incorporation of social and economic factors and their interaction with climate change and the nature of adaptive responses into ccra drawing on agent based modelling or qualitative understanding of human behaviour time lags in adaptation implementation of change might not be instant and may take some time for practical reasons or due to the existence of other barriers institutions social reasons these issues need to be incorporated in assessments of the extent to which an adaptation can offset climate related impacts uncertainty uncertainty can limit action if adaptation is undertaken only in the light of predictions however predictability is suggested by some authors to be more important when there are few alternative options for action and relative certainty in outcomes this is not the case with climate change uncertainty may relate to consequences or likelihood of climate change impacts or in relation to the effects of adaptive actions in relation to climate change much uncertainty is probably irreducible therefore wait and see is not a positive strategy some authors have suggested that uncertainty can be used as knowledge in itself affecting how the viability of different options for change is viewed questions are raised about whether reducing uncertainty increases the effectiveness of decision making although the importance of providing boundaries to potential outcomes are emphasized by some having a range of scenarios including extremes may assist decision making under uncertainty and being explicit about the goals of adaptation is also important involving stakeholders in participatory approaches to change based on precautionary principles can be a more effective path for decision making with unavoidable uncertainty than using metrices and making decision trees other approaches include incorporating the temporal aspects of change e g dynamic adaptation pathways with trigger points robust decision making approaches and risk layering according to risk and return periods and stress testing to assess critical levels for ecosystem functioning in natural systems d2 comparison

main paper fig 2 e is covered in the main text 1 climate change adaptation modelling and stakeholders responsibilities of modelling under progressive change recent integrated modelling initiatives have demonstrated the use of agricultural modelling within a process in which model outcomes provide the basis for exploring the broader impacts of change beyond those normally incorporated in agricultural modelling in sardinia models revealed likely reductions in summer sheep s milk production under cc considering this researchers and stakeholders explored potential consequences for the supply chain and other economic sectors dono et al 2016 lower milk production would reduce availability of cheese for tourists while reduction in milk quality could cause problems for transformation into products with a quality label one issue exemplified by this study is that of limitations and uncertainty in modelling available statistical heat stress models were not able to incorporate adaptive responses demonstrating the importance of clearly communicating the meaning and limitations of results to avoid misuse such limitations include uncertainty about cc impacts and adaptive responses the use of impact pirttioja et al 2015 and adaptation response surfaces ruiz ramos et al 2018 together with robustness indexes of adaptation recommendations rodríguez et al 2018 have been used in biophysical models to address this challenge uncertainty makes developing sound protocols for adaptation modelling vital in preventing model misuse and reducing the potential for incorrect or misinterpreted outputs to drive mal adaptive change ramirez villegas et al 2015 a second issue raised within the sardinian study was that dairy cow systems with access to irrigation were predicted to be less affected by cc than more traditional sheep systems choices made by policymakers presented with such evidence would depend on how the modelling message was framed and what was valued in that framing e g economic benefit ecological footprint tradition and culture tourism or agriculture the interests of a particular sector modelled impacts might therefore drive adaptive responses in very different directions changing who is affected by climate change and how reckien et al 2017 in undertaking and presenting findings modellers may unwittingly be used to support the case of specific stakeholder groups lang et al 2012 in highlighting how models can shape stakeholder views and agendas the data from this study illustrate how modellers might alter what stakeholders consider in their choices this issue might be addressed by considering how to make researchers more accountable for their influence on decision making or by ensuring that by representing the agendas of the affected as well as the affecting and by expressing the limitations to their work modellers can enable stakeholders and policymakers to retain responsibility for their actions the progressive nature of cc and as a result cc adaptation and how it shapes the systems on which humanity relies brings to the fore the tension between research following pragmatic consensus seeking approaches to engagement and critical approaches that see exploring and making different societal groups aware of conflicts and power relations as prerequisites for just solutions johansson and lindhult 2008 while social learning approaches facilitating co learning between researchers and stakeholders may underpin more effective sustainable bottom up change in agriculture nguyen et al 2014 questions still remain about how the needs and values of those outside the process are recognised the ability of modelling to help stakeholders understand how their actions can affect other systems and actors martin et al 2011 vieira pak and castillo brieva 2010 suggests a role in helping stakeholders and policymakers at all levels to conceptualise the types of cc futures their adaptive choices are likely to create how well modellers can fulfil the role of facilitating learning and exploration by stakeholders is linked to the extent to which they are willing and can work together across disciplines to recognise and present a range of strategies and consequences information on adaptive responses to progressive change for models such as regional integrated land use models ilms or biophysical models well specified adaptation strategies may be included as inputs these are frequently defined by experts external information can be added about the adaptation e g for ilms the regional availability of relevant technology and the required infrastructure and conditions such as water availability and institutional settings although technical coefficient generators can be used to identify a large range of alternative adaptations e g janssen et al 2010 information may also be needed on adoption e g in positive mathematical programming models posing a particular challenge for adaptation measures which are not yet available at regional level socio economic scenarios are being created to consistently define framework conditions for adaptation improving transparency and comparability in the assumptions underlying model predictions these include the regional agricultural pathways raps developed within agmip valdivia et al 2013 raps are characterised with input from stakeholders and experts to ensure their coherence and relevance however scenarios may still face issues including limitations in the scenario building approach the choice of stakeholders and experts from whom to gather data and the potential for uncritical inclusion of implicit sociological assumptions jansen 2009 at farm scale eliciting farmers objectives is not straightforward what they say and what they do may not be the same mandryk et al 2014 rather than using expert judgement to validate the performance of decision making sub models models such as melodie chardon et al 2012 have used on farm observations of real behaviour chardon et al 2008 garcia et al 2005 removing doubt about the accuracy of reported actions however validation based on observed behaviour may not reflect future choices under progressive cc in addition lack of knowledge about the future availability and quality of alternative inputs e g concentrate feeds may limit the ability of modelling at farm scale to apply relevant scenarios studies using the bio economic farm scale model fssim kanellopoulos et al 2014 wolf et al 2015 came to different conclusions due to differences in the projected possibility of renting land which influenced crop rotations constraining choices a range of approaches exist for increasing the accuracy of predicted behaviour in farm scale bio economic modelling reidsma et al 2018 some maintain assumptions of rational profit maximising behaviour but include impacts of uncertainty and changing experience in decision making processes such as the use of discrete stochastic programming dono et al 2016 or make alternative assumptions about farmers risk behaviour finger and calanca 2011 forming links between agricultural modellers and agent based modellers berger and troost 2014 including those focussing specifically on modelling human adaptive behaviour under global environmental change acosta michlik and espaldon 2008 acosta michlik et al 2014 offers the potential to explore ways to use their modelling to provide improved adaptation scenarios or to more realistically represent adaptive behaviour endogenously given the unavoidability of uncertainty about future choices one approach is to produce a range of outcomes based on different scenarios and adaptation choices which stakeholders can subsequently discuss rather than ranking outcomes to suggest a recommended best action dittrich et al 2017 mandryk et al 2014 model findings may also be presented in the context of a critical assessment of wider implications of implementation including adaptation effects on social or environmental objectives such farm income cc mitigation or water quality e g reidsma et al 2015a b schönhart et al 2018 they become one among a range of inputs to a broader process of social learning in which stakeholders together with researchers from different disciplines develop a shared understanding of problems and solutions nguyen et al 2014 this feeds into the idea of cycling between biophysical and socio economic aspects in participatory processes of research and the creation of adaptive loops to maintain flexibility in the face of changing conditions howden et al 2007 a recent review of scenario planning star et al 2016 provided a matrix of approaches that can be aligned with different roles for modelling which may support stakeholders in determining adaptation strategies that help them meet the normative objectives they desire provide a range of exploratory outcomes for them to consider present them with a recommended normative outcome or finally provide a range of strategies that they would like models to explore engagement with experts in scenario planning can therefore address issues relating to gathering information on future conditions with different approaches supporting modellers in tackling the challenge of responsibilities of modelling in the context of progressive change fig 1 a 2 bio economic modelling scope of adaptations modelled to characterise how adaptation affects biophysical processes farm scale bio economic models rely on either inputs from biophysical models from one off data input to integrated frameworks or the creation of simpler endogenous representations of biophysical systems the scope of adaptation strategies they characterise is therefore constrained by the scope of these linked models including in relation to the objectives of adaptation strategies with most crop models focussing on yield rather than other types of outcome mandryk et al 2014 2017 linking to crop models using modular approaches is a common solution to increase scope e g the link between epic and famos space schönhart et al 2016 or wofost and the agro climate calendar and farmdesign mandryk et al 2017 where crop management choices are modelled at field level fewer models link to biophysical animal models with livestock production often represented via feed budgeting and or herd dynamics modules e g famos space scotfarm modam with annual or monthly time steps farm scale bio economic models might also include integrated cropping or soil processes exemplified by the incorporation of soil carbon stocks in farmdesign groot et al 2012 adaptation modelling is then possible to the extent that cc and adaptation impacts can be translated to the relevant co efficients in these modules e g change in milk yield or liveweight gain solutions for fully integrated livestock and crop production sub modules also exist for example the dairynz model takes weather data directly with pasture and cow metabolism modules operating with a daily time step and an annual time step economic module kalaugher et al 2017 at regional level ilms have a wide spatial scope from landscape briner et al 2012 reidsma et al 2015a b and sub regional schönhart et al 2014 to continental levels holman et al 2017 and integrate field animal and farm scale biophysical and economic models or components of them to represent bio physical and human systems and their interactions regional ilms based on a normative concept of adaptive decision making such as some linear programming models assuming profit maximization annetts and audsley 2002 kirchner et al 2016 have the scope to model novel land use outcomes e g new crop species or the adoption of new technology although this requires prior specification of the measure by the user this is particularly challenging in regional ilm due to their large spatial and farming system coverage regional ilm based on positive concepts of adaptation decision making such as positive mathematical programming pmp models schönhart et al 2014 or econometric models fezzi and bateman 2015 moore and lobell 2014 may face challenges in representing adaptation beyond previously observed ranges an option to overcome this limitation is the incorporation of observed management practices from other regions where climatic conditions are similar to those expected in the focus region under cc in terms of representing future technologies dietrich et al 2014 endogenously modelled investment dependent technological change in the global ilm magpie for ilms further research is required to understand adaptation outcomes when relationships between farms supply chains and marketing of agricultural products are taken into account optimisation under progressive change and with thresholds dynamic bio economic farm scale models such as scotfarm can represent inter temporal dependencies e g agronomic effects of adaptation via changing rotations or herd management or the financial aspects of longer term investment and policy and or market changes agronomic thresholds can be incorporated into farm scale bio economic models either via the functions of specific modules e g linked crop models or external data input however incremental adaptation can only be assessed if relevant processes are integrated or if data are provided from external models janssen et al 2010 schaap et al 2013 economic thresholds e g farms going out of production due to losses can be represented although financial modules often work at the gross or net margin level not considering reserves and credit availability to the extent that alternative practices can be characterised step changes in management and in contextual scenarios can be compared including the impacts of long term financial investment which can be annualised over the investment s lifetime to make them comparable while some adaptation requires binary decisions e g whether to establish cover crops on a plot other decisions can be continuous e g the choice of fertilisation levels or irrigation rates ilms frequently link single models sequentially and are static with respect to land use decisions rarely representing feedbacks of adaptation choices on cc altered biophysical systems consequently they are limited in relation to evaluating how the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies evolve over time modelling of dynamic adaptation processes such as applied in bio economic farm models is complicated by the larger spatial and farming system coverage of ilms even for market feedbacks many applications use exogenous price assumptions on agricultural inputs and outputs independent from adaptation choices in regional ilms adaptation thresholds are mainly determined by economic cost benefit considerations a considerable simplification from real world decision making one off investment decisions can be modelled by comparing average costs and benefits e g represented in annuities but this requires assumptions about the dynamic effects of adaptation strategies such as transition periods options to overcome challenges relating to optimisation under progressive change include risk sensitive dynamic modelling of annual land use decisions lehtonen 2012 abstracting from the farm level in regional ilm eases the representation of transformative shifts between farming systems such as land cover conversion changes in livestock or between organic and conventional farming systems however static models are prone to overestimating the likelihood of dynamic transformation processes e g forest succession including risk behaviour as in many bio economic farm models liu et al 2016 can make such the representation of adaptation choices more realistic 3 biophysical modelling scope of adaptations modelled the focus of many recent crop model inter comparisons has been on wheat e g asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 maize and rice ehrhardt et al 2018 and rötter et al 2018 have highlighted the need to widen the focus of modelling to cover more systems including tropical crop production the effects of cc on pest and disease ecology and spread and the consequences for different plant species and communities also need to be better incorporated into models as a pre requisite to simulating the impacts of adaptation strategies focussed on plant health newbery et al 2016 challenges of model scope and adaptation impact are being tackled in relation to several specific adaptations including modelling crop rotations kollas et al 2015 and cc effects on harvest quality nuttall et al 2017 wheeler and reynolds 2013 the characterisation of intercropping systems and crop mixtures is also challenging with most models currently representing such systems as a single crop with characteristics based on those of the combined crop an advance is the characterisation of two species independently accounting for soil nutrient and light sharing between them e g stics corre hellou et al 2009 multi species grasslands are also likely to be more resilient to cc tilman and downing 1994 tilman et al 2006 taken together the need for multi species modelling for arable and grassland systems creates potential for collaboration with ecological modellers more used to dealing with multi species swards kipling et al 2016 van oijen et al 2018 recent work in this area includes the development of dynamic modelling of both species composition and changes in biomass in productive grasslands moulin et al 2018 grassland models have flexibility through their mechanistic incorporation of a range of biophysical processes such as plant grazing animal interactions graux et al 2011 the inclusion of these and other detailed sward processes along with outputs relating to production nutrient flows and ghg emissions sanz cobena et al 2017 demonstrate the scope of such models to characterise adaptive changes via the alteration of input variables by the user as in the case of bio economic models section 3 4 2 the scope of farm scale biophysical models to characterise novel adaptations is determined by the capabilities of the crop and grass models to which they are linked thus in melodie chardon et al 2012 a dynamic model designed to simulate nutrient flows across a mixed farming system operational short term within a season adaptations associated with crop and grassland management and short term changes in feed rations are incorporated via the stics crop model tactical annual adaptations linked with the planning of crop rotations feed rations and fertilisation strategy are also simulated using specific sub models chardon 2008 chardon et al 2008 however farm scale models must also consider adaptations associated with farm infrastructure and resources e g housing imported feed and interactions between these systemic components that might produce emergent effects chardon et al 2012 within melodie manpower machinery and some aspects of animal housing e g control of ventilation alleviation of heat stress or addition of water to slurry tank are not included excluding consideration of related adaptation strategies assessing the value of some tactical adaptations like the use of cover crops changing crop species varieties or the implementation of different tillage practices is possible but only by comparing several with vs without adaptation scenarios and not by simulating such changes in response to external factors similarly some adaptations can be simulated by altering input variables e g change in the calving pattern use of alternative forages changes of breeds or changes in manure processing inclusion of farm scale biophysical models in modelling platforms e g melodie within the inra modelling platform bergez et al 2013 allow them to benefit from improvements in sub models modular structures for farm scale models offer an important technical solution to the challenge of characterising a wider scope of novel cc adaptations in both biophysical and bio economic modelling janssen et al 2010 optimisation under progressive change and with thresholds many crop models are only designed for single season runs rötter et al 2018 making it hard to consider the relative outcomes of adaptation strategies over different time scales a major challenge is the development of approaches to incorporate carry over effects of management change for example progressive shifts in sowing dates and how performance in crop rotations alters according to the effects of previous crops in the rotation pappa et al 2012 without characterising these effects adaptation under progressive cc cannot be fully assessed similarly in grassland modelling capturing dynamic change in swards under progressive cc kipling et al 2016 is a prerequisite to fully assessing the cost benefits of adaptation strategies over different time frames 
26148,modelling is key to adapting agriculture to climate change cc facilitating evaluation of the impacts and efficacy of adaptation measures and the design of optimal strategies although there are many challenges to modelling agricultural cc adaptation it is unclear whether these are novel or whether adaptation merely adds new motivations to old challenges here qualitative analysis of modellers

to environmental change such as altering sowing dates while a policy decision to fund irrigation systems might be a non autonomous adaptation investigated by altering model inputs in addition modelling strategies investigated as potential cc adaptations might include responses to non climatic systemic pressures with adaptive or maladaptive consequences grüneis et al 2016 mitter et al 2018 in the context of this study cc adaptation is defined as including non autonomous adaptations any strategy explored by modellers as a potential cc adaptation and autonomous human adaptations autonomous biophysical responses of the system and actions not recognised as cc adaptations within a specific modelling exercise are considered to be part of the context within which cc adaptation occurs the literature on agricultural modelling of cc impacts and adaptive responses is vast and growing challinor et al 2014 özkan et al 2016 rötter et al 2018 ruiz ramos et al 2018 wheeler and reynolds 2013 zhang et al 2017 with diversity in scope and focus this complexity makes it hard to unpick the nature of the modelling challenges the question arises as to whether efforts to model cc impacts and to improve agricultural modelling in general are sufficient to support adaptive actions by stakeholders and policymakers or whether there are agricultural modelling challenges specific to cc adaptation and thus requiring focussed attention from researchers and modellers the aim of the current study was to search for and if found define challenges specific to cc adaptation modelling in agriculture research was based on the gathering and analysis of agricultural modellers views of challenges to modelling agricultural cc adaptation 2 materials and methods the study proceeded in three stages i modelling challenges were identified by modellers within workshops and analysed to identify challenge themes and categories ii findings were triangulated by comparing the identified themes with modelling challenges described in existing reviews this process was used to validate the workshop data and to identify themes likely to include elements specific to modelling cc adaptation iii the subset of challenges considered to have cc adaptation specific aspects was considered in the light of a review of the wider literature on cc adaptation to highlight those novel elements 2 1 identifying challenge themes and categories two workshops were held to understand and explore modellers views on the challenges to modelling cc adaptation bringing together researchers from across the modelling european agriculture with climate change for food security macsur knowledge hub http macsur eu the workshops engaged 22 modellers from 21 institutes across 11 european countries with participants representing a purposive sample of agricultural modellers with a specific interest in modelling cc adaptation yin 1989 within this sample 16 agricultural modelling groups were represented appendix a from across crop grassland livestock farm scale and economic modelling disciplines workshops gathered participants views through two structured discussions in which attendees were asked to map adaptation strategies for agriculture and related modelling challenges participants were asked what the challenges to modelling climate change adaptation were they recorded their ideas on sticky notes one challenge per note to reduce bias towards the views of vocal participants which can arise in group discussions kitzinger 1995 notes were collected and reviewed by the group to remove duplicates clarify unclear contributions and give participants a chance to add further ideas after considering the question during the session and in the light of other responses data responses recorded by participants on sticky notes were analysed following a grounded theory approach using thematic coding ritchie et al 2014 grounded theory seeks to draw information from data rather than fitting them to a pre conceived categorisation themes in the data are identified by thematic coding for example identifying that several contributions relate to data quality themes are then compared and contrasted to identify underlying characteristics linking them into broader categories relevant to the research question in this way categories are grounded in derived from the original data ensuring relevance and openness to emerging issues charmaz 2014 qualitative approaches have been widely used to investigate the views perspectives and characteristics of agricultural stakeholders mitter et al 2018 morris et al 2017 but to a lesser extent to explore agricultural research processes themselves exceptions include reed et al 2014 who used a grounded theory approach to identify key principles of knowledge exchange in environmental management and kipling and özkan et al 2016 who analysed questionnaire data to reveal discourses underlying the perspectives of agricultural modellers on the challenges to communication with stakeholders these examples demonstrate the practical value of grounded theory in revealing underlying patterns in complex topics after the identification of themes through coding of the workshop data these themes were compared and contrasted to reveal underlying categories with relevance to the research topic ritchie et al 2014 to ensure that the identified categories were robust and properly grounded in the data results were checked by co authors not involved in the analysis following bitsch 2005 in addition intermediate findings were presented and discussed at an internal macsur project meeting an important aspect of grounded theory methodology is to ensure data saturation morris et al 2017 where no new themes or issues arise from the data to check this specific modelling challenges were identified in the text of a global review focussed on crop modelling of the impacts of and adaptation to cc rötter et al 2018 these challenges were coded to ascertain whether any new themes were present or whether workshop themes were sufficient to accommodate the challenges described indicating saturation the article also defined challenges specific to modelling tropical plant production systems providing a test of whether themes arising from the contributions of european modellers involved in the present study have relevance beyond the region 2 2 triangulation with previous reviews and the identification of cc adaptation specific challenges a recent review of challenges for climate change risk assessment ccra for adaptation policy adger et al 2018 offered a comparison between the data from the current study and challenges identified within a discipline focussed specifically on cc adaptation but which encompasses change in all sectors not only agriculture and which may but does not necessarily draw on modelling this comparison could therefore reveal or expand on challenges related to cc adaptation itself that modellers may not have considered themes were identified in the review using thematic coding following the method applied to the data from the workshops 2 1 the themes defined in this process were then compared with the themes derived from the current study to identify similarities and differences a second set of comparisons were made between workshop data and two recent reviews of modelling challenges in the context of cc for grassland modelling and for animal health and disease modelling kipling et al 2016b özkan et al 2016 these two articles were chosen as they applied a similar approach to that used here in order to derive the challenges they presented allowing a straight comparison with the themes identified in the current study the disciplines of grassland and health and disease modelling lie within the broader agricultural modelling community focussed on in this study but the reviews reflected on cc in general only briefly treating cc adaptation they could therefore be used to reveal which of the challenges from the current study were also wider challenges for modellers and therefore not specific to cc adaptation modelling in the context of a wider review of literature on cc adaptation triangulation of these different comparisons was used to draw out specific cc adaptation challenges for agricultural modelling 3 results and discussion 3 1 challenges to modelling adaptation grounded theory analysis of challenges to modelling adaptation expressed by modellers identified 18 themes see appendix a for full description of each and three underlying categories content use and capacity fig 1 3 1 1 content of models many comments made by participants related to the fundamental question of how and how well models characterise systems for some the effects of external processes on systems was important not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible how to assess the impacts at farm scale including top down political influences changes in policies can make previous changes in farm strategic planning investments useless other comments highlighted challenges of modelling different types of change over time solutions can be applied in many different ways gradually in one step in a series of steps timeframe of choices so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity and in particular sudden change in biophysical systems the length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices and this is hard to model e g a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought but previous droughts or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available and changes in the adaptive choices available disruptive technology one of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural issues were also raised relating to when choices are made when it becomes preferable to change the system production rather than to adapt underlying these challenges were those relating to modelling interactions within systems in general e g the application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change with adaptation adding further complexity incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure participants reflected on unevenness in the coverage of different systems by modelling which may be limited in regions currently facing the most negative cc impacts difficulties in modelling mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self reseeding species the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands or in relation to previously marginal production approaches that might be important adaptation strategies nitrogen cycle to create a zero sum long term n balance what happens in a semi arid soil what happens under agro forestry what happens in ley plus arable the category is bound together by a sense from the data of a research community that is itself being asked to adapt this mirrors the progressive nature of cc how this is changing modelling priorities and how it disrupts a research community of previously discrete specialised modelling groups forcing them to broaden their focus and the application of their models see also section 3 1 3 3 1 2 use of models many participants raised issues that related to how modelling could and should be interpreted and applied some considered the need to highlight different outcomes adaptation to protect ecosystem services social context motive of farmers values policy context market failure etc demonstration of importance of these services while others viewed modelling as part of a wider process demonstrate use of modelling in participatory projects with the capacity to alter the focus of stakeholders and also of research modelling imagined situations to produce simulations can draw attention to a problem and stimulate the data production required to improve such estimates while these comments view the role of models as stimulating understanding and interest others focussed on how to fit findings to users needs policy makers are asking how do we do x while scientists are answering what happens if questions this can create communication problems and understanding of the requirements of key players policy farmers some specific interests believed to be important for stakeholders were highlighted along with the challenge of tailoring outputs to specific conditions cooling ventilation adaptation designs are very farm specific e g requirement for a very detailed design and approach other comments considered how stakeholder engagement and model relevance were related actors e g farmers have to be involved in the research pathway from the beginning in order to co design research questions and co develop win win adaptation strategies a final element was the challenge of communicating findings which may be related to the complexity of the results distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive normative information and results or the skills of modellers talking is important modellers can put too little effort into communication skills some participants suggested ways to overcome communication barriers when sharing results e g incorporation into media products like animated films the use of models category therefore has both pragmatic what do stakeholders want how to communicate and normative what should be modelled and explored elements 3 1 3 capacity of models in contrast to comments about what models characterise and how content a distinct set of contributions were related to information and support for modelling many participants highlighted historical and resource related reasons for model limitations some model limitations come from the development of models over time e g model name was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in what now seems a limited way management experts then moved on to other projects and model name became more biophysical model evolution was seen to create problems in the capacity of successive generations of researchers to use models effectively most models contain vast amounts of implicit knowledge continuity of human capital is too short this rapidly degrades the future utility of models despite huge latent potential some participants referred to how model capacity can be shaped by the interests of funders which may not align with priorities identified by researchers with disease endemic diseases are more important than incursions but less attractive to funders e g liver fluke collaboration was seen as a way to tackle issues of capacity by drawing on wider expertise linking groups interdisciplinarily to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user a distinct capacity related element in responses referred to the data on which models rely a particular focus was issues relating to data on the impacts of future cc conditions on modelled systems lack of data for forage crops response to fertilizer under varied extreme event conditions future climatic conditions focussed climate scenarios needed e g northern europe is likely to face wetter conditions and heat stress is not an issue and the likely adaptive behaviour of stakeholders data on risk perception of farmers are they likely to use the strategy why past experiences there was awareness that data issues often related to a lack of interaction between researchers in different regions and disciplines there are examples of systems in extreme climates we in north western europe have little sense about them or data that may exist on them and to variation in available data quality heat stress modelling work requires wider data availability to capture differences in impacts between regions eu database some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability rather than real differences in conditions the need for data about projected futures was raised and particularly limitations in approaches to gaining such information subjective expert knowledge on probability of events and shocks comments on data sometimes focussed on the need for better data sharing systems inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information and barriers to this often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and or obtain cash and rights again the underlying thread in this category was how tackling cc adaptation created a need to overcome the constraints of fragmented research structures 3 1 4 evaluation of analysis comparing the challenges identified here with those defined for crop modelling by rötter et al 2018 appendix c no new challenge themes were discovered indicating data saturation in relation to the themes and categories derived from our workshop data challenges from rötter et al 2018 aligned with a subset of six of the 18 themes identified from workshops the article also discussed the use of model ensembles to tackle issues related to uncertainty with this topic treated as an aspect of progress rather than a future challenge if included as a challenge to modelling this topic would be accommodated within the uncertainty modelling theme identified in the workshop appendix c as the article included specific challenges for modelling tropical plant production the fact that no new themes were revealed also provides an indication that the themes presented here are also relevant to adaptation modelling in non european contexts although specific challenges within themes are likely to vary further investigations of challenges to modelling other non european farming systems would be important to confirm this wider applicability of the categorisation presented 3 2 triangulation with previous reviews consolidating challenges to modelling cc adaptation into three categories model content use and capacity provided a useful conceptual overview however many issues raised related to broader modelling challenges in particular modelling cc impacts on agriculture is a complex challenge in itself that has been recently reviewed by a number of authors kipling et al 2016a 2016b özkan et al 2016 rötter et al 2018 comparisons with previous work therefore sought to further elaborate and differentiate cc adaptation specific issues from wider modelling challenges 3 2 1 ccra review comparison comparison of the challenge themes derived from workshop data with the ccra review adger et al 2018 identified workshop challenges also recognised as issues for the adaptation but not agriculture specific field of ccra for adaptation policy the aim was to highlight challenges with potentially adaptation specific aspects for further consideration for full details of themes from the ccra review and of the comparison see appendix d in relation to the category of capacity in the current study several themes were found in both modelling and ccra studies specifically collaboration data availability data quality novel scenarios and uncertainty fig 2 challenges identified by modellers relating to resource availability resources for modelling and data accessibility i e due to communication and ownership of data rather than due to whether they exist were not raised in relation to ccra for adaptation policy this difference may reflect the very specific data requirements of models and the fact that agricultural modelling must come together across specific disciplines to incorporate cc adaptation while ccra is already a united community explicitly focused on this aim and working in direct support of policy in general these two challenge themes are clearly not a specific issue for modelling cc adaptation in agriculture but broader challenges to model development and application in relation to the category of model content the ccra review highlighted challenges relating to the interdependence of systems and how adaptations and their impacts cascade outwards this theme overlaps with the modelling challenges of interactions scale interactions external limitations modelling and dynamic change modelling in relation to the latter the specific issue of accounting for time lags in adaptation was highlighted there is no ccra theme that relates to discrete events except for a reference within the collaboration theme to the benefits of linking to disaster risk management researchers in relation to management modelling the ccra review focused on the specific issue of cognitive bias and how it affects decision making the biggest differences between the current study and the ccra review were found in the category of use of models participants in the current study expressed awareness of practical challenges relating to how to improve model relevance user focus the engagement approaches that modellers need to use the role of modelling when and how to engage and the challenge of effective communication with stakeholders however they did not consider how such issues might interact with differing stakeholder limitations and agendas which was highlighted in the ccra review within several different themes fig 2 a black boxes these differences in relation to use may reflect the different characteristics of modelling versus risk assessment in a ccra data form the core content with the scope of the assessment and understanding of interactions biophysical political and economic across scales and sectors etc explicit in the subsequent interpretation of those data an issue relating to the capacity to carry out this interpretation in contrast in modelling data are required to develop and use the model relating to the category capacity while scope and understanding of how systems work form the content of the model as a result model outputs may be shared and used by decision makers without these underlying issues contained within the model being considered interpretation of results becomes a much more contested space within ccra with uncertainty and limitations of knowledge interacting with the sometimes conflicting subjective agendas of stakeholders adger et al 2018 comparison of the ccra review and the present study therefore highlights the importance for agricultural cc adaptation modelling of taking better account of ethical issues relating to the presentation of findings what they include and exclude and with whom they are shared i e issues relating to the diverse motives perspectives and values of different societal groups 3 2 2 comparison with modelling reviews comparing challenges to grassland modelling and animal health and disease modelling under cc with the workshop data appendix d revealed two themes highlighted only in relation to cc adaptation not as wider challenges to modelling the first was the development of novel scenarios of future adaption fig 2 novel scenarios relate to the challenges of model scope with the difference being between elements of future change provided as model inputs scenarios and elements that are endogenous to models scope the second theme only arising in relation to cc adaptation was management modelling however it is apparent that incorporating all relevant aspects of decision making including cognitive bias into models is a general challenge for modellers seeking to represent any form of decision making studies of approaches to incorporating management into agricultural models moore et al 2014 robert et al 2016 suggest that technical solutions exist in modelling to characterise adaptation including constraints and changes that take place over time but that actually representing proactive management is difficult the fact that management modelling was not framed as a general challenge in the reviews used in the comparison exercise may relate to their focus on biophysical challenges reflecting the implicit nature of decision making assumptions in biophysical modelling i e as rational responses to biophysical cues with perfect knowledge this view is reinforced by the consideration in both reviews of interactions between management and biophysical and economic systems suggesting a greater focus on biophysical impacts and triggers of choices than on characterisation of the decision making process itself again although interactions modelling was considered as both a general and an adaptation specific challenge in the reviews improving how the interactions of biophysical economic and management systems are characterised is a general modelling challenge with only the scope of the systems modelled increasing to facilitate the modelling of novel adaptations data accessibility was another theme identified as a challenge for both general and cc adaptation modelling in the grassland and livestock health and disease reviews the need to collate available data on future adaptations however overcoming issues of data accessibility ownership sharing is clearly a general challenge for modellers and no specific elements of it were detailed in the reviews or the literature taking account of the discussions above ten of the original challenges were either not mentioned in the modelling reviews only mentioned as general challenges to modelling under cc or were determined to be general after further consideration fig 2 white boxes a cc adaptation specific element was suggested for three of these fig 2 a white boxes as a result of their relation to the ccra challenges associated with subjective aspects of dealing with stakeholders seven more of the original challenges were given both adaptation specific and wider relevance fig 2 light grey boxes determining the precise nature of the adaptation specific elements within these challenges required further consideration in the context of understanding from the wider literature which is the focus of the following section 3 3 identifying challenges specific to modelling adaptation the challenges identified in the previous section as having cc adaptation specific elements as well as associated themes from the ccra review fig 2 boxes within dashed ovals are explored below in the light of key characteristics of cc adaptation in order to focus on the underlying specific issues they present climate change differs from most other issues in that it overlays pre existing socio economic iglesias and garrote 2015 and environmental challenges and represents a progressive and sustained change over time as cc affects the biophysical systems on which we rely in multiple ways it produces cascades of interacting impacts and feedbacks within and between sectors making studies of cc issues particularly complex terzi et al 2019 so while other types of change affecting farming may also be progressive e g increasing demand for meat and dairy products advances in technology cc is unique as a sustained progressive change in the biophysical systems that farmers rely on rather than just in the socio economic context in which farming takes place path dependency in relation to processes of economic and political change over time including in agricultural systems kay 2003 see martin and sunley 2006 for a critical review means that our iterative responses to progressive cc may lead us down particular pathways each with different implications for different societal groups regions and biophysical systems for example investment to install and improve irrigation systems may make increasing crop water supply more cost effective for a farmer than changing towards more water efficient systems as cc advances with implications for other water users and the environment in sardinia dono et al 2016 found that intensive dairy farming reliant on irrigation systems is likely to be less vulnerable to cc than traditional low input sheep production reliant on natural water supplies therefore pathways of adaptive response to progressive cc need to be explored in order to facilitate informed and reflective decision making that take such issues into account in this light the scope of models to explore the future consequences of cc adaptation strategies is revealed as a cc adaptation specific element of the workshop theme of scope fig 3 b the issue of path dependency is also relevant to the use of models challenge category in the literature on cc adaptation even the need for intervention to ensure agricultural adaptation to cc is contested with some suggesting that market forces will automatically adjust systems to change while others argue that progressive cc will require well planned responses beyond the autonomous incremental change already undertaken by agricultural stakeholders anwar et al 2013 reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 relying on autonomous responses or intervening to completely manage cc adaptation are two extremes in a continuum of approaches which adaptive pathway different types of planned response or reliance on autonomous change appears most favourable depends on chosen system boundaries e g biophysical processes economic processes social processes and the nature of cc change reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 but also on desired outcomes and on whose desires are considered although profit or production maximising objectives may be assumed in hard systems van paassen et al 2007 research approaches this assumption has been described as representing an implicit sociology jansen 2009 of unexplored motives and opinions if particular motives and objectives for change have already been assumed in a model this represents a move towards more instrumental engagement with stakeholders to improve research outcomes or increase the implementation of recommendations and away from normative engagement involvement of stakeholders and incorporation of their views and needs as a right reed et al 2009 using freeman s 1984 classification of affected and affecting stakeholders this focus shifts attention from those who may be affected by change towards those that can affect change in this context and given that the quantification of information e g in models is understood to fundamentally alter how things are perceived and valued espeland and stevens 2008 it is important that the aims modellers focus on what models include who they are for and how they are communicated are critically reflected on by modellers in general within the current study the more normative aspects of the use of models challenge category reflected awareness among modellers of the potential for models to affect the direction of choices including adaptive responses and of how in some cases modellers are facing the challenge of assuming new roles e g recognising a paradigm shift in the research praxis from observer to co researchers knowledge brokers much previous work considers these issues with recent reviews focussing on best practice in stakeholder involvement model development use and evaluation fulton et al 2015 hamilton et al 2019 jakeman et al 2006 voinov et al 2016 including the development of specific engagement processes drawing on understanding of soft systems approaches martin 2015 however with pathway dependency in the context of progressive cc the potential impacts of model findings beyond the implementation of a given modelled choice add an extra dimension to issues of model use this additional element can be seen as a cc adaptation specific challenge to model use as discussed above cc adaptation modellers including biophysical modellers as well as bio economic modellers need to consider how social conflicts power relations and sectoral interests may influence their work and its use lang et al 2012 newell and taylor 2018 reed et al 2009 in the context of progressive cc and escalating adaptive responses such considerations enable modellers to recognise the implications of their focus on which stakeholders which objectives which adaptations and which impacts and to identify ways to ensure that the wider context of non modelled strategies and impacts is conveyed to stakeholders this may be carried out by the modellers themselves where they have the required expertise and sufficient resources but may also be achieved through collaboration with social scientists to try to avoid unintended consequences arising from the use of model outputs and to achieve best practice fig 3 e taken together these considerations represent the specific cc adaptation aspects of the challenges of communication engagement approaches role of modelling and user focus grouped as responsibilities of modelling under progressive climate change in fig 3 a related to the progressive nature of cc and adaptive responses to it a second key characteristic of cc adaptation was revealed explicitly in workshop data modellers expressed the need to better understand and incorporate likely stakeholder choices under progressive cc in which their expectations and experiences of cc evolve over time distinct from likely responses to other types of change such as one off shocks or opportunities to increase efficiency one participant for example highlighted the importance of understanding reasons or other triggers for farmer decisions on the number of cattle they have and the type of grassland management they apply and the point when they begin to care about climate change and take action addressing this issue which contributes to the adaptation specific elements optimisation and information fig 3 of challenge themes in groups c and d in fig 1 requires the development of cc adaptation scenarios which are relevant to likely future conditions and which provide data about the context of decision making and depending on the type of model define at least some aspects of decision making itself constructing adaptation scenarios is complex not least because of the issue of path dependency in iterative adaptive responses to progressive cc discussed above in addition choices are likely to be affected by dynamic changes in stakeholder understanding as conditions change anwar et al 2013 data for scenarios may come from social science models or be gathered from stakeholders or experts and will therefore incorporate uncertainty in addition data needed for scenarios includes information on the likely efficacy and impacts of adaptation strategies themselves which can also be considered to be cc adaptation specific given that participants in the current study highlighted the limitations to the data on adaptation efficacy including relating to reliance on expert views uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of cc adaptation strategies can also be considered an adaptation specific challenge within the cluster of challenges relating to information available for model development testing and use fig 3 d however uncertainty relating to models themselves is common to modelling in general while issues around the quality of data from climate models are important for both adaptation and cc impact modelling cammarano et al 2017 scenario development therefore brings together the cc adaptation specific elements of data availability and quality uncertainty and novel scenarios as information on adaptive responses to progressive change fig 3 d under progressive cc the period over which stakeholders seek to optimise systemic outputs is important as long term and short term goals may not align how this trade off is viewed is likely to alter with the considered time periods or the assumed pace and certainty of cc reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 this is a specific challenge for cc adaptation modelling with the goal of optimisation fig 3 c and represents the cc adaptation specific aspect of dynamic change modelling recent work has started to consider the application of approaches from other disciplines to agricultural settings in order to build understanding of how changes in the efficacy of cc adaptations over time and uncertainty in conditions and outcomes can be incorporated into assessments of adaptation strategies dittrich et al 2017 barriers to inter disciplinary research collaboration have been well documented siedlok and hibbert 2014 and the need for coordination across disciplines and institutes to tackle cc challenges has been recognised soussana et al 2012 key to challenges a and c fig 3 is collaboration with social scientists with expertise in managing stakeholder engagement nguyen et al 2014 reed et al 2014 and particularly those with expertise in normative and critical engagement approaches however inter disciplinary research communities require time resources appropriate structures and the application of specific skillsets to flourish kipling et al 2016c tomassini and luthi 2007 initiatives such as macsur and the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip rosenzweig et al 2013 have driven progress in agricultural model development and use ewert et al 2015 sándor et al 2017 and supported the application of inter disciplinary expertise to region specific cc issues dono et al 2016 özkan gülzari et al 2017 schönhart et al 2016 the need to characterise a wider range of sometimes transformative adaptations in agricultural models makes it essential to include smaller and geographically marginal research groups in inter disciplinary networks to capture the diversity of expertise in the research community these groups are vital to fully leveraging existing expertise along with core research groups that may find it easier to engage saetnan and kipling 2016 although differences in context may prevent data on management responses to cc conditions in one location being used as a reliable predictor of change in another reilly and schimmelpfennig 2000 linking local research expertise across regions offers the opportunity to explore novel solutions cross pollinating ideas between scientific communities within and between disciplines the need for integrated modelling approaches to investigate cc impacts and adaptation has been widely recognised reidsma et al 2015a b rötter et al 2018 and the closer involvement of stakeholders in modelling processes is vital to the generation of model outputs with real world relevance bellocchi et al 2015 hamilton et al 2019 the distinct aspect of collaboration for cc adaptation fig 3 e is therefore the urgency of the need to work together resulting from the progressive nature of cc hallegatte 2009 focussing efforts on the specific challenges to agricultural modelling identified above fig 3 a d illustrative reviews of the five cc adaptation specific modelling challenges identified fig 3 are provided in appendix e giving richer descriptions of how they are tackled by specific modelling communities 4 conclusions this study sought to answer the question to what extent is cc adaptation a novel challenge for agricultural modellers the findings indicate that there are a number of cc adaptation specific aspects to the challenges of adaptation modelling identified by modellers within the three challenge categories of use content and capacity derived from the data the theme of creating novel adaptation scenarios was found to be entirely specific to cc adaptation modelling seven challenge themes such as resources for modelling and scale interactions represented essential pre requisites for cc adaptation modelling but were not considered specific to it ten other themes were considered general modelling challenges but with cc adaptation specific aspects most fundamentally the importance of understanding and managing the influence of model focus limitations use and presentation on adaptive responses and their consequences was highlighted for both bio economic modellers and biophysical modellers cc adaptation modelling draws agricultural modellers into social and political contexts in which their approaches and findings affect who wins and who loses what is valued and what sacrificed in the adaptation of agriculture to progressive cc in modelling cc adaptation in agriculture there is a need for the agricultural modelling community to focus on the aspects of model content and capacity relating to scope optimisation and information on collaboration across

in the data data accessibility this theme relates to data ownership and its effect on the ability to use data that have been collected for modelling work data has a value to those who hold it which may mean that it is not used to the full extent possible intellectual property and turf secrecy and privacy often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and or obtain cash and rights limited accessibility may also be a more straightforward issue of communication and knowledge with modellers who have many demands on their time looking for data capture from readily available sources to reduce time spent getting outputs to tackle this challenge the need for shared resources was highlighted inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information data availability limitations in available data were commented on with respect to most aspects of adaptation modelling table b 1 the examples in the table indicate the division by the part of the system management economic biophysical and by different data types relating to future and current systems table b 1 types of data availability challenge table b 1 data type

limited knowledge on the interactions between grassland productivity and associated ecosystem services different systems few long term datasets on mediterranean grasslands lack of data for low input grassland systems different systems as predictors of extremes lack of data for forage crops response to fertilizer under varied extreme event conditions there are examples of systems in extreme climates we in nw europe have little sense about them or data that may exist on them different scales scarcity of data is an important problem we need to know what the business as usual state of a farm is usually very few data on management practices and productivity at territorial scale future predictions cost and availability of new technologies e g breeds soil management options also the change in management required e g new feed regime for new breeds focussed climate scenarios needed e g northern europe is likely to face wetter conditions and heat stress is not an issue limited knowledge on the interactions between grassland productivity and associated ecosystem services data quality some modellers raised the issue of data quality with respect to both standards and uncertainty heat stress modelling work requires wider data availability to capture differences in impacts between regions eu database some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability rather than real differences in conditions subjective expert knowledge on probability of events and shocks collaboration participants identified issues of a lack of interaction and understanding between modellers in different communities for example between disease modellers and other agricultural systems modellers as a particular issue disease modellers do not consider other modelling groups as potential users of their models outputs there is a gap between the modelling communities important challenge for modelling adaptation and a lack of interaction between empirical researchers and modellers was also raised as a challenge no insight or insufficient insight on data availability from other disciplines several participants highlighted the need for work across disciplines and this was associated with the need to provide models that met the requirements of users linking groups interdisciplinarity to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user collaboration is underpinned by the need to improve how information about models source codes etc is shared between researchers communication modelling can produce complex findings that are a challenge to communicate to end users with certain procedures not intuitively understandable for non modellers comprehensible sensitivity analysis participants recognised the importance of communication skills in relation to ensuring outputs are easy to take in for different groups policy makers want to receive a simplified summary of key outputs not to be given complex model details other stakeholders also require simplified outputs how can we make material digestible for stakeholders how to communicate suggested feed changes to farmers communication skills were emphasized as a challenge the process of transferring information might limit its accessibility for stakeholders care is needed in the communication process and also the importance of more integrated engagement to enable users and modellers to understand each other better organising dynamic learning and communication processes discrete events modelling one off or extreme events are shocks to a system that may be hard to predict risk and timing of extreme events and the effects of which may alter both future states of the system and the ability of decision makers to implement adaptation options the length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices and this is hard to model e g a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought but previous droughts or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available discrete events also include the challenge of modelling threshold changes in behaviour the appearance and implementation of a new disruptive technology or the point at which stakeholders move from adaptation of current systems to transformation to new systems in relation to causes timing and impacts of such changes disruptive technology one of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural for example a transition to food derived from bio reactors dynamic change modelling adaptations can be implemented in different ways which are likely to influence how they affect the system and this presents a challenge for modelling solutions can be applied in many different ways gradually in one step in a series of steps timeframe of choices so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity for modellers at the same time biophysical processes themselves may occur over different short and long term time scales which can be hard to capture short term eg annual versus long term eg decadal simulations e g soil carbon soil organic matter long term dynamics not well addressed engagement approach participants highlighted the challenge of engaging in meaningful ways with stakeholders how to build long term connections between interested farmers and scientists that go way beyond usual project durations a range of approaches and tools for improved engagement with stakeholders was shared for example typical farms as anchor for simulating and presenting my results thinking about a game in which effects and feedbacks can be explored in a kind of what happens when machine external limitations modelling this theme focuses on changes to policy or biophysical constraints beyond the system that affect the implementation of adaptation options and its consequences policy limitations to model adaptation strategies change feeding increases milk yield but milk quota consideration of temporary regional constraints e g regional silage market in case of drought interactions modelling this theme encompasses challenges relating to i a lack of underlying understanding of the interactions between factors and mechanisms in agricultural systems too many interacting factors and interacting mechanisms are still not well enough understood to be modelled e g heat stress on animal productivity includes many confounding effects and studies generally do not separate these effects sufficiently ii challenges relating to the computational power required in characterising complex interactions involving a number of inter dependent types of mechanism computability to integrate inter dependent sectors scales spatial ecosystem services scales temporal adaptations future scenario space uncertainty etc these issues relate to biophysical interactions grassland models are not able to simulate the diversity of species and inter specific interactions that characterise grasslands to economic and management interactions such as the cost availability of novel options and the changes in management required when they are implemented cost and availability of new technologies e g breeds soil management options also including the change in management required e g new feed regime for new breeds and to the effects of implementation on the biophysical system the application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change and finally to feedback arising from management changes incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models at all in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure management modelling this theme refers to the challenge of understanding and then modelling the decision to implement change what factors values knowledge age economics influence these stakeholder choices and how can these be incorporated into models adaptation is related to the perception of farmers and their sensitivity to change in a specific aspect of management e g they are likely to be more willing to change some practices than others the uptake of adaptation measures is therefore dependent on culture and knowledge as well as external risk differentiation was made between reactive and proactive change farmers have to face actual events not the risk of events after such events a range of actions will be required for a system to recover these represent reactive adaptation which is not the same as pre emptive adaptation to reduce future impacts with a question as to how biophysical models can incorporate adaptation when choices to adapt are made in advance of biophysical triggers to change how do biophysical models include the costs of anticipatory strategies novel scenarios under climate change models will be faced with the need to characterise new circumstances and their impacts under climate change relationships between variables may not remain the same e g under more extreme conditions than tested for and we need to try to understand these potential changes one challenge is to represent the impacts of climate change on the biophysical system differential effect of increasing co2 on mixed swards and their downstream impacts on production roughage quality analysis not future proof mixed sward quality under climate change on top of this is the need to then understand how the implementation of adaptation options will affect such changed systems model limitations for allocating land to feed types plus protein feeds e g forage versus cereal crops adaptation through changing feeding patterns this may include the introduction of new production options nitrogen cycle to create a zero sum long term n balance what happens in a semi arid soil what happens under agro forestry what happens in ley plus arable resources for modelling this theme covers three main areas 1 the way that models develop over time and how this affects their capabilities e g if some parts are based on older research and the capacity of their users to understand them some model limitations come from the development of models over time for example model name was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in what now seems a limited way management experts then moved on to other projects and model name became more biophysical especially when the agricultural modelling field may not have the space to nurture many careers agricultural systems modellers very narrow resource pool very different funding too few can form a career at the coal face many just pass through 2 issues relating to computability and the need to incorporate more and more complexity while handling the trade off with usability computability to integrate inter dependent sectors scales spatial ecosystem services scales temporal adaptations future scenario space uncertainty etc finally modelling resources may not be distributed equally across specific topics and this unevenness may not reflect the importance of individual topics in relation to adaptation with disease endemic diseases are more important than incursions but less attractive to funders e g liverfluke role of modellers focuses on the different ways in which modellers engage with real world problems this includes various roles for model outputs to demonstrate the importance of something to allowing comparisons of systems benchmarking to informing decision making and in the development of new ideas and also includes changes in the role of the modellers themselves not just their tools paradigm shift in the research praxis from observer to co researchers knowledge brokers scale interactions the theme consists of challenges to modelling how change at one scale affects that at another including the need to predict the farm scale impacts of wider changes not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible how to assess the impacts at farm scale and the importance of scaling up detailed farm level modelling to provide regional scale predictions upscaling issues e g modelling at farm scale and impacts at landscape scale participants highlighted how such effects cross the boundaries between economic and biophysical modelling need to start with farm level adaptations farmers may observe regional water issues and pay for own storage or find it better to reduce water dependence by using different crops etc scope this theme focuses on the extent to which models cover different regions and systems difficulties in modelling mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self reseeding species the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands mainly dominated by perennials elements of systems demonstrate how biodiversity impacts productivity e g by showing influence of pest predation on yield and impact of beneficial fauna on this acceptance and better understanding of feedback effects between production biodiversity and ecosystem services societal value and the extent to which they are able to span or take into account interactions between biophysical management and economic elements of change which are central to understanding adaptation biophysical models ignore economic life e g if all farms use more imported feed then feed prices will rise people will move out of farming and animal prices will fall these are important interactions requiring anticipatory actions by farmers to minimise costs user focus these challenges related to the need to ensure models and their outputs were mindful of the needs of stakeholders who may differ from modellers in relation to the timescale they are considering or type of questions they want answered policy makers are asking how do we do x while scientists are answering what happens if questions this can create communication problems the theme includes the challenge of providing tailored models cooling ventilation adaptation designs are very farm specific e g requirement for a very detailed design and approach to the extent of modelling on demand applied research by demand i e farmer associations demanding to play with their real data modellers need to consider who their users are and what they need and working with them can be part of achieving this define end users target groups and work with them throughout finally some participants referred to the need to ensure that outputs were interpreted correctly distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive normative information and results uncertainty modelling the need for models to be able to deal with uncertainty from biophysical and economic systems and from models themselves was commented upon by several participants e g integration of deviation coming from the biological world in the correctness of the model appendix c comparison of workshop findings with a review of crop modelling in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation rötter et al 2018 specific challenges were extracted from the text of the review article and coded contrasting and comparing these challenges with workshop data and themes to develop or add themes where required no new themes emerged from the data with all challenges being compatible with themes identified from workshop data without further development table c 1 the article identified some challenges specific to tropical systems table c 1 these challenges were also compatible with themes identified from analysis of workshop data table c 1 text relating to challenges to modelling agricultural impacts of and adaptations to climate change identified by rötter et al 2018 and its relation to themes identified in workshop data ts challenges identified by rötter et al 2018 as specific to tropical plant production systems table c 1 text extracts from rötter et al 2018 relating to modelling challenges themes economic models need to be combined with crop simulation models in whole farm assessments to better evaluate management practices collaboration interactions management and land use does not only respond to climate change but also to changing socio economic conditions such as liberalization of markets or changes in dietary habits crop simulation modelling thus needs to be integrated into a larger modelling framework collaboration interactions scale interactions statistical models are constrained in many cases by the availability of adequate representative yield data data availability data quality substantial mismatches between crop simulation models and statistical models may indicate knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms processes that cause under overestimation of yield et cetera data availability interactions despite some efforts the effect of tillage on carbon storage has so far only been modelled with limited success mainly due to insufficient field data to develop mechanistic descriptions in the models data availability interactions at larger scales crop simulation modelling is severely hampered by lack of data for parameterization and calibration and management systems are often unknown large uncertainties persist especially related to variability in managerial practices and spatial response patterns data availability likewise important tropical crops have been much less investigated in experiments regarding their exposure to agro climatic extremes than those for temperate systems even with some progress in data availability there is a need for both more experiments and modelling as propagated by tropags see fig 3 to understand the underlying mechanisms ts data availability a key constraint to realistically upscaling the productivity of such systems and how it is affected by climate change to region level is for instance that fields of smallholder systems are not clearly defined and a wide range of crop types can be found within a field ts data availability besides improving crop models fast track methods are needed to characterise and inventory smallholder fields as a basis for upscaling thereby the typical simplistic focus of modelling climate change impacts on sole crops usually maize in smallholder systems of africa can be overcome ts data availability we need much better understanding of how climate effects scale with changes in low input systems ts data availability still by far the majority of crop simulation models deal with single season single crop runs dynamic change there is also an increasing interest in the role that agricultural management has on environmental impact such as carbon sequestration or ghg emissions however carbon stocks need years to build up thus long term simulation over multiple years that also reflect the current deviation from the equilibrium state are necessary to capture that dynamic change while ensemble approaches helped to make model predictions more robust and quantify the uncertainties the next logical step was to improve responses to heat and the fundamental temperature functions in individual models to eventually reduce the uncertainty by proposing improved functions and parameterization interactions modelling and also lack information on critical interactions of factors such as weather soil and management practices interactions modelling so far crop models are not capable of capturing the multi species interactions within one field and the associated services delivered ts interactions modelling moreover many systems are integrated crop livestock systems which makes the common use of the model output variable yield produced per unit area difficult ts interactions modelling one advantage of this method use of statistical models is that it inherently covers also indirect yield limiting factors which are linked to climate variables like pest and diseases process based crop models so far largely ignore their effects and thus fail to estimate farmer yields accurately in regions and years where biotic stresses are significant scope while these multi model ensemble approaches can be the basis for systematically exploring critical parameters and assumptions they do not compensate for exploring missing mechanisms scope global model runs suggest strong effects of climate change on the crop production systems in the global south especially in africa however such runs were done mainly for water limited and or nutrient limited yield hence with yields not limited by biotic stresses that makes the results of little use to understand the actual effect of climate change on these systems as many tropical plant production systems are heavily restricted by combinations of severe abiotic and biotic stresses ts scope many tropical systems are arguably more complex including agroforestry intercropping unfortunately crop models have been rarely tested applied in such systems ts scope appendix d comparison of workshop findings with a review of challenges for climate change risk assessment ccra for adaptation policy adger et al 2018 and challenges identified by kipling et al 2016 grassland modelling özkan et al 2016 livestock health and disease modelling d1 themes from the adger et al 2018 review of challenges to ccra for adaptation policy the themes below summarise the text of the adger et al 2018 review gathering it into intuitive groupings that enabled easier comparison with the challenges identified in the current study the themes were extracted from the paper using a thematic coding approach ritchie et al 2014 themes were then compared with challenges identified by modellers in the workshops to highlight any cc adaptation specific issues that modellers also need to tackle gaps in coverage of identified adaptation modelling challenges how the ccra for adaptation policy themes and those identified by modellers overlapped and complemented each other is described in section d2 and table d1 below and explained and visualised in main text fig 2 in fig 2 some of the themes below are grouped according to their type indicated in brackets next to their title e g incorporating biophysical knowledge into ccra relates to the availability and quality of data biophysical knowledge data availability biophysical systems will respond to climate change in complex ways that interact across systems and over different time scales including feedback effects on climate change itself these interactions are not fully understood including for example potential for critical transitions recent studies provide improved assessments of the extent to which specific events can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and predictions about the magnitude and frequency of extreme events cognitive bias human choices are often made using mental short cuts which allow decisions to be made despite limits to available information of the ability to gather and process it these cognitive factors can bias the choices according to pre existing preferences and can lead to inconsistency across scales and contexts of decision making they may be the result of cultural or inherited traits communication the challenge of communicating uncertainties assumptions and limitations given that the choice of adaptive response is often controversial and liable to scrutiny is important to address this includes the need to avoid over technical approaches that might not fit well with some examples of risk to explain constraints in order to avoid the development of unrealistic expectations around outcomes to ensure the relevance of outcomes to decision makers e g focussing on urgency relating risks to current policy outcomes the presentation of ccras can affect their effectiveness in stimulating change examples from text were the assessment of risks associated with current policy and how current objectives might be threatened by climate change and the use of risk registers that use the dimensions of likelihood and impact to bring together rank highlight and communicate a range of risks transparency and close engagement with users of ccra outputs are highlighted data on adaptation availability and quality the need to better incorporate into ccra information on the viability of adaptation options and on the way their effectiveness varies with different scenarios of future change sensitivity in the context of uncertainty lack of data is an important limitation to ccra for example relating to monitoring or evaluation of adaptation options to biophysical systems their responses and the impacts of human actions on them and on adaptive capacity there is a need for improved data quality to move on from piecemeal and or qualitative subjective assessments e g expert judgements or stakeholder exercises to systemized data collection appraisal and presentation monitoring and evaluation data are in many cases limited in terms of survey size and sample type e g only early adopters consistency is needed in framing risks and uncertainties and the criteria on which adaptations are evaluated needs to be considered see also under ethics approaches have been developed and used to apply global data to more localised ccra to overcome some challenges relating to a lack of data developing new ccra methods risk registers can be useful but may become over technical leading to frames being fitted to risks that they are not suited to in italy the climate risk index improved model ensemble data and applied a more robust analysis to rank administrative areas in relation to different climate change impacts in order to support the allocation of funds for adaptation in ccra methodological advances such as the business function framework for business and industry risks are mentioned diversity and number of factors diversity is present in i the context of adaptation including the perspectives of those involved what they value or feel concerned about different types of change and impact different timescales of change ii the diversity of evidence types on which ccras must be based iii the different underlying assumptions uses of scenarios and scope of ccras iv the diversity of risks and adaptive options which means that fitting risks into strict technical parameters for ccra may not be appropriate large numbers of options are also likely to be available for adaptive change ethics why intervention should take place and in what form how ccras are presented including scope uncertainty limitations framing recognition of risk as subjective and perceived differently by different groups is mentioned and aspects such as how adaptations are evaluated e g effectiveness and fairness are relevant expectations decision makers are expecting more from ccras including for example information on the adaptive impacts of current policies and assessments of how to make adaptations more effective some examples of ccras used in practical policy processes include the climate risk index for italy which used detailed ensemble modelling and analysis to rank administrative areas according to the risks they faced in relation to specific climate change impacts outcomes informed the distribution of financial resources for adaptation those using ccras need to recognise that complete avoidance of risk is not likely to be practical engaging throughout the process of ccra can help build understanding and reduce differences in expectation between those producing and using the ccra experience of decision makers a challenge for climate change adaptation ccra is that decision makers often have limited experience of dealing with problems with large numbers of alternative options and high uncertainty while past experience of change often used to quantify risk in ccras is not adequate under climate change conditions interdependence challenge to understanding i how risks cascade through interdependent systems biophysical and human and ii how adaptive actions on the ground policy and risk levels interact in relation to i work is needed to better understand linkages and critical transitions within systems including biophysical human system interactions such interactions and the incorporation of multiple time scales are beyond conventional ra methods but need to be understood to address systemic risks using expert stakeholder knowledge can provide a route to understanding how risks are transmitted across sectors and scales risk transmission framing is mentioned as a specific methodological advance in relation to assessing cascading risks interdisciplinary and trans disciplinary approaches collaboration challenge of dealing with the wide and interacting impacts of climate change and adaptive responses including the key integration of biophysical and socio economic aspects of exposure and vulnerability and the linking of disaster risk management and cc adaptation expertise challenges for research and decision makers at policy level can be addressed by considering the experiences of ccra in specific sectors and approaches used to address other complex issues can also be learned from ccra approaches for infrastructure and business risks are mentioned as methodological advances relating to specific sectors stakeholders can provide expert knowledge to complement scientific understanding links across disciplines need to be integrated with links to the needs of adaptation policymakers at a strategic level interests individuals and groups vary in how they respond to risk and the types of risk and types of things affected are likely to be qualitatively different so that attempts at objective comparisons can lead to choices that are suboptimal in terms of people s needs e g irreversible changes value related to attachment to places and systems with cultural significance the interests of some groups may trade off with those of others and may be sub optimal when considered more broadly e g policy drive to incentivise food production over environmental protection priorities may also link to deeper underlying values that may not be explicit these issues create a challenge at points where objective ccras and subjective perspectives interact taken together the issue of interests raises the important issue of who should be involved in determining the scope and nature of ccra and the extent and type of response given that those making choices may not wish to take precautions scenarios the interactions of climate change with global change in systems resulting from a variety of stressors is a big challenge for scenarios that will need to incorporate how different drivers of change co evolve for example by pooling data to discover confounding factors scenarios can be used to represent diverse pathways exceeding those accessible through conventional prediction facilitating understanding of the consequences of change presenting a range of scenarios including extremes is also a strategy to deal with uncertainty in predictions see uncertainty scope the scope of an ccra can affect how it is used and how risks are perceived as well as affecting the accuracy with which incorporated risks are assessed more recent ccras have incorporated socio economic drivers of vulnerability and ccras are being widened to incorporate climate change opportunities to improve balance in decision making there has been recognition of issues relating to impacts and adaptive responses that cross political borders relates also to interdependence and how these can affect risk and adaptive responses inclusion of the impact of current adaptation actions on future risk from policy aspirations to action and adaptive capacity is important including how different policy drivers might interact with adaptation needs to positively or negatively effect risk finally a need to characterise risks and issues related to different coping potentials was identified scope interacts with expectations of what ccras should provide for policy makers as well as what they incorporate into their conclusions with an emphasis on the need to engage with policy and implementation in addition to publishing reports the review also highlights a modelling challenge also raised by modellers that the variety and diversity of adaptations is a challenge for integrated assessment models that do not incorporate all the required parameters or interactions socio economic drivers data availability incorporation of social and economic factors and their interaction with climate change and the nature of adaptive responses into ccra drawing on agent based modelling or qualitative understanding of human behaviour time lags in adaptation implementation of change might not be instant and may take some time for practical reasons or due to the existence of other barriers institutions social reasons these issues need to be incorporated in assessments of the extent to which an adaptation can offset climate related impacts uncertainty uncertainty can limit action if adaptation is undertaken only in the light of predictions however predictability is suggested by some authors to be more important when there are few alternative options for action and relative certainty in outcomes this is not the case with climate change uncertainty may relate to consequences or likelihood of climate change impacts or in relation to the effects of adaptive actions in relation to climate change much uncertainty is probably irreducible therefore wait and see is not a positive strategy some authors have suggested that uncertainty can be used as knowledge in itself affecting how the viability of different options for change is viewed questions are raised about whether reducing uncertainty increases the effectiveness of decision making although the importance of providing boundaries to potential outcomes are emphasized by some having a range of scenarios including extremes may assist decision making under uncertainty and being explicit about the goals of adaptation is also important involving stakeholders in participatory approaches to change based on precautionary principles can be a more effective path for decision making with unavoidable uncertainty than using metrices and making decision trees other approaches include incorporating the temporal aspects of change e g dynamic adaptation pathways with trigger points robust decision making approaches and risk layering according to risk and return periods and stress testing to assess critical levels for ecosystem functioning in natural systems d2 comparison

main paper fig 2 e is covered in the main text 1 climate change adaptation modelling and stakeholders responsibilities of modelling under progressive change recent integrated modelling initiatives have demonstrated the use of agricultural modelling within a process in which model outcomes provide the basis for exploring the broader impacts of change beyond those normally incorporated in agricultural modelling in sardinia models revealed likely reductions in summer sheep s milk production under cc considering this researchers and stakeholders explored potential consequences for the supply chain and other economic sectors dono et al 2016 lower milk production would reduce availability of cheese for tourists while reduction in milk quality could cause problems for transformation into products with a quality label one issue exemplified by this study is that of limitations and uncertainty in modelling available statistical heat stress models were not able to incorporate adaptive responses demonstrating the importance of clearly communicating the meaning and limitations of results to avoid misuse such limitations include uncertainty about cc impacts and adaptive responses the use of impact pirttioja et al 2015 and adaptation response surfaces ruiz ramos et al 2018 together with robustness indexes of adaptation recommendations rodríguez et al 2018 have been used in biophysical models to address this challenge uncertainty makes developing sound protocols for adaptation modelling vital in preventing model misuse and reducing the potential for incorrect or misinterpreted outputs to drive mal adaptive change ramirez villegas et al 2015 a second issue raised within the sardinian study was that dairy cow systems with access to irrigation were predicted to be less affected by cc than more traditional sheep systems choices made by policymakers presented with such evidence would depend on how the modelling message was framed and what was valued in that framing e g economic benefit ecological footprint tradition and culture tourism or agriculture the interests of a particular sector modelled impacts might therefore drive adaptive responses in very different directions changing who is affected by climate change and how reckien et al 2017 in undertaking and presenting findings modellers may unwittingly be used to support the case of specific stakeholder groups lang et al 2012 in highlighting how models can shape stakeholder views and agendas the data from this study illustrate how modellers might alter what stakeholders consider in their choices this issue might be addressed by considering how to make researchers more accountable for their influence on decision making or by ensuring that by representing the agendas of the affected as well as the affecting and by expressing the limitations to their work modellers can enable stakeholders and policymakers to retain responsibility for their actions the progressive nature of cc and as a result cc adaptation and how it shapes the systems on which humanity relies brings to the fore the tension between research following pragmatic consensus seeking approaches to engagement and critical approaches that see exploring and making different societal groups aware of conflicts and power relations as prerequisites for just solutions johansson and lindhult 2008 while social learning approaches facilitating co learning between researchers and stakeholders may underpin more effective sustainable bottom up change in agriculture nguyen et al 2014 questions still remain about how the needs and values of those outside the process are recognised the ability of modelling to help stakeholders understand how their actions can affect other systems and actors martin et al 2011 vieira pak and castillo brieva 2010 suggests a role in helping stakeholders and policymakers at all levels to conceptualise the types of cc futures their adaptive choices are likely to create how well modellers can fulfil the role of facilitating learning and exploration by stakeholders is linked to the extent to which they are willing and can work together across disciplines to recognise and present a range of strategies and consequences information on adaptive responses to progressive change for models such as regional integrated land use models ilms or biophysical models well specified adaptation strategies may be included as inputs these are frequently defined by experts external information can be added about the adaptation e g for ilms the regional availability of relevant technology and the required infrastructure and conditions such as water availability and institutional settings although technical coefficient generators can be used to identify a large range of alternative adaptations e g janssen et al 2010 information may also be needed on adoption e g in positive mathematical programming models posing a particular challenge for adaptation measures which are not yet available at regional level socio economic scenarios are being created to consistently define framework conditions for adaptation improving transparency and comparability in the assumptions underlying model predictions these include the regional agricultural pathways raps developed within agmip valdivia et al 2013 raps are characterised with input from stakeholders and experts to ensure their coherence and relevance however scenarios may still face issues including limitations in the scenario building approach the choice of stakeholders and experts from whom to gather data and the potential for uncritical inclusion of implicit sociological assumptions jansen 2009 at farm scale eliciting farmers objectives is not straightforward what they say and what they do may not be the same mandryk et al 2014 rather than using expert judgement to validate the performance of decision making sub models models such as melodie chardon et al 2012 have used on farm observations of real behaviour chardon et al 2008 garcia et al 2005 removing doubt about the accuracy of reported actions however validation based on observed behaviour may not reflect future choices under progressive cc in addition lack of knowledge about the future availability and quality of alternative inputs e g concentrate feeds may limit the ability of modelling at farm scale to apply relevant scenarios studies using the bio economic farm scale model fssim kanellopoulos et al 2014 wolf et al 2015 came to different conclusions due to differences in the projected possibility of renting land which influenced crop rotations constraining choices a range of approaches exist for increasing the accuracy of predicted behaviour in farm scale bio economic modelling reidsma et al 2018 some maintain assumptions of rational profit maximising behaviour but include impacts of uncertainty and changing experience in decision making processes such as the use of discrete stochastic programming dono et al 2016 or make alternative assumptions about farmers risk behaviour finger and calanca 2011 forming links between agricultural modellers and agent based modellers berger and troost 2014 including those focussing specifically on modelling human adaptive behaviour under global environmental change acosta michlik and espaldon 2008 acosta michlik et al 2014 offers the potential to explore ways to use their modelling to provide improved adaptation scenarios or to more realistically represent adaptive behaviour endogenously given the unavoidability of uncertainty about future choices one approach is to produce a range of outcomes based on different scenarios and adaptation choices which stakeholders can subsequently discuss rather than ranking outcomes to suggest a recommended best action dittrich et al 2017 mandryk et al 2014 model findings may also be presented in the context of a critical assessment of wider implications of implementation including adaptation effects on social or environmental objectives such farm income cc mitigation or water quality e g reidsma et al 2015a b schönhart et al 2018 they become one among a range of inputs to a broader process of social learning in which stakeholders together with researchers from different disciplines develop a shared understanding of problems and solutions nguyen et al 2014 this feeds into the idea of cycling between biophysical and socio economic aspects in participatory processes of research and the creation of adaptive loops to maintain flexibility in the face of changing conditions howden et al 2007 a recent review of scenario planning star et al 2016 provided a matrix of approaches that can be aligned with different roles for modelling which may support stakeholders in determining adaptation strategies that help them meet the normative objectives they desire provide a range of exploratory outcomes for them to consider present them with a recommended normative outcome or finally provide a range of strategies that they would like models to explore engagement with experts in scenario planning can therefore address issues relating to gathering information on future conditions with different approaches supporting modellers in tackling the challenge of responsibilities of modelling in the context of progressive change fig 1 a 2 bio economic modelling scope of adaptations modelled to characterise how adaptation affects biophysical processes farm scale bio economic models rely on either inputs from biophysical models from one off data input to integrated frameworks or the creation of simpler endogenous representations of biophysical systems the scope of adaptation strategies they characterise is therefore constrained by the scope of these linked models including in relation to the objectives of adaptation strategies with most crop models focussing on yield rather than other types of outcome mandryk et al 2014 2017 linking to crop models using modular approaches is a common solution to increase scope e g the link between epic and famos space schönhart et al 2016 or wofost and the agro climate calendar and farmdesign mandryk et al 2017 where crop management choices are modelled at field level fewer models link to biophysical animal models with livestock production often represented via feed budgeting and or herd dynamics modules e g famos space scotfarm modam with annual or monthly time steps farm scale bio economic models might also include integrated cropping or soil processes exemplified by the incorporation of soil carbon stocks in farmdesign groot et al 2012 adaptation modelling is then possible to the extent that cc and adaptation impacts can be translated to the relevant co efficients in these modules e g change in milk yield or liveweight gain solutions for fully integrated livestock and crop production sub modules also exist for example the dairynz model takes weather data directly with pasture and cow metabolism modules operating with a daily time step and an annual time step economic module kalaugher et al 2017 at regional level ilms have a wide spatial scope from landscape briner et al 2012 reidsma et al 2015a b and sub regional schönhart et al 2014 to continental levels holman et al 2017 and integrate field animal and farm scale biophysical and economic models or components of them to represent bio physical and human systems and their interactions regional ilms based on a normative concept of adaptive decision making such as some linear programming models assuming profit maximization annetts and audsley 2002 kirchner et al 2016 have the scope to model novel land use outcomes e g new crop species or the adoption of new technology although this requires prior specification of the measure by the user this is particularly challenging in regional ilm due to their large spatial and farming system coverage regional ilm based on positive concepts of adaptation decision making such as positive mathematical programming pmp models schönhart et al 2014 or econometric models fezzi and bateman 2015 moore and lobell 2014 may face challenges in representing adaptation beyond previously observed ranges an option to overcome this limitation is the incorporation of observed management practices from other regions where climatic conditions are similar to those expected in the focus region under cc in terms of representing future technologies dietrich et al 2014 endogenously modelled investment dependent technological change in the global ilm magpie for ilms further research is required to understand adaptation outcomes when relationships between farms supply chains and marketing of agricultural products are taken into account optimisation under progressive change and with thresholds dynamic bio economic farm scale models such as scotfarm can represent inter temporal dependencies e g agronomic effects of adaptation via changing rotations or herd management or the financial aspects of longer term investment and policy and or market changes agronomic thresholds can be incorporated into farm scale bio economic models either via the functions of specific modules e g linked crop models or external data input however incremental adaptation can only be assessed if relevant processes are integrated or if data are provided from external models janssen et al 2010 schaap et al 2013 economic thresholds e g farms going out of production due to losses can be represented although financial modules often work at the gross or net margin level not considering reserves and credit availability to the extent that alternative practices can be characterised step changes in management and in contextual scenarios can be compared including the impacts of long term financial investment which can be annualised over the investment s lifetime to make them comparable while some adaptation requires binary decisions e g whether to establish cover crops on a plot other decisions can be continuous e g the choice of fertilisation levels or irrigation rates ilms frequently link single models sequentially and are static with respect to land use decisions rarely representing feedbacks of adaptation choices on cc altered biophysical systems consequently they are limited in relation to evaluating how the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies evolve over time modelling of dynamic adaptation processes such as applied in bio economic farm models is complicated by the larger spatial and farming system coverage of ilms even for market feedbacks many applications use exogenous price assumptions on agricultural inputs and outputs independent from adaptation choices in regional ilms adaptation thresholds are mainly determined by economic cost benefit considerations a considerable simplification from real world decision making one off investment decisions can be modelled by comparing average costs and benefits e g represented in annuities but this requires assumptions about the dynamic effects of adaptation strategies such as transition periods options to overcome challenges relating to optimisation under progressive change include risk sensitive dynamic modelling of annual land use decisions lehtonen 2012 abstracting from the farm level in regional ilm eases the representation of transformative shifts between farming systems such as land cover conversion changes in livestock or between organic and conventional farming systems however static models are prone to overestimating the likelihood of dynamic transformation processes e g forest succession including risk behaviour as in many bio economic farm models liu et al 2016 can make such the representation of adaptation choices more realistic 3 biophysical modelling scope of adaptations modelled the focus of many recent crop model inter comparisons has been on wheat e g asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 maize and rice ehrhardt et al 2018 and rötter et al 2018 have highlighted the need to widen the focus of modelling to cover more systems including tropical crop production the effects of cc on pest and disease ecology and spread and the consequences for different plant species and communities also need to be better incorporated into models as a pre requisite to simulating the impacts of adaptation strategies focussed on plant health newbery et al 2016 challenges of model scope and adaptation impact are being tackled in relation to several specific adaptations including modelling crop rotations kollas et al 2015 and cc effects on harvest quality nuttall et al 2017 wheeler and reynolds 2013 the characterisation of intercropping systems and crop mixtures is also challenging with most models currently representing such systems as a single crop with characteristics based on those of the combined crop an advance is the characterisation of two species independently accounting for soil nutrient and light sharing between them e g stics corre hellou et al 2009 multi species grasslands are also likely to be more resilient to cc tilman and downing 1994 tilman et al 2006 taken together the need for multi species modelling for arable and grassland systems creates potential for collaboration with ecological modellers more used to dealing with multi species swards kipling et al 2016 van oijen et al 2018 recent work in this area includes the development of dynamic modelling of both species composition and changes in biomass in productive grasslands moulin et al 2018 grassland models have flexibility through their mechanistic incorporation of a range of biophysical processes such as plant grazing animal interactions graux et al 2011 the inclusion of these and other detailed sward processes along with outputs relating to production nutrient flows and ghg emissions sanz cobena et al 2017 demonstrate the scope of such models to characterise adaptive changes via the alteration of input variables by the user as in the case of bio economic models section 3 4 2 the scope of farm scale biophysical models to characterise novel adaptations is determined by the capabilities of the crop and grass models to which they are linked thus in melodie chardon et al 2012 a dynamic model designed to simulate nutrient flows across a mixed farming system operational short term within a season adaptations associated with crop and grassland management and short term changes in feed rations are incorporated via the stics crop model tactical annual adaptations linked with the planning of crop rotations feed rations and fertilisation strategy are also simulated using specific sub models chardon 2008 chardon et al 2008 however farm scale models must also consider adaptations associated with farm infrastructure and resources e g housing imported feed and interactions between these systemic components that might produce emergent effects chardon et al 2012 within melodie manpower machinery and some aspects of animal housing e g control of ventilation alleviation of heat stress or addition of water to slurry tank are not included excluding consideration of related adaptation strategies assessing the value of some tactical adaptations like the use of cover crops changing crop species varieties or the implementation of different tillage practices is possible but only by comparing several with vs without adaptation scenarios and not by simulating such changes in response to external factors similarly some adaptations can be simulated by altering input variables e g change in the calving pattern use of alternative forages changes of breeds or changes in manure processing inclusion of farm scale biophysical models in modelling platforms e g melodie within the inra modelling platform bergez et al 2013 allow them to benefit from improvements in sub models modular structures for farm scale models offer an important technical solution to the challenge of characterising a wider scope of novel cc adaptations in both biophysical and bio economic modelling janssen et al 2010 optimisation under progressive change and with thresholds many crop models are only designed for single season runs rötter et al 2018 making it hard to consider the relative outcomes of adaptation strategies over different time scales a major challenge is the development of approaches to incorporate carry over effects of management change for example progressive shifts in sowing dates and how performance in crop rotations alters according to the effects of previous crops in the rotation pappa et al 2012 without characterising these effects adaptation under progressive cc cannot be fully assessed similarly in grassland modelling capturing dynamic change in swards under progressive cc kipling et al 2016 is a prerequisite to fully assessing the cost benefits of adaptation strategies over different time frames 
26149,flow regime alterations from hydropower regulation may impact fish populations impacts can be characterized using methods for mapping bottlenecks for different species life stages improving the understanding of such bottlenecks could provide a basis for mitigation measures an integrated modelling approach coupling a salmon population model ib salmon a hydraulic 1d model hec ras and a temperature model air2stream was used to identify the bottlenecks constraining the salmon population in a hydro regulated river ljungan river sweden this integrated approach evaluated changes in the salmon population under different low flow scenarios involving potential dewatering of spawning sites and the effect of restored spawning sites model results demonstrated that low discharges in winter and summer were potential hydrological bottlenecks for the salmon population particularly in winter due to potential dewatering of spawning sites restoration of spawning sites increased salmon production under all scenarios posing a potential counter measure against low flows 1 introduction hydropower production in northern europe has an important and stabilizing role in the current and future nordic energy system and the green shift toward european renewable energies oecd iea 2013 in 2016 the total installed capacity for hydropower in sweden was 16 200 mw with an average annual production of 66 twh flood 2015 accounting for approximately half of the country s energy consumption shares in the energy system from swedish and norwegian hydropower play an important role in supporting decarbonisation in the nordic countries oecd iea 2013 the implementation of european legislation such as the renewable energy directive 2009 28 ec and the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec supporting agreed emission targets of greenhouse gases to reduce climate change while improving the quality of aquatic environments and sustaining biodiversity lindström and ruud 2017 implicitly necessitates a better understanding of how flows within regulated rivers can be used to sustain fish populations sweden a member state of the european union has approximately 1000 1200 water bodies including 670 km of regulated reaches johnsen et al 2011 that are affected by hydropower regulation hav 2015 eighty four percent of hydropower affected reaches are inhabited by salmonid species such as atlantic salmon salmo salar l and sea trout salmo trutta l species with both high socio economic interest and importance as indicator species for the quality of aquatic environments burger et al 2015 ignatius and haapasaari 2018 thus preserving sustainable populations of these species has an important political and management interest atlantic salmon has a complex life cycle requiring different habitat characteristics at different life stages bardonnet and baglinière 2000 armstrong et al 2003 reported challenges affecting atlantic salmon populations in swedish regulated rivers are related to anthropogenic migratory barriers such as hydropower dams habitat loss and flow regulation svensson 2000 rivinoja 2005 changes in water temperature due to regulation may also be an issue firstly salmon survival development and growth is bound by temperature thresholds secondly temperature affects fish migration spawning and egg hatching olden and naiman 2010 hydropower induced reduction in water flows during summer in combination with higher air temperature will influence the salmon growth phase while hydropower induced changes in winter temperature will affect fish energy storage and potential for starvation heggenes et al 2018 however temperature impacts in swedish regulated rivers may be reduced by the fact that they these rivers typically have hydropower systems with low elevation dams that create upstream impoundments with little storage capacity and therefore have less potential for storage induced temperature changes hydropower regulation may also cause reductions in water flow which will reduce the wetted area the surface area of the river channel that is covered by water and therefore reduce available salmon habitat if winter flows are lower than in the previous spawning season dewatering of spawning sites may lead to potential desiccation of eggs and stranding of juvenile salmon at spawning sites forseth and harby 2014 johnsen et al 2011 furthermore reductions in the magnitude and frequency of floods in regulated rivers may increase sand and silt deposition and reduce habitat quality barlaup et al 2008 which may reduce the survival and fitness of juvenile salmon beside negative effects hydro regulation may also positively impact salmon populations in some cases high winter flows due to high energy demand have been reported to increase the survival of juvenile salmon and thus positively impact salmon smolt production in regulated rivers johnsen et al 2011 in light of the impacts produced in rivers from hydropower plants the water framework directive wfd alongside recommendations from swedish national agencies e g swedish agency for marine and water management are driving the implementation of mitigation measures in swedish rivers regulated for hydropower lindström and ruud 2017 in some hydropower systems run of river impoundments may be owned by different hydropower companies and therefore cooperation and coordination between stakeholders is motivated by the implementation of mitigation measures mrc 2016 in recent years different methods have been developed to identify bottlenecks phenomena causing high mortality and having significant influence on fish population dynamics and to assist the decision making process for implementing mitigation measures forseth and harby 2014 published a guideline handbook for the diagnosis of bottlenecks and the design of mitigation measures in regulated salmon rivers the handbook includes a definition for hydrological bottleneck because flow determines the extent of wetted area and hydrological factors influence density dependent growth and survival rates see milner et al 2003 which are crucial to salmon populations for example a high flow will result in a large wetted area and fish will distribute over a large area with low densities however when flow decreases wetted area will be reduced fish densities will increase and density dependent mortality may occur models combining hydrological and hydrodynamic factors can support the identification of hydrological bottlenecks in addition the combination of these models with biological modelling to predict changes in salmon populations has shown their potential to address a wide variety of impacts and bottlenecks in salmon populations and their implications for mitigation measures hedger et al 2013a in this study we evaluate and identify bottlenecks that constrain an atlantic salmon population in a hydropower regulated river in northern sweden the ljungan river this study is based on a project collaboration between the county environment officer national authorities local and national ngo s and international research institutes the motivation for this study was stakeholder concern regarding low release flows and the potential effect on the salmon population in addition to an upcoming revision of the hydropower license which will include discussions concerning the establishment of a minimum flow the project was established with an adaptive management approach walters 1986 to ensure clear objectives involvement from affected stakeholders identification of bottlenecks for atlantic salmon and potential mitigation measures the overall objective of this study is to identify hydrological bottlenecks in salmon smolt production in ljungan river using an integrated approach in addition the effect on the salmon population of restoring spawning habitat as a mitigation measure is also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the ljungan river situated in northern sweden fig 1 the ljungan river is in total 399 km in length helcom 2011 and is regulated for hydropower production through a cascade of 15 run of river ror hydropower plants cascade systems are usually characterized by reservoirs with large storage capacity located at high altitude followed by a series of ror impoundments these systems provide an effective way to enhance water resources utilization maximize energy generation optimize the regional water allocation and mitigate possible flood events zhai et al 2017 shen et al 2018 ding et al 2018 the lowermost hydropower plant in the ljungan river is the viforsen power plant which has an installed capacity of 10 mw and an annual production of 79 gwh and was designed to reduce rapid flow changes from upstream power plants in the hydropower system there is a minimum flow of 20 m3 s 1 specified by law for an upstream hydropower plant but at viforsen power plant there is no minimum flow specified by law however based on preliminary results from this project a local agreement has been established to maintain when it is possible a downstream minimum flow of 30 m3 s 1 particularly during winter the annual average flow in the modelled reach in ljungan river is 138 m3 s 1 table 1 today the viforsen hydropower plant is the upstream barrier for anadromous fish species the modelled river reach in this study comprised the 17 km lowermost part of the river system between viforsen power plant and the estuary the stretch available for supporting anadromous fishes such as atlantic salmon the modelled river reach is dominated by glides and deep pools with intermittent riffles and rapids table 1 the modelled reach ranges from 40 to 280 m in width and has an average water depth of 3 m the river bed is characterized predominantly by gravel and cobbles but also has areas with sand and boulders the water normally has a high amount of humic substances originating from pine forest and marsh areas within the catchment which gives a brown colour to the water the ljungan river has a genetically unique baltic atlantic salmon population which is considered to be self sustaining helcom 2011 however the stock abundance estimated from annual electro fishing demonstrates large year to year variation ices 2015 other fish species in the ljungan river include sea trout salmo trutta l and grayling thymallus thymallus l among others 2 2 modelling approach the main modelling approach was based on an integrated method that combined hydrological hydraulic and ecological components initially presented in adeva bustos et al 2017 but further developed in this study to include lidar data as a basis for hydraulic modelling this integrated approach fig 2 applies the salmon population model ib salmon see hedger et al 2013a to calculate changes in smolt production as an indicator for changes in total salmon production in a selected river reach the approach in this project is built on the following steps 1 ib salmon was set up to simulate the atlantic salmon population under present day conditions 2 a series of hypothetical scenarios were established which were used to simulate new populations with the ib salmon model finally 3 the change in smolt production defined as percentage change from that produced under present day conditions for the different scenarios was analysed as discharge water temperature proportion of dewatered area spawning sites parr carrying capacity and number of eggs are physical and biological factors controlling smolt production in ib salmon evaluation of how these changed according to scenario allowed us to identify the bottlenecks that constrained the salmon population 2 2 1 ib salmon set up the atlantic salmon population was simulated using the individual based population model ib salmon see hedger et al 2013a for a description of the model design ib salmon is designed to simulate the response of atlantic salmon populations to changes in river discharge water temperature and hydro morphological characteristics ib salmon has been used to examine the effect of climate change hedger et al 2013b sundt hansen et al 2018 hydropeaking sauterleute et al 2016 hedger et al 2018 and changes in long term flow regimes and habitat modification adeva bustos et al 2017 the model simulates salmon population abundances across the salmon life cycle parr freshwater resident juveniles smolts salmon that are migrating to sea for the first time sea resident and returning adults processes in freshwater are modelled with a weekly time step across the modelled reach which is compartmentalized into 50 m long river sections parr abundance is initially dependent on parr recruitment which in turn is dependent on the spatial distribution and number of spawning sites the maximum biomass of parr supported per section is the product of the parr carrying capacity g m 2 of the section and its total wetted area which in turn is dependent on discharge when the maximum biomass of a section is exceeded excess parr migrate out of the section i e density dependent migration a proportion of these migrating parr die so density dependent mortality is an implicit part of the model for each section parr abundance was simulated at a weekly time step as a basis for calculation of annual smolt production model inputs were data on the atlantic salmon population used in estimating parr carrying capacity and in validating model results and data on the river habitat data on the juvenile atlantic salmon population were obtained from västernorrlands county abundance data for age 0 parr and age 1 4 parr were collected from electrofishing surveys at 14 sites within the ljungan river conducted in august october in the period 1988 2015 92 sample sites in total body length data were obtained from 5930 parr captured downstream of viforsen from 1988 to 2016 in august n 884 september n 4116 and october n 930 body lengths showed a bimodal distribution corresponding to 0 age group length 95 mm and 1 2 age group length 95 mm parr abundances and body lengths simulated by the model were compared with those observed using mann whitney u tests to validate the model simulation physical habitat data were obtained from surveys conducted by uni research in 2014 skoglund et al 2015 habitat data used in the population model included the spatial distribution of spawning sites which controlled the recruitment of parr and the spatial distribution of shelter a key determinant of parr carrying capacity see foldvik et al 2017 the parr carrying capacity of each section was calculated by i establishing a relationship between observed maximum parr biomass from electrofishing data and shelter density and ii applying this relationship throughout the watercourse from electrofishing data the maximum total biomass of parr at each station was determined this was considered to be a conservative estimate of the biomass that each station could support using data on shelter density for each section carrying capacity was assigned to all sections in the river based on their respective shelter densities derived from skoglund et al 2015 2 2 2 scenario set up the scenario specific inputs needed in ib salmon were discharge temperature wetted area and spawning habitat availability temperature and wetted areas changes were modelled using hypothetical discharges and spawning habitat availability was dependent on wetted areas changes 2 2 2 1 discharge and temperature the weekly average discharge calculated from observed discharge data from ljungan river for the period 1982 2015 provided by statkraft ab sweden was used for the generation of river discharge scenarios the one day minimum flow registered was 19 m3 s 1 during summer and 40 m3 s 1 during winter as the chief objective was to identify potential hydrological bottlenecks related to salmon production within the context of the established minimum flow agreement of 30 m3 s 1 downstream of viforsen five hypothetical scenario groups were created fig 3 based on the following criteria i baseline defined as the weekly average discharge and used for comparison to the other scenarios ii historical defined as unregulated flow conditions obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi 2018 iii summer 30 the hypothetical case of releasing the minimum flow during summer iv winter 30 the hypothetical case of releasing the minimum flow during winter and v summer 19 the hypothetical case of releasing a flow during summer of 19 m3 s 1 equivalent to the minimum flow that has been observed during summer in order to reduce stochasticity from the biological model each discharge scenarios used the same intra annual discharge pattern for every year of the simulation water temperatures were dependent on discharge scenarios air2stream a hybrid statistical physical model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 that included a lumped heat budget model was used to model the water temperatures based on the given discharge scenario input data on air temperature from a gauge at sundsvall airport 2202 råsta was provided by the swedish transport administration trafikverket 2018 adjustments were made based on linear regression for low summer flows not occurring in the calibration data 2 2 2 2 wetted area changes and spawning location a hydraulic model was set up for the modelled river stretch to evaluate changes in wetted area and the possible dewatered areas the hydraulic model includes 340 cross sections for use in the hydrodynamic model hec ras 5 0 hec 2016 the cross sections were extracted from a digital elevation model dem using hec georas 4 3 in arcgis 10 5 esri 2016 with a mean distance between transects of 50 m corresponding to the resolution of the ib salmon model the bathymetry data used to construct the dem were derived from an airborne lidar bathymetry alb survey carried out with the riegl vq 880 g scanner riegl 2014 on september 2nd 2015 the lidar data had an accuracy of 0 07 m for planar coordinates and a mean vertical accuracy of 0 03 0 04 m alne 2016 as the alb technique is sensitive to dissolved organic material and air bubbles water column areas with no information may occur alne 2016 therefore areas lacking bathymetry data were mapped using a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler profiler adcp sontek 2016 bathymetry data from the lidar and the adcp were combined to produce the final dem using an empirical bayesian kriging interpolation method in arcgis changes in wetted area were simulated using a 1d modelling approach with the selected discharge scenarios used as the upstream boundary condition and normal depth used as the downstream boundary condition changes in the wetted area were obtained from the model at each cross section for the eight discharge scenarios validation of the model was done by calibrating the observed water line from lidar data with the simulated water line in the model from hec ras 1d dewatered areas and potential dewatered spawning sites were identified using a quasi 2d model created from post processing of the hydrodynamic results in hec georas 4 3 in order to simulate the effect of spawning site availability four spawning site conditions were combined with the discharge scenario groups fig 4 present newspawn dewatered and new sp dew the present day spatial distribution of atlantic salmon spawning areas identified by the river survey conducted by uni research was included in the ib salmon model as the present condition the newspawn condition was based on the present condition but had an additional four restored spawning sites involving an increase in spawning area of 11 the dewatered condition involved certain spawning sites being rendered ineffective due to desiccation of the spawning site centres during low discharge existing and restored spawning areas were evaluated in each discharge scenario to identify those that were dewatered between spawning and egg hatching using a quasi 2d model created from post processing of the hydrodynamic results in hec georas 4 3 the dewatered situation was included in all discharge scenarios except the baseline scenario group where winter flows were higher than during the spawning season and the summer 19 and summer 30 scenario group where eggs had hatched by the time the conditions of these scenarios would have applied finally the new spdew condition including the four new spawning sites from the newspawn condition but also considered those that were dewatered from the dewatered condition 2 2 3 parameterising ib salmon outputs from scenarios were used as inputs in the ib salmon population model population dynamics were simulated for 34 years corresponding to the number of years of available discharge data in the baseline present scenario to obtain a full age distribution of spawning adults in the model the first ten years of each simulation were used as a burn in period and the latter 24 years were used to analyse the smolt production under the different scenarios smolt production from the hypothetical scenarios were compared with that of the baseline present scenario average observed flow scenario under present day spawning to determine the relative effects of the scenario conditions 3 results 3 1 simulated population validation the salmon population model simulated a population abundance that was similar to that observed for both 0 parr mann whitney u test w 223 p 0 87 and 1 4 parr mann whitney u test w 148 p 0 08 fig 5 left panel the salmon population model also generated similar body length distributions to those observed fig 5 right panel with 0 parr being approximately 65 70 mm in length and 1 2 parr being approximately 120 135 mm however there were marginally significant differences between simulated and observed lengths 0 parr w 117 p value 0 011 1 2 parr w 310 p value 0 016 3 2 hec ras model calibration simulated water surface elevations showed strong agreement with those observed from the water line on the day of the alb survey indicating that the model was valid to simulate the alternative scenarios fig 6 mean vertical errors were 0 13 m and 0 14 m for the left and right bank respectively with a minimum and maximum vertical error of 0 001 0 9 m for both banks calculated without outliers 3 3 wetted area changes and dewatering of spawning sites little reduction in wetted area occurred until the river discharge fell below 110 m3 s 1 in addition all spawning sites were covered at a discharge of 110 m3 s 1 therefore a discharge of 110 m3 s 1 was used for the comparison of results regarding wetted area change and dewatering of spawning sites reducing discharge below this caused a decrease in wetted area and a consequent increase in dewatered spawning habitat fig 7 below a discharge of 20 m3 s 1 wetted area was reduced by 35 and spawning sites were reduced by 25 the four new spawning sites were found to be covered in all the discharge scenarios 3 4 changes in smolt production all scenarios under the present spawning condition showed lower smolt production compared with baseline present scenario average observed flow scenario under present day spawning fig 8 four scenarios showed higher smolt production than the baseline present scenario baseline newspawn historical new sp dew summer 19 newspawn and summer 30 newspawn no scenario showed higher production than baseline newspawn which produced 20 more smolts than baseline present scenarios with lower average smolt production for the modelled river stretch also had lower smolt production per 50 m section see fig 9 showing the two scenarios with lowest production winter 30 and summer 19 and the baseline scenario results for summer 19 and winter 30 showed a general reduction in wetted area and in smolt production per section fig 9 compared with baseline scenario comparison of the three scenarios under present conditions for spawning sites showed that some sections under the baseline present scenario were more productive than under summer 19 and winter 30 present scenarios smolt production was greater in scenarios with additional spawning sites summer 19 newspawn and winter 30 new sp dew than in the respective scenarios without additional sites summer 19 present and winter 30 present however both scenarios summer 19 newspawn and winter 30 new sp dew showed lower smolt production than the baseline scenario with new spawning sites baseline newspawn differences between smolt production under winter 30 present and winter 30 dewatered spawning conditions exhibited the effect of dewatering spawning areas being implemented showing areas with no production under winter 30 dewatered compared with winter 30 present 3 5 effect of temperature on salmon smolt production the simulated age distribution of smolts was scenario specific scenario groups summer 19 and summer 30 with lower discharges and therefore high temperature in summer compared with the baseline scenario caused smoltification at a younger age and a resulting increase in the percentage of parr smoltifying as age group 1 or 2 rather than at older age groups fig 10 the smolt age distribution did not depend on whether spawning habitat improvement had been made 4 discussion potential bottlenecks and the effect of restoring spawning sites were evaluated based on changes in smolt production obtained under different hydropower production scenarios results indicated that a low winter discharge 30 m3 s 1 could be the most critical bottleneck for smolt production in the ljungan river due to a significant increase in dewatered spawning sites it is important to notice that the hypothetical scenario in which the agreed minimum flow is released during winter is unlikely to happen considering past and current operational releases however results from low summer flows which have been observed indicated that reduced flow in summer is also a bottleneck for the smolt production results also indicate that low summer flows in combination with high water temperatures may lead to reduced smolt age and thus could increase smolt production in the absence of other limiting factors such as wetted area in addition restoration of spawning sites as a mitigating action in regulated rivers can compensate for the potential negative effect of dewatered areas in spawning sites and be of vital importance in mitigating the effects from low discharges the 1d hydrodynamic model simulated water surface elevations that fitted those observed indicating a robust hydraulic modelling of wetted area key input data for the salmon population model one dimensional models have also been shown to be computational efficient when large areas needs to be modelled for a range of river discharges producing accurate results especially for wetted areas and water depths benjankar et al 2015 supporting our work further the quasi 2d model used in this study to evaluate dewatered spawning sites was shown to adequately predict dewatered areas the results were also corroborated in stakeholder meetings confirming both human perceptions and actual measured observations based on this the integrated approach has shown the potential to adequately predict salmon population abundance and hydraulic conditions model results demonstrated a sharp decrease in wetted areas during flows less than 30 m3 s 1 under these conditions the proportion of dewatered spawning sites increased meaning that the minimum flow of 30 m3 s 1 specified for the river is adequate and should be maintained in order to preserve sustainable populations of atlantic salmon a reduction in wetted area of 30 under winter 30 present decreased smolt production by 17 the same percentage reduction in wetted area 30 decreased smolt production for summer 30 present scenario by only 8 despite winter flows showing a lowered smolt production scenarios with 19 m3 s 1 and 30 m3 s 1 discharge during summer also reduced smolt production therefore winter and summer low flows might be considered as the two most important hydrological bottlenecks in ljungan river which is in agreement with forseth and harby 2014 and the results from adeva bustos et al 2017 the findings of the current study can be explained by the increase in juvenile density dependent mortality as a function of reduction in wetted area in the ib salmon model see hedger et al 2013a forseth and harby 2014 also identified winter and summer wetted area as a factor influencing salmon population abundance at the same time comparing the historical scenario group with the baseline scenario group showed that an increase in the winter discharge due to regulation could result in increased wetted area and reduced juvenile mortality these results are in agreement with johnsen et al 2011 who reported higher juvenile survival from higher and more stables winter flows in a norwegian regulated river allowing for the dewatered spawning sites in winter 30 dewatered resulted in a reduction of smolt production by 30 this is related to the number of spawning sites being dewatered with a modelled minimum discharge of 30 m3 s 1 it is important to highlight however that groundwater effects on egg survival reported in previous studies see casas mulet et al 2015 and salveit et al 2001 were not considered in this study forseth and harby 2014 indicated that a 7 day period with a minimum winter flow lower than the flow during the previous year s spawning period may be a bottleneck for the salmon population in some years of the observed discharge regime of the ljungan river 7 day minimum flows in winter showed lower discharges than the previous spawning season so this is a potential bottleneck reducing the flow during the spawning season to the minimum flow level during winter may therefore be an efficient mitigation measure to reduce mortality on eggs and the early life stage of salmonids see casas mulet et al 2016 lower river discharges also increased water temperature parr body mass growth was positively related with temperature and given that a critical body size was required for smoltification higher temperatures led to earlier smoltification with a consequent skewing of the parr age distribution to being composed of younger parr this is consistent with the findings of sundt hansen et al 2018 results in this study do not show large differences among the two summer scenario groups which could be explained by the negligible temperature differences 0 2 c between them temperature increases in summer between summer scenario groups summer 19 and summer 30 over those of the baseline scenario group were approximately 3 c increased temperatures could result in a shorter total period of parr density dependent mortality between parr recruitment and smoltification and thus could lead to higher smolt production however this effect can be cancelled out by the mortality produced by reduction in wetted areas as described by sundt hansen et al 2018 restoration of spawning sites are conventional compensation actions in regulated river systems such work has been demonstrated to be effective even under suboptimal depth and velocity conditions in five norwegian rivers barlaup et al 2008 and is widely applied from a cost benefit approach in ljungan river the hydrological bottlenecks identified under critical flows can be mitigated by restoring spawning sites the increase in total spawning area resulted in elevated smolt production compared to the baseline scenario group this indicates that the availability of spawning sites can be a limiting factor for the population following the adaptive management approach with a focus on objectives actions monitoring and evaluating future monitoring in the ljungan river will allow the evaluation of the efficiency of adding spawning sites based on experimental data total smolt production under the baseline newspawn scenario was 21 000 smolts similar to the 20 000 smolts predicted by uusitalo et al 2005 using a probabilistic salmon production capacity model built on expert knowledge suggesting that the addition of spawning sites is an effective method of maximizing production our study also supports the importance of involving stakeholders with valuable local knowledge about the river in the planning phase considering mitigation measures and adapting these to specific discharge levels to avoid dewatering in low flow conditions the addition of spawning sites may have positive effects on salmon production while dewatering may have negative effects however salmon production may also be affected by other factors such as the spatial configuration of river habitat characteristics kocik and ferreri 1998 poff and huryn 1998 kim and lapointe 2011 in our model dewatered areas in low discharges were found in segments with a wide range of salmon production potential new spawning sites were added in segments classified as areas with moderate to large production potential however this classification could change when the spatial configuration of dewatered areas and new spawning sites is considered potential bottlenecks arising from a lack of spatial connection between spawning habitat which would provide initial parr recruitment and habitat with a high parr carrying capacity which could potentially be dewatered were simulated since the model implicitly simulates spatial processes via the density dependent emigration of parr from areas of high parr abundance this study contributes to the understanding of the constraints affecting an atlantic salmon population in a swedish regulated river system it demonstrates the potential of using an integrating modelling approach that combines physical and biological components to identify possible bottlenecks and predict the effects of implementing mitigation measures furthermore the cooperation between the stakeholders group formed by the hydropower company the county officer national authorities local and national ngo s and research institutes has benefitted the analyses in this study providing useful inputs and data the importance of involving stakeholders at an early stage in projects related to river restoration and preservation of environmental conditions is of vital importance and a success key both from a perception point of view and from the value of incorporating local knowledge the implementation of modelling scenarios conducted in this study could also be of benefit for hydropower mitigation measures and other projects requiring evaluation as an alternative to long term and costly monitoring studies 5 conclusion in this study low winter and summer discharges were identified as key hydrological bottlenecks because they reduced wetted area and increased juvenile atlantic salmon density dependent mortality in addition winter low flows reduced juvenile atlantic salmon recruitment via dewatering of spawning sites the presently agreed upon specified minimum flow in ljungan river 30 m3 s 1 was shown to be the critical flow in our analyses and special attention should be paid to summer low flows to avoid flows below 30 m3 s 1 this study has shown the potential of integrating modelling tools including a salmon population model and a hydraulic model to investigate the response of a salmon population to modifications of discharge and spawning habitat this approach can aid in identifying bottlenecks affecting fish populations and provide support for decisions on environmental mitigation measures the method was developed for a specific river in this study but could be applied to other regulated rivers to investigate possible bottlenecks for atlantic salmon populations and to predict the effect of implementing mitigation measures acknowledgements this work was

26149,flow regime alterations from hydropower regulation may impact fish populations impacts can be characterized using methods for mapping bottlenecks for different species life stages improving the understanding of such bottlenecks could provide a basis for mitigation measures an integrated modelling approach coupling a salmon population model ib salmon a hydraulic 1d model hec ras and a temperature model air2stream was used to identify the bottlenecks constraining the salmon population in a hydro regulated river ljungan river sweden this integrated approach evaluated changes in the salmon population under different low flow scenarios involving potential dewatering of spawning sites and the effect of restored spawning sites model results demonstrated that low discharges in winter and summer were potential hydrological bottlenecks for the salmon population particularly in winter due to potential dewatering of spawning sites restoration of spawning sites increased salmon production under all scenarios posing a potential counter measure against low flows 1 introduction hydropower production in northern europe has an important and stabilizing role in the current and future nordic energy system and the green shift toward european renewable energies oecd iea 2013 in 2016 the total installed capacity for hydropower in sweden was 16 200 mw with an average annual production of 66 twh flood 2015 accounting for approximately half of the country s energy consumption shares in the energy system from swedish and norwegian hydropower play an important role in supporting decarbonisation in the nordic countries oecd iea 2013 the implementation of european legislation such as the renewable energy directive 2009 28 ec and the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec supporting agreed emission targets of greenhouse gases to reduce climate change while improving the quality of aquatic environments and sustaining biodiversity lindström and ruud 2017 implicitly necessitates a better understanding of how flows within regulated rivers can be used to sustain fish populations sweden a member state of the european union has approximately 1000 1200 water bodies including 670 km of regulated reaches johnsen et al 2011 that are affected by hydropower regulation hav 2015 eighty four percent of hydropower affected reaches are inhabited by salmonid species such as atlantic salmon salmo salar l and sea trout salmo trutta l species with both high socio economic interest and importance as indicator species for the quality of aquatic environments burger et al 2015 ignatius and haapasaari 2018 thus preserving sustainable populations of these species has an important political and management interest atlantic salmon has a complex life cycle requiring different habitat characteristics at different life stages bardonnet and baglinière 2000 armstrong et al 2003 reported challenges affecting atlantic salmon populations in swedish regulated rivers are related to anthropogenic migratory barriers such as hydropower dams habitat loss and flow regulation svensson 2000 rivinoja 2005 changes in water temperature due to regulation may also be an issue firstly salmon survival development and growth is bound by temperature thresholds secondly temperature affects fish migration spawning and egg hatching olden and naiman 2010 hydropower induced reduction in water flows during summer in combination with higher air temperature will influence the salmon growth phase while hydropower induced changes in winter temperature will affect fish energy storage and potential for starvation heggenes et al 2018 however temperature impacts in swedish regulated rivers may be reduced by the fact that they these rivers typically have hydropower systems with low elevation dams that create upstream impoundments with little storage capacity and therefore have less potential for storage induced temperature changes hydropower regulation may also cause reductions in water flow which will reduce the wetted area the surface area of the river channel that is covered by water and therefore reduce available salmon habitat if winter flows are lower than in the previous spawning season dewatering of spawning sites may lead to potential desiccation of eggs and stranding of juvenile salmon at spawning sites forseth and harby 2014 johnsen et al 2011 furthermore reductions in the magnitude and frequency of floods in regulated rivers may increase sand and silt deposition and reduce habitat quality barlaup et al 2008 which may reduce the survival and fitness of juvenile salmon beside negative effects hydro regulation may also positively impact salmon populations in some cases high winter flows due to high energy demand have been reported to increase the survival of juvenile salmon and thus positively impact salmon smolt production in regulated rivers johnsen et al 2011 in light of the impacts produced in rivers from hydropower plants the water framework directive wfd alongside recommendations from swedish national agencies e g swedish agency for marine and water management are driving the implementation of mitigation measures in swedish rivers regulated for hydropower lindström and ruud 2017 in some hydropower systems run of river impoundments may be owned by different hydropower companies and therefore cooperation and coordination between stakeholders is motivated by the implementation of mitigation measures mrc 2016 in recent years different methods have been developed to identify bottlenecks phenomena causing high mortality and having significant influence on fish population dynamics and to assist the decision making process for implementing mitigation measures forseth and harby 2014 published a guideline handbook for the diagnosis of bottlenecks and the design of mitigation measures in regulated salmon rivers the handbook includes a definition for hydrological bottleneck because flow determines the extent of wetted area and hydrological factors influence density dependent growth and survival rates see milner et al 2003 which are crucial to salmon populations for example a high flow will result in a large wetted area and fish will distribute over a large area with low densities however when flow decreases wetted area will be reduced fish densities will increase and density dependent mortality may occur models combining hydrological and hydrodynamic factors can support the identification of hydrological bottlenecks in addition the combination of these models with biological modelling to predict changes in salmon populations has shown their potential to address a wide variety of impacts and bottlenecks in salmon populations and their implications for mitigation measures hedger et al 2013a in this study we evaluate and identify bottlenecks that constrain an atlantic salmon population in a hydropower regulated river in northern sweden the ljungan river this study is based on a project collaboration between the county environment officer national authorities local and national ngo s and international research institutes the motivation for this study was stakeholder concern regarding low release flows and the potential effect on the salmon population in addition to an upcoming revision of the hydropower license which will include discussions concerning the establishment of a minimum flow the project was established with an adaptive management approach walters 1986 to ensure clear objectives involvement from affected stakeholders identification of bottlenecks for atlantic salmon and potential mitigation measures the overall objective of this study is to identify hydrological bottlenecks in salmon smolt production in ljungan river using an integrated approach in addition the effect on the salmon population of restoring spawning habitat as a mitigation measure is also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the ljungan river situated in northern sweden fig 1 the ljungan river is in total 399 km in length helcom 2011 and is regulated for hydropower production through a cascade of 15 run of river ror hydropower plants cascade systems are usually characterized by reservoirs with large storage capacity located at high altitude followed by a series of ror impoundments these systems provide an effective way to enhance water resources utilization maximize energy generation optimize the regional water allocation and mitigate possible flood events zhai et al 2017 shen et al 2018 ding et al 2018 the lowermost hydropower plant in the ljungan river is the viforsen power plant which has an installed capacity of 10 mw and an annual production of 79 gwh and was designed to reduce rapid flow changes from upstream power plants in the hydropower system there is a minimum flow of 20 m3 s 1 specified by law for an upstream hydropower plant but at viforsen power plant there is no minimum flow specified by law however based on preliminary results from this project a local agreement has been established to maintain when it is possible a downstream minimum flow of 30 m3 s 1 particularly during winter the annual average flow in the modelled reach in ljungan river is 138 m3 s 1 table 1 today the viforsen hydropower plant is the upstream barrier for anadromous fish species the modelled river reach in this study comprised the 17 km lowermost part of the river system between viforsen power plant and the estuary the stretch available for supporting anadromous fishes such as atlantic salmon the modelled river reach is dominated by glides and deep pools with intermittent riffles and rapids table 1 the modelled reach ranges from 40 to 280 m in width and has an average water depth of 3 m the river bed is characterized predominantly by gravel and cobbles but also has areas with sand and boulders the water normally has a high amount of humic substances originating from pine forest and marsh areas within the catchment which gives a brown colour to the water the ljungan river has a genetically unique baltic atlantic salmon population which is considered to be self sustaining helcom 2011 however the stock abundance estimated from annual electro fishing demonstrates large year to year variation ices 2015 other fish species in the ljungan river include sea trout salmo trutta l and grayling thymallus thymallus l among others 2 2 modelling approach the main modelling approach was based on an integrated method that combined hydrological hydraulic and ecological components initially presented in adeva bustos et al 2017 but further developed in this study to include lidar data as a basis for hydraulic modelling this integrated approach fig 2 applies the salmon population model ib salmon see hedger et al 2013a to calculate changes in smolt production as an indicator for changes in total salmon production in a selected river reach the approach in this project is built on the following steps 1 ib salmon was set up to simulate the atlantic salmon population under present day conditions 2 a series of hypothetical scenarios were established which were used to simulate new populations with the ib salmon model finally 3 the change in smolt production defined as percentage change from that produced under present day conditions for the different scenarios was analysed as discharge water temperature proportion of dewatered area spawning sites parr carrying capacity and number of eggs are physical and biological factors controlling smolt production in ib salmon evaluation of how these changed according to scenario allowed us to identify the bottlenecks that constrained the salmon population 2 2 1 ib salmon set up the atlantic salmon population was simulated using the individual based population model ib salmon see hedger et al 2013a for a description of the model design ib salmon is designed to simulate the response of atlantic salmon populations to changes in river discharge water temperature and hydro morphological characteristics ib salmon has been used to examine the effect of climate change hedger et al 2013b sundt hansen et al 2018 hydropeaking sauterleute et al 2016 hedger et al 2018 and changes in long term flow regimes and habitat modification adeva bustos et al 2017 the model simulates salmon population abundances across the salmon life cycle parr freshwater resident juveniles smolts salmon that are migrating to sea for the first time sea resident and returning adults processes in freshwater are modelled with a weekly time step across the modelled reach which is compartmentalized into 50 m long river sections parr abundance is initially dependent on parr recruitment which in turn is dependent on the spatial distribution and number of spawning sites the maximum biomass of parr supported per section is the product of the parr carrying capacity g m 2 of the section and its total wetted area which in turn is dependent on discharge when the maximum biomass of a section is exceeded excess parr migrate out of the section i e density dependent migration a proportion of these migrating parr die so density dependent mortality is an implicit part of the model for each section parr abundance was simulated at a weekly time step as a basis for calculation of annual smolt production model inputs were data on the atlantic salmon population used in estimating parr carrying capacity and in validating model results and data on the river habitat data on the juvenile atlantic salmon population were obtained from västernorrlands county abundance data for age 0 parr and age 1 4 parr were collected from electrofishing surveys at 14 sites within the ljungan river conducted in august october in the period 1988 2015 92 sample sites in total body length data were obtained from 5930 parr captured downstream of viforsen from 1988 to 2016 in august n 884 september n 4116 and october n 930 body lengths showed a bimodal distribution corresponding to 0 age group length 95 mm and 1 2 age group length 95 mm parr abundances and body lengths simulated by the model were compared with those observed using mann whitney u tests to validate the model simulation physical habitat data were obtained from surveys conducted by uni research in 2014 skoglund et al 2015 habitat data used in the population model included the spatial distribution of spawning sites which controlled the recruitment of parr and the spatial distribution of shelter a key determinant of parr carrying capacity see foldvik et al 2017 the parr carrying capacity of each section was calculated by i establishing a relationship between observed maximum parr biomass from electrofishing data and shelter density and ii applying this relationship throughout the watercourse from electrofishing data the maximum total biomass of parr at each station was determined this was considered to be a conservative estimate of the biomass that each station could support using data on shelter density for each section carrying capacity was assigned to all sections in the river based on their respective shelter densities derived from skoglund et al 2015 2 2 2 scenario set up the scenario specific inputs needed in ib salmon were discharge temperature wetted area and spawning habitat availability temperature and wetted areas changes were modelled using hypothetical discharges and spawning habitat availability was dependent on wetted areas changes 2 2 2 1 discharge and temperature the weekly average discharge calculated from observed discharge data from ljungan river for the period 1982 2015 provided by statkraft ab sweden was used for the generation of river discharge scenarios the one day minimum flow registered was 19 m3 s 1 during summer and 40 m3 s 1 during winter as the chief objective was to identify potential hydrological bottlenecks related to salmon production within the context of the established minimum flow agreement of 30 m3 s 1 downstream of viforsen five hypothetical scenario groups were created fig 3 based on the following criteria i baseline defined as the weekly average discharge and used for comparison to the other scenarios ii historical defined as unregulated flow conditions obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi 2018 iii summer 30 the hypothetical case of releasing the minimum flow during summer iv winter 30 the hypothetical case of releasing the minimum flow during winter and v summer 19 the hypothetical case of releasing a flow during summer of 19 m3 s 1 equivalent to the minimum flow that has been observed during summer in order to reduce stochasticity from the biological model each discharge scenarios used the same intra annual discharge pattern for every year of the simulation water temperatures were dependent on discharge scenarios air2stream a hybrid statistical physical model toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 that included a lumped heat budget model was used to model the water temperatures based on the given discharge scenario input data on air temperature from a gauge at sundsvall airport 2202 råsta was provided by the swedish transport administration trafikverket 2018 adjustments were made based on linear regression for low summer flows not occurring in the calibration data 2 2 2 2 wetted area changes and spawning location a hydraulic model was set up for the modelled river stretch to evaluate changes in wetted area and the possible dewatered areas the hydraulic model includes 340 cross sections for use in the hydrodynamic model hec ras 5 0 hec 2016 the cross sections were extracted from a digital elevation model dem using hec georas 4 3 in arcgis 10 5 esri 2016 with a mean distance between transects of 50 m corresponding to the resolution of the ib salmon model the bathymetry data used to construct the dem were derived from an airborne lidar bathymetry alb survey carried out with the riegl vq 880 g scanner riegl 2014 on september 2nd 2015 the lidar data had an accuracy of 0 07 m for planar coordinates and a mean vertical accuracy of 0 03 0 04 m alne 2016 as the alb technique is sensitive to dissolved organic material and air bubbles water column areas with no information may occur alne 2016 therefore areas lacking bathymetry data were mapped using a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler profiler adcp sontek 2016 bathymetry data from the lidar and the adcp were combined to produce the final dem using an empirical bayesian kriging interpolation method in arcgis changes in wetted area were simulated using a 1d modelling approach with the selected discharge scenarios used as the upstream boundary condition and normal depth used as the downstream boundary condition changes in the wetted area were obtained from the model at each cross section for the eight discharge scenarios validation of the model was done by calibrating the observed water line from lidar data with the simulated water line in the model from hec ras 1d dewatered areas and potential dewatered spawning sites were identified using a quasi 2d model created from post processing of the hydrodynamic results in hec georas 4 3 in order to simulate the effect of spawning site availability four spawning site conditions were combined with the discharge scenario groups fig 4 present newspawn dewatered and new sp dew the present day spatial distribution of atlantic salmon spawning areas identified by the river survey conducted by uni research was included in the ib salmon model as the present condition the newspawn condition was based on the present condition but had an additional four restored spawning sites involving an increase in spawning area of 11 the dewatered condition involved certain spawning sites being rendered ineffective due to desiccation of the spawning site centres during low discharge existing and restored spawning areas were evaluated in each discharge scenario to identify those that were dewatered between spawning and egg hatching using a quasi 2d model created from post processing of the hydrodynamic results in hec georas 4 3 the dewatered situation was included in all discharge scenarios except the baseline scenario group where winter flows were higher than during the spawning season and the summer 19 and summer 30 scenario group where eggs had hatched by the time the conditions of these scenarios would have applied finally the new spdew condition including the four new spawning sites from the newspawn condition but also considered those that were dewatered from the dewatered condition 2 2 3 parameterising ib salmon outputs from scenarios were used as inputs in the ib salmon population model population dynamics were simulated for 34 years corresponding to the number of years of available discharge data in the baseline present scenario to obtain a full age distribution of spawning adults in the model the first ten years of each simulation were used as a burn in period and the latter 24 years were used to analyse the smolt production under the different scenarios smolt production from the hypothetical scenarios were compared with that of the baseline present scenario average observed flow scenario under present day spawning to determine the relative effects of the scenario conditions 3 results 3 1 simulated population validation the salmon population model simulated a population abundance that was similar to that observed for both 0 parr mann whitney u test w 223 p 0 87 and 1 4 parr mann whitney u test w 148 p 0 08 fig 5 left panel the salmon population model also generated similar body length distributions to those observed fig 5 right panel with 0 parr being approximately 65 70 mm in length and 1 2 parr being approximately 120 135 mm however there were marginally significant differences between simulated and observed lengths 0 parr w 117 p value 0 011 1 2 parr w 310 p value 0 016 3 2 hec ras model calibration simulated water surface elevations showed strong agreement with those observed from the water line on the day of the alb survey indicating that the model was valid to simulate the alternative scenarios fig 6 mean vertical errors were 0 13 m and 0 14 m for the left and right bank respectively with a minimum and maximum vertical error of 0 001 0 9 m for both banks calculated without outliers 3 3 wetted area changes and dewatering of spawning sites little reduction in wetted area occurred until the river discharge fell below 110 m3 s 1 in addition all spawning sites were covered at a discharge of 110 m3 s 1 therefore a discharge of 110 m3 s 1 was used for the comparison of results regarding wetted area change and dewatering of spawning sites reducing discharge below this caused a decrease in wetted area and a consequent increase in dewatered spawning habitat fig 7 below a discharge of 20 m3 s 1 wetted area was reduced by 35 and spawning sites were reduced by 25 the four new spawning sites were found to be covered in all the discharge scenarios 3 4 changes in smolt production all scenarios under the present spawning condition showed lower smolt production compared with baseline present scenario average observed flow scenario under present day spawning fig 8 four scenarios showed higher smolt production than the baseline present scenario baseline newspawn historical new sp dew summer 19 newspawn and summer 30 newspawn no scenario showed higher production than baseline newspawn which produced 20 more smolts than baseline present scenarios with lower average smolt production for the modelled river stretch also had lower smolt production per 50 m section see fig 9 showing the two scenarios with lowest production winter 30 and summer 19 and the baseline scenario results for summer 19 and winter 30 showed a general reduction in wetted area and in smolt production per section fig 9 compared with baseline scenario comparison of the three scenarios under present conditions for spawning sites showed that some sections under the baseline present scenario were more productive than under summer 19 and winter 30 present scenarios smolt production was greater in scenarios with additional spawning sites summer 19 newspawn and winter 30 new sp dew than in the respective scenarios without additional sites summer 19 present and winter 30 present however both scenarios summer 19 newspawn and winter 30 new sp dew showed lower smolt production than the baseline scenario with new spawning sites baseline newspawn differences between smolt production under winter 30 present and winter 30 dewatered spawning conditions exhibited the effect of dewatering spawning areas being implemented showing areas with no production under winter 30 dewatered compared with winter 30 present 3 5 effect of temperature on salmon smolt production the simulated age distribution of smolts was scenario specific scenario groups summer 19 and summer 30 with lower discharges and therefore high temperature in summer compared with the baseline scenario caused smoltification at a younger age and a resulting increase in the percentage of parr smoltifying as age group 1 or 2 rather than at older age groups fig 10 the smolt age distribution did not depend on whether spawning habitat improvement had been made 4 discussion potential bottlenecks and the effect of restoring spawning sites were evaluated based on changes in smolt production obtained under different hydropower production scenarios results indicated that a low winter discharge 30 m3 s 1 could be the most critical bottleneck for smolt production in the ljungan river due to a significant increase in dewatered spawning sites it is important to notice that the hypothetical scenario in which the agreed minimum flow is released during winter is unlikely to happen considering past and current operational releases however results from low summer flows which have been observed indicated that reduced flow in summer is also a bottleneck for the smolt production results also indicate that low summer flows in combination with high water temperatures may lead to reduced smolt age and thus could increase smolt production in the absence of other limiting factors such as wetted area in addition restoration of spawning sites as a mitigating action in regulated rivers can compensate for the potential negative effect of dewatered areas in spawning sites and be of vital importance in mitigating the effects from low discharges the 1d hydrodynamic model simulated water surface elevations that fitted those observed indicating a robust hydraulic modelling of wetted area key input data for the salmon population model one dimensional models have also been shown to be computational efficient when large areas needs to be modelled for a range of river discharges producing accurate results especially for wetted areas and water depths benjankar et al 2015 supporting our work further the quasi 2d model used in this study to evaluate dewatered spawning sites was shown to adequately predict dewatered areas the results were also corroborated in stakeholder meetings confirming both human perceptions and actual measured observations based on this the integrated approach has shown the potential to adequately predict salmon population abundance and hydraulic conditions model results demonstrated a sharp decrease in wetted areas during flows less than 30 m3 s 1 under these conditions the proportion of dewatered spawning sites increased meaning that the minimum flow of 30 m3 s 1 specified for the river is adequate and should be maintained in order to preserve sustainable populations of atlantic salmon a reduction in wetted area of 30 under winter 30 present decreased smolt production by 17 the same percentage reduction in wetted area 30 decreased smolt production for summer 30 present scenario by only 8 despite winter flows showing a lowered smolt production scenarios with 19 m3 s 1 and 30 m3 s 1 discharge during summer also reduced smolt production therefore winter and summer low flows might be considered as the two most important hydrological bottlenecks in ljungan river which is in agreement with forseth and harby 2014 and the results from adeva bustos et al 2017 the findings of the current study can be explained by the increase in juvenile density dependent mortality as a function of reduction in wetted area in the ib salmon model see hedger et al 2013a forseth and harby 2014 also identified winter and summer wetted area as a factor influencing salmon population abundance at the same time comparing the historical scenario group with the baseline scenario group showed that an increase in the winter discharge due to regulation could result in increased wetted area and reduced juvenile mortality these results are in agreement with johnsen et al 2011 who reported higher juvenile survival from higher and more stables winter flows in a norwegian regulated river allowing for the dewatered spawning sites in winter 30 dewatered resulted in a reduction of smolt production by 30 this is related to the number of spawning sites being dewatered with a modelled minimum discharge of 30 m3 s 1 it is important to highlight however that groundwater effects on egg survival reported in previous studies see casas mulet et al 2015 and salveit et al 2001 were not considered in this study forseth and harby 2014 indicated that a 7 day period with a minimum winter flow lower than the flow during the previous year s spawning period may be a bottleneck for the salmon population in some years of the observed discharge regime of the ljungan river 7 day minimum flows in winter showed lower discharges than the previous spawning season so this is a potential bottleneck reducing the flow during the spawning season to the minimum flow level during winter may therefore be an efficient mitigation measure to reduce mortality on eggs and the early life stage of salmonids see casas mulet et al 2016 lower river discharges also increased water temperature parr body mass growth was positively related with temperature and given that a critical body size was required for smoltification higher temperatures led to earlier smoltification with a consequent skewing of the parr age distribution to being composed of younger parr this is consistent with the findings of sundt hansen et al 2018 results in this study do not show large differences among the two summer scenario groups which could be explained by the negligible temperature differences 0 2 c between them temperature increases in summer between summer scenario groups summer 19 and summer 30 over those of the baseline scenario group were approximately 3 c increased temperatures could result in a shorter total period of parr density dependent mortality between parr recruitment and smoltification and thus could lead to higher smolt production however this effect can be cancelled out by the mortality produced by reduction in wetted areas as described by sundt hansen et al 2018 restoration of spawning sites are conventional compensation actions in regulated river systems such work has been demonstrated to be effective even under suboptimal depth and velocity conditions in five norwegian rivers barlaup et al 2008 and is widely applied from a cost benefit approach in ljungan river the hydrological bottlenecks identified under critical flows can be mitigated by restoring spawning sites the increase in total spawning area resulted in elevated smolt production compared to the baseline scenario group this indicates that the availability of spawning sites can be a limiting factor for the population following the adaptive management approach with a focus on objectives actions monitoring and evaluating future monitoring in the ljungan river will allow the evaluation of the efficiency of adding spawning sites based on experimental data total smolt production under the baseline newspawn scenario was 21 000 smolts similar to the 20 000 smolts predicted by uusitalo et al 2005 using a probabilistic salmon production capacity model built on expert knowledge suggesting that the addition of spawning sites is an effective method of maximizing production our study also supports the importance of involving stakeholders with valuable local knowledge about the river in the planning phase considering mitigation measures and adapting these to specific discharge levels to avoid dewatering in low flow conditions the addition of spawning sites may have positive effects on salmon production while dewatering may have negative effects however salmon production may also be affected by other factors such as the spatial configuration of river habitat characteristics kocik and ferreri 1998 poff and huryn 1998 kim and lapointe 2011 in our model dewatered areas in low discharges were found in segments with a wide range of salmon production potential new spawning sites were added in segments classified as areas with moderate to large production potential however this classification could change when the spatial configuration of dewatered areas and new spawning sites is considered potential bottlenecks arising from a lack of spatial connection between spawning habitat which would provide initial parr recruitment and habitat with a high parr carrying capacity which could potentially be dewatered were simulated since the model implicitly simulates spatial processes via the density dependent emigration of parr from areas of high parr abundance this study contributes to the understanding of the constraints affecting an atlantic salmon population in a swedish regulated river system it demonstrates the potential of using an integrating modelling approach that combines physical and biological components to identify possible bottlenecks and predict the effects of implementing mitigation measures furthermore the cooperation between the stakeholders group formed by the hydropower company the county officer national authorities local and national ngo s and research institutes has benefitted the analyses in this study providing useful inputs and data the importance of involving stakeholders at an early stage in projects related to river restoration and preservation of environmental conditions is of vital importance and a success key both from a perception point of view and from the value of incorporating local knowledge the implementation of modelling scenarios conducted in this study could also be of benefit for hydropower mitigation measures and other projects requiring evaluation as an alternative to long term and costly monitoring studies 5 conclusion in this study low winter and summer discharges were identified as key hydrological bottlenecks because they reduced wetted area and increased juvenile atlantic salmon density dependent mortality in addition winter low flows reduced juvenile atlantic salmon recruitment via dewatering of spawning sites the presently agreed upon specified minimum flow in ljungan river 30 m3 s 1 was shown to be the critical flow in our analyses and special attention should be paid to summer low flows to avoid flows below 30 m3 s 1 this study has shown the potential of integrating modelling tools including a salmon population model and a hydraulic model to investigate the response of a salmon population to modifications of discharge and spawning habitat this approach can aid in identifying bottlenecks affecting fish populations and provide support for decisions on environmental mitigation measures the method was developed for a specific river in this study but could be applied to other regulated rivers to investigate possible bottlenecks for atlantic salmon populations and to predict the effect of implementing mitigation measures acknowledgements this work was
