13810,this review summarizes the progress made in the field of low cost biosorption of heavy metal ions over the past few years it gives a comprehensive summary of the synthesis performance modification and regeneration of biosorbent the review also focused upon optimum operating parameters isotherm and kinetic studies moreover from an industrial application point of view fixed bed column studies have been discussed in this paper methods like chemical pretreatment grafting immobilization etc which improve the biosorbent properties have been summarized operating parameters that affect the biosorption process such as temperature ph contact time agitation speed etc have been studied to understand the relationship between factors and removal efficiency for most of the studies biosorption process was found to be endothermic with room temperature being optimum for the process grafting was observed to enhance the adsorption capacity of biosorbent enormously biosorption process generally followed langmuir or freundlich isotherm whereas mostly the best fit for kinetic model was pseudo second order desorption process was mostly carried out via acidic eluent the

industries metallurgy and mining industry energy and fuel production glass production industry and fertilizer industry are some of the primary heavy metal contaminated effluent producing industries 1 2 due to the activities like surface finishing production of chemicals milling and mining a large amount of effluent is generated that is regularly discharged into the water bodies 3 due to toxic 4 non degradable 5 mutagenic 6 and carcinogenic nature of heavy metals it becomes vital to treat them properly before discharging into the ecosystem effluent mainly consists of pharmaceutical compounds 7 dyes 8 and heavy metals these contaminates need to be appropriately addressed as they can stay in the environment for infinite time and in turn become a formidable threat to the ecosystem 9 arsenic 10 cadmium chromium 11 nickel lead zinc mercury 12 copper 13 etc 14 are some of the metals that are commonly found in industrial effluents these metals tend to form complexes with biological matter comprising oxygen sulfur and nitrogen and hence if absorbed by living beings it can result in modifying the molecular framework of nucleic acids protein or inhibiting the activity of enzymes ultimately leading to carcinogenic or toxicological effects heavy metals can cause serious problems such as poisoning brain problems and even primary cancer in humans if present in amounts above the tolerable limit 15 some of the common sources and impact of heavy metals are shown in table 1 many tragic incidents that have taken place due to the heavy metal concentration in water bodies have raised alertness towards the risk of heavy metal toxicity one of the very well known tragedies due to cadmium toxicity was the itai itai disease in japan that has been caused by methyl mercury poisoning in minamata bay a wide variety of techniques have been studied to achieve the aim of metal removal from industrial effluents some of the treatments used to overcome this problem are chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane separation method flocculation electro coagulation ultra filtration 25 adsorption etc fig 1 however along with each process both advantages and disadvantages are associated table 2 using membrane separation and ion exchange is comparatively simple but due to the high cost of membranes and resins its application remains limited also if these methods are used for solutions with low concentration of metals their efficiency decreases on the other hand in electrochemical treatment the high electricity consumption increases the operating cost of the process 26 in coagulation and flocculation the cost of chemical reagent used is high this in turn shoots up the operational cost moreover the sludge that is produced in this process is challenging to remove finally adsorption has been frequently used as one of the methods to remove heavy metal ions 27 economic feasibility flexible operational parameters and low sludge volume have proved to be of considerable advantage in using this process zeolite bentonite and activated carbon are some of the commonly used biosorbents however their cost and complicated regeneration processes have forced the researchers to look for other alternatives environmental protection has become one of the biggest concerns worldwide hence the development of greener remediation has become the need of the hour the study on possible cheap biosorbents started in the 1990s biosorbents due to their low cost high efficiency for even trace amounts of metal and low sludge content has attracted the researchers for further studies there has been extensive use of forestry and industrial waste such as wheat bran rice husk neem leaves neem bark waste paper fly ash bentonite slag coconut shell peanut husk etc for the biosorption process 33 36 its unique physiochemical properties good sorption efficiency and numerous functional groups that bind to the metal ion effectively have proved to be an advantage in the usage of these materials therefore this study provides a wide coverage of such biosorbents and their performance in metal removal in a concise yet complete manner besides pointing out the merits and demerits associated with different types of biosorbents also since the efficiency of biosorption process is not only dependent on the biosorbent this paper also covers the biosorbent preparation methods and the factors that affect the efficiency of the biosorption process like ph temperature residence time adsorption dosage rotation speed initial metal concentration moreover the popular modification techniques which have proven to boost the performance of raw biosorbents have been summarized which gives the reader a deeper insight into the biosorption process it is also necessary to have a fair idea of the mechanism of biosorption process for developing new biosorbents with even better properties therefore this study has also covered biosorption mechanisms along with kinetics and isotherms for better understanding of the biosorption process regeneration and desorption studies are also of crucial importance since at industrial scale it is preferred to use biosorbents that are capable of undergoing several adsorption desorption cycles as reusing biosorbents significantly decreases the operating cost of the process hence this study gives a special focus on biosorbent regeneration methods finally since the ultimate goal is to treat effluents emerging from the industry the industrial setup for biosorption process and efficiency of the various biosorbents packed into columns has been investigated 2 biosorbent preparation the method for the preparation of biosorbent from commercially worthless products is simple and cost effective these products can be utilized as they are or can be modified to tailor their properties generally the material first passes through pre cleaning where the dust dirt and any particles present on the surface are removed then it undergoes drying which helps in removing the moisture content and then it is sent for size reduction to achieve the desired size almost all the synthesis processes go through these steps but the only difference lies in their process parameters raw materials used for the preparation of biosorbent are initially collected from their origin and then water washed it has been observed that different ranges of water were used for washing of the material water aspects which were generally used were tap water 37 38 distilled water 39 double distilled water 40 de ionised water 41 and ultra pure water 42 sometimes the material was initially washed with tap water and then was washed with other ranges of water 43 occasionally washing is also done after the size reduction this process aids in removing tannin the water soluble substances and the colour the second most important step is drying it can be done in several ways such as drying at room temperature 44 sun drying 45 or oven drying 43 drying at ambient conditions and sun drying takes longer time as compared to oven drying fig 2 shows general protocol for biosorbent preparation while table 3 which covers performance of different biosorbents for metal removal also covers the synthesis steps that were followed for each biosorbent further if tailoring of properties is required the unmodified biosorbent can undergo physical or chemical modification which is discussed in later sections 3 brief overview of studies in this section the performance of various biosorbents produced mostly from agriculture forestry and industrial waste is discussed a summary on the common methods implied for improvement of adsorption capacity selectivity and mechanical strength of the biosorbent is discussed followed by discussion on factors affecting biosorption isotherm models and kinetic models table 3 gives the complete overview of all the recent studies where biosorbents were developed for metal removal and subsequent subsections point out the major findings and trends that were realized during the composition of this table 3 1 classification of biosorbents biosorbents can be broadly classified into two types living biosorbents which comprises of algae fungi yeast and bacteria and non living biosorbents such as rice husk coal fly ash neem leaves neem bark clay etc which are mostly derived from agriculture forestry and industrial waste however in comparison to non living biosorbents living biosorbents suffer from some drawbacks for example they usually show low mechanical strength due to their inherent friability and hence immobilization is mostly necessary for them in order to increase their stability which in turn increases the cost of biosorbent also living biosorbents are difficult to store since the live cells require suitable conditions to be maintained whereas nonliving biosorbents are easier to store due to no such metabolic energy requirements moreover while the nonliving biosorbents can be regenerated and reused multiple times living biosorbents show limited reuse due to accumulation of toxic substance inside the living cells therefore nonliving biosorbents have a slight edge over the living biosorbents 99 converting the waste produced by the industry agriculture and forestry into biosorbents nonliving has helped in productively managing waste it has also led to deriving value from commercially worthless products studies have been made to utilize rice husk nutshell fruit and vegetable peel leaves bark wheat bran and other wastes of agricultural origin for biosorption plant based bio materials have proved to be good biosorbents due to their static binding ability to the metal present in the effluent this binding occurs via cell surface sorption intracellular and extracellular accumulation from the study done on the plant based carnauba fruit biomass it has been found that the presence of lignocellulose on the surface has helped in the sorption process 100 whereas the presence of the carboxylic group in the rubber leaf has helped in the metal sorption from the aqueous solution industrial waste shows a varied range of physiochemical properties that can be effectively used for metal removal the by products produced by industries such as coal fly ash sawdust blast furnace slag industrial sludge etc 101 can be used for biosorbent preparation it has been observed that the by products from biorefineries pulp and paper industry mainly consist of a propyl phenolic group whereas the slag produced by metal and ore industry is rich in silicon and metal oxides red mud produced from the alumina producing industries consists of metal oxides that enhance its biosorption efficiency a study on sawdust showed that the functional groups such as the phenolic the carbonyl the amino the amide and the alcoholic groups in the sawdust a waste product from the timber industry have proved to be advantageous in the sorption process 102 3 2 modifying biosorbents pristine nonliving biosorbents may show low adsorption capacity poor mechanical strength and low selectivity in certain cases 103 to overcome such drawbacks researchers have frequently modified the biosorbent via various techniques and have obtained biosorbents with much enhanced properties these techniques include biosorbent pre treatment biosorbent immobilization addition of magnetic particles to biosorbent and grafting fig 3 shows a broad classification of popular modification techniques table 4 shows the performance of biosorbents that were modified via different techniques 3 2 1 biosorbent pre treatment methods usually biomaterials are pre treated via physical and chemical methods to remove impurities from the biosorbent surface which in turn increase the number of sites available for biosorption and hence the adsorption capacity commonly biosorbents are chemically pre treated with acids bases or inorganic salts by simple washing along with effective removal of impurities from the surface treatment with acid commonly used h2so4 117 hcl 118 and hno3 119 increases the positive charge on the biosorbent surface and hence adsorption capacity and selectivity of biosorbent can be expected to increase for the metal oxyanions like cro4 2 but decrease for the metal cations 120 however acidic treatment should be done with caution since it leads to mass loss of biosorbent and therefore excessive treatment can significantly reduce the biosorbent performance just like acids treatment with bases 121 123 like koh naoh also leads to removal of impurities and mass loss however one important difference between acid and base treatment is that the surface of biosorbent in the case of base experience an increase in negative charge which results in increased selectivity of the biosorbent for the metal cations due to electrostatic attractions bases also add the hydroxyl group to the biosorbent which further increases the adsorption capacity 124 125 unlike acids and bases inorganic salts like nacl nano3 nahco3 are lot safer for pre treatment since mass loss is almost negligible for this case these salts exchange ions with the biosorbent and hence are preferred for continuous flow systems as the released ions will get carried away with the feed 126 127 another chemical method for pre treatment of biosorbent is fenton process the biosorbent is treated with fenton reagent a solution of hydrogen peroxide with ferrous ion which removes the impurities from the biosorbent surface and hence increases the sites available for adsorption moreover it oxidizes the surface of biosorbent and hence increases the functional groups for metal binding 128 though fenton reagent is more effective than inorganic salts towards enhancement in adsorption capacity the toxic nature of hydrogen peroxide can limit the application of fenton process for large scale development of biosorbent while chemical treatment methods have been more effective in increasing the adsorption capacity of biosorbent physical methods can also be used for pre treatment of biosorbent due to their simplicity in physical pre treatment the unmodified biosorbent undergoes thermal treatment i e it may be subjected to heat or can be kept at freezing temperature 63 this method includes mechanical disruption boiling heating autoclave freeze drying or putting in a vacuum 3 2 2 immobilization of biosorbent just like adsorption capacity mechanical strength is also a very important parameter for evaluation of a biosorbent performance unfortunately some biosorbents show very low mechanical strength which results in their poor regeneration and hence limited industrial application 129 however to overcome this drawback immobilization techniques have attracted much attention 130 along with increasing the mechanical strength immobilization of biosorbent also makes it easier to separate the biosorbent from the solution after adsorption process however immobilization has certain drawbacks as well immobilization increases the cost of biosorbent reduces the number of sites available for adsorption of metal ion and increases retention time but still for many cases immobilization is necessary in order to meet strength and stability requirements 131 immobilization techniques can be mainly classified into three types adsorption method embedding method and cross linking method the adsorption method 132 of immobilization is easiest of all the other immobilization methods since it relies on the physical forces like van der waal and electrostatic forces between the biomass and the carrier support for immobilizing the biomass onto the carrier however this method is unpopular owing to the easy to break bonding between the biosorbent and the carrier usually this adsorption method is observed for immobilization of inorganic materials like zeolite activated carbon ceramics with biosorbents these inorganic materials themselves have a good adsorption capacity and hence immobilizing those with biosorbent have additional benefit of increased overall adsorption capacity of the immobilized biosorbent 133 another method embedding method 134 is the most common method for immobilization in this method a polymer network traps the biomass molecules and provides the support stability to the biomass molecules organic compounds like agar polyvinyl alcohol pva gel and polyacrylonitrile are few common supports that are used for embedding for the high mechanical strength and chemical stability they impart to the structure 135 similarly sodium alginate is another popular choice for biomass immobilization 136 while sodium alginate provides additional functional groups for metal ion adsorption the mechanical strength it imparts is relatively lower and may not be always sufficient for such cases the third method for immobilization cross linking method can be used 137 often used in combination with other modification methods cross linking method uses a cross linker like glutaraldehyde epichlorohydrin ech and formaldehyde to bind the biomass molecules together and hence increases the mechanical strength of the biosorbent while cross linking alone is also a reliable method for immobilization it is often used in combination with embedding methods for example cross linking saccharomyces cerevisiae with formaldehyde along with embedding with sodium alginate which results in remarkable mechanical strength 138 mostly cross linkers with high number of functional groups are preferred for cross linking method of immobilization since these functional groups act as additional sites for metal ion adsorption 3 2 3 other modifications other than pre treatment of biosorbent there exist other methods as well which can increase the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent one such method is grafting 139 groups like carboxyl hydroxyl that have high affinity for metal ions onto the surface of biosorbent grafting is a very common and cheap method which can not only enhance the adsorption capacity but can also increase the selectivity of the biosorbent towards metal ions since negatively charged groups like coo oh or electron donating group like thiol amine attract the metal ions via electrostatic interactions for example grafting acrylic acid introduces many new carboxyl groups on the biosorbent surface which help in binding of metal ions 140 similarly ethylenediaminetetraacetic anhydride which contains two anhydride groups can be grafted by actylation which binds metal ions via mostly complexation mechanism 141 another method is combining magnetic particles like fe3o4 142 with the biosorbent this method along with increasing the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent makes the separation of biosorbent from the solution after completion of adsorption process very simple such biosorbents can be recovered from the solution easily via help of an external magnetic field moreover they provide additional support to the biomass molecules which increases the overall strength of the biosorbent 143 144 however magnetic particles are susceptible to oxidation in air as well as acidic conditions therefore in order to protect the magnetic properties of the biosorbent in oxidative conditions studies have coated the core of magnetic particles with inert materials like sio2 145 researchers have also embedded photocatalytic materials like tio2 cu2o into the biosorbents which upon irradiation by light helps the adsorption process by oxidizing or reducing the metal ion into a valence state which is more easier for the biosorbent to adsorb 146 3 3 factors affecting biosorption the prevailing operating conditions play an important role in the biosorption process main factors affecting biosorption include temperature ph biosorbent dosage and stirring rate optimum ph value for a particular biosorption process depends upon the zero point charge value phzpc of the biosorbent and the targeted metal ions phzpc is that value of ph of the solution at which at the surface charge of biosorbent equals to zero for ph phzpc the surface of biosorbent acquires a positive charge and hence repel positively charged metal ions on the other hand for ph phzpc the surface of biosorbent acquires a negative charge and therefore attracts the positively charged metal ions 147 having said this let s now take into the consideration the metal ions that are targeted for biosorption almost all the heavy metal ions including cd ii pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii exist in their cationic form in the solution therefore a drastic increase in their uptake is observed when the ph value surpasses phzpc value ph phzpc 148 149 but if the ph of the solution is lower than the phzpc values h3o ions from the solution occupy the active sites on the biosorbent surface which were originally supposed to be occupied by metal ions and the positive charge on the surface on the biosorbent repels the positively charged metal ions leading to an overall decreased adsorption however a very different behaviour is observed when cr vi ions are adsorption target it has been observed that the removal efficiency increases with decrease in ph value for the case of cr vi 150 151 this is due to the fact that at low ph cr vi ions exist in anionic form i e hcro4 is the dominant species in the solution and hence they are attracted to biosorbent surface via electrostatic interactions when ph phzpc as the ph increases biosorbent surface becomes negatively charged resulting in the repulsion between biosorbent and hcro4 leading to decreased removal of cr vi however for all metal ions an optimum ph value should be calculated since at very large ph values this large ph value range depends upon concentration of metal ions in the solution but it s typically greater than 7 metal ions start to precipitate leading to low adsorption 152 153 stability and solubility of ligands and biosorbent depend upon temperature most of the biosorption processes were observed to be endothermic so increasing the temperature increases the removal efficiency as surface activity is raised 154 however the temperature should be optimized if the temperature is too high the active biomolecules in the biosorbent will degrade resulting in a changed active site structure and pore size of the biosorbent resulting in a decrease of removal however for large scale applications it is costly to maintain the desired optimum temperature therefore most of the studies have been conducted at room temperatures 92 93 for exothermic reactions activity decreases with an increase in temperature 155 generally metal uptake increases with an increase in biosorbent dosage as the number of active site increases 156 however it has also been observed that metal removal percentage first reaches a maximum and then start decreasing as the biosorbent dose is increased reason being that in case of very high dosage biosorbent particles start to agglomerate and hence the active sites start to overlap with each other which results in overall decrease in removal efficiency 157 increasing agitation speed helps in overcoming mass transfer resistance but it should be maintained within a range or else biosorbent fragmentation can take place generally agitation speed is kept between 120 rpm 200 rpm from table 3 it can be observed that uptake of ni ii was maximum for litchi chinensis seeds with results being best obtained at room temperature keeping ph 7 5 adsorbent dosage as 1 g l and agitation speed of 180 rpm 84 similarly for cd ii ions a very high uptake was achieved with nettle ash with calculated optimum values for ph temperature adsorbent dosage and agitation speed being equal to 6 30 c 0 5 g l 180 rpm respectively 76 likewise for pb ii ions highest adsorption capacity was obtained with 2 5 mg l of anadara inaequivalvis shells in a ph range of 5 5 5 with agitation speed of 350 rpm at 30 c 94 for the case of zn ii a very high uptake was achieved with sugarcane baggase as raw material with optimum values for ph adsorbent dosage and agitation speed calculated to be 5 1 25 g l and 120 rpm respectively in a temperature range from 35 c to 49 c 50 similarly in case of cu ii maximum uptake was observed for 1 g l coconut husk when agitation speed was kept equal to 120 rpm with ph equal to 5 at 30 c 48 for the case of cr vi ions highest adsorption capacity was observed with exhausted coffee waste and as expected best removal was obtained for a relatively lower ph value that was equal to 3 and the optimum values for temperature adsorbent dosage and agitation speed were equal to 25 c 6 67 g l and 40 rpm respectively 66 3 4 biosorption isotherm at equilibrium solute concentration and constant temperature interactive behaviour between the metal and the biosorbent has been studied with the help of biosorption isotherm it helps in understanding the biosorption mechanism and also helps to determine the arrangement of biosorption sites and adsorption of metal ions onto the biosorbent surface it helps in optimizing the usage of biosorbent for a particular system table 5 shows the common isotherms used in the study according to langmuir model uptake of metal occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption the model provides the relationship between metal adsorption on the biosorbent surface and its equilibrium concentration in the effluent this model is based on three assumptions i e adsorption can occur only at a specific number of the sites present on the surface adsorption can only take place in a monolayer fashion i e only one single layer of molecules will attach to the biosorbent surface and adsorbate is strongly attracted to biosorbent in a solution freundlich isotherm depicted a good fit for many studies especially when concentration of metal ion was low it has the capability of describing the biosorption process for a wide variety of biosorbents this model expresses the biosorbent surface as heterogeneous and adsorption as multilayer with different intermolecular interactions bet model which is a two parameter model is used for multilayer adsorption assuming each layer obeys langmuir isotherm temkin isotherm is a model used to assess the relationship between the biosorbent surface and the adsorption heat of all molecules it shows a linear decrease in heat of adsorption of all molecules with an increase in biosorbent surface coverage 100 158 r p model is used to describe biosorption equilibrium in a broad dimension of concentrations 159 r p model is a three parameter model and contains properties of the freundlich and the langmuir isotherm langmuir isotherm fits most of the experimental data obtained by biosorption studies suggesting homogeneous biosorbent surface and mono layer binding on the surface of biosorbent 160 162 freundlich isotherm also fitted well with the experimental data in many studies suggesting multilayer adsorption and heterogeneous surface of biosorbent 163 165 table 3 provides the information on biosorbents performance along with the isotherm model they followed 3 5 kinetic study analysis of the kinetic model for biosorption study is vital to understand the reaction pathway mechanism and dynamics of the biosorption process it helps in determining physiochemical interaction mass transport and rate determining steps in the biosorption process also knowledge about kinetics of metal adsorption helps in determination of optimum conditions for adsorption processes moreover for continuous processes reactor dimensions and residence time are determined with the help of kinetics study for biosorption processes mostly it was observed that either pseudo first order 166 or pseudo second order kinetic model was followed fig 4 depicts the common kinetic model used in the biosorption process in pseudo first order model occupancy rate of sites is directly proportional to the number of sites that are unoccupied 99 whereas the pseudo second order considers metal adsorption as a function of the number of the free active sites and the number of metal ions in the solution the pseudo first order model has one major drawback that it fits well with the data obtained from experiments only for initial few minutes of the adsorption process as the contact time increases the plot between time t and log qe qt starts to lose it linearity where qe qtrepresent the sorption capacity at equilibrium and time t respectively one possible reason for this deviation from linearity can be the possibility of time lag due to external resistance controlling at the beginning of the biosorption process since this time lag is difficult to quantify the deviation between experimental and theoretical value of sorption capacity cannot be controlled 30 therefore to obtain better results for longer time period pseudo second order kinetic model is usually a better choice for fitting the experimental data from biosorption process moreover for chemisorption processes pseudo second order considers the bonding between biosorbent and adsorbate via their valence forces which further makes this model better than pseudo first order kinetic model 167 while pseudo second order model is very successful it has one disadvantage as well since it is a pseudo kinetic model a new rate constant is obtained for each change in system variable and therefore it becomes necessary to develop an equation which correlates the pseudo rate constant with each variable 30 other popular kinetic models are intra particle diffusion model and elovich kinetic model according to the intra particle diffusion model rapid adsorption occurs initially and then a slow sorption occurs where the intra particle diffusion dominates and then finally solute starts moving from larger pores to micropores leading to equilibrium 168 on the other hand elovich model is famous for describing kinetics at heterogeneous energy solid biosorbent surfaces 99 in this work it was observed that generally the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted better than other models 169 172 table 3 provides information on biosorbents performance along with the kinetics model they followed 4 mechanism of biosorption sorbents used for biosorption are derived from different sources raw materials used for biosorbent synthesis are generally complex and diverse hence it implies that metal uptake can be facilitated by different ways it is important to understand biosorption mechanism in order to improve the understanding of metal binding to biosorbent surface increase biosorbent efficiency and control metal removal moreover knowledge about the process mechanism helps in choosing the appropriate method for biosorbent regeneration depending upon choice of biosorbent there are different type of functional group such as amide amine carbonyl hydroxyl imine sulfonate carboxyl phosphate thioether phenolic and phosphodiester groups that can attract metal ion towards the surface 173 175 in some cases functional group can possess barriers in biosorption process due to steric conformational or other factors mechanism of biosorption gets affected by binding site of biosorbent binding site availability affinity between active site and metal and type of binding site sorption can follow one mechanism or combination of mechanisms hence it is not feasible to imply general mechanism different mechanism has been proposed to understand the process such as ion exchange chelation surface complexation electrostatic interaction etc fig 5 gives an overview on different types of biosorption mechanism table 6 gives the information on the mechanism followed by different biosorbents 4 1 physical adsorption a weak van der waals attraction between sorbate and surface facilitates physical adsorption which is a reversible process this phenomenon is basically affected by surface area or by ph of the solution 203 54 2 however mostly for biosorption of metal ions this mechanism has not played much of an important role this can be attributed to the weak binding between biosorbent and adsorbate via van der waals force nevertheless exceptions were observed where the physical adsorption mechanism was the dominant mechanism for the process one such example was observed when cu ii was adsorbed onto the rubber leaf powder based biosorbent 54 204 206 table 7 below summarizes the results of the column studies done during the adsorption of various heavy metals by few biomass based adsorbents 4 2 ion exchange the phenomenon where ion bounded on biosorbent surface is exchanged with other ion in solution is called as ion exchange 118 it is generally a reversible process though there are a few studies that focus on biosorption mechanism studies which include biosorption mechanism mostly reported ion exchange as one of the governing mechanism of process this mechanism was observed in most of the studies and provided major driving force for adsorption process ion exchange mechanism can be generally represented as 225 m x x h y x h m y x where mx is metal ion myx is sorbed mx and hy represent number of acid site on solid surface 176 179 release of mg2 ca2 and na ions into the solution gives a sign that biosorption process underwent ion exchange mechanism in one such study authors studied the mechanism of cu ii adsorption on macrocystis pyrifera biomass the results showed that adsorption proceeded dominantly by exchange of cu ii ions with ca 2 and mg 2 197 ionic strength is a crucial factor that affects the ion exchange mechanism and hence varying the ionic strength can help in determining whether the ion exchange mechanism was followed or not for example while studying the adsorption of cr vi on the date pit biomass researchers increased the amount of nacl in the solution and noticed no significant changes in the biosorbent performance which indicated that ion exchange mechanism was not dominant for this process 51 4 3 complexation complexation mechanism involves formation of complex by the combination of two or more species formation in which central position is occupied by metal bound by ligands are known as mononuclear complexes polynuclear complexes are formed when there exist more than one metal ion in the centre bounded with ligands multidentate ligands are more preferred than monodentate complexes as the former contains multiple ligands leading to attraction of multiple ions 188 a study utilized walnut shell for adsorption of pb ii ions the experiments were conducted on two biosorbents walnut shell ws and walnut shell grafted with sulphur containing functional group xanthate sws the results showed that lead adsorption significantly increased from ws to sws this was attributed to the complexation reaction that took place between the xanthate and lead ion the sulphur containing group xanthate is a soft ligand group and lead ion belongs to soft acid group hence in accordance to pearson acid base theory it was expected that xanthate and lead ion will have high affinity for each other and therefore the complexation reaction between the two significantly enhanced the lead adsorption 185 4 4 chelation chelates are complex ring structures in which the electron donating atoms adhere to metal ion at more than a single place simultaneously this is a special case of complexation mechanism with speciality being the formation of rings generally polydentate ligands are involved in reaction to aid formation of stable structure by multiple bonding stability of structure increases with increase in ligand binding site chelates are comparatively more stable than complexes due to binding of metal ions at several sites 226 functional groups like rcoo oh so2 and nh3 were found to be commonly involved in chelating the metal ions among all functional groups nh3 was observed to be most efficient in removing the heavy metals as for this case chelation and electrostatic interaction both took place simultaneously 225 recently a study focused on biosorption of cr iii cu ii onto soyabean meal wastes sbm investigated the mechanism of this process ftir analysis showed that the biosorbent was rich in carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups to understand the role of each functional group in chelating the metal ions the carboxyl groups were blocked via esterification reaction and hydroxyl groups were blocked via methylation reaction individually it was observed that while the blocking of carboxyl groups decreased the biosorption efficiency by 54 4 for cr iii and by 51 for cu ii blocking hydroxyl groups decreased the biosorption efficiency by 30 for cr iii and by 28 for cu ii these results clearly indicated the dominance of chelation mechanism for this process while the ion exchange mechanism also played a role in metal ion adsorption onto sbm 192 4 5 surface precipitation formation of insoluble metal oxides and hydroxides on the surface of biosorbent is referred to as surface precipitation in case of metabolism independent biosorbent precipitation occurs due to chemical reaction such as oxidation reduction reaction between surface functional group of biosorbent generally this type of mechanism is observed when the metal concentration on the biosorbent surface increases beyond the capability of the biosorbent the adsorption rate via surface precipitation is much slower in comparison to other mechanisms 54 192 227 228 in a recent study researchers investigated the performance of aloe vera wastes for adsorption of uranium and cadmium the high performance biosorbent used multiple mechanisms to adsorb 370 4 and 104 2 mg g of uranium and cadmium these mechanisms included ion exchange physical adsorption and surface precipitation 54 5 regeneration and desorption study of biosorbent as we know biosorption is being studied for the past few decades but still it faces some hindrances in large scale applications one of the chief studies before the industrial application is desorption and regeneration study desorption studies can help the industry to get back precious metal which was lost in the effluent and regeneration studies will help in understanding the method of reusing spent biosorbent and decreasing the demand of virgin biosorbent regeneration studies are usually important where the raw material for biosorbent is not easily available or the synthesis process is time and cost consuming generally the desorption process depends on the mechanical strength 229 230 of the biosorbent and the mechanism of the biosorption process 67 desorption study can be broadly classified into destructive 231 120 and non destructive methods 136 160 fig 6 a destructive method for metal recovery can be used if biosorbent employed is of very low cost this method is generally carried out by either recovering the metal from ash after combustion of the biosorbent or dissolution of the biosorbent in a strong chemical which will in turn loosen the metallic bond on the surface in a study by 232 on exhausted pine cone shell which was implied in sorption of lead and copper it was observed that after pyrolysis about 99 and 95 of lead and copper respectively were recovered from char of metal laden biosorbent similarly a study conducted on waste olive solid suggested that incineration of exhausted biosorbent resulted in recovery of 96 nickel and copper metal from char of exhausted biosorbent 233 nonetheless the major disadvantage of using this technique is high sludge generation and as a result it increases the sludge disposal cost hence the researchers have focussed more on the non destructive techniques as the biosorbent can be recycled for this case non destructive techniques can be done via two methods either by physical treatment or by chemical treatment in physical treatment metal is recovered using specific unit operations such as microwaving or heating while in chemical treatment different elements such as metal salts 234 acids 48 or alkalis 49 are used for metal recovery 235 when an acid usually hcl hno3 or h2so4 is used for desorption numerous hydronium ions and protons are introduced in the solution and hence they compete with each other for active sites and as a result metal ion desorbs from the biosorbent surface and forms a complex with acid radical ion 236 recently to desorb uranium vi and cadmium ii from the surface of aloe vera wastes 0 1 m h2so4 was used the results obtained showed more than 96 desorption efficiency for both the metal ions and for the second cycle of adsorption removal efficiency achieved was more than 93 54 on the other hand the addition of alkali usually naoh or nh4oh lowers the degree of protonation of the biosorbent surface therefore leading to desorption in order to desorb pb ii cr vi metal ions from the surface of functionalised oil palm leaves 0 5 mol l of naoh was used the desorption efficiency achieved was greater than 99 for both the metal ions and the removal efficiency of the biosorbent remained at 88 and 90 for pb ii and cr vi even after completion of five cycles 237 one practical advantage of employing acidic or basic treatment for regeneration is that acids bases are common waste products for many industries therefore employing them for regeneration processes can help in waste utilization however acid base treatment can also result in significant mass loss of the biosorbent in few cases moreover in practical application acids and bases may corrode the equipment over time therefore other chemical methods like desorption via metal salt or complexing agent might be more appropriate for some cases metal salts are preferred for the cases where ion exchange is the leading mechanism for adsorption process when metal salts are used the ion exchange mechanism leads again but this time for desorption of metal ions from the biosorbent surface famous examples of metal salts include nacl kno3 and cacl2 a recent study used 2 0 m kno3 for desorbing gold and silver particles from the surface of aminoguanidyl imprinted glutaraldehyde crosslinked chitosan the desorption efficiency achieved was greater than 95 for both the ions and the biosorbent showed 85 removal efficiency even after five cycles 238 complexing agents like edta are also a popular choice for desorbing metal ions these agents are rich in electron donating groups like amine and hydroxyl and hence form stable complex structures with the metal ions via donating their electrons resulting in desorption of the ions recently to desorb lead and cadmium ions from the surface of mistletoe leaves 0 05 m edta was applied the removal efficiency of the biosorbent remained almost unchanged even after three cycles which proves the calibre of edta as a regenerating agent 239 desorption and regeneration are important processes since these processes reduce the overall operating cost of the effluent treatment plant by making it possible to reuse the biosorbent and by making metal recovery feasible 6 from lab to industry much research has been conducted on various biosorbents for evaluating their adsorption properties however most of these studies were limited only to batch experiments 240 batch experiments are easy to perform and can provide good insight into the biosorbent properties especially capacity mechanism and kinetics of the biosorption process batch experiments are therefore helpful for screening out the biosorbents that satisfy necessary but not sufficient conditions for industrial application however batch processes are not usually used on industrial scale due to their inability to treat large volumes of effluent rather continuous flow processes are developed to treat the industrial effluent more specifically fixed bed column reactors are the most popular choice for industrial applications 131 in fixed bed column reactor design effluent streams are pumped and fed from top into a column say b1 packed with biosorbents or influents are fed from bottom of the column as this stream flows down the column biosorbents packed into the column takes up the metal ions from the stream and the purified effluent stream exits from the bottom of the column to reach s1 fig 7 from s1 effluent can be either discharged directly or some acidic basic treatment of the effluent maybe necessary in order to ensure neutrality of the discharged stream this process continues until the column bed reaches saturation i e most of the sites available for metal adsorption are now are already utilized which results in increased metal ion concentration in the exit effluent stream therefore the flow of effluent stream into b1 is either stopped or diverted into another column bed say b2 while b1 is treated with regenerating agents regenerating agents like acid or basic solution are fed from the top of the column as these regenerating agents flow through column they desorb the metal ions from the biosorbent surface and these ions flow down with the regenerating stream the exit stream from this regeneration process is diverted to s2 fig 7 from where it can be taken for recovery of metal ions 241 initially when the effluent is fed to the column from the top the few upper packed layers of the biosorbent adsorb most of the metal ions from the effluent and therefore almost metal free stream flows through the subsequent layers fig 8 in this case upper packed layer zone where most of the adsorption is taking place is called mass transfer zone mtz after some time the upper layers become saturated with metal ions and are no longer able to adsorb significant amount of ions in that case most of the metal ions are adsorbed by the middle layers of the biosorbent packaging and almost metal free stream flows through the lower layers of the column the process continues until saturation of the complete column takes place after which metal ion concentration in the exit flow stream is no longer below the standard levels 242 to make sure that the column bed is not used further after its saturation it becomes necessary to constantly monitor the metal ion concentration in exiting stream techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy and plasma mass spectrometry are limited only to lab based experiments and are insufficient for purposes where constant monitoring for metal ion concentration is required therefore for industrial purposes chemical optical sensors 243 like surface enhanced raman scattering 244 and surface plasmon resonance sensors 245 can be applied the working principle of these sensors is based upon the changes in optical properties that take place due to the interaction between biosorbent and immobilized sensors just like adsorption capacity is an important parameter for measuring the biosorbent efficiency break through curves are important for evaluating efficiency of the fixed bed column process break through curves which usually take up s curved shaped with varying steepness provide a fair idea for maximum amount of the volume that a column bed can treat depending upon the maximum permissible exit effluent stream metal concentration 246 a biosorbent which showed success in batch experiments performed in laboratory may not be able to retain its success when used for treating real industrial effluent due to several possible reasons one of the prime reasons is that real industrial effluents are much more complex than the solutions prepared in lab the co existing metal ions and anions in the industrial effluents are known to compete with target heavy metal ions for active sites on the biosorbent which results in overall decreased metal removal efficiency of the biosorbent 247 another issue which is not realized during batch experiments is that some biosorbents have tendency to swell during the adsorption process due to swelling the liquid flow may get blocked through the column resulting in a failed process however with help of biosorbent immobilization 248 and mixing of biosorbent with ion exchangers 249 swelling property of biosorbent can be controlled ph is also a very crucial factor which determines overall adsorption performance while it is very easy to work with optimum ph values in batch experiments it is impractical to control the ph value for continuous flow processes where large volumes of effluent are to be treated since effluents are unlikely to have ph in optimum ranges biosorbents which show less dependency on ph are more likely to be successful in industrial processes 241 moreover decreasing biosorbent particle size is known to increase the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent since with decreasing particle size there is an increase in specific area however very small particles may not be useful in industrial processes even though it may have high adsorption capacity this is simply because exhaustion time of the biosorbent bed decreases with decreasing the particle size in addition to this smaller particle size results in high pressure drop in the column bed 250 recently to test the performance of olive tree pruning for lead adsorption 251 experiments were performed on lab scale ls and pilot scale ps for ls experiments column with 1 5 cm diameter d and length of 23 cm h was used and for ps studies column with 5 cm diameter d and length of 56 cm h was used the scaling from ls to ps was done maintaining three similarities 1 geometric similarity h d h d 2 kinetic similarity physical properties of solution were kept constant 3 dynamic similarity physical properties of biosorbent were not changed it was reported that for a bed depth of 11 3 cm in both cases breakthrough time decreased from 241 min to 105 min for ls and from 195 min to 75 min for ps when the effluent flow rate was increased from 4 to 8 ml min and from 44 to 89 ml min respectively the decrease in saturation time with increase in flow rate could be due to large turbulence effect and reduced external mass transfer resistance in the case of high flow rate for all cases of experiments performed removal efficiency for ps was only slightly less than that in case of ls overall more than 99 removal efficiency was achieved for all cases in another study column with 6 35 cm diameter and 38 cm length was packed with sugarcane bagasse and used for mn ii adsorption 252 the flow rate was fixed to 7 l min and the maximum removal efficiency reported was 51 75 in yet another study effect of column height was studied on saturation time for copper removal from the column 1 1 diameter packed with amino functionalized ramie stalk based biosorbent fen 253 at a constant flow rate of 5 l min it was noticed that saturation time increases as the bed height is increased 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm as shown in the fig 9 this was expected since for greater column height there are more number of sites available for adsorption and hence will require more time for saturation also the maximum adsorption capacities observed were 0 538 0 501 and 0 468 mmol g 1 for heights 5 10 15 cm respectively this reduction in adsorption capacity with the column height could be due to effect of liquid channeling and maldistribution in high beds 254 7 conclusions in the past few years an enormous amount of research has been conducted on biosorbents the present study focussed on low cost biosorbents that were used for heavy metal ions adsorption from the lab based synthetic solutions or real industrial wastewater in this study it was observed that most of the times biomass went under certain modifications for its best utilization as a biosorbent fenton reagent acids bases and inorganic salts were mostly applied for chemical pre treatment of the biosorbent which usually increased the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent while embedding methods combined with cross linking provided biosorbents very high mechanical strength the different factors affecting biosorption such as temperature ph contact time agitation speed biosorbent dose particle size etc have been included in the present study most of the biosorbent processes were endothermic and spontaneous by nature also to understand the biosorption mechanism isotherm and kinetics of the various processes were studied most of the processes followed the langmuir or the freundlich isotherm and fitted best with the pseudo second order kinetic model moreover from regeneration studies it was realized that highest desorption percentages are usually achieved with acidic eluents moreover from bed column studies it was realized that biosorbents can prove to be a good alternative for commercially available adsorbents 8 recommendations although work on the biosorption process is being conducted from a long time still the following knowledge gaps were observed in the wake of this review 1 more focus on the real effluent system will help in a better understanding of the behavior of the biosorbent in the presence of multi metals this study will also help in synthesizing biosorbents which can simultaneously handle multi metals 2 regeneration and desorption studies are still limited which pose a challenge in the application of biosorbent at an industrial level also more focus should be given to selective desorption of expensive metal ions proper study in this direction will help in value addition to the biosorption process 3 currently the disposal or recycling study of the spent catalyst is limited a proper study in this direction will help in reducing the challenge of biosorbent disposal after completion of biosorption process 4 for industrial application current methods for biosorbent immobilization are too much complicated therefore it is required to search for easier biosorbent immobilization methods declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

13810,this review summarizes the progress made in the field of low cost biosorption of heavy metal ions over the past few years it gives a comprehensive summary of the synthesis performance modification and regeneration of biosorbent the review also focused upon optimum operating parameters isotherm and kinetic studies moreover from an industrial application point of view fixed bed column studies have been discussed in this paper methods like chemical pretreatment grafting immobilization etc which improve the biosorbent properties have been summarized operating parameters that affect the biosorption process such as temperature ph contact time agitation speed etc have been studied to understand the relationship between factors and removal efficiency for most of the studies biosorption process was found to be endothermic with room temperature being optimum for the process grafting was observed to enhance the adsorption capacity of biosorbent enormously biosorption

industries metallurgy and mining industry energy and fuel production glass production industry and fertilizer industry are some of the primary heavy metal contaminated effluent producing industries 1 2 due to the activities like surface finishing production of chemicals milling and mining a large amount of effluent is generated that is regularly discharged into the water bodies 3 due to toxic 4 non degradable 5 mutagenic 6 and carcinogenic nature of heavy metals it becomes vital to treat them properly before discharging into the ecosystem effluent mainly consists of pharmaceutical compounds 7 dyes 8 and heavy metals these contaminates need to be appropriately addressed as they can stay in the environment for infinite time and in turn become a formidable threat to the ecosystem 9 arsenic 10 cadmium chromium 11 nickel lead zinc mercury 12 copper 13 etc 14 are some of the metals that are commonly found in industrial effluents these metals tend to form complexes with biological matter comprising oxygen sulfur and nitrogen and hence if absorbed by living beings it can result in modifying the molecular framework of nucleic acids protein or inhibiting the activity of enzymes ultimately leading to carcinogenic or toxicological effects heavy metals can cause serious problems such as poisoning brain problems and even primary cancer in humans if present in amounts above the tolerable limit 15 some of the common sources and impact of heavy metals are shown in table 1 many tragic incidents that have taken place due to the heavy metal concentration in water bodies have raised alertness towards the risk of heavy metal toxicity one of the very well known tragedies due to cadmium toxicity was the itai itai disease in japan that has been caused by methyl mercury poisoning in minamata bay a wide variety of techniques have been studied to achieve the aim of metal removal from industrial effluents some of the treatments used to overcome this problem are chemical precipitation ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane separation method flocculation electro coagulation ultra filtration 25 adsorption etc fig 1 however along with each process both advantages and disadvantages are associated table 2 using membrane separation and ion exchange is comparatively simple but due to the high cost of membranes and resins its application remains limited also if these methods are used for solutions with low concentration of metals their efficiency decreases on the other hand in electrochemical treatment the high electricity consumption increases the operating cost of the process 26 in coagulation and flocculation the cost of chemical reagent used is high this in turn shoots up the operational cost moreover the sludge that is produced in this process is challenging to remove finally adsorption has been frequently used as one of the methods to remove heavy metal ions 27 economic feasibility flexible operational parameters and low sludge volume have proved to be of considerable advantage in using this process zeolite bentonite and activated carbon are some of the commonly used biosorbents however their cost and complicated regeneration processes have forced the researchers to look for other alternatives environmental protection has become one of the biggest concerns worldwide hence the development of greener remediation has become the need of the hour the study on possible cheap biosorbents started in the 1990s biosorbents due to their low cost high efficiency for even trace amounts of metal and low sludge content has attracted the researchers for further studies there has been extensive use of forestry and industrial waste such as wheat bran rice husk neem leaves neem bark waste paper fly ash bentonite slag coconut shell peanut husk etc for the biosorption process 33 36 its unique physiochemical properties good sorption efficiency and numerous functional groups that bind to the metal ion effectively have proved to be an advantage in the usage of these materials therefore this study provides a wide coverage of such biosorbents and their performance in metal removal in a concise yet complete manner besides pointing out the merits and demerits associated with different types of biosorbents also since the efficiency of biosorption process is not only dependent on the biosorbent this paper also covers the biosorbent preparation methods and the factors that affect the efficiency of the biosorption process like ph temperature residence time adsorption dosage rotation speed initial metal concentration moreover the popular modification techniques which have proven to boost the performance of raw biosorbents have been summarized which gives the reader a deeper insight into the biosorption process it is also necessary to have a fair idea of the mechanism of biosorption process for developing new biosorbents with even better properties therefore this study has also covered biosorption mechanisms along with kinetics and isotherms for better understanding of the biosorption process regeneration and desorption studies are also of crucial importance since at industrial scale it is preferred to use biosorbents that are capable of undergoing several adsorption desorption cycles as reusing biosorbents significantly decreases the operating cost of the process hence this study gives a special focus on biosorbent regeneration methods finally since the ultimate goal is to treat effluents emerging from the industry the industrial setup for biosorption process and efficiency of the various biosorbents packed into columns has been investigated 2 biosorbent preparation the method for the preparation of biosorbent from commercially worthless products is simple and cost effective these products can be utilized as they are or can be modified to tailor their properties generally the material first passes through pre cleaning where the dust dirt and any particles present on the surface are removed then it undergoes drying which helps in removing the moisture content and then it is sent for size reduction to achieve the desired size almost all the synthesis processes go through these steps but the only difference lies in their process parameters raw materials used for the preparation of biosorbent are initially collected from their origin and then water washed it has been observed that different ranges of water were used for washing of the material water aspects which were generally used were tap water 37 38 distilled water 39 double distilled water 40 de ionised water 41 and ultra pure water 42 sometimes the material was initially washed with tap water and then was washed with other ranges of water 43 occasionally washing is also done after the size reduction this process aids in removing tannin the water soluble substances and the colour the second most important step is drying it can be done in several ways such as drying at room temperature 44 sun drying 45 or oven drying 43 drying at ambient conditions and sun drying takes longer time as compared to oven drying fig 2 shows general protocol for biosorbent preparation while table 3 which covers performance of different biosorbents for metal removal also covers the synthesis steps that were followed for each biosorbent further if tailoring of properties is required the unmodified biosorbent can undergo physical or chemical modification which is discussed in later sections 3 brief overview of studies in this section the performance of various biosorbents produced mostly from agriculture forestry and industrial waste is discussed a summary on the common methods implied for improvement of adsorption capacity selectivity and mechanical strength of the biosorbent is discussed followed by discussion on factors affecting biosorption isotherm models and kinetic models table 3 gives the complete overview of all the recent studies where biosorbents were developed for metal removal and subsequent subsections point out the major findings and trends that were realized during the composition of this table 3 1 classification of biosorbents biosorbents can be broadly classified into two types living biosorbents which comprises of algae fungi yeast and bacteria and non living biosorbents such as rice husk coal fly ash neem leaves neem bark clay etc which are mostly derived from agriculture forestry and industrial waste however in comparison to non living biosorbents living biosorbents suffer from some drawbacks for example they usually show low mechanical strength due to their inherent friability and hence immobilization is mostly necessary for them in order to increase their stability which in turn increases the cost of biosorbent also living biosorbents are difficult to store since the live cells require suitable conditions to be maintained whereas nonliving biosorbents are easier to store due to no such metabolic energy requirements moreover while the nonliving biosorbents can be regenerated and reused multiple times living biosorbents show limited reuse due to accumulation of toxic substance inside the living cells therefore nonliving biosorbents have a slight edge over the living biosorbents 99 converting the waste produced by the industry agriculture and forestry into biosorbents nonliving has helped in productively managing waste it has also led to deriving value from commercially worthless products studies have been made to utilize rice husk nutshell fruit and vegetable peel leaves bark wheat bran and other wastes of agricultural origin for biosorption plant based bio materials have proved to be good biosorbents due to their static binding ability to the metal present in the effluent this binding occurs via cell surface sorption intracellular and extracellular accumulation from the study done on the plant based carnauba fruit biomass it has been found that the presence of lignocellulose on the surface has helped in the sorption process 100 whereas the presence of the carboxylic group in the rubber leaf has helped in the metal sorption from the aqueous solution industrial waste shows a varied range of physiochemical properties that can be effectively used for metal removal the by products produced by industries such as coal fly ash sawdust blast furnace slag industrial sludge etc 101 can be used for biosorbent preparation it has been observed that the by products from biorefineries pulp and paper industry mainly consist of a propyl phenolic group whereas the slag produced by metal and ore industry is rich in silicon and metal oxides red mud produced from the alumina producing industries consists of metal oxides that enhance its biosorption efficiency a study on sawdust showed that the functional groups such as the phenolic the carbonyl the amino the amide and the alcoholic groups in the sawdust a waste product from the timber industry have proved to be advantageous in the sorption process 102 3 2 modifying biosorbents pristine nonliving biosorbents may show low adsorption capacity poor mechanical strength and low selectivity in certain cases 103 to overcome such drawbacks researchers have frequently modified the biosorbent via various techniques and have obtained biosorbents with much enhanced properties these techniques include biosorbent pre treatment biosorbent immobilization addition of magnetic particles to biosorbent and grafting fig 3 shows a broad classification of popular modification techniques table 4 shows the performance of biosorbents that were modified via different techniques 3 2 1 biosorbent pre treatment methods usually biomaterials are pre treated via physical and chemical methods to remove impurities from the biosorbent surface which in turn increase the number of sites available for biosorption and hence the adsorption capacity commonly biosorbents are chemically pre treated with acids bases or inorganic salts by simple washing along with effective removal of impurities from the surface treatment with acid commonly used h2so4 117 hcl 118 and hno3 119 increases the positive charge on the biosorbent surface and hence adsorption capacity and selectivity of biosorbent can be expected to increase for the metal oxyanions like cro4 2 but decrease for the metal cations 120 however acidic treatment should be done with caution since it leads to mass loss of biosorbent and therefore excessive treatment can significantly reduce the biosorbent performance just like acids treatment with bases 121 123 like koh naoh also leads to removal of impurities and mass loss however one important difference between acid and base treatment is that the surface of biosorbent in the case of base experience an increase in negative charge which results in increased selectivity of the biosorbent for the metal cations due to electrostatic attractions bases also add the hydroxyl group to the biosorbent which further increases the adsorption capacity 124 125 unlike acids and bases inorganic salts like nacl nano3 nahco3 are lot safer for pre treatment since mass loss is almost negligible for this case these salts exchange ions with the biosorbent and hence are preferred for continuous flow systems as the released ions will get carried away with the feed 126 127 another chemical method for pre treatment of biosorbent is fenton process the biosorbent is treated with fenton reagent a solution of hydrogen peroxide with ferrous ion which removes the impurities from the biosorbent surface and hence increases the sites available for adsorption moreover it oxidizes the surface of biosorbent and hence increases the functional groups for metal binding 128 though fenton reagent is more effective than inorganic salts towards enhancement in adsorption capacity the toxic nature of hydrogen peroxide can limit the application of fenton process for large scale development of biosorbent while chemical treatment methods have been more effective in increasing the adsorption capacity of biosorbent physical methods can also be used for pre treatment of biosorbent due to their simplicity in physical pre treatment the unmodified biosorbent undergoes thermal treatment i e it may be subjected to heat or can be kept at freezing temperature 63 this method includes mechanical disruption boiling heating autoclave freeze drying or putting in a vacuum 3 2 2 immobilization of biosorbent just like adsorption capacity mechanical strength is also a very important parameter for evaluation of a biosorbent performance unfortunately some biosorbents show very low mechanical strength which results in their poor regeneration and hence limited industrial application 129 however to overcome this drawback immobilization techniques have attracted much attention 130 along with increasing the mechanical strength immobilization of biosorbent also makes it easier to separate the biosorbent from the solution after adsorption process however immobilization has certain drawbacks as well immobilization increases the cost of biosorbent reduces the number of sites available for adsorption of metal ion and increases retention time but still for many cases immobilization is necessary in order to meet strength and stability requirements 131 immobilization techniques can be mainly classified into three types adsorption method embedding method and cross linking method the adsorption method 132 of immobilization is easiest of all the other immobilization methods since it relies on the physical forces like van der waal and electrostatic forces between the biomass and the carrier support for immobilizing the biomass onto the carrier however this method is unpopular owing to the easy to break bonding between the biosorbent and the carrier usually this adsorption method is observed for immobilization of inorganic materials like zeolite activated carbon ceramics with biosorbents these inorganic materials themselves have a good adsorption capacity and hence immobilizing those with biosorbent have additional benefit of increased overall adsorption capacity of the immobilized biosorbent 133 another method embedding method 134 is the most common method for immobilization in this method a polymer network traps the biomass molecules and provides the support stability to the biomass molecules organic compounds like agar polyvinyl alcohol pva gel and polyacrylonitrile are few common supports that are used for embedding for the high mechanical strength and chemical stability they impart to the structure 135 similarly sodium alginate is another popular choice for biomass immobilization 136 while sodium alginate provides additional functional groups for metal ion adsorption the mechanical strength it imparts is relatively lower and may not be always sufficient for such cases the third method for immobilization cross linking method can be used 137 often used in combination with other modification methods cross linking method uses a cross linker like glutaraldehyde epichlorohydrin ech and formaldehyde to bind the biomass molecules together and hence increases the mechanical strength of the biosorbent while cross linking alone is also a reliable method for immobilization it is often used in combination with embedding methods for example cross linking saccharomyces cerevisiae with formaldehyde along with embedding with sodium alginate which results in remarkable mechanical strength 138 mostly cross linkers with high number of functional groups are preferred for cross linking method of immobilization since these functional groups act as additional sites for metal ion adsorption 3 2 3 other modifications other than pre treatment of biosorbent there exist other methods as well which can increase the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent one such method is grafting 139 groups like carboxyl hydroxyl that have high affinity for metal ions onto the surface of biosorbent grafting is a very common and cheap method which can not only enhance the adsorption capacity but can also increase the selectivity of the biosorbent towards metal ions since negatively charged groups like coo oh or electron donating group like thiol amine attract the metal ions via electrostatic interactions for example grafting acrylic acid introduces many new carboxyl groups on the biosorbent surface which help in binding of metal ions 140 similarly ethylenediaminetetraacetic anhydride which contains two anhydride groups can be grafted by actylation which binds metal ions via mostly complexation mechanism 141 another method is combining magnetic particles like fe3o4 142 with the biosorbent this method along with increasing the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent makes the separation of biosorbent from the solution after completion of adsorption process very simple such biosorbents can be recovered from the solution easily via help of an external magnetic field moreover they provide additional support to the biomass molecules which increases the overall strength of the biosorbent 143 144 however magnetic particles are susceptible to oxidation in air as well as acidic conditions therefore in order to protect the magnetic properties of the biosorbent in oxidative conditions studies have coated the core of magnetic particles with inert materials like sio2 145 researchers have also embedded photocatalytic materials like tio2 cu2o into the biosorbents which upon irradiation by light helps the adsorption process by oxidizing or reducing the metal ion into a valence state which is more easier for the biosorbent to adsorb 146 3 3 factors affecting biosorption the prevailing operating conditions play an important role in the biosorption process main factors affecting biosorption include temperature ph biosorbent dosage and stirring rate optimum ph value for a particular biosorption process depends upon the zero point charge value phzpc of the biosorbent and the targeted metal ions phzpc is that value of ph of the solution at which at the surface charge of biosorbent equals to zero for ph phzpc the surface of biosorbent acquires a positive charge and hence repel positively charged metal ions on the other hand for ph phzpc the surface of biosorbent acquires a negative charge and therefore attracts the positively charged metal ions 147 having said this let s now take into the consideration the metal ions that are targeted for biosorption almost all the heavy metal ions including cd ii pb ii ni ii cu ii and zn ii exist in their cationic form in the solution therefore a drastic increase in their uptake is observed when the ph value surpasses phzpc value ph phzpc 148 149 but if the ph of the solution is lower than the phzpc values h3o ions from the solution occupy the active sites on the biosorbent surface which were originally supposed to be occupied by metal ions and the positive charge on the surface on the biosorbent repels the positively charged metal ions leading to an overall decreased adsorption however a very different behaviour is observed when cr vi ions are adsorption target it has been observed that the removal efficiency increases with decrease in ph value for the case of cr vi 150 151 this is due to the fact that at low ph cr vi ions exist in anionic form i e hcro4 is the dominant species in the solution and hence they are attracted to biosorbent surface via electrostatic interactions when ph phzpc as the ph increases biosorbent surface becomes negatively charged resulting in the repulsion between biosorbent and hcro4 leading to decreased removal of cr vi however for all metal ions an optimum ph value should be calculated since at very large ph values this large ph value range depends upon concentration of metal ions in the solution but it s typically greater than 7 metal ions start to precipitate leading to low adsorption 152 153 stability and solubility of ligands and biosorbent depend upon temperature most of the biosorption processes were observed to be endothermic so increasing the temperature increases the removal efficiency as surface activity is raised 154 however the temperature should be optimized if the temperature is too high the active biomolecules in the biosorbent will degrade resulting in a changed active site structure and pore size of the biosorbent resulting in a decrease of removal however for large scale applications it is costly to maintain the desired optimum temperature therefore most of the studies have been conducted at room temperatures 92 93 for exothermic reactions activity decreases with an increase in temperature 155 generally metal uptake increases with an increase in biosorbent dosage as the number of active site increases 156 however it has also been observed that metal removal percentage first reaches a maximum and then start decreasing as the biosorbent dose is increased reason being that in case of very high dosage biosorbent particles start to agglomerate and hence the active sites start to overlap with each other which results in overall decrease in removal efficiency 157 increasing agitation speed helps in overcoming mass transfer resistance but it should be maintained within a range or else biosorbent fragmentation can take place generally agitation speed is kept between 120 rpm 200 rpm from table 3 it can be observed that uptake of ni ii was maximum for litchi chinensis seeds with results being best obtained at room temperature keeping ph 7 5 adsorbent dosage as 1 g l and agitation speed of 180 rpm 84 similarly for cd ii ions a very high uptake was achieved with nettle ash with calculated optimum values for ph temperature adsorbent dosage and agitation speed being equal to 6 30 c 0 5 g l 180 rpm respectively 76 likewise for pb ii ions highest adsorption capacity was obtained with 2 5 mg l of anadara inaequivalvis shells in a ph range of 5 5 5 with agitation speed of 350 rpm at 30 c 94 for the case of zn ii a very high uptake was achieved with sugarcane baggase as raw material with optimum values for ph adsorbent dosage and agitation speed calculated to be 5 1 25 g l and 120 rpm respectively in a temperature range from 35 c to 49 c 50 similarly in case of cu ii maximum uptake was observed for 1 g l coconut husk when agitation speed was kept equal to 120 rpm with ph equal to 5 at 30 c 48 for the case of cr vi ions highest adsorption capacity was observed with exhausted coffee waste and as expected best removal was obtained for a relatively lower ph value that was equal to 3 and the optimum values for temperature adsorbent dosage and agitation speed were equal to 25 c 6 67 g l and 40 rpm respectively 66 3 4 biosorption isotherm at equilibrium solute concentration and constant temperature interactive behaviour between the metal and the biosorbent has been studied with the help of biosorption isotherm it helps in understanding the biosorption mechanism and also helps to determine the arrangement of biosorption sites and adsorption of metal ions onto the biosorbent surface it helps in optimizing the usage of biosorbent for a particular system table 5 shows the common isotherms used in the study according to langmuir model uptake of metal occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer sorption the model provides the relationship between metal adsorption on the biosorbent surface and its equilibrium concentration in the effluent this model is based on three assumptions i e adsorption can occur only at a specific number of the sites present on the surface adsorption can only take place in a monolayer fashion i e only one single layer of molecules will attach to the biosorbent surface and adsorbate is strongly attracted to biosorbent in a solution freundlich isotherm depicted a good fit for many studies especially when concentration of metal ion was low it has the capability of describing the biosorption process for a wide variety of biosorbents this model expresses the biosorbent surface as heterogeneous and adsorption as multilayer with different intermolecular interactions bet model which is a two parameter model is used for multilayer adsorption assuming each layer obeys langmuir isotherm temkin isotherm is a model used to assess the relationship between the biosorbent surface and the adsorption heat of all molecules it shows a linear decrease in heat of adsorption of all molecules with an increase in biosorbent surface coverage 100 158 r p model is used to describe biosorption equilibrium in a broad dimension of concentrations 159 r p model is a three parameter model and contains properties of the freundlich and the langmuir isotherm langmuir isotherm fits most of the experimental data obtained by biosorption studies suggesting homogeneous biosorbent surface and mono layer binding on the surface of biosorbent 160 162 freundlich isotherm also fitted well with the experimental data in many studies suggesting multilayer adsorption and heterogeneous surface of biosorbent 163 165 table 3 provides the information on biosorbents performance along with the isotherm model they followed 3 5 kinetic study analysis of the kinetic model for biosorption study is vital to understand the reaction pathway mechanism and dynamics of the biosorption process it helps in determining physiochemical interaction mass transport and rate determining steps in the biosorption process also knowledge about kinetics of metal adsorption helps in determination of optimum conditions for adsorption processes moreover for continuous processes reactor dimensions and residence time are determined with the help of kinetics study for biosorption processes mostly it was observed that either pseudo first order 166 or pseudo second order kinetic model was followed fig 4 depicts the common kinetic model used in the biosorption process in pseudo first order model occupancy rate of sites is directly proportional to the number of sites that are unoccupied 99 whereas the pseudo second order considers metal adsorption as a function of the number of the free active sites and the number of metal ions in the solution the pseudo first order model has one major drawback that it fits well with the data obtained from experiments only for initial few minutes of the adsorption process as the contact time increases the plot between time t and log qe qt starts to lose it linearity where qe qtrepresent the sorption capacity at equilibrium and time t respectively one possible reason for this deviation from linearity can be the possibility of time lag due to external resistance controlling at the beginning of the biosorption process since this time lag is difficult to quantify the deviation between experimental and theoretical value of sorption capacity cannot be controlled 30 therefore to obtain better results for longer time period pseudo second order kinetic model is usually a better choice for fitting the experimental data from biosorption process moreover for chemisorption processes pseudo second order considers the bonding between biosorbent and adsorbate via their valence forces which further makes this model better than pseudo first order kinetic model 167 while pseudo second order model is very successful it has one disadvantage as well since it is a pseudo kinetic model a new rate constant is obtained for each change in system variable and therefore it becomes necessary to develop an equation which correlates the pseudo rate constant with each variable 30 other popular kinetic models are intra particle diffusion model and elovich kinetic model according to the intra particle diffusion model rapid adsorption occurs initially and then a slow sorption occurs where the intra particle diffusion dominates and then finally solute starts moving from larger pores to micropores leading to equilibrium 168 on the other hand elovich model is famous for describing kinetics at heterogeneous energy solid biosorbent surfaces 99 in this work it was observed that generally the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted better than other models 169 172 table 3 provides information on biosorbents performance along with the kinetics model they followed 4 mechanism of biosorption sorbents used for biosorption are derived from different sources raw materials used for biosorbent synthesis are generally complex and diverse hence it implies that metal uptake can be facilitated by different ways it is important to understand biosorption mechanism in order to improve the understanding of metal binding to biosorbent surface increase biosorbent efficiency and control metal removal moreover knowledge about the process mechanism helps in choosing the appropriate method for biosorbent regeneration depending upon choice of biosorbent there are different type of functional group such as amide amine carbonyl hydroxyl imine sulfonate carboxyl phosphate thioether phenolic and phosphodiester groups that can attract metal ion towards the surface 173 175 in some cases functional group can possess barriers in biosorption process due to steric conformational or other factors mechanism of biosorption gets affected by binding site of biosorbent binding site availability affinity between active site and metal and type of binding site sorption can follow one mechanism or combination of mechanisms hence it is not feasible to imply general mechanism different mechanism has been proposed to understand the process such as ion exchange chelation surface complexation electrostatic interaction etc fig 5 gives an overview on different types of biosorption mechanism table 6 gives the information on the mechanism followed by different biosorbents 4 1 physical adsorption a weak van der waals attraction between sorbate and surface facilitates physical adsorption which is a reversible process this phenomenon is basically affected by surface area or by ph of the solution 203 54 2 however mostly for biosorption of metal ions this mechanism has not played much of an important role this can be attributed to the weak binding between biosorbent and adsorbate via van der waals force nevertheless exceptions were observed where the physical adsorption mechanism was the dominant mechanism for the process one such example was observed when cu ii was adsorbed onto the rubber leaf powder based biosorbent 54 204 206 table 7 below summarizes the results of the column studies done during the adsorption of various heavy metals by few biomass based adsorbents 4 2 ion exchange the phenomenon where ion bounded on biosorbent surface is exchanged with other ion in solution is called as ion exchange 118 it is generally a reversible process though there are a few studies that focus on biosorption mechanism studies which include biosorption mechanism mostly reported ion exchange as one of the governing mechanism of process this mechanism was observed in most of the studies and provided major driving force for adsorption process ion exchange mechanism can be generally represented as 225 m x x h y x h m y x where mx is metal ion myx is sorbed mx and hy represent number of acid site on solid surface 176 179 release of mg2 ca2 and na ions into the solution gives a sign that biosorption process underwent ion exchange mechanism in one such study authors studied the mechanism of cu ii adsorption on macrocystis pyrifera biomass the results showed that adsorption proceeded dominantly by exchange of cu ii ions with ca 2 and mg 2 197 ionic strength is a crucial factor that affects the ion exchange mechanism and hence varying the ionic strength can help in determining whether the ion exchange mechanism was followed or not for example while studying the adsorption of cr vi on the date pit biomass researchers increased the amount of nacl in the solution and noticed no significant changes in the biosorbent performance which indicated that ion exchange mechanism was not dominant for this process 51 4 3 complexation complexation mechanism involves formation of complex by the combination of two or more species formation in which central position is occupied by metal bound by ligands are known as mononuclear complexes polynuclear complexes are formed when there exist more than one metal ion in the centre bounded with ligands multidentate ligands are more preferred than monodentate complexes as the former contains multiple ligands leading to attraction of multiple ions 188 a study utilized walnut shell for adsorption of pb ii ions the experiments were conducted on two biosorbents walnut shell ws and walnut shell grafted with sulphur containing functional group xanthate sws the results showed that lead adsorption significantly increased from ws to sws this was attributed to the complexation reaction that took place between the xanthate and lead ion the sulphur containing group xanthate is a soft ligand group and lead ion belongs to soft acid group hence in accordance to pearson acid base theory it was expected that xanthate and lead ion will have high affinity for each other and therefore the complexation reaction between the two significantly enhanced the lead adsorption 185 4 4 chelation chelates are complex ring structures in which the electron donating atoms adhere to metal ion at more than a single place simultaneously this is a special case of complexation mechanism with speciality being the formation of rings generally polydentate ligands are involved in reaction to aid formation of stable structure by multiple bonding stability of structure increases with increase in ligand binding site chelates are comparatively more stable than complexes due to binding of metal ions at several sites 226 functional groups like rcoo oh so2 and nh3 were found to be commonly involved in chelating the metal ions among all functional groups nh3 was observed to be most efficient in removing the heavy metals as for this case chelation and electrostatic interaction both took place simultaneously 225 recently a study focused on biosorption of cr iii cu ii onto soyabean meal wastes sbm investigated the mechanism of this process ftir analysis showed that the biosorbent was rich in carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl groups to understand the role of each functional group in chelating the metal ions the carboxyl groups were blocked via esterification reaction and hydroxyl groups were blocked via methylation reaction individually it was observed that while the blocking of carboxyl groups decreased the biosorption efficiency by 54 4 for cr iii and by 51 for cu ii blocking hydroxyl groups decreased the biosorption efficiency by 30 for cr iii and by 28 for cu ii these results clearly indicated the dominance of chelation mechanism for this process while the ion exchange mechanism also played a role in metal ion adsorption onto sbm 192 4 5 surface precipitation formation of insoluble metal oxides and hydroxides on the surface of biosorbent is referred to as surface precipitation in case of metabolism independent biosorbent precipitation occurs due to chemical reaction such as oxidation reduction reaction between surface functional group of biosorbent generally this type of mechanism is observed when the metal concentration on the biosorbent surface increases beyond the capability of the biosorbent the adsorption rate via surface precipitation is much slower in comparison to other mechanisms 54 192 227 228 in a recent study researchers investigated the performance of aloe vera wastes for adsorption of uranium and cadmium the high performance biosorbent used multiple mechanisms to adsorb 370 4 and 104 2 mg g of uranium and cadmium these mechanisms included ion exchange physical adsorption and surface precipitation 54 5 regeneration and desorption study of biosorbent as we know biosorption is being studied for the past few decades but still it faces some hindrances in large scale applications one of the chief studies before the industrial application is desorption and regeneration study desorption studies can help the industry to get back precious metal which was lost in the effluent and regeneration studies will help in understanding the method of reusing spent biosorbent and decreasing the demand of virgin biosorbent regeneration studies are usually important where the raw material for biosorbent is not easily available or the synthesis process is time and cost consuming generally the desorption process depends on the mechanical strength 229 230 of the biosorbent and the mechanism of the biosorption process 67 desorption study can be broadly classified into destructive 231 120 and non destructive methods 136 160 fig 6 a destructive method for metal recovery can be used if biosorbent employed is of very low cost this method is generally carried out by either recovering the metal from ash after combustion of the biosorbent or dissolution of the biosorbent in a strong chemical which will in turn loosen the metallic bond on the surface in a study by 232 on exhausted pine cone shell which was implied in sorption of lead and copper it was observed that after pyrolysis about 99 and 95 of lead and copper respectively were recovered from char of metal laden biosorbent similarly a study conducted on waste olive solid suggested that incineration of exhausted biosorbent resulted in recovery of 96 nickel and copper metal from char of exhausted biosorbent 233 nonetheless the major disadvantage of using this technique is high sludge generation and as a result it increases the sludge disposal cost hence the researchers have focussed more on the non destructive techniques as the biosorbent can be recycled for this case non destructive techniques can be done via two methods either by physical treatment or by chemical treatment in physical treatment metal is recovered using specific unit operations such as microwaving or heating while in chemical treatment different elements such as metal salts 234 acids 48 or alkalis 49 are used for metal recovery 235 when an acid usually hcl hno3 or h2so4 is used for desorption numerous hydronium ions and protons are introduced in the solution and hence they compete with each other for active sites and as a result metal ion desorbs from the biosorbent surface and forms a complex with acid radical ion 236 recently to desorb uranium vi and cadmium ii from the surface of aloe vera wastes 0 1 m h2so4 was used the results obtained showed more than 96 desorption efficiency for both the metal ions and for the second cycle of adsorption removal efficiency achieved was more than 93 54 on the other hand the addition of alkali usually naoh or nh4oh lowers the degree of protonation of the biosorbent surface therefore leading to desorption in order to desorb pb ii cr vi metal ions from the surface of functionalised oil palm leaves 0 5 mol l of naoh was used the desorption efficiency achieved was greater than 99 for both the metal ions and the removal efficiency of the biosorbent remained at 88 and 90 for pb ii and cr vi even after completion of five cycles 237 one practical advantage of employing acidic or basic treatment for regeneration is that acids bases are common waste products for many industries therefore employing them for regeneration processes can help in waste utilization however acid base treatment can also result in significant mass loss of the biosorbent in few cases moreover in practical application acids and bases may corrode the equipment over time therefore other chemical methods like desorption via metal salt or complexing agent might be more appropriate for some cases metal salts are preferred for the cases where ion exchange is the leading mechanism for adsorption process when metal salts are used the ion exchange mechanism leads again but this time for desorption of metal ions from the biosorbent surface famous examples of metal salts include nacl kno3 and cacl2 a recent study used 2 0 m kno3 for desorbing gold and silver particles from the surface of aminoguanidyl imprinted glutaraldehyde crosslinked chitosan the desorption efficiency achieved was greater than 95 for both the ions and the biosorbent showed 85 removal efficiency even after five cycles 238 complexing agents like edta are also a popular choice for desorbing metal ions these agents are rich in electron donating groups like amine and hydroxyl and hence form stable complex structures with the metal ions via donating their electrons resulting in desorption of the ions recently to desorb lead and cadmium ions from the surface of mistletoe leaves 0 05 m edta was applied the removal efficiency of the biosorbent remained almost unchanged even after three cycles which proves the calibre of edta as a regenerating agent 239 desorption and regeneration are important processes since these processes reduce the overall operating cost of the effluent treatment plant by making it possible to reuse the biosorbent and by making metal recovery feasible 6 from lab to industry much research has been conducted on various biosorbents for evaluating their adsorption properties however most of these studies were limited only to batch experiments 240 batch experiments are easy to perform and can provide good insight into the biosorbent properties especially capacity mechanism and kinetics of the biosorption process batch experiments are therefore helpful for screening out the biosorbents that satisfy necessary but not sufficient conditions for industrial application however batch processes are not usually used on industrial scale due to their inability to treat large volumes of effluent rather continuous flow processes are developed to treat the industrial effluent more specifically fixed bed column reactors are the most popular choice for industrial applications 131 in fixed bed column reactor design effluent streams are pumped and fed from top into a column say b1 packed with biosorbents or influents are fed from bottom of the column as this stream flows down the column biosorbents packed into the column takes up the metal ions from the stream and the purified effluent stream exits from the bottom of the column to reach s1 fig 7 from s1 effluent can be either discharged directly or some acidic basic treatment of the effluent maybe necessary in order to ensure neutrality of the discharged stream this process continues until the column bed reaches saturation i e most of the sites available for metal adsorption are now are already utilized which results in increased metal ion concentration in the exit effluent stream therefore the flow of effluent stream into b1 is either stopped or diverted into another column bed say b2 while b1 is treated with regenerating agents regenerating agents like acid or basic solution are fed from the top of the column as these regenerating agents flow through column they desorb the metal ions from the biosorbent surface and these ions flow down with the regenerating stream the exit stream from this regeneration process is diverted to s2 fig 7 from where it can be taken for recovery of metal ions 241 initially when the effluent is fed to the column from the top the few upper packed layers of the biosorbent adsorb most of the metal ions from the effluent and therefore almost metal free stream flows through the subsequent layers fig 8 in this case upper packed layer zone where most of the adsorption is taking place is called mass transfer zone mtz after some time the upper layers become saturated with metal ions and are no longer able to adsorb significant amount of ions in that case most of the metal ions are adsorbed by the middle layers of the biosorbent packaging and almost metal free stream flows through the lower layers of the column the process continues until saturation of the complete column takes place after which metal ion concentration in the exit flow stream is no longer below the standard levels 242 to make sure that the column bed is not used further after its saturation it becomes necessary to constantly monitor the metal ion concentration in exiting stream techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy and plasma mass spectrometry are limited only to lab based experiments and are insufficient for purposes where constant monitoring for metal ion concentration is required therefore for industrial purposes chemical optical sensors 243 like surface enhanced raman scattering 244 and surface plasmon resonance sensors 245 can be applied the working principle of these sensors is based upon the changes in optical properties that take place due to the interaction between biosorbent and immobilized sensors just like adsorption capacity is an important parameter for measuring the biosorbent efficiency break through curves are important for evaluating efficiency of the fixed bed column process break through curves which usually take up s curved shaped with varying steepness provide a fair idea for maximum amount of the volume that a column bed can treat depending upon the maximum permissible exit effluent stream metal concentration 246 a biosorbent which showed success in batch experiments performed in laboratory may not be able to retain its success when used for treating real industrial effluent due to several possible reasons one of the prime reasons is that real industrial effluents are much more complex than the solutions prepared in lab the co existing metal ions and anions in the industrial effluents are known to compete with target heavy metal ions for active sites on the biosorbent which results in overall decreased metal removal efficiency of the biosorbent 247 another issue which is not realized during batch experiments is that some biosorbents have tendency to swell during the adsorption process due to swelling the liquid flow may get blocked through the column resulting in a failed process however with help of biosorbent immobilization 248 and mixing of biosorbent with ion exchangers 249 swelling property of biosorbent can be controlled ph is also a very crucial factor which determines overall adsorption performance while it is very easy to work with optimum ph values in batch experiments it is impractical to control the ph value for continuous flow processes where large volumes of effluent are to be treated since effluents are unlikely to have ph in optimum ranges biosorbents which show less dependency on ph are more likely to be successful in industrial processes 241 moreover decreasing biosorbent particle size is known to increase the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent since with decreasing particle size there is an increase in specific area however very small particles may not be useful in industrial processes even though it may have high adsorption capacity this is simply because exhaustion time of the biosorbent bed decreases with decreasing the particle size in addition to this smaller particle size results in high pressure drop in the column bed 250 recently to test the performance of olive tree pruning for lead adsorption 251 experiments were performed on lab scale ls and pilot scale ps for ls experiments column with 1 5 cm diameter d and length of 23 cm h was used and for ps studies column with 5 cm diameter d and length of 56 cm h was used the scaling from ls to ps was done maintaining three similarities 1 geometric similarity h d h d 2 kinetic similarity physical properties of solution were kept constant 3 dynamic similarity physical properties of biosorbent were not changed it was reported that for a bed depth of 11 3 cm in both cases breakthrough time decreased from 241 min to 105 min for ls and from 195 min to 75 min for ps when the effluent flow rate was increased from 4 to 8 ml min and from 44 to 89 ml min respectively the decrease in saturation time with increase in flow rate could be due to large turbulence effect and reduced external mass transfer resistance in the case of high flow rate for all cases of experiments performed removal efficiency for ps was only slightly less than that in case of ls overall more than 99 removal efficiency was achieved for all cases in another study column with 6 35 cm diameter and 38 cm length was packed with sugarcane bagasse and used for mn ii adsorption 252 the flow rate was fixed to 7 l min and the maximum removal efficiency reported was 51 75 in yet another study effect of column height was studied on saturation time for copper removal from the column 1 1 diameter packed with amino functionalized ramie stalk based biosorbent fen 253 at a constant flow rate of 5 l min it was noticed that saturation time increases as the bed height is increased 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm as shown in the fig 9 this was expected since for greater column height there are more number of sites available for adsorption and hence will require more time for saturation also the maximum adsorption capacities observed were 0 538 0 501 and 0 468 mmol g 1 for heights 5 10 15 cm respectively this reduction in adsorption capacity with the column height could be due to effect of liquid channeling and maldistribution in high beds 254 7 conclusions in the past few years an enormous amount of research has been conducted on biosorbents the present study focussed on low cost biosorbents that were used for heavy metal ions adsorption from the lab based synthetic solutions or real industrial wastewater in this study it was observed that most of the times biomass went under certain modifications for its best utilization as a biosorbent fenton reagent acids bases and inorganic salts were mostly applied for chemical pre treatment of the biosorbent which usually increased the adsorption capacity of the biosorbent while embedding methods combined with cross linking provided biosorbents very high mechanical strength the different factors affecting biosorption such as temperature ph contact time agitation speed biosorbent dose particle size etc have been included in the present study most of the biosorbent processes were endothermic and spontaneous by nature also to understand the biosorption mechanism isotherm and kinetics of the various processes were studied most of the processes followed the langmuir or the freundlich isotherm and fitted best with the pseudo second order kinetic model moreover from regeneration studies it was realized that highest desorption percentages are usually achieved with acidic eluents moreover from bed column studies it was realized that biosorbents can prove to be a good alternative for commercially available adsorbents 8 recommendations although work on the biosorption process is being conducted from a long time still the following knowledge gaps were observed in the wake of this review 1 more focus on the real effluent system will help in a better understanding of the behavior of the biosorbent in the presence of multi metals this study will also help in synthesizing biosorbents which can simultaneously handle multi metals 2 regeneration and desorption studies are still limited which pose a challenge in the application of biosorbent at an industrial level also more focus should be given to selective desorption of expensive metal ions proper study in this direction will help in value addition to the biosorption process 3 currently the disposal or recycling study of the spent catalyst is limited a proper study in this direction will help in reducing the challenge of biosorbent disposal after completion of biosorption process 4 for industrial application current methods for biosorbent immobilization are too much complicated therefore it is required to search for easier biosorbent immobilization methods declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

13811,evaporation ponds are a known cost effective option which are also environmentally friendly enough to be considered a viable solution for disposal of oil produced water opw especially in areas with high evaporation rates however there is no study to particularly relate opw physico chemical properties and climatic variables to optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds this study therefore presents a multi objective stochastic optimization framework as a first attempt to determine optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds considering simultaneous effects of climatic variables and opw physico chemical parameters on opw evaporation opwe rates daily based experimental data were collected from oilfield located at south eastern arabian peninsula for a period of one year a model was derived using dimensional analysis to estimate opwe as a function of opw physico chemical properties clear water evaporation and climatic variables fifty stochastic evaporation scenarios were examined to include uncertainties associated with climatic and opw parameters conditional value at risk was utilized to reduce the risk of opw overflow from evaporation ponds a multi objective nsga ii model was developed to simultaneously maximize average volume of opwe minimize evaporation pond dimensions and also the risk of opw overflow results show that the derived opwe model performed exceptionally well in opwe estimation by involving key parameters influencing the opwe moreover it was found that developed framework increased the magnitude of opwe up to 20 while inaccurate evaporation estimation can seriously increase probability of failure of evaporation ponds the proposed framework was found to be efficient to determine the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds for disposal of not only the opw but also other industrial and mining wastewater keywords oil produced water opw oil produced water evaporation opwe evaporation pond dimensional analysis multi objective optimization conditional value at risk cvar 1 introduction water that exists in the underground geologic formations is usually extracted during gas and oil production and it is known as oil produced water opw 1 the opw is known to be rich in dissolved solids and may as well contain radioactive elements 2 3 or contain high concentrations of extracted hydrocarbons and metals 4 normally about 65 of opw generated globally is re injected into petroleum reservoirs for pressure maintenance while 30 of it is disposed into deep wells a practice which is not environmentally sound and operationally consumes massive energy 5 the remaining 5 is discharged into surface water or marine environments thus introducing toxic compounds in such environmental compartments 6 8 the discharge of opw has caused serious environmental pollution of surface water subsurface water and marine ecosystems moreover it has caused numerous adverse human health effects and caused socio economic issues in oilfield host communities such as niger delta region 9 turkey 6 north sea and gulf of mexico 10 and nueces bay texas 2 to date a wide variety of physical biological and chemical treatment approaches and technologies have been developed and applied for opw treatment 11 1 7 12 these include chemical oxidation 13 14 macro porous polymer extraction technology 15 16 freeze thaw evaporation 17 18 thermal technologies 19 ion exchange technology 20 membrane filtration technology 21 23 adsorption 24 biological aerated filters media filtration and electrodialysis electrodialysis reversal 25 26 phytoremediation 27 altelarainsm process 12 as well as hydrocyclones and gas flotation 28 1 these are major methods and technologies utilized to treat opw in various parts of the world nonetheless the huge maintenance and operational costs are the major drawbacks of these techniques which negatively impact their overall performance the experience of implementing these approaches in remote areas particularly in developing nations wherein many oil assets are located has revealed that they are not economically and technically feasible because of lack of local skilled workforce substantial maintenance cost and poor management 5 29 31 moreover traditional solutions such as deep well injection and discharge into surface water or marine environments are increasingly being discouraged due to environmental concerns over the opw and also the stringent regulations 32 evaporation ponds are attractive engineering solution to the disposal of wastewater including oil produced water reject water reject brine and concentrate in arid and semi arid regions due to the significant availability of solar energy 33 35 moreover evaporation ponds have been widely used for a variety of purposes such as salt production from sea water or other brines e g 36 40 and disposal of subsurface agricultural drain water e g 41 46 olive oil mill wastewater e g 47 50 industrial wastewater e g 51 53 mine wastewater e g 54 56 reject brine from desalination plants e g 57 33 and landfill leachate e g 58 the design of evaporation pond depends mainly upon the knowledge of the evaporation rate which is a function of the characteristics of the wastewater and local climatic condition 34 43 59 60 the effect of salinity on the evaporation rates has been investigated in several studies using both laboratory and field experiments 61 62 leaney and christen 2000 63 66 67 40 59 60 68 69 70 71 it also been reported that the rate of evaporation for different brines vary from 70 to 10 of the freshwater evaporation rate 40 oroud 65 proposed a model to estimate the evaporation rate based on the calculation of the salinity effects on the saturation vapor pressure parker et al 63 concluded that the evaporation rates of clear water were lower than those of fresh effluent evaporation rates which were collected from a feed yard holding pond in another study leaney and christen 43 indicated that the evaporation rate decreases exponentially with increasing salinity kokya and kokya 62 used water quality data and chemical analysis in lake urmia iran and suggested a simplistic evaporation equation for saline semi saline and freshwater resources izady et al 61 developed a model to formulate municipal wastewater evaporation as a function of wastewater characteristics and climatic factors mickley et al 34 and hauck 72 indicated that the accurate sizing of evaporation pond depends very much upon the precise estimation of the evaporation rate however the effect of evaporation rates on the dimensions of evaporation ponds has scarcily been investigated 58 43 60 pochop et al 60 employed a routing procedure to assess the effects of uncertainty in evaporation rates estimated by kohler nordenson fox equation kohler et al 1955 to develop the probabilities of the success of a specific evaporation pond design leaney and christen 43 developed a spreadsheet model that combines the factors influencing the disposal capacity of evaporation ponds the model inputs include the size of the pond the climatic record evaporation and rainfall estimation from the nearest meteorological station the leakage rate under the pond and the salinity of the water edf 58 determined evaporation pond sizing using an iterative approach by adjusting the value of the bottom surface area in the water balance calculation for an average year however a major drawback in these studies is using the freshwater evaporation equations to estimate the evaporation rate for wastewater i e drain water reject water reject brine concentrate as discussed above equating the freshwater and wastewater evaporation is a strong assumption that can lead to substantial errors in finding the optimum size of the pond and increases the failure potential of ponds designed on freshwater evaporation equations this study relates the trend and pattern of oil produced water evaporation to the dimensions of evaporation ponds and develops a multi stage framework to estimate the oil produced water evaporation optimize the dimensions of evaporation ponds and maximize the rates of oil produced water evaporation considering the opw physico chemical properties and climatic variables the key objectives of this study are to address the following gaps which have not been tackled in the previous investigations to develop a more realistic procedure to estimate the oil produced water evaporation rates based on dimension analysis and one year daily based experimental data to develop a framework not only to optimize the dimensions of evaporation ponds but also to maximize the rates of oil produced water evaporation simultaneously to analyze different stochastic evaporation scenarios to include the uncertainties associated with the climatic variables and the physico chemical properties of the oil produced water to assess the risk of the oil produced water overflow from the evaporation ponds using the conditional value at risk 2 methodology and experimental setup this study was carried out in the following steps i measurement of daily oil produced water opw temperature

considering the uncertainties associated with the opwe rate 2 1 study site and data measurement the experimental setup consisted of two evaporation pans was deployed in the oilfield located at the south eastern arabian peninsula with daily production of more than 100 000 m3 day of the opw the climate of the area is hot and very dry while the monthly air temperature decreases from july to december the increasing trend is observed from january to june humidity is usually low during warmer months and generally the area records no rainfall class a pan 73 a well known evaporation pan was used for this research study the pan is unpainted galvanized iron with the shape of cylindrical and dimensions of 4 feet 121 9 cm diameter and 10 inches 25 4 cm height a wooden frame is installed to allow the air circulation under and around the pan 74 two class a pans were installed and filled with opw and clear water to measure the daily rate of evaporation and daily temperature of each pan over one year from aug 2018 to jul 2019 fig 1 liquid levels were measured in both pans with a needle gauge which is installed within a stilling well the losses of evaporation were determined by calculating the required volume of water to fill the pan to the level of 20 cm if there was rainfall during the time period it was added to the measured evaporation the temperature at 10 cm below the fluid surface was measured with an alcohol thermometer the climatic data were obtained from an onsite weather station the opw samples were collected on a daily basis according to the u s geological survey 75 standard field methods and were analyzed in the environmental engineering laboratory at sultan qaboos university muscat oman the opw parameters including ec tds tss tph bod cod toc and tic were measured through the standard methods for the assessment of wastewater and water 76 it is not feasible to measure the evaporation rate directly from water bodies with large surface areas and instead evaporation pans are normally used for estimations a pan coefficient is required for data calibration due to the larger evaporation rate from pans than direct measurements from water bodies hence the following equation was employed to convert the pan evaporation to pond evaporation 1 e e p k p a n e p where eep and ep are respectively evaporation rate from evaporation pond and pan and kpan is coefficient of pan a pan coefficient of 0 7 was used based on the average coefficient suggested in the literature e g 77 79 2 2 derivation of the oil produced evaporation model dimensional

optimization model was employed to simultaneously maximize the volume of opwe minimize the evaporation pond surface area and minimize the cvar associated with the opw overflow the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii for multi objective optimization model nsga ii mom was employed to obtain the pareto front solutions considering the number and area length and width of the evaporation ponds as well as five opw parameters consisting of tss tph bod cod and toc as decision variables the maximized evaporation volume was determined based on the average of the evaporation volume which was calculated for the fifty different evaporation scenarios to include the associated uncertainties the evaporation scenarios consisting of all climatic variables and opw physical properties were determined by sorting the daily measured data according to the value of the cwe sm section s 3 to reduce the risk of the opw overflow from the evaporation ponds an efficient risk based approach known as conditional value at risk cvar model 82 is employed the cvar a risk measure that determines the value of the excess loss is defined as the average loss occurring over a range of extreme loss scenarios that occur beyond a threshold or value at risk var 85 84 the theory of cvar model is elaborated in the sm section s 5 the model determines the difference between the average opwe rate and the measured one over a year and calculates the opw rise due to the lower opwe rate compared to the average opwe rate by minimizing the cvar the pareto front solutions strike a balance between the evaporation ponds area and opwe rate which results in reliable and cost effective design of the evaporation ponds the formulation of the stochastic multi objective optimization model to obtain the

and coefficient of variation as presented in table 1 the ec and tds are the measurement of the total salt content which vary from 11 7 to 14 7 ms cm and 6 568 to 8 370 mg l with an average of 12 8 ms cm and 7 268 mg l for ec and tds respectively the tss is relatively low with a mean value of 38 mg l and the range of 26 to 50 mg l the bod and cod are measures of required oxygen to break down the organic materials while the bod is poorly variable ranging from 4 0 to 24 0 mg l with an average value of 16 0 mg l the cod ranges considerably from 8 0 to 160 0 mg l with a mean of 38 5 mg l the tph which indicates the mixture of hydrocarbons in crude petroleum varies from 3 to 14 mg l with a mean of 7 mg l although the variation range of the tic is significant in the opw the toc fluctuation is trivial and varies from 0 0 to 2 7 mg l the matrix plots of the opw properties versus opwe rate are presented in fig s 14 sm section s 8 fig 2 shows the variation of daily and monthly estimated opwe along with the cwe an average pan coefficient of 0 7 e g 77 79 was applied to estimate the opwe and cwe using eq 1 while the daily and monthly rate of evaporation for the opw and clear water generally decrease from august to november and increase from february to july the slightly steady evaporation rate was observed for november december and january for the period of aug 2018 through july 2019 the annual evaporation of the opw and clear water were 2 524 and 2 607 mm respectively therefore an average evaporation rate of the opwe was found to be 3 3 lower than the cwe because of high salinity and dissolved solids in the opw in fact the molecular activity of the opw decreased due to the interference of dissolved solids molecules with the water molecules motion which lead to the reduction of the availability of water molecules for the opw evaporation moreover the opw includes fats oil and grease 10 mg l which float on the surface of the opw sm sections s 1 hence the contact between water molecules and the air is reduced due to covering some parts of the surface area by fats oil and grease molecules which lead to a decrease in the evaporation of the opw more details about the measured data analysis are provided in the sm sections s 1 and s 2 3 2 oil produced water evaporation model the coefficients of eq 6 were achieved using the ga optimization method as c 2 792 α 0 941 β 0 039 γ

analysis of the eq 19 is assessed to the different π terms and it is presented in fig s12 sm section s 6 statistics listed in table 2 show the performance of eq 19 to estimate the opwe the high performance in the calibration phase r 2 0 955 rmse 0 48 mm mare 5 12 and ns 0 95 indicates the consistency of the proposed model with the underlying physics of the opwe process the high model performance of the calibrated model for the validation phase using an independent dataset r 2 0 907 rmse 0 53 mm mare 5 83 and ns 0 91 also reveals the robustness of the model in predicting opwe in a broad range of conditions beyond those of the calibration phase fig 3 exhibits the comparison between estimated and measured opwe for the calibration and validation phases as observed the opwe temporal variabilities at different time scales are well captured by the proposed model in particular the general trend and short term fluctuations of the measured and estimated opwe match very well verifying the efficiency and accuracy of the derived model for the opwe estimation the exceptional performance of the opwe model reflects the fact that the key parameters influencing the opwe are well taken into account in the derived opwe model using the dimensional analysis the term with cwe tds r and w parameters demonstrates a major influence on the opwe because of the higher power α in the eq 19 the tds results in a lower saturation vapor pressure due to the decreased chemical potential of the opw and hence a lower evaporation rate on the contrary solar radiation provides heat to enable evaporation such that the increase in the evaporation with the increase in solar radiation is due principally to the increase in internal convection of the opw moreover wind helps to disperse the saturated air in order to allow for further evaporation to occur 3 3 optimal opw parameters and dimensions of evaporation ponds the proposed stochastic multi objective optimization model was utilized to obtain the optimal dimensions of evaporation ponds i e width length and number of ponds along with the optimal values of five opw parameters tss tph bod cod and toc the efficiency of the obtained dimensions is highly dependent on the climatic parameters and the opw properties therefore the daily measured cwe opwe and opw parameters over a period of august 1 2018 to july 30 2019 were considered to examine fifty different stochastic evaporation scenarios as shown in the sm section s 3 the nsga ii mom selects different stochastic values for the decision variables in each iteration and then determines the opwe rate for the fifty evaporation scenarios the model strives to simultaneously minimize the cvar based on the difference between the average and daily opwe rates for the worst case scenarios minimize the total evaporation pond area and maximize the average volume of the opwe fig 4 shows the 20 pareto front solutions generated by the nsga ii mom with a population size of 160 8 20 after reaching the set of maximum 200 generations the variables are set through assessing different values of crossover mutation and population size in a trial and error process sm section s 7 the decision variables and objective values of the pareto front solutions are given in table 3 the optimization model was run several times and the results are compared to ensure that the results are globally optimal sm section s 7 for instance according to the solution 19 an average daily evaporation volume of 46 1 103 m3 can be disposed of through 11 ponds with a surface area of 1434 431 hectare if the determined average annual values for the decision variables are met over a year with a confidence level of 95 the cvar is equal to 792 7 mm which means that in the 5 worst cases the opw can rise 792 7 mm over a year based on the solution 19 as shown in fig 5 the determined optimal opw properties of the solution 19 columns 2 to 6 of table 3 enhance the performance of the evaporation ponds significantly by increasing the opwe rate up to 17 8 a key finding of this study is the significant increase in the opwe through optimizing the impact of the effecting parameters on the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds therefore it is quite rational to implement some mechanisms to change the actual amount of the opw parameters to the optimal values which is proposed in this study however the cost of changing the opw parameters and the inter relation of these parameters together are the major points that should be assessed under an experimental pilot in future studies this study provides the conceptual step and methodology to increase the opwe through the multi objective stochastic optimization model therefore the performance of these findings in real applications should be tested under an experimental pilot setup both in the laboratory and field conditions as a final step in designing the evaporation ponds the pond depth is calculated and presented here the average opwe rate of the solution 19 is 6 79 mm a freeboard is also determined to account for wave action caused by wind and more importantly the opw rise due to the lower evaporation rates compared to the average opwe the analysis of daily measured opwe fig 2 shows that during 30 of the time over a year evaporation rate is less than the average opwe rate of the solution 19 which causes the opw level to rise by 238 mm sm section s 4 fig s 9 moreover based on the equation suggested by mickley 83 the wave height is 260 mm for the study area in the worst condition sm section s 4 hence the depth of the designed ponds is 0 505 meter 6 79 238 260 505 mm one of the fundamental concerns associated with the depth of the opw evaporation ponds is that the dissolved salts will accumulate in the pond due to evaporation and will reduce the designed storage volume forecasting the quantity of evaporite residues is difficult because of variations in the opw quality and in evaporating efficiency therefore the removal of salts from evaporation ponds is necessary in order to maintain evaporating efficiency the disposition of the salts accumulating in the evaporation pond is a long term concern the alternative includes salt harvesting for commercial use e g industrial although there is a potential for commercial salt harvesting the presence of some trace elements may constrain the use of these salts 4 conclusion the evaporation ponds discussed in this study are engineered structures that are being proposed for the disposal of opw especially in arid and semi arid areas with favorable climatic conditions the opwe rates have been observed to a great extent to be dependent upon the physico chemical characteristics of the opw moreover this study has revealed that the decrease in evaporation rates in relation to cwe rates can seriously increase the failure potential of the evaporation ponds designed on the considerations based on cwe criteria moreover failure to estimate accurate opwe could shorten an evaporation pond s lifetime which results in increased maintenance costs due to the high importance of the mentioned fact significant field measurements and laboratory sample analyses are conducted over a one year period to ensure the reliability of the applied data to determine the opwe and the optimal dimensions of the evaporation ponds moreover in this study the developed stochastic multi objective optimization model was used to ascertain the optimal evaporation pond dimensions and opw physical parameters with the maximum volume of the opwe minimum evaporation pond area and minimum risk of the opw overflow the uncertainties associated with the daily climatic variables and the opw properties were examined by developing fifty stochastic evaporation scenarios the risk of the opw overflow from the designed evaporation ponds was also assessed by the cvar as a coherent risk measure the pareto front solutions reveal that the opw overflow depth can reach to one meter in the evaporation ponds in worst case scenarios which is meaningful and should be taken into account for the designing of the evaporation ponds the difference between the average opw overflow depth and the opw overflow depth in worst case scenarios e g 238 mm and 793 mm for the solution 19 is significant which indicates that the sufficient evaporation scenarios should be examined to increase the reliability of the designed evaporation ponds the estimation of the opwe is highly dependent on the simultaneous effects of the climatic variables and the opw properties therefore the optimal opw parameters while minimize the evaporation pond area it can increase the volume of opwe up to 20 it should be emphasized that the developed framework is area independent and therefore the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds can be determined for any interest area given the availability of required data the developed framework will certainly find application in the optimization of the strategies employed in the disposal of opw as well as other types of wastewater systems which is currently a challenge to the industry given the fact that this study is one of the very first of its nature and kind the paper will certainly prove to be of interest to various researchers who work on opw disposal or other types of wastewaters author agreement with the submission of

13811,evaporation ponds are a known cost effective option which are also environmentally friendly enough to be considered a viable solution for disposal of oil produced water opw especially in areas with high evaporation rates however there is no study to particularly relate opw physico chemical properties and climatic variables to optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds this study therefore presents a multi objective stochastic optimization framework as a first attempt to determine optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds considering simultaneous effects of climatic variables and opw physico chemical parameters on opw evaporation opwe rates daily based experimental data were collected from oilfield located at south eastern arabian peninsula for a period of one year a model was derived using dimensional analysis to estimate opwe as a function of opw physico chemical properties clear water evaporation and climatic variables fifty stochastic evaporation scenarios were examined to include uncertainties associated with climatic and opw parameters conditional value at risk was utilized to reduce the risk of opw overflow from evaporation ponds a multi objective nsga ii model was developed to simultaneously maximize average volume of opwe minimize evaporation pond dimensions and also the risk of opw overflow results show that the derived opwe model performed exceptionally well in opwe estimation by involving key parameters influencing the opwe moreover it was found that developed framework increased the magnitude of opwe up to 20 while inaccurate evaporation estimation can seriously increase probability of failure of evaporation ponds the proposed framework was found to be efficient to determine the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds for disposal of not only the opw but also other industrial and mining wastewater keywords oil produced water opw oil produced water evaporation opwe evaporation pond dimensional analysis multi objective optimization conditional value at risk cvar 1 introduction water that exists in the underground geologic formations is usually extracted during gas and oil production and it is known as oil produced water opw 1 the opw is known to be rich in dissolved solids and may as well contain radioactive elements 2 3 or contain high concentrations of extracted hydrocarbons and metals 4 normally about 65 of opw generated globally is re injected into petroleum reservoirs for pressure maintenance while 30 of it is disposed into deep wells a practice which is not environmentally sound and operationally consumes massive energy 5 the remaining 5 is discharged into surface water or marine environments thus introducing toxic compounds in such environmental compartments 6 8 the discharge of opw has caused serious environmental pollution of surface water subsurface water and marine ecosystems moreover it has caused numerous adverse human health effects and caused socio economic issues in oilfield host communities such as niger delta region 9 turkey 6 north sea and gulf of mexico 10 and nueces bay texas 2 to date a wide variety of physical biological and chemical treatment approaches and technologies have been developed and applied for opw treatment 11 1 7 12 these include chemical oxidation 13 14 macro porous polymer extraction technology 15 16 freeze thaw evaporation 17 18 thermal technologies 19 ion exchange technology 20 membrane filtration technology 21 23 adsorption 24 biological aerated filters media filtration and electrodialysis electrodialysis reversal 25 26 phytoremediation 27 altelarainsm process 12 as well as hydrocyclones and gas flotation 28 1 these are major methods and technologies utilized to treat opw in various parts of the world nonetheless the huge maintenance and operational costs are the major drawbacks of these techniques which negatively impact their overall performance the experience of implementing these approaches in remote areas particularly in developing nations wherein many oil assets are located has revealed that they are not economically and technically feasible because of lack of local skilled workforce substantial maintenance cost and poor management 5 29 31 moreover traditional solutions such as deep well injection and discharge into surface water or marine environments are increasingly being discouraged due to environmental concerns over the opw and also the stringent regulations 32 evaporation ponds are attractive engineering solution to the disposal of wastewater including oil produced water reject water reject brine and concentrate in arid and semi arid regions due to the significant availability of solar energy 33 35 moreover evaporation ponds have been widely used for a variety of purposes such as salt production from sea water or other brines e g 36 40 and disposal of subsurface agricultural drain water e g 41 46 olive oil mill wastewater e g 47 50 industrial wastewater e g 51 53 mine wastewater e g 54 56 reject brine from desalination plants e g 57 33 and landfill leachate e g 58 the design of evaporation pond depends mainly upon the knowledge of the evaporation rate which is a function of the characteristics of the wastewater and local climatic condition 34 43 59 60 the effect of salinity on the evaporation rates has been investigated in several studies using both laboratory and field experiments 61 62 leaney and christen 2000 63 66 67 40 59 60 68 69 70 71 it also been reported that the rate of evaporation for different brines vary from 70 to 10 of the freshwater evaporation rate 40 oroud 65 proposed a model to estimate the evaporation rate based on the calculation of the salinity effects on the saturation vapor pressure parker et al 63 concluded that the evaporation rates of clear water were lower than those of fresh effluent evaporation rates which were collected from a feed yard holding pond in another study leaney and christen 43 indicated that the evaporation rate decreases exponentially with increasing salinity kokya and kokya 62 used water quality data and chemical analysis in lake urmia iran and suggested a simplistic evaporation equation for saline semi saline and freshwater resources izady et al 61 developed a model to formulate municipal wastewater evaporation as a function of wastewater characteristics and climatic factors mickley et al 34 and hauck 72 indicated that the accurate sizing of evaporation pond depends very much upon the precise estimation of the evaporation rate however the effect of evaporation rates on the dimensions of evaporation ponds has scarcily been investigated 58 43 60 pochop et al 60 employed a routing procedure to assess the effects of uncertainty in evaporation rates estimated by kohler nordenson fox equation kohler et al 1955 to develop the probabilities of the success of a specific evaporation pond design leaney and christen 43 developed a spreadsheet model that combines the factors influencing the disposal capacity of evaporation ponds the model inputs include the size of the pond the climatic record evaporation and rainfall estimation from the nearest meteorological station the leakage rate under the pond and the salinity of the water edf 58 determined evaporation pond sizing using an iterative approach by adjusting the value of the bottom surface area in the water balance calculation for an average year however a major drawback in these studies is using the freshwater evaporation equations to estimate the evaporation rate for wastewater i e drain water reject water reject brine concentrate as discussed above equating the freshwater and wastewater evaporation is a strong assumption that can lead to substantial errors in finding the optimum size of the pond and increases the failure potential of ponds designed on freshwater evaporation equations this study relates the trend and pattern of oil produced water evaporation to the dimensions of evaporation ponds and develops a multi stage framework to estimate the oil produced water evaporation optimize the dimensions of evaporation ponds and maximize the rates of oil produced water evaporation considering the opw physico chemical properties and climatic variables the key objectives of this study are to address the following gaps which have not been tackled in the previous investigations to develop a more realistic procedure to estimate the oil produced water evaporation rates based on dimension analysis and one year daily based experimental data to develop a framework not only to optimize the dimensions of evaporation ponds but also to maximize the rates of oil produced water evaporation simultaneously to analyze different stochastic evaporation scenarios to include the uncertainties associated with the climatic variables and the physico chemical properties of the oil produced water to assess the risk of the oil produced water overflow from the evaporation ponds using the conditional value at risk 2 methodology and experimental setup this study was carried out in the following steps i measurement of daily oil produced water opw temperature

considering the uncertainties associated with the opwe rate 2 1 study site and data measurement the experimental setup consisted of two evaporation pans was deployed in the oilfield located at the south eastern arabian peninsula with daily production of more than 100 000 m3 day of the opw the climate of the area is hot and very dry while the monthly air temperature decreases from july to december the increasing trend is observed from january to june humidity is usually low during warmer months and generally the area records no rainfall class a pan 73 a well known evaporation pan was used for this research study the pan is unpainted galvanized iron with the shape of cylindrical and dimensions of 4 feet 121 9 cm diameter and 10 inches 25 4 cm height a wooden frame is installed to allow the air circulation under and around the pan 74 two class a pans were installed and filled with opw and clear water to measure the daily rate of evaporation and daily temperature of each pan over one year from aug 2018 to jul 2019 fig 1 liquid levels were measured in both pans with a needle gauge which is installed within a stilling well the losses of evaporation were determined by calculating the required volume of water to fill the pan to the level of 20 cm if there was rainfall during the time period it was added to the measured evaporation the temperature at 10 cm below the fluid surface was measured with an alcohol thermometer the climatic data were obtained from an onsite weather station the opw samples were collected on a daily basis according to the u s geological survey 75 standard field methods and were analyzed in the environmental engineering laboratory at sultan qaboos university muscat oman the opw parameters including ec tds tss tph bod cod toc and tic were measured through the standard methods for the assessment of wastewater and water 76 it is not feasible to measure the evaporation rate directly from water bodies with large surface areas and instead evaporation pans are normally used for estimations a pan coefficient is required for data calibration due to the larger evaporation rate from pans than direct measurements from water bodies hence the following equation was employed to convert the pan evaporation to pond evaporation 1 e e p k p a n e p where eep and ep are respectively evaporation rate from evaporation pond and pan and kpan is coefficient of pan a pan coefficient of 0 7 was used based on the average coefficient suggested in the literature e g 77 79 2 2 derivation of the oil produced evaporation model dimensional

optimization model was employed to simultaneously maximize the volume of opwe minimize the evaporation pond surface area and minimize the cvar associated with the opw overflow the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii for multi objective optimization model nsga ii mom was employed to obtain the pareto front solutions considering the number and area length and width of the evaporation ponds as well as five opw parameters consisting of tss tph bod cod and toc as decision variables the maximized evaporation volume was determined based on the average of the evaporation volume which was calculated for the fifty different evaporation scenarios to include the associated uncertainties the evaporation scenarios consisting of all climatic variables and opw physical properties were determined by sorting the daily measured data according to the value of the cwe sm section s 3 to reduce the risk of the opw overflow from the evaporation ponds an efficient risk based approach known as conditional value at risk cvar model 82 is employed the cvar a risk measure that determines the value of the excess loss is defined as the average loss occurring over a range of extreme loss scenarios that occur beyond a threshold or value at risk var 85 84 the theory of cvar model is elaborated in the sm section s 5 the model determines the difference between the average opwe rate and the measured one over a year and calculates the opw rise due to the lower opwe rate compared to the average opwe rate by minimizing the cvar the pareto front solutions strike a balance between the evaporation ponds area and opwe rate which results in reliable and cost effective design of the evaporation ponds the formulation of the stochastic multi objective optimization model to obtain the

and coefficient of variation as presented in table 1 the ec and tds are the measurement of the total salt content which vary from 11 7 to 14 7 ms cm and 6 568 to 8 370 mg l with an average of 12 8 ms cm and 7 268 mg l for ec and tds respectively the tss is relatively low with a mean value of 38 mg l and the range of 26 to 50 mg l the bod and cod are measures of required oxygen to break down the organic materials while the bod is poorly variable ranging from 4 0 to 24 0 mg l with an average value of 16 0 mg l the cod ranges considerably from 8 0 to 160 0 mg l with a mean of 38 5 mg l the tph which indicates the mixture of hydrocarbons in crude petroleum varies from 3 to 14 mg l with a mean of 7 mg l although the variation range of the tic is significant in the opw the toc fluctuation is trivial and varies from 0 0 to 2 7 mg l the matrix plots of the opw properties versus opwe rate are presented in fig s 14 sm section s 8 fig 2 shows the variation of daily and monthly estimated opwe along with the cwe an average pan coefficient of 0 7 e g 77 79 was applied to estimate the opwe and cwe using eq 1 while the daily and monthly rate of evaporation for the opw and clear water generally decrease from august to november and increase from february to july the slightly steady evaporation rate was observed for november december and january for the period of aug 2018 through july 2019 the annual evaporation of the opw and clear water were 2 524 and 2 607 mm respectively therefore an average evaporation rate of the opwe was found to be 3 3 lower than the cwe because of high salinity and dissolved solids in the opw in fact the molecular activity of the opw decreased due to the interference of dissolved solids molecules with the water molecules motion which lead to the reduction of the availability of water molecules for the opw evaporation moreover the opw includes fats oil and grease 10 mg l which float on the surface of the opw sm sections s 1 hence the contact between water molecules and the air is reduced due to covering some parts of the surface area by fats oil and grease molecules which lead to a decrease in the evaporation of the opw more details about the measured data analysis are provided in the sm sections s 1 and s 2 3 2 oil produced water evaporation model the coefficients of eq 6 were achieved using the ga optimization method as c 2 792 α 0 941 β 0 039 γ

analysis of the eq 19 is assessed to the different π terms and it is presented in fig s12 sm section s 6 statistics listed in table 2 show the performance of eq 19 to estimate the opwe the high performance in the calibration phase r 2 0 955 rmse 0 48 mm mare 5 12 and ns 0 95 indicates the consistency of the proposed model with the underlying physics of the opwe process the high model performance of the calibrated model for the validation phase using an independent dataset r 2 0 907 rmse 0 53 mm mare 5 83 and ns 0 91 also reveals the robustness of the model in predicting opwe in a broad range of conditions beyond those of the calibration phase fig 3 exhibits the comparison between estimated and measured opwe for the calibration and validation phases as observed the opwe temporal variabilities at different time scales are well captured by the proposed model in particular the general trend and short term fluctuations of the measured and estimated opwe match very well verifying the efficiency and accuracy of the derived model for the opwe estimation the exceptional performance of the opwe model reflects the fact that the key parameters influencing the opwe are well taken into account in the derived opwe model using the dimensional analysis the term with cwe tds r and w parameters demonstrates a major influence on the opwe because of the higher power α in the eq 19 the tds results in a lower saturation vapor pressure due to the decreased chemical potential of the opw and hence a lower evaporation rate on the contrary solar radiation provides heat to enable evaporation such that the increase in the evaporation with the increase in solar radiation is due principally to the increase in internal convection of the opw moreover wind helps to disperse the saturated air in order to allow for further evaporation to occur 3 3 optimal opw parameters and dimensions of evaporation ponds the proposed stochastic multi objective optimization model was utilized to obtain the optimal dimensions of evaporation ponds i e width length and number of ponds along with the optimal values of five opw parameters tss tph bod cod and toc the efficiency of the obtained dimensions is highly dependent on the climatic parameters and the opw properties therefore the daily measured cwe opwe and opw parameters over a period of august 1 2018 to july 30 2019 were considered to examine fifty different stochastic evaporation scenarios as shown in the sm section s 3 the nsga ii mom selects different stochastic values for the decision variables in each iteration and then determines the opwe rate for the fifty evaporation scenarios the model strives to simultaneously minimize the cvar based on the difference between the average and daily opwe rates for the worst case scenarios minimize the total evaporation pond area and maximize the average volume of the opwe fig 4 shows the 20 pareto front solutions generated by the nsga ii mom with a population size of 160 8 20 after reaching the set of maximum 200 generations the variables are set through assessing different values of crossover mutation and population size in a trial and error process sm section s 7 the decision variables and objective values of the pareto front solutions are given in table 3 the optimization model was run several times and the results are compared to ensure that the results are globally optimal sm section s 7 for instance according to the solution 19 an average daily evaporation volume of 46 1 103 m3 can be disposed of through 11 ponds with a surface area of 1434 431 hectare if the determined average annual values for the decision variables are met over a year with a confidence level of 95 the cvar is equal to 792 7 mm which means that in the 5 worst cases the opw can rise 792 7 mm over a year based on the solution 19 as shown in fig 5 the determined optimal opw properties of the solution 19 columns 2 to 6 of table 3 enhance the performance of the evaporation ponds significantly by increasing the opwe rate up to 17 8 a key finding of this study is the significant increase in the opwe through optimizing the impact of the effecting parameters on the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds therefore it is quite rational to implement some mechanisms to change the actual amount of the opw parameters to the optimal values which is proposed in this study however the cost of changing the opw parameters and the inter relation of these parameters together are the major points that should be assessed under an experimental pilot in future studies this study provides the conceptual step and methodology to increase the opwe through the multi objective stochastic optimization model therefore the performance of these findings in real applications should be tested under an experimental pilot setup both in the laboratory and field conditions as a final step in designing the evaporation ponds the pond depth is calculated and presented here the average opwe rate of the solution 19 is 6 79 mm a freeboard is also determined to account for wave action caused by wind and more importantly the opw rise due to the lower evaporation rates compared to the average opwe the analysis of daily measured opwe fig 2 shows that during 30 of the time over a year evaporation rate is less than the average opwe rate of the solution 19 which causes the opw level to rise by 238 mm sm section s 4 fig s 9 moreover based on the equation suggested by mickley 83 the wave height is 260 mm for the study area in the worst condition sm section s 4 hence the depth of the designed ponds is 0 505 meter 6 79 238 260 505 mm one of the fundamental concerns associated with the depth of the opw evaporation ponds is that the dissolved salts will accumulate in the pond due to evaporation and will reduce the designed storage volume forecasting the quantity of evaporite residues is difficult because of variations in the opw quality and in evaporating efficiency therefore the removal of salts from evaporation ponds is necessary in order to maintain evaporating efficiency the disposition of the salts accumulating in the evaporation pond is a long term concern the alternative includes salt harvesting for commercial use e g industrial although there is a potential for commercial salt harvesting the presence of some trace elements may constrain the use of these salts 4 conclusion the evaporation ponds discussed in this study are engineered structures that are being proposed for the disposal of opw especially in arid and semi arid areas with favorable climatic conditions the opwe rates have been observed to a great extent to be dependent upon the physico chemical characteristics of the opw moreover this study has revealed that the decrease in evaporation rates in relation to cwe rates can seriously increase the failure potential of the evaporation ponds designed on the considerations based on cwe criteria moreover failure to estimate accurate opwe could shorten an evaporation pond s lifetime which results in increased maintenance costs due to the high importance of the mentioned fact significant field measurements and laboratory sample analyses are conducted over a one year period to ensure the reliability of the applied data to determine the opwe and the optimal dimensions of the evaporation ponds moreover in this study the developed stochastic multi objective optimization model was used to ascertain the optimal evaporation pond dimensions and opw physical parameters with the maximum volume of the opwe minimum evaporation pond area and minimum risk of the opw overflow the uncertainties associated with the daily climatic variables and the opw properties were examined by developing fifty stochastic evaporation scenarios the risk of the opw overflow from the designed evaporation ponds was also assessed by the cvar as a coherent risk measure the pareto front solutions reveal that the opw overflow depth can reach to one meter in the evaporation ponds in worst case scenarios which is meaningful and should be taken into account for the designing of the evaporation ponds the difference between the average opw overflow depth and the opw overflow depth in worst case scenarios e g 238 mm and 793 mm for the solution 19 is significant which indicates that the sufficient evaporation scenarios should be examined to increase the reliability of the designed evaporation ponds the estimation of the opwe is highly dependent on the simultaneous effects of the climatic variables and the opw properties therefore the optimal opw parameters while minimize the evaporation pond area it can increase the volume of opwe up to 20 it should be emphasized that the developed framework is area independent and therefore the optimum dimensions of evaporation ponds can be determined for any interest area given the availability of required data the developed framework will certainly find application in the optimization of the strategies employed in the disposal of opw as well as other types of wastewater systems which is currently a challenge to the industry given the fact that this study is one of the very first of its nature and kind the paper will certainly prove to be of interest to various researchers who work on opw disposal or other types of wastewaters author agreement with the submission of

the profile of the phenolic compounds catechin and ellagic acid concentration in g sulphuraria biomass reached 0 866 mg g in the bioreactor and 3 556 mg g in the shake flask this places the microalgae as the main source of catechin and the second best source of ellagic acid in nature keywords microalgae dairy effluent catechin ellagic acid phenolic compounds 1 introduction milk permeate also known as whey is the remaining liquid of cheese production and corresponds to approximately 85 v v of the milk used 1 approx 145 million tonnes of milk permeate is produced annually based on the worldwide production of cheese 2 3 disposal of it in nature can cause severe environmental impact especially due to its high nitrogen content 4 with chemical and biochemical oxygen demand bod as high as 27 60 g l and 50 120 g l respectively 5 7 in the last fifty years milk permeate has been used in numerous applications such as pharmaceuticals powdered and liquid formula for infants food and dairy products ice cream cookies beverages and others and for sport medicinal and other specialized nutrition 4 whey is rich in essential nutrients such as vitamins minerals proteins and lactose whey ultrafiltration is an industrial process to recover whey protein a high value added product used as a dietary supplement but also generates a new effluent called whey permeate these new effluents need treatment for its disposal since its lactose content is 70 of the total solids 8 this propitious waste is to be considered for the development of adding value bioprocesses polyesters phas various organic acids lactic acid amino acids vitamins polysaccharides enzymes as well as basic compounds like biogasses hydrogen and ethanol are some examples of products left over from bioprocesses of the whey permeate

and ph between 0 5 and 4 11 in autotrophic mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 12 these microalgae have a versatile metabolism that can metabolize up to 50 carbon sources 13 which is an interesting ability and should be considered for the development of waste based bioprocesses g sulphuraria is being studied for the production of phycocyanin glycogen antioxidants and biofuels the absorption of heavy metals and the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus it is being considered a new candidate for large scale production 14 the studies of extremophile microorganisms are of interest because of the distinctive biomolecules developed to tolerate adapt and survive in extreme environments it is expected that these extremophiles microorganisms are highly resistant to the phenomenon of oxidative stress 15 and consequently may have a high content of efficient antioxidants phenolic compounds are antioxidant compounds with biological activity commonly found in microalgae and cyanobacteria most studies evaluate the total phenolic compounds content in microalgae biomass extracts using folin ciocalteu spectrophotometric method however only a few are directed to the identification of phenolic compounds in microalgae 16 and the effects of the cultures conditions on its production in this work galdieria sulphuraria gds was cultivated in a whey permeate medium under

l 24 to 26 8 g l 25 based on the nitrate content the c n ratio was approx 13 which is similar to the best indicated for the production of microalgae 26 the milk permeate has a reported resistance to biodegradation when compared to other dairy industry effluents 27 it has low alkalinity and high content of lactose which contributes to its fast acidification especially in aerobic processes 28 however because gds is an acidophile the fast acidification of the whey permeate may not be a problem 3 2 heterotrophic growth analysis the heterotrophic route is admittedly more productive than its autotrophic counterpart and is more economically viable for large scale production it is also a strategy to overcome the excessive time and costs involved in the stages of scaling up autotrophic crops on commercial scales 29 the use of complex carbohydrates di tri and polysaccharides depends on the presence of enzymatic complexes while polysaccharides are generally converted into simpler sugars in the extracellular environment di and trisaccharides can only be metabolized in the cell s cytoplasm since it depends on the presence of a specific carrier the use of lactose by gds was observed previously and is described to be transported by a low affinity transport system 30 31 inside the cell lactose is enzymatically converted to glucose and galactose which are then oxidized to more reduced compounds producing biochemical energy these will be then used for cell maintenance and replication fig 1 during cell metabolism several secondary compounds are produced among which are the phenolic compounds phenolic compounds are typically synthesized at very small quantities through the shikimic and malonic acid pathways this preliminary test proves the capability of gds to grow in the presence and absence of glucose and lactose table 3 growth kinetics however was not described in the referred literature heterotrophic biomass productivity growth in a glucose and lactose medium was respectively 6 4 and 9 3 times greater than autotrophic growth table 3 this reinforces the hypothesis that whey permeate a lactose rich wastewater can be used as a medium for gds 3 3 biomass production in whey permeate medium different final concentrations of whey permeate were evaluated for gds growth the final concentrations of whey permeated varied between 0 40 and were diluted using distilled water table 4 the strain was not previously adapted to the whey permeate which may explain the observed longer adaptation phases at higher concentrations of whey permeate the best observed whey permeate concentration for biomass production and productivity was 20 which was statistically different p 0 05 from the kinetic growth parameters observed at 15 and 25 table 4 the lowest results of biomass productivity were observed at 0 as expected since no light was provided for growth and no organic carbon source was present in this condition concentrations above 25 have shown to be toxic to the microorganism the best whey permeated concentration of 20 is similar to the study of bracher et al 2015 32 that describes the highest spirulina sp and c minutissima growth at 25 and 20 milk permeate respectively it is important to note that gds cultivation was carried with whey permeate diluted in distilled water and not in a synthetic media as used by the referenced author modified zarrouk medium for spirulina sp and bristol medium for c minutissima the condition of 20 whey permeate was then scaled up to a 2 5 l bioreactor for the production of biomass aimed at investigating cod and bod removal from the whey permeate as well as the content of pigments and phenolic compounds in the biomass the exponential growth lasted at least 168 h in the bioreactor achieving a maximum biomass concentration of 3 4 107 cells ml this represents a gain of 86 of the biomass concentration achieved in shake flask conditions proving the effectiveness of scaling up the resultant reduction in cod and bod was 60 and 44 respectively table 5 this is not sufficient to consider gds cultivation as a sole treatment step especially when considering that the traditional biological treatment of whey permeate generally results in a 96 cod reduction 28 however gds cultivation can be considered as an intermediary treatment step of whey permeate where important high value added biomolecules are produced considering a recent study wherein the mixed culture of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria was successfully used for ammonia removal from slaughterhouse wastewater 33 it might be possible that a consortium of g sulphuraria and other microorganisms may increase the cod and bod reduction 3 4 pigments identification tlc and raman spectroscopy among the biomolecules produced by gds pigments and phenolic compounds were particularly evaluated in this study gds has been widely described as a phycocyanin producing microalgae even in heterotrophic conditions 34 36 it was then expected that the whey permeate cultures displayed a greenish or bluish color nevertheless the color observed was yellowish fig 2 tlc analysis was performed to obtain a preliminary profile of the biomass pigment content the separation of the biomass extract into three distinct bands with retention times of 0 31 0 33 and 0 73 was observed according to 37 the retention time of 0 31 and 0 33 correspond to astaxanthin which was observed in the extract of the biomasses cultivated at 5 15 25 30 35 and 40 whey permeate the presence of astaxanthin diester in the biomass extracts derived from cultures containing 15 25 30 35 and 40 whey permeate retention time of 0 73 was also observed consequently the absence of phycocyanin was confirmed by the absence of the characteristic tlc band to confirm the tlc analysis that indicated the presence of astaxanthin and no phycocyanin production raman analysis of the dried gds biomass produced in synthetic autotrophic modified allen s medium and 20 whey permeate medium was carried in the spectral range from 800 to 2000 cm 1 fig 3 in both biomasses 4 carotenoids peaks appeared between 1005 and 1524 cm 1 which are compatible with the astaxanthin raman signature 38 39 the band observed at 1006 cm 1 is related to the methyl group in the carotenoid s polyene chain the peaks 1520 and 1156 are attributed to the symmetrical elongation cc and cc from carotenoids polyenes chain respectively 40 44 astaxanthin was previously reported in autotrophic grown gds biomass 41 but no heterotrophic production has been described until now due to the yellowish color of the culture the amount of astaxanthin within cells produced heterotrophically in whey permeate media was probably very low however the mechanisms of how strain 107 79 produced astaxanthin at heterotrophic conditions may be of interest considering that few organisms are described to produce astaxanthin at complete heterotrophic conditions the microalga chlorella zofingesis 46 the bacterium sphingomonas astaxanthinifaciens 47 paracoccus sp 48 and brevundimonas sp 49 and the yeast phaffia rhodozyma 50 the peak observed at 1640 cm 1 is linked to the vibrations of the bonding cc in the phycocyanin molecule 51 and could also be observed in both mediums this proves that phycocyanin was produced by the strain 107 79 however in such small quantities the biomass did not present the typical bluish color of phycocyanin producers the low content of phycocyanin of the lineage 107 79 indicated by tlc and raman analysis corroborates with the described loss of pigmentation under heterotrophic growth on lactose previously observed 30 the effect of how different cultures conditions including carbon sources affect biomass productivity and carotenoids content is widely discussed in the scientific literature 52 54 however the whitening of this specific strain is probably a specific characteristic that deserves further studies 3 5 phenolic compounds analysis the method of extraction also has a great influence on the profile of phenolic compounds different extraction techniques were tested for phenolic compounds of arthrospira platensis they observed a 100 times increase in catechin when high pressure temperature extraction 36 1 μg g was used instead of microwave assisted extraction 0 3 μg g 55 in this study however the same extraction method was used for both biomasses the phenolic profile of the extracts of gds biomass exhibits the presence of 4 aminobenzoic acid salicylic acid quercetin ellagic acid and catechin table 6 catechin was the most abundant phenolic compound in the biomass cultivated in a shake flask 3 56 mg g but was not identified in the extract of the biomass cultivated in the bioreactor on the other hand ellagic acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds at the bioreactor scale 0 87 mg g but was not found in shake flask conditions the different observed profiles of phenolic compounds in the biomass cultivated in the bioreactor and shake flask conditions indicate that process conditions probably ph and or dissolved oxygen which were controlled in the bioreactor but not in shake flask condition may have a strong influence on phenolic compounds production by gds and deserves further investigation the catechin content in gds cultivated in shake flasks and 20 whey permeate medium 3 558 mg g was 130 times higher than the previously described for a platensis 55 catechin is a flavonoid notoriously found in cocoa with the maximum concentration on its seeds the natural seed has 0 2 mg g of catechin while fermented seeds achieved up to 1 1 mg g 56 the catechin content in gds was found to be approx 18 and greater than 3 times higher than the natural and fermented cocoa seeds respectively this puts gds as the main natural source of this phenolic compound which has potential application as an antioxidant and antimicrobial in cosmetics and food products 57 58 ellagic acid has antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties since it interrupts the tumor cellular cycle and conducts the cells to apoptosis 59 60 moreover it was correlated to reductions in tumor size mammary cancer in rats of up to 75 61 it is generally found in low quantity in food especially in strawberries 170 470 μg g and raspberries 4 mg g 62 the amount of ellagic acid found in the biomass cultivated in the bioreactor 860 μg g was greater than 2 times the content in raspberries which makes gds the second largest natural source of ellagic acid quercetin is a flavonoid common in vegetables such as peas apple and onions 63 64 in this study the quercetin appeared moderately in both treatments in quantities of approx half of the content in capers 310 μg g which is considered one of the main natural sources of quercetin 65 3 6 practical applications and perspectives large scale microalgae systems are mostly limited by the high costs associated with biomass production 29 which represents up to 40 of the price of the final product 66 the use of industrial wastes as media or source of nutrients for microalgal growth is an important strategy not only to overcome the high costs associated with biomass production but for the development of sustainable production technologies the fact that gds is one of the main natural sources of catechin and ellagic acid may boost research in the field of human health and food and increase interest in its large scale production despite the increasing studies that show the potential of gds to produce value added bioproducts it is not yet recognized as safe a recent evaluation of toxicity ames bacterial reverse mutation test in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test and 13 week oral toxicity study in rats of a novel gds based feed supplement with a commercial purpose did not present an indication of toxicity 67 gds biomass is described to be a source of good proteins for human digestive enzymes and is an important source of dietary fiber 45 and food colorants 68 thus it is a potential strain to be used as food or food additive moreover its ability to reduce exercise linked oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in rat tissues 69 as well as its highly beneficial and protective effects on human health 70 reinforces its potential for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical use however more toxicological studies are necessary to ensure its safety for human health as well as studies to support r d on commercial applications of gds biomass and its derived bioproducts and process scaling up the need to maintain the culture at high temperatures 45 56 c will certainly present an economic challenge gds cultivation at large scales should be associated with the use of bioenergies and energy efficient facilities where the heat can be reused to increase the chance of successful commercial gds production it is crucial to give priority to the use of alternative sources of nutrients and the production of high addedvalue biomolecules there are no reports in the scientific literature on the production of gds in heterotrophic conditions on a pilot or commercial scale as far as we know therefore scale up cultivation criteria such as oxygen consumption rate maximum shear stress intensity and studies on the different modes of operation of gds cultivation systems batch fed batch and continuous for the production of secondary metabolites are required given that i whey permeate is a liquid waste that can be used as the only source of nutrients for the production of gds biomass ii that the microalga has been presented elsewhere as potentially safe for consumption iii that it is possible to produce a phenolic compound rich biomass that can be used for food feed and pharmaceuticals applications this work attempts to contribute to the development of a technology that can play an important role within the circular economy the recovery of waste resources and its conversion to value added products by biological routes is at the core of the development of a bio based economy 4 conclusions gds is a polyextremophile microalga with the potential to be scaled up where high value added products are mostly desired a process to produce galdieria sulphuraria sag 107 79 gds biomass in a 20 whey permeate at shake flask and 2 5 l bioreactor scale was presented gds cultivation resulted in cod and bod removal and its biomass can be used as an important source of phenolic compounds gds sag 107 79 is presented as the main source of catechin and the second main best of ellagic acid in nature while not producing significant amounts of phycocyanin the culture conditions were observed to influence the profile of phenolic compounds produced by the referred strain where ph and dissolved oxygen is proposed to have a major influence this study opens new insights on the application of the referred microalgae for the recovery of nutrients from wastewaters directed for the production of value added bioproducts in

13812,galdieria sulphuraria is a microalga capable of surviving extreme environmental conditions and has an impressive metabolic versatility it has been considered a potential strain for large scale production since it can produce useful products from waste resources whey permeate is a by product of the whey industry that is produced at high rates and has a high chemical oxygen demand cod this work describes the use of whey permeate as a medium for the growth of g sulphuraria in a heterotrophic condition concentrations from 0 to 40 of whey were tested and the best condition was verified to be a 20 whey permeate concentration biomass production kinetics and cod removal analysis were then carried in a 2 5 l bioreactor the biomasses obtained from cultures in bioreactor and shake flask were analyzed for their phenolic profile which showed the presence of 4 aminobenzoic acid salicylic acid quercetin ellagic acid and catechin it was observed that cultures conditions significantly affected the profile of the phenolic compounds catechin and ellagic acid concentration in g sulphuraria biomass reached 0 866 mg g in the bioreactor and 3 556 mg g in the shake flask this places the microalgae as the main source of catechin and the second best source of ellagic acid in nature keywords microalgae dairy effluent catechin ellagic acid phenolic compounds 1 introduction milk permeate also known as whey is the remaining liquid of cheese production and corresponds to approximately 85 v v of the milk used 1 approx 145 million tonnes of milk permeate is produced annually based on the worldwide production of cheese 2 3 disposal of it in nature can cause severe environmental impact especially due to its high nitrogen content 4 with chemical and biochemical oxygen demand bod as high as 27 60 g l and 50 120 g l respectively 5 7 in the last fifty years milk permeate has been used in numerous applications such as pharmaceuticals powdered and liquid formula for infants food and dairy products ice cream cookies beverages and others and for sport medicinal and other specialized nutrition 4 whey is rich in essential nutrients such as vitamins minerals proteins and lactose whey ultrafiltration is an industrial process to recover whey protein a high value added product used as a dietary supplement but also generates a new effluent called whey permeate these new effluents need treatment for its disposal since its lactose content is 70 of the total solids 8 this propitious waste is to be considered for the development of adding value bioprocesses polyesters phas various organic acids lactic acid amino acids vitamins polysaccharides enzymes as well as basic compounds like biogasses hydrogen and ethanol are some examples of products left over from bioprocesses of the whey permeate more complex processes such as single cell production also results from the bioprocesses 9 10 galdieria sulphuraria gds is an extremophile unicellular microalgae that grow in temperatures up to 56 c and ph between 0 5 and 4 11 in autotrophic mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 12 these microalgae have a versatile metabolism that can metabolize up to 50 carbon sources 13 which is an interesting ability and should be considered for the development of waste based bioprocesses g sulphuraria is being studied for the production of phycocyanin glycogen antioxidants and biofuels the absorption of heavy metals and the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus it is being considered a new candidate for large scale production 14 the studies of extremophile microorganisms are of interest because of the distinctive biomolecules developed to tolerate adapt and survive in extreme environments it is expected that these extremophiles microorganisms are highly resistant to the phenomenon of oxidative stress 15 and consequently may have a high content of efficient antioxidants phenolic compounds are antioxidant compounds with biological activity commonly found in microalgae and cyanobacteria most studies evaluate the total phenolic compounds content in microalgae biomass extracts using folin ciocalteu spectrophotometric method however only a few are directed to the identification of phenolic compounds in microalgae 16 and the effects of the cultures conditions on its production in this work galdieria sulphuraria gds was cultivated in a whey permeate medium under shake flask and bioreactor conditions growth kinetics was determined in various whey permeate concentrations in shake flask and the best condition was scaled up to a 2 5 l bioreactor cod and bod removal microalgal pigments and phenolic compounds production were evaluated as a strategy to combine the recovery of nutrients from whey permeate for the production of value added products 2

than the previously described for a platensis 55 catechin is a flavonoid notoriously found in cocoa with the maximum concentration on its seeds the natural seed has 0 2 mg g of catechin while fermented seeds achieved up to 1 1 mg g 56 the catechin content in gds was found to be approx 18 and greater than 3 times higher than the natural and fermented cocoa seeds respectively this puts gds as the main natural source of this phenolic compound which has potential application as an antioxidant and antimicrobial in cosmetics and food products 57 58 ellagic acid has antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties since it interrupts the tumor cellular cycle and conducts the cells to apoptosis 59 60 moreover it was correlated to reductions in tumor size mammary cancer in rats of up to 75 61 it is generally found in low quantity in food especially in strawberries 170 470 μg g and raspberries 4 mg g 62 the amount of ellagic acid found in the biomass cultivated in the bioreactor 860 μg g was greater than 2 times the content in raspberries which makes gds the second largest natural source of ellagic acid quercetin is a flavonoid common in vegetables such as peas apple and onions 63 64 in this study the quercetin appeared moderately in both treatments in quantities of approx half of the content in capers 310 μg g which is considered one of the main natural sources of quercetin 65 3 6 practical applications and perspectives large scale microalgae systems are mostly limited by the high costs associated with biomass production 29 which represents up to 40 of the price of the final product 66 the use of industrial wastes as media or source of nutrients for microalgal growth is an important strategy not only to overcome the high costs associated with biomass production but for the development of sustainable production technologies the fact that gds is one of the main natural sources of catechin and ellagic acid may boost research in the field of human health and food and increase interest in its large scale production despite the increasing studies that show the potential of gds to produce value added bioproducts it is not yet recognized as safe a recent evaluation of toxicity ames bacterial reverse mutation test in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test and 13 week oral toxicity study in rats of a novel gds based feed supplement with a commercial purpose did not present an indication of toxicity 67 gds biomass is described to be a source of good proteins for human digestive enzymes and is an important source of dietary fiber 45 and food colorants 68 thus it is a potential strain to be used as food or food additive moreover its ability to reduce exercise linked oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in rat tissues 69 as well as its highly beneficial and protective effects on human health 70 reinforces its potential for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical use however more toxicological studies are necessary to ensure its safety for human health as well as studies to support r d on commercial applications of gds biomass and its derived bioproducts and process scaling up the need to maintain the culture at high temperatures 45 56 c will certainly present an economic challenge gds cultivation at large scales should be associated with the use of bioenergies and energy efficient facilities where the heat can be reused to increase the chance of successful commercial gds production it is crucial to give priority to the use of alternative sources of nutrients and the production of high addedvalue biomolecules there are no reports in the scientific literature on the production of gds in heterotrophic conditions on a pilot or commercial scale as far as we know therefore scale up cultivation criteria such as oxygen consumption rate maximum shear stress intensity and studies on the different modes of operation of gds cultivation systems batch fed batch and continuous for the production of secondary metabolites are required given that i whey permeate is a liquid waste that can be used as the only source of nutrients for the production of gds biomass ii that the microalga has been presented elsewhere as potentially safe for consumption iii that it is possible to produce a phenolic compound rich biomass that can be used for food feed and pharmaceuticals applications this work attempts to contribute to the development of a technology that can play an important role within the circular economy the recovery of waste resources and its conversion to value added products by biological routes is at the core of the development of a bio based economy 4 conclusions gds is a polyextremophile microalga with the potential to be scaled up where high value added products are mostly desired a process to produce galdieria sulphuraria sag 107 79 gds biomass in a 20 whey permeate at shake flask and 2 5 l bioreactor scale was presented gds cultivation resulted in cod and bod removal and its biomass can be used as an important source of phenolic compounds gds sag 107 79 is presented as the main source of catechin and the second main best of ellagic acid in nature while not producing

13813,using abundant and cheap steel slag for metals removal from water represents an opportunity to recover waste material from one industry as a resource for another in this study powdered steel slag which contains lime cao leftover from the steelmaking process was evaluated and benchmarked against the relatively expensive and energy intensive chemical sodium hydroxide naoh for the removal of cadmium cd manganese mn and zinc zn from two different mine drainage waters unlike isotherm and kinetic studies that represent most previous work this study evaluated metals removal under realistic simulated water treatment conditions doses mixing contact times etc bringing the material one step closer to actual full scale implementation in the neutral ph water with lower metals concentrations approximately four times more steel slag 400 mg l compared to naoh 100 mg l was required to achieve 70 metals removal in the acidic ph water with higher metals concentrations steel slag was insufficient to raise the ph at reasonable doses 1 000 mg l but was shown to reduce naoh dosing requirements by 25 600 to 450 mg l when used in combination with steel slag 600 mg l like naoh steel slag addition facilitated metal precipitate formation but also provided relatively high specific surface area 7 6 m2 g for metal adsorption particularly for mn a promising finding for future work to evaluate sludge recycle water treated with steel slag was also found to be more amenable to 0 45 μm filtration than water treated with naoh keywords mine drainage metals adsorption precipitation steel slag sodium hydroxide 1 introduction reclaiming waste materials from one industry as useful materials in another is is becoming increasingly attractive in a resource limited world one example and the topic of this study is the use of steel slag for the removal of metals from water steel slag is a waste byproduct from steelmaking produced from the addition of burnt lime or calcium oxide cao to remove impurities metal oxides phosphorus from the high temperature steelmaking process as such steel slag is a relatively high surface area and dense granular material rich in cao and other metal oxides such as iron iii oxide fe2o3 and silicon dioxide sio2 in addition to having a high specific surface area the presence of cao in steel slag increases water ph 1 2 and divalent calcium ca2 concentrations through the formation of hydrated lime or calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 s as shown in eq 1 a desirable trait for metals removal e g as hydroxide precipitates from water 1 c a o s h 2 o c a o h 2 s c a 2 2 o h several studies have investigated the use of steel slag for metals removal from water using either batch or fixed bed scenarios fixed bed steel slag studies are not discussed herein but have been shown to be effective at removing metals from water albeit at relatively low water throughput i e hundreds of bed volumes 3 7 in the case of batch studies which are more relevant to this study steel slag particles ranging from 24 to 2 000 μm in diameter have been evaluated for metals removal via adsorption to its relatively high metal oxide surface area 0 4 to 107 m2 g 1 3 4 7 11 in environmental systems metals removal mechanisms can be difficult to isolate or identify nevertheless in general free divalent metal cation me2 adsorption to the heterogeneous steel slag surface is akin to adsorption to homogenous metal oxide surfaces following the generic adsorption equations shown in eq 2 10 12 15 2 s o h 0 m e 2 s o m e h s o h 0 m e 2 h 2 o s o m e o h 2 h where soh0 is a neutral surface site some and someoh are surface sites occupied by a divalent metal cation and h is the hydrogen ion proton released into solution considering steel slag addition would raise the ph as given by eq 1 the formation of divalent metal oxides meo hydroxides me oh 2 and or carbonates meco3 followed by precipitation to the steel slag surface could be expected in addition to metal ligand complex mel adsorption or ternary surface complex formation as shown in eq 3 13 14 3 s o h 0 m e 2 l s o m e l 0 h where l is a ligand e g oh that acts as a bridge to form somel0 a neutral surface site occupied by the metal ligand complex in prior batch equilibrium adsorption studies steel slag was shown to be an effective adsorbent for removing several divalent cationic metals from solution namely cadmium cd copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn 1 3 4 7 11 increased adsorption was measured at higher ph values above the steel slag surface ph point of zero charge phpzc where the negative surface charge attracted divalent cations however these studies controlled ph using either acid or base addition as opposed to testing ph response derived solely from steel slag addition most solutions were synthetic buffered deionized water with high steel slag doses and metals concentrations 10 000 mg l and 500 mg l respectively as an example 3 work by nguyen et al 7 evaluated adsorption of metals to steel slag under more realistic scenarios doses and metals concentrations of 100 mg l and 5 mg l respectively but experiments were still run to equilibrium 24 h at a constant ph 6 5 more research with real waters reasonable steel slag doses and typical contact times minutes to hours is needed to evaluate the potential of steel slag as a practical and potentially more sustainable water treatment process as with any novel material a baseline comparison to existing treatment chemicals is needed but such comparisons are also lacking in previous studies therefore the objective and novelty of this study was to evaluate steel slag performance benchmarked against relatively expensive and energy intensive chemical sodium hydroxide naoh under realistic treatment plant conditions with two real waters both relatively high in cd manganese mn and zn experiments were designed to determine bulk performance of steel slag as measured by metals removal when added during water treatment processes similar to adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon pac as opposed to experiments designed to elucidate specific removal mechanisms surface reactions or kinetic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 waters two mine drainage waters with elevated levels of metals were tested in this study one from the leadville mine drainage tunnel lmdt in leadville colorado and one from the argo tunnel at in idaho springs colorado both lmdt and at have operating water treatment plants that use naoh and ca oh 2 to remove metals prior to discharging to the vulnerable surface waters of the arkansas river and clear creek respectively most testing was performed with lmdt water but for both waters testing was either performed at the respective water treatment plants or after collecting water in 20 l hdpe containers and storing at 4 until use within a week relevant raw water quality of the two waters is shown in table 1 highlighting the metals focused on in this study cd mn and zn due to difficulties in their removal solely through increases in ph compared to other easily removed source water metals cu fe pb historically lmdt water is atypical for mine drainage in that it is influenced by native groundwater which raises ph alkalinity and oxidation reduction potential orp consequently lmdt water has significant alkalinity neutral ph and relatively low metals concentrations by contrast at water is historically more typical of acid mine drainage exhibiting low ph no alkalinity and relatively high metals concentrations 2 2 slag basic oxygen furnace steel slag the same product used by caicedo ramirez et al 2 16 was tested in this study major metal oxide composition of this steel slag identified using powder x ray diffraction xrd was performed by caicedo ramirez et al 16 and consisted of cao 32 fe2o3 26 sio2 15 magnesium oxide mgo 11 aluminum oxide al2o3 6 6 manganese oxide mno 2 5 phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 0 7 calcium or sodium sulfate caso4 or na2so4 0 4 and sodium oxide na2o 0 1 consistent with steel slag composition 1 7 9 11 to create a powder similar in size to pac small batches 100 g of as received steel slag 1 6 mm were sieved to particle diameters less than 75 μm using a stainless steel sieve us standard mesh 200 and vibratory sieve shaker powdered steel slag stock slurries 20 g l were made several times over the course of testing using deionized water resistivity 16 mω cm stock slurries were stored at room temperature in 1 l amber glass bottles scanning electron microscopy sem paired with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of steel slag surfaces was also performed to obtain relative mass percent values of identified elements with a detection limit of 0 1 rocky mountain laboratories inc colorado an sem image of the powdered raw steel slag is shown in fig 1 and demonstrates a rough surface morphology that contributed to a measured specific surface area value of 7 6 m2 g according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method micromeritics instrument corporation georgia for reference the specific surface area of a perfectly spherical steel slag particle with a diameter of 38 μm half of 75 μm and solid particle density ρs of 2 6 0 3 g cm 3 4 8 would be approximately 0 06 m2 g or nearly 130 times less surface area than what was measured for the steel slag used in this study to eliminate the ability of as received steel slag to increase water ph and subsequently test that modification approximately 5 g of powdered steel slag was exhausted for ph change capacity by up flowing deionized water ph 6 10 ml min through a small fluidized bed of steel slag in 9 5 mm inside diameter polypropylene tubing using a diaphragm pump when the fluidized bed effluent water reached a steady state ph value of approximately 7 after several months of operation the process was stopped powdered steel slag was removed from the tubing dried in a muffle furnace at 100 c and stored in a 50 ml glass beaker until use herein this steel slag is referred to as exhausted slag es and steel slag added from the previously described stock slurry is referred to as unexhausted slag ues 2 3 sodium hydroxide as a benchmark for performance all ues and es tests included parallel tests with naoh naoh was chosen instead of pure cao or ca oh 2 because it contributes only hydroxide ions oh to solution i e ph increase only whereas cao or ca oh 2 contribute ca2 and oh eq 1 such that metals removal could be enhanced through coprecipitation with and or adsorption to calcium carbonate caco3 s 14 both lmdt and at waters did contain appreciable amounts of fe 1 5 and 15 mg l respectively in which case some metals removal would also be expected through adsorption to iron iii hydroxide fe oh 3 s surfaces formed from the addition of naoh 14 naoh stock solutions were made several times over the course of testing using reagent grade pellets fisher scientific new hampshire and deionized water stock solutions were stored at room temperature in 1 l amber glass bottles 2 4 jar testing all testing was performed using a jar tester phipps bird inc virginia with 2 l clear acrylic square jars for jar testing ues added from stock slurry es added dry or naoh added from stock solution were added using small measuring cups or plastic syringes during a 1 2 minute rapid mix phase with an average velocity gradient g value of approximately 350 s 1 followed by a 60 min slow mix phase with a g value range of 50 to 90 s 1 upon completion of the slow mix phase samples were immediately removed from the built in jar valve and filtered using 0 45 μm acrylic copolymer membrane disc filters pall corporation new york metals removal kinetics were evaluated in a separate set of jar tests under the same conditions and procedures where metals samples were collected and filtered after 10 30 60 and 120 min of slow mixing these times were chosen based on the relevance to typical time scales of water treatment plants following another set of jar tests filterability of water treated with either ues or naoh was evaluated filterability was defined as the time to filter 500 ml of water through the same 0 45 μm filter under a constant 80 kpa of vacuum pressure immediately following the slow mix phase similar to the silt density index sdi test astm d4189 2 5 water quality analysis dissolved cd mn and zn were measured according to epa method 200 8 by a certified laboratory green analytical laboratories colorado with minimum reporting levels mrl of 0 0001 0 0005 and 0 002 mg l respectively for lmdt water and 0 002 0 01 and 0 04 mg l respectively for at water other metals of interest were measured according to either epa method 200 7 or 200 8 by the same certified laboratory alkalinity was measured using hach method 8203 hach colorado ph was measured using a gel filled electrode attached to a portable multimeter hach colorado calibrated before each jar test turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter hach colorado hardness and orp in table 1 were obtained from historical lmdt data 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose response final ph measured after 60 min of slow mixing as a function of ues and naoh dose is shown in fig 2 a for lmdt water although not shown within the first few minutes of slow mixing significant floc formation was visible in both ues and naoh jars as expected naoh was very effective at raising the ph compared to ues confirming its use as a performance benchmark as a point of reference every 1 0 mg l of naoh theoretically adds 0 43 mg l as oh to solution while every 1 0 mg l of cao theoretically adds 0 61 mg l as oh eq 1 however considering ues was approximately 32 cao only 0 20 mg l as oh would have been added to solution assuming complete dissolution therefore to reach the same ph it would be expected the ues dose would need to be at least twice the naoh dose as shown in fig 2a approximately four to ten times ues was required to reach a similar final ph driven by a relative plateau starting at a ues dose of 200 mg l plateauing ph indicates buffering an example being silicic acid h4sio4 pka1 9 8 pka2 13 2 formation from the dissolution of sio2 s 2 9 but as a check alkalinity was measured at ues doses of 400 and 1 000 mg l raw water alkalinity decreased from 120 5 mg l as caco3 to final values after 60 min of slow mixing of 105 5 and 70 5 mg l as caco3 respectively from this data alone it is unclear why final ph plateau behavior was observed for ues but a decrease in alkalinity is consistent with precipitation of me oh n s and meco3 s complexes one hypothesis as to why the final ph plateaued is release of h with free metal cation or metal ligand complex adsorption eq 2 and 3 increasingly counteracted the effect of oh addition eq 1 another related effect may be that increasing ues dose increased precipitation and or adsorption of me oh n s and meco3 s complexes such as caco3 s that coated the ues surface inhibiting further dissolution of cao that would have increased the ph eq 1 ultimately the dissolution of cao from ues and subsequent increase in ph led to increased metal adsorption and precipitate formation such that particles were filterable using a 0 45 μm filter normalized dissolved metals concentrations or the final concentration c divided by the initial raw water concentration c0 as a function of increasing ues and naoh doses are shown in fig 2b for lmdt water for both ues and naoh metals removed increased with dose and the percent removal followed zn cd mn consistent throughout all testing and at least with the solubility order of cd and zn meco3 s me oh 2 s and meo s complexes 14 while the removal of cd and zn through precipitate formation from increasing ph is common using either cao or naoh mn removal through precipitate formation is commonly and alternatively achieved through oxidation as manganese dioxide mno2 s likely because the reaction kinetics are faster than precipitation as mn oh 2 s or mnco3 s figure sm2 it is difficult to compare these results to published literature as these experiments were somewhat unique due to prior adsorption studies having very high steel slag doses 1 000 mg l and run until equilibrium 1 3 4 8 11 using modeling software stream analyzer oli systems inc new jersey to generate eh ph diagrams with the lmdt raw water quality in table 1 as inputs figure sm1 through figure sm3 in supplementary material the following metal precipitates were predicted to form under equilibrium and testing conditions positive orp high ph 2 oxidation state for cd mn and zn cadmium carbonate cdco3 s cadmium hydroxide cd oh 2 s manganese carbonate mnco3 s manganese hydroxide mn oh 2 s zinc carbonate znco3 s and zinc oxide zno s considering ues would contribute more species to solution than naoh based on its metal oxide composition the formation of additional precipitates such as al oh 3 s mgco3 s or sio2 s was also possible the potential for precipitation of several me oh n s and meco3 s complexes would be consistent with the observed decrease in alkalinity with increase in ues dose for further testing results shown in fig 2b were used to establish a ues dose of 400 mg l and naoh dose of 100 mg l as they provided similar and high levels 70 of cd mn and zn removal it should be noted that duplicate jars in one test measured release of dissolved ca increase from 65 to85 3 3 mg l and si increase from 5 4 to 6 3 0 25 mg l at the ues dose of 400 mg l confirming dissolution from ues and availability to form precipitates in solution e g caco3 s and potentially buffer ph the combination of data in figs 2a and 2b is shown in fig 2c with normalized dissolved metals concentrations shown as a function of final ph as expected metals removal increased with increasing ph with more similar trends between ues and naoh than those shown in fig 2b it is difficult to compare these results to published literature adsorption studies that relied on added acid bases to reach target ph values instead of steel slag induced ph change in general cd and zn were more easily removed at lower ph values than mn as was observed in fig 2b as a function of dose interestingly each metal exhibited a crossover point after which ues addition resulted in higher metals removal compared to naoh at the same final ph value these ph crossover points are specifically called out in fig 2c and were approximately 7 8 9 0 and 8 0 for cd mn and zn respectively the change was most dramatic for mn where approximately 70 75 removal was reached at ph 9 1 with ues but required ph 9 7 with naoh because metals removal was higher with ues at a lower ph than naoh following the crossover point such behavior suggests adsorption to the ues surface as a removal mechanism in addition to metal precipitate formation followed by size exclusion during filtration 3 2 kinetics based on the dose response curves in fig 2b ues and naoh doses of 400 and 100 mg l respectively were used for additional testing to establish metals removal kinetics normalized dissolved metals concentrations as a function of slow mixing time are shown in fig 3 for lmdt water removal curves in fig 3 confirm the selected doses for ues and naoh provided similar removal of cd mn and zn in the expected removal percentages zn cd mn the curve shapes are similar suggesting similar removal mechanisms of adsorption and precipitation of metals to ues and metal oxide floc surfaces initial kinetics were relatively fast with most of the cd mn and zn removed within the first 10 min in the case of ues similar for naoh 86 43 and 98 removal of cd mn and zn respectively occurred within the first 10 min for the next 110 min an additional 10 30 and 1 removal of cd mn and zn respectively was realized using ues again indicating slower kinetics for mn precipitate formation removal coincided with final ph where the ph did not significantly increase further after the 10 minute sample 9 3 0 1 for ues and 9 9 0 2 for naoh similar results to those shown in fig 3 albeit at much higher cd and zn concentrations 23 and 35 mg l respectively and steel slag doses 1 000 mg l have been observed with an initial rapid removal stage followed by a gradual removal stage 3 8 11 a two step adsorption process is typical for adsorption of metals to metal oxide surfaces 12 13 17 and therefore more gradual removal following the initial rapid phase may have been more related to metal ligand complex adsorption to the ues and metal oxide surfaces eq 3 adsorption is precluded and typically rate limited by film diffusion to the surfaces as opposed to solely precipitate growth into a filterable particle or floc a process that can be very fast as water molecules leave the metal coordination sphere 12 14 this postulation is unresolved as tests in this study were not designed to elucidate kinetics specific to different removal mechanisms 3 3 adsorption thus far it has been shown that greater metals removal from lmdt water was measured with increasing ues and naoh doses i e with increasing ph with specific removal mechanisms difficult to discern to better isolate adsorption of free metal cations eq 2 and metal ligand complexes eq 3eq 3 as a potential removal mechanism different es doses were tested in conjunction with a constant naoh dose of 30 mg l which resulted in a consistent final ph of 9 4 0 1 for all experiments es was mostly exhausted for its ph change capacity so its addition intentionally did not increase ph to any measurable degree but did add significant surface area for metal adsorption and or precipitation results of es testing are shown in fig 4 where normalized dissolved metals concentrations are presented as a function of es dose and surface area added at a naoh dose of 30 mg l only with no es added cd mn and zn removal were 75 19 and 98 respectively for cd and mn removal increased significantly with increasing es dose while zn removal was relatively stable at 97 98 as it was the most easily removed constituent with elevated ph fig 2c and fig 3 at a es dose of 200 mg l cd and mn removal improved to 84 and 46 respectively presumably through adsorption to the added es surface area of approximately 1 5 m2 l or 3 0 m2 for a 2 l jar mn dose response was the most dramatic and somewhat expected based on known affinities of mn for iron iii oxide surfaces e g α feooh 15 17 these results are also consistent with the stark crossover point in fig 2c for mn where adsorption to the ues surface was postulated since removal was greater than naoh tests at the same ph values greater than 9 0 in addition to the jar test results shown in fig 4 eds analysis of surfaces for six different steel slag particles before unused and after used testing with lmdt water is shown in table 2 eds spectra in figure sm4 through figure sm21 in supplementary material for each element across the six different particles in table 2 tukey s test was applied to establish differences in relative elemental surface mass percent values termed values for short in this section at the 95 confidence level the six particles were 1 ues unused 2 ues used at 400 mg l 3 es unused dominated by ca 4 es used at 200 mg l dominated by ca 5 es unused dominated by fe and 6 es used at 200 mg l dominated by fe the two es particles were differentiated in table 2 because it was apparent from sem backscatter images heavier elements are lighter in contrast that es particles were heterogeneous one was dominated by ca darker in contrast and another by fe lighter in contrast on all six particle types a cd peak in the eds spectra was not discernable from method noise likely because of its low concentration compared to other metals for ues particles differences in values between unused and used were significant only for carbon c and sulfur s s content was minimal in both cases but the increase in c could have been from adsorption and or precipitation of meco3 s complexes e g caco3 s to the ues surface although insignificant at the 95 confidence level mn values did increase on the ues surface from 0 4 unused to 0 6 used consistent with previous discussions on mn adsorption particularly the crossover points in fig 2c a discernable zn peak in the eds spectrum was not apparent for unused ues but was for used ues at 0 6 providing evidence for zn adsorption and or precipitation to the ues surface consistent with the affinity of zn for iron iii oxide surfaces e g fe2o3 h2o am 12 for ca dominated es particles there was not much difference in values between unused and used other than zn which increased from no discernable peak to 2 5 similar results were observed for zn on unused and used fe dominated es particles although insignificant at the 95 confidence level mn values for ca dominated es particles were higher than ues values at 1 3 perhaps the most important values in table 2 were for mn on fe dominated es particles mn values were 1 9 and 3 5 on the unused and used fe dominated particles respectively again consistent with previous studies that demonstrated mn affinity for iron iii oxide surfaces 15 17 a value of 3 5 was significantly different at the 95 confidence level compared to ues and ca dominated es values for mn these results further corroborate mn adsorption to es particles shown graphically in fig 4 3 4 filterability and leaching throughout all testing floc settling rates were visually faster in ues than naoh treated jars where the addition of ues appeared to provide benefits similar to ballasted flocculation using microsand to formally evaluate settling rates ues and naoh settling tests were performed by measuring the turbidity of water pulled from the built in jar values after 0 5 10 15 30 and 60 min of settling however turbidity results did not agree with visual observations or filter time for metals samples ues treated water was visibly much clearer after as little as 5 min of settling but resulted in similar settled water turbidity values as naoh treated water e g 4 4 1 4 and 6 0 2 6 ntu respectively after 60 min it is well known jar tests are not ideal for evaluating floc settling due to the lack of depth and continued water movement once mixing stops compared to full scale sedimentation basins therefore as an alternative way to quantitatively establish the water clarity or treatability of ues and naoh treated waters filterability tests at the same doses of 400 and 100 mg l respectively were performed filterability tests confirmed that water treated with ues was easier to filter immediately following 60 min of slow mixing consistent with visual observations from settling tests specifically triplicate tests established 4 3 0 1 min to filter 500 ml using ues final ph 9 5 0 0 and nearly three times longer or 11 9 2 7 min using naoh final ph 10 2 0 1 these results clearly indicate floc particles formed from naoh addition had a higher affinity for the hydrophilic filter surface compared to floc ues particles formed from ues addition that increased affinity materialized as a fouling layer increasing resistance to water flow despite a constant applied vacuum pressure without zeta potential or streaming current measurements it is difficult to assume floc particle surface charges following naoh or ues addition but filterability tests operationally demonstrated there were considerable differences in floc character and behavior considering the abundance of species that can dissolve from the ues surface e g ca and si and form precipitates e g caco3 s and sio2 s these results are not entirely surprising independent of floc affinity for the filter surface the vast majority of ues particles 75 μm would be filterable using a 0 45 μm filter as a result lmdt water treated with ues may also have been easier to filter due to adsorption of free metal cation and metal ligand complexes to ues surface as opposed to their precipitation in solution that could contribute to a fouling layer at the filter surface future research could elucidate the difference in filtration between the two treated waters and extend results to design of a downstream process such as membrane filtration following filterability tests duplicate jar samples were analyzed for dissolved arsenic as chromium cr cyanide cn phosphorus p selenium se and s over concerns related to the leachability of undesirable constituents from ues as cn p and se were all below mrls of 0 001 0 010 0 050 and 0 001 mg l respectively in raw and ues treated water cr concentrations decreased slightly from 0 0017 mg l in the raw water to 0 0011 0 0001 mg l in the ues treated water s also decreased slightly from 71 mg l in the raw water to 69 0 2 mg l in the ues treated water therefore for this ues and lmdt water combination leaching of concerning constituents was not significant however although the same constituents were not measured in at treated water leaching could be more significant in acid mine drainage waters 3 5 combined treatment while ues addition alone was sufficient to significantly raise the ph of lmdt water it was unable to do the same in the much more acidic at water for example at a dose of 2 400 mg l ues raised at water ph from 2 9 to 6 0 resulting in only 21 15 and 30 removal of cd mn and zn respectively therefore ues was tested in conjunction with naoh as a means to reduce naoh dosing requirements a relatively expensive chemical compared to steel slag recent costs for naoh and steel slag were approximately 1 15 per kg naoh 18 and 0 03 per kg steel slag 19 results comparing naoh alone with a naoh dose of 450 mg l combined with varying ues doses is shown in fig 5 for mn only mn data are shown because as previously demonstrated it was the most difficult to remove and present at a concentration much higher than lmdt water at approximately 65 mg l a naoh dose of 450 mg l was chosen to target approximately 50 mn removal based on preliminary testing but removed cd and zn to 97 which is the reason for their omission in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a naoh dose of 450 mg l at 0 mg l on ues naoh curve or interpolated point on naoh only curve with dashed lines was close to the target resulting in mn removal of approximately 44 mn removal increased with ues dose and intersected the naoh only curve at approximately 600 mg l as such this point can be interpreted as a naoh dose reduction of 150 mg l 25 with the addition of 600 mg l ues similar interpretations can be made using interpolations of both curves demonstrating that ues use could result in significant reductions of naoh dosing requirements for example if 80 mn removal was required it could be accomplished with approximately 550 mg l naoh or 450 mg l naoh with 350 mg l ues an 18 reduction in naoh considering metals removal was observed using naoh and es fig 4 sludge recycle is likely to increase metals removal if such a process were implemented an additional observation of note in fig 5 is no mn removal was observed by solely dosing naoh at 300 mg l ph 6 8 but as previously stated approximately 15 mn removal was observed at the high ues dose of 2 400 mg l ph 6 0 such behavior further supports the adsorption of mn to the ues surface as a removal mechanism 4 conclusions two different types of the same original steel slag ues and es were applied under simulated water treatment conditions for the removal of metals from two mine drainage waters one neutral and one acidic approximately four times as much ues 400 mg l compared to naoh 100 mg l was required to achieve 70 removal of cd mn and zn from near neutral ph lmdt water beyond ph values specific to each metal ues provided better removal at lower ph values compared to naoh which was attributed to metal adsorption to the ues surface most metals removal occurred within the first 10 min of ues 400 mg l and naoh 100 mg l addition however continued removal was observed over the next 110 min especially for mn at a constant ph value of 9 4 30 mg l naoh increased addition of es 0 200 mg l increased metals removal confirming adsorption was a significant removal mechanism in addition to removal via filtration of metal precipitates these results also indicate that in a full scale process sludge recycle could be implemented to enhance metals adsorption and reduce ues dose requirements eds analysis also confirmed metal adsorption through relative quantification of ues and es surface concentrations lmdt water treated with ues was easier to filter than water treated with naoh based on time to filter 500 ml through 0 45 μm filters which deserves further research into specific floc filter interactions for the very acidic at water ues 600 mg l was able to reduce naoh dose requirements by 25 600 to 450 mg l to achieve 90 mn removal compared to naoh ues represents a significant opportunity to use a waste material to sustainably reduce metals removal treatment costs for that reason future research should test steel slag

13813,using abundant and cheap steel slag for metals removal from water represents an opportunity to recover waste material from one industry as a resource for another in this study powdered steel slag which contains lime cao leftover from the steelmaking process was evaluated and benchmarked against the relatively expensive and energy intensive chemical sodium hydroxide naoh for the removal of cadmium cd manganese mn and zinc zn from two different mine drainage waters unlike isotherm and kinetic studies that represent most previous work this study evaluated metals removal under realistic simulated water treatment conditions doses mixing contact times etc bringing the material one step closer to actual full scale implementation in the neutral ph water with lower metals concentrations approximately four times more steel slag 400 mg l compared to naoh 100 mg l was required to achieve 70 metals removal in the acidic ph water with higher metals concentrations steel slag was insufficient to raise the ph at reasonable doses 1 000 mg l but was shown to reduce naoh dosing requirements by 25 600 to 450 mg l when used in combination with steel slag 600 mg l like naoh steel slag addition facilitated metal precipitate formation but also provided relatively high specific surface area 7 6 m2 g for metal adsorption particularly for mn a promising finding for future work to evaluate sludge recycle water treated with steel slag was also found to be more amenable to 0 45 μm filtration than water treated with naoh keywords mine drainage metals adsorption precipitation steel slag sodium hydroxide 1 introduction reclaiming waste materials from one industry as useful materials in another is is becoming increasingly attractive in a resource limited world one example and the topic of this study is the use of steel slag for the removal of metals from water steel slag is a waste byproduct from steelmaking produced from the addition of burnt lime or calcium oxide cao to remove impurities metal oxides phosphorus from the high temperature steelmaking process as such steel slag is a relatively high surface area and dense granular material rich in cao and other metal oxides such as iron iii oxide fe2o3 and silicon dioxide sio2 in addition to having a high specific surface area the presence of cao in steel slag increases water ph 1 2 and divalent calcium ca2 concentrations through the formation of hydrated lime or calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 s as shown in eq 1 a desirable trait for metals removal e g as hydroxide precipitates from water 1 c a o s h 2 o c a o h 2 s c a 2 2 o h several studies have investigated the use of steel slag for metals removal from water using either batch or fixed bed scenarios fixed bed steel slag studies are not discussed herein but have been shown to be effective at removing metals from water albeit at relatively low water throughput i e hundreds of bed volumes 3 7 in the case of batch studies which are more relevant to this study steel slag particles ranging from 24 to 2 000 μm in diameter have been evaluated for metals removal via adsorption to its relatively high metal oxide surface area 0 4 to 107 m2 g 1 3 4 7 11 in environmental systems metals removal mechanisms can be difficult to isolate or identify nevertheless in general free divalent metal cation me2 adsorption to the heterogeneous steel slag surface is akin to adsorption to homogenous metal oxide surfaces following the generic adsorption equations shown in eq 2 10 12 15 2 s o h 0 m e 2 s o m e h s o h 0 m e 2 h 2 o s o m e o h 2 h where soh0 is a neutral surface site some and someoh are surface sites occupied by a divalent metal cation and h is the hydrogen ion proton released into solution considering steel slag addition would raise the ph as given by eq 1 the formation of divalent metal oxides meo hydroxides me oh 2 and or carbonates meco3 followed by precipitation to the steel slag surface could be expected in addition to metal ligand complex mel adsorption or ternary surface complex formation as shown in eq 3 13 14 3 s o h 0 m e 2 l s o m e l 0 h where l is a ligand e g oh that acts as a bridge to form somel0 a neutral surface site occupied by the metal ligand complex in prior batch equilibrium adsorption studies steel slag was shown to be an effective adsorbent for removing several divalent cationic metals from solution namely cadmium cd copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn 1 3 4 7 11 increased adsorption was measured at higher ph values above the steel slag surface ph point of zero charge phpzc where the negative surface charge attracted divalent cations however these studies controlled ph using either acid or base addition as opposed to testing ph response derived solely from steel slag addition most solutions were synthetic buffered deionized water with high steel slag doses and metals concentrations 10 000 mg l and 500 mg l respectively as an example 3 work by nguyen et al 7 evaluated adsorption of metals to steel slag under more realistic scenarios doses and metals concentrations of 100 mg l and 5 mg l respectively but experiments were still run to equilibrium 24 h at a constant ph 6 5 more research with real waters reasonable steel slag doses and typical contact times minutes to hours is needed to evaluate the potential of steel slag as a practical and potentially more sustainable water treatment process as with any novel material a baseline comparison to existing treatment chemicals is needed but such comparisons are also lacking in previous studies therefore the objective and novelty of this study was to evaluate steel slag performance benchmarked against relatively expensive and energy intensive chemical sodium hydroxide naoh under realistic treatment plant conditions with two real waters both relatively high in cd manganese mn and zn experiments were designed to determine bulk performance of steel slag as measured by metals removal when added during water treatment processes similar to adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon pac as opposed to experiments designed to elucidate specific removal mechanisms surface reactions or kinetic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 waters two mine drainage waters with elevated levels of metals were tested in this study one from the leadville mine drainage tunnel lmdt in leadville colorado and one from the argo tunnel at in idaho springs colorado both lmdt and at have operating water treatment plants that use naoh and ca oh 2 to remove metals prior to discharging to the vulnerable surface waters of the arkansas river and clear creek respectively most testing was performed with lmdt water but for both waters testing was either performed at the respective water treatment plants or after collecting water in 20 l hdpe containers and storing at 4 until use within a week relevant raw water quality of the two waters is shown in table 1 highlighting the metals focused on in this study cd mn and zn due to difficulties in their removal solely through increases in ph compared to other easily removed source water metals cu fe pb historically lmdt water is atypical for mine drainage in that it is influenced by native groundwater which raises ph alkalinity and oxidation reduction potential orp consequently lmdt water has significant alkalinity neutral ph and relatively low metals concentrations by contrast at water is historically more typical of acid mine drainage exhibiting low ph no alkalinity and relatively high metals concentrations 2 2 slag basic oxygen furnace steel slag the same product used by caicedo ramirez et al 2 16 was tested in this study major metal oxide composition of this steel slag identified using powder x ray diffraction xrd was performed by caicedo ramirez et al 16 and consisted of cao 32 fe2o3 26 sio2 15 magnesium oxide mgo 11 aluminum oxide al2o3 6 6 manganese oxide mno 2 5 phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 0 7 calcium or sodium sulfate caso4 or na2so4 0 4 and sodium oxide na2o 0 1 consistent with steel slag composition 1 7 9 11 to create a powder similar in size to pac small batches 100 g of as received steel slag 1 6 mm were sieved to particle diameters less than 75 μm using a stainless steel sieve us standard mesh 200 and vibratory sieve shaker powdered steel slag stock slurries 20 g l were made several times over the course of testing using deionized water resistivity 16 mω cm stock slurries were stored at room temperature in 1 l amber glass bottles scanning electron microscopy sem paired with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of steel slag surfaces was also performed to obtain relative mass percent values of identified elements with a detection limit of 0 1 rocky mountain laboratories inc colorado an sem image of the powdered raw steel slag is shown in fig 1 and demonstrates a rough surface morphology that contributed to a measured specific surface area value of 7 6 m2 g according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method micromeritics instrument corporation georgia for reference the specific surface area of a perfectly spherical steel slag particle with a diameter of 38 μm half of 75 μm and solid particle density ρs of 2 6 0 3 g cm 3 4 8 would be approximately 0 06 m2 g or nearly 130 times less surface area than what was measured for the steel slag used in this study to eliminate the ability of as received steel slag to increase water ph and subsequently test that modification approximately 5 g of powdered steel slag was exhausted for ph change capacity by up flowing deionized water ph 6 10 ml min through a small fluidized bed of steel slag in 9 5 mm inside diameter polypropylene tubing using a diaphragm pump when the fluidized bed effluent water reached a steady state ph value of approximately 7 after several months of operation the process was stopped powdered steel slag was removed from the tubing dried in a muffle furnace at 100 c and stored in a 50 ml glass beaker until use herein this steel slag is referred to as exhausted slag es and steel slag added from the previously described stock slurry is referred to as unexhausted slag ues 2 3 sodium hydroxide as a benchmark for performance all ues and es tests included parallel tests with naoh naoh was chosen instead of pure cao or ca oh 2 because it contributes only hydroxide ions oh to solution i e ph increase only whereas cao or ca oh 2 contribute ca2 and oh eq 1 such that metals removal could be enhanced through coprecipitation with and or adsorption to calcium carbonate caco3 s 14 both lmdt and at waters did contain appreciable amounts of fe 1 5 and 15 mg l respectively in which case some metals removal would also be expected through adsorption to iron iii hydroxide fe oh 3 s surfaces formed from the addition of naoh 14 naoh stock solutions were made several times over the course of testing using reagent grade pellets fisher scientific new hampshire and deionized water stock solutions were stored at room temperature in 1 l amber glass bottles 2 4 jar testing all testing was performed using a jar tester phipps bird inc virginia with 2 l clear acrylic square jars for jar testing ues added from stock slurry es added dry or naoh added from stock solution were added using small measuring cups or plastic syringes during a 1 2 minute rapid mix phase with an average velocity gradient g value of approximately 350 s 1 followed by a 60 min slow mix phase with a g value range of 50 to 90 s 1 upon completion of the slow mix phase samples were immediately removed from the built in jar valve and filtered using 0 45 μm acrylic copolymer membrane disc filters pall corporation new york metals removal kinetics were evaluated in a separate set of jar tests under the same conditions and procedures where metals samples were collected and filtered after 10 30 60 and 120 min of slow mixing these times were chosen based on the relevance to typical time scales of water treatment plants following another set of jar tests filterability of water treated with either ues or naoh was evaluated filterability was defined as the time to filter 500 ml of water through the same 0 45 μm filter under a constant 80 kpa of vacuum pressure immediately following the slow mix phase similar to the silt density index sdi test astm d4189 2 5 water quality analysis dissolved cd mn and zn were measured according to epa method 200 8 by a certified laboratory green analytical laboratories colorado with minimum reporting levels mrl of 0 0001 0 0005 and 0 002 mg l respectively for lmdt water and 0 002 0 01 and 0 04 mg l respectively for at water other metals of interest were measured according to either epa method 200 7 or 200 8 by the same certified laboratory alkalinity was measured using hach method 8203 hach colorado ph was measured using a gel filled electrode attached to a portable multimeter hach colorado calibrated before each jar test turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter hach colorado hardness and orp in table 1 were obtained from historical lmdt data 3 results and discussion 3 1 dose response final ph measured after 60 min of slow mixing as a function of ues and naoh dose is shown in fig 2 a for lmdt water although not shown within the first few minutes of slow mixing significant floc formation was visible in both ues and naoh jars as expected naoh was very effective at raising the ph compared to ues confirming its use as a performance benchmark as a point of reference every 1 0 mg l of naoh theoretically adds 0 43 mg l as oh to solution while every 1 0 mg l of cao theoretically adds 0 61 mg l as oh eq 1 however considering ues was approximately 32 cao only 0 20 mg l as oh would have been added to solution assuming complete dissolution therefore to reach the same ph it would be expected the ues dose would need to be at least twice the naoh dose as shown in fig 2a approximately four to ten times ues was required to reach a similar final ph driven by a relative plateau starting at a ues dose of 200 mg l plateauing ph indicates buffering an example being silicic acid h4sio4 pka1 9 8 pka2 13 2 formation from the dissolution of sio2 s 2 9 but as a check alkalinity was measured at ues doses of 400 and 1 000 mg l raw water alkalinity decreased from 120 5 mg l as caco3 to final values after 60 min of slow mixing of 105 5 and 70 5 mg l as caco3 respectively from this data alone it is unclear why final ph plateau behavior was observed for ues but a decrease in alkalinity is consistent with precipitation of me oh n s and meco3 s complexes one hypothesis as to why the final ph plateaued is release of h with free metal cation or metal ligand complex adsorption eq 2 and 3 increasingly counteracted the effect of oh addition eq 1 another related effect may be that increasing ues dose increased precipitation and or adsorption of me oh n s and meco3 s complexes such as caco3 s that coated the ues surface inhibiting further dissolution of cao that would have increased the ph eq 1 ultimately the dissolution of cao from ues and subsequent increase in ph led to increased metal adsorption and precipitate formation such that particles were filterable using a 0 45 μm filter normalized dissolved metals concentrations or the final concentration c divided by the initial raw water concentration c0 as a function of increasing ues and naoh doses are shown in fig 2b for lmdt water for both ues and naoh metals removed increased with dose and the percent removal followed zn cd mn consistent throughout all testing and at least with the solubility order of cd and zn meco3 s me oh 2 s and meo s complexes 14 while the removal of cd and zn through precipitate formation from increasing ph is common using either cao or naoh mn removal through precipitate formation is commonly and alternatively achieved through oxidation as manganese dioxide mno2 s likely because the reaction kinetics are faster than precipitation as mn oh 2 s or mnco3 s figure sm2 it is difficult to compare these results to published literature as these experiments were somewhat unique due to prior adsorption studies having very high steel slag doses 1 000 mg l and run until equilibrium 1 3 4 8 11 using modeling software stream analyzer oli systems inc new jersey to generate eh ph diagrams with the lmdt raw water quality in table 1 as inputs figure sm1 through figure sm3 in supplementary material the following metal precipitates were predicted to form under equilibrium and testing conditions positive orp high ph 2 oxidation state for cd mn and zn cadmium carbonate cdco3 s cadmium hydroxide cd oh 2 s manganese carbonate mnco3 s manganese hydroxide mn oh 2 s zinc carbonate znco3 s and zinc oxide zno s considering ues would contribute more species to solution than naoh based on its metal oxide composition the formation of additional precipitates such as al oh 3 s mgco3 s or sio2 s was also possible the potential for precipitation of several me oh n s and meco3 s complexes would be consistent with the observed decrease in alkalinity with increase in ues dose for further testing results shown in fig 2b were used to establish a ues dose of 400 mg l and naoh dose of 100 mg l as they provided similar and high levels 70 of cd mn and zn removal it should be noted that duplicate jars in one test measured release of dissolved ca increase from 65 to85 3 3 mg l and si increase from 5 4 to 6 3 0 25 mg l at the ues dose of 400 mg l confirming dissolution from ues and availability to form precipitates in solution e g caco3 s and potentially buffer ph the combination of data in figs 2a and 2b is shown in fig 2c with normalized dissolved metals concentrations shown as a function of final ph as expected metals removal increased with increasing ph with more similar trends between ues and naoh than those shown in fig 2b it is difficult to compare these results to published literature adsorption studies that relied on added acid bases to reach target ph values instead of steel slag induced ph change in general cd and zn were more easily removed at lower ph values than mn as was observed in fig 2b as a function of dose interestingly each metal exhibited a crossover point after which ues addition resulted in higher metals removal compared to naoh at the same final ph value these ph crossover points are specifically called out in fig 2c and were approximately 7 8 9 0 and 8 0 for cd mn and zn respectively the change was most dramatic for mn where approximately 70 75 removal was reached at ph 9 1 with ues but required ph 9 7 with naoh because metals removal was higher with ues at a lower ph than naoh following the crossover point such behavior suggests adsorption to the ues surface as a removal mechanism in addition to metal precipitate formation followed by size exclusion during filtration 3 2 kinetics based on the dose response curves in fig 2b ues and naoh doses of 400 and 100 mg l respectively were used for additional testing to establish metals removal kinetics normalized dissolved metals concentrations as a function of slow mixing time are shown in fig 3 for lmdt water removal curves in fig 3 confirm the selected doses for ues and naoh provided similar removal of cd mn and zn in the expected removal percentages zn cd mn the curve shapes are similar suggesting similar removal mechanisms of adsorption and precipitation of metals to ues and metal oxide floc surfaces initial kinetics were relatively fast with most of the cd mn and zn removed within the first 10 min in the case of ues similar for naoh 86 43 and 98 removal of cd mn and zn respectively occurred within the first 10 min for the next 110 min an additional 10 30 and 1 removal of cd mn and zn respectively was realized using ues again indicating slower kinetics for mn precipitate formation removal coincided with final ph where the ph did not significantly increase further after the 10 minute sample 9 3 0 1 for ues and 9 9 0 2 for naoh similar results to those shown in fig 3 albeit at much higher cd and zn concentrations 23 and 35 mg l respectively and steel slag doses 1 000 mg l have been observed with an initial rapid removal stage followed by a gradual removal stage 3 8 11 a two step adsorption process is typical for adsorption of metals to metal oxide surfaces 12 13 17 and therefore more gradual removal following the initial rapid phase may have been more related to metal ligand complex adsorption to the ues and metal oxide surfaces eq 3 adsorption is precluded and typically rate limited by film diffusion to the surfaces as opposed to solely precipitate growth into a filterable particle or floc a process that can be very fast as water molecules leave the metal coordination sphere 12 14 this postulation is unresolved as tests in this study were not designed to elucidate kinetics specific to different removal mechanisms 3 3 adsorption thus far it has been shown that greater metals removal from lmdt water was measured with increasing ues and naoh doses i e with increasing ph with specific removal mechanisms difficult to discern to better isolate adsorption of free metal cations eq 2 and metal ligand complexes eq 3eq 3 as a potential removal mechanism different es doses were tested in conjunction with a constant naoh dose of 30 mg l which resulted in a consistent final ph of 9 4 0 1 for all experiments es was mostly exhausted for its ph change capacity so its addition intentionally did not increase ph to any measurable degree but did add significant surface area for metal adsorption and or precipitation results of es testing are shown in fig 4 where normalized dissolved metals concentrations are presented as a function of es dose and surface area added at a naoh dose of 30 mg l only with no es added cd mn and zn removal were 75 19 and 98 respectively for cd and mn removal increased significantly with increasing es dose while zn removal was relatively stable at 97 98 as it was the most easily removed constituent with elevated ph fig 2c and fig 3 at a es dose of 200 mg l cd and mn removal improved to 84 and 46 respectively presumably through adsorption to the added es surface area of approximately 1 5 m2 l or 3 0 m2 for a 2 l jar mn dose response was the most dramatic and somewhat expected based on known affinities of mn for iron iii oxide surfaces e g α feooh 15 17 these results are also consistent with the stark crossover point in fig 2c for mn where adsorption to the ues surface was postulated since removal was greater than naoh tests at the same ph values greater than 9 0 in addition to the jar test results shown in fig 4 eds analysis of surfaces for six different steel slag particles before unused and after used testing with lmdt water is shown in table 2 eds spectra in figure sm4 through figure sm21 in supplementary material for each element across the six different particles in table 2 tukey s test was applied to establish differences in relative elemental surface mass percent values termed values for short in this section at the 95 confidence level the six particles were 1 ues unused 2 ues used at 400 mg l 3 es unused dominated by ca 4 es used at 200 mg l dominated by ca 5 es unused dominated by fe and 6 es used at 200 mg l dominated by fe the two es particles were differentiated in table 2 because it was apparent from sem backscatter images heavier elements are lighter in contrast that es particles were heterogeneous one was dominated by ca darker in contrast and another by fe lighter in contrast on all six particle types a cd peak in the eds spectra was not discernable from method noise likely because of its low concentration compared to other metals for ues particles differences in values between unused and used were significant only for carbon c and sulfur s s content was minimal in both cases but the increase in c could have been from adsorption and or precipitation of meco3 s complexes e g caco3 s to the ues surface although insignificant at the 95 confidence level mn values did increase on the ues surface from 0 4 unused to 0 6 used consistent with previous discussions on mn adsorption particularly the crossover points in fig 2c a discernable zn peak in the eds spectrum was not apparent for unused ues but was for used ues at 0 6 providing evidence for zn adsorption and or precipitation to the ues surface consistent with the affinity of zn for iron iii oxide surfaces e g fe2o3 h2o am 12 for ca dominated es particles there was not much difference in values between unused and used other than zn which increased from no discernable peak to 2 5 similar results were observed for zn on unused and used fe dominated es particles although insignificant at the 95 confidence level mn values for ca dominated es particles were higher than ues values at 1 3 perhaps the most important values in table 2 were for mn on fe dominated es particles mn values were 1 9 and 3 5 on the unused and used fe dominated particles respectively again consistent with previous studies that demonstrated mn affinity for iron iii oxide surfaces 15 17 a value of 3 5 was significantly different at the 95 confidence level compared to ues and ca dominated es values for mn these results further corroborate mn adsorption to es particles shown graphically in fig 4 3 4 filterability and leaching throughout all testing floc settling rates were visually faster in ues than naoh treated jars where the addition of ues appeared to provide benefits similar to ballasted flocculation using microsand to formally evaluate settling rates ues and naoh settling tests were performed by measuring the turbidity of water pulled from the built in jar values after 0 5 10 15 30 and 60 min of settling however turbidity results did not agree with visual observations or filter time for metals samples ues treated water was visibly much clearer after as little as 5 min of settling but resulted in similar settled water turbidity values as naoh treated water e g 4 4 1 4 and 6 0 2 6 ntu respectively after 60 min it is well known jar tests are not ideal for evaluating floc settling due to the lack of depth and continued water movement once mixing stops compared to full scale sedimentation basins therefore as an alternative way to quantitatively establish the water clarity or treatability of ues and naoh treated waters filterability tests at the same doses of 400 and 100 mg l respectively were performed filterability tests confirmed that water treated with ues was easier to filter immediately following 60 min of slow mixing consistent with visual observations from settling tests specifically triplicate tests established 4 3 0 1 min to filter 500 ml using ues final ph 9 5 0 0 and nearly three times longer or 11 9 2 7 min using naoh final ph 10 2 0 1 these results clearly indicate floc particles formed from naoh addition had a higher affinity for the hydrophilic filter surface compared to floc ues particles formed from ues addition that increased affinity materialized as a fouling layer increasing resistance to water flow despite a constant applied vacuum pressure without zeta potential or streaming current measurements it is difficult to assume floc particle surface charges following naoh or ues addition but filterability tests operationally demonstrated there were considerable differences in floc character and behavior considering the abundance of species that can dissolve from the ues surface e g ca and si and form precipitates e g caco3 s and sio2 s these results are not entirely surprising independent of floc affinity for the filter surface the vast majority of ues particles 75 μm would be filterable using a 0 45 μm filter as a result lmdt water treated with ues may also have been easier to filter due to adsorption of free metal cation and metal ligand complexes to ues surface as opposed to their precipitation in solution that could contribute to a fouling layer at the filter surface future research could elucidate the difference in filtration between the two treated waters and extend results to design of a downstream process such as membrane filtration following filterability tests duplicate jar samples were analyzed for dissolved arsenic as chromium cr cyanide cn phosphorus p selenium se and s over concerns related to the leachability of undesirable constituents from ues as cn p and se were all below mrls of 0 001 0 010 0 050 and 0 001 mg l respectively in raw and ues treated water cr concentrations decreased slightly from 0 0017 mg l in the raw water to 0 0011 0 0001 mg l in the ues treated water s also decreased slightly from 71 mg l in the raw water to 69 0 2 mg l in the ues treated water therefore for this ues and lmdt water combination leaching of concerning constituents was not significant however although the same constituents were not measured in at treated water leaching could be more significant in acid mine drainage waters 3 5 combined treatment while ues addition alone was sufficient to significantly raise the ph of lmdt water it was unable to do the same in the much more acidic at water for example at a dose of 2 400 mg l ues raised at water ph from 2 9 to 6 0 resulting in only 21 15 and 30 removal of cd mn and zn respectively therefore ues was tested in conjunction with naoh as a means to reduce naoh dosing requirements a relatively expensive chemical compared to steel slag recent costs for naoh and steel slag were approximately 1 15 per kg naoh 18 and 0 03 per kg steel slag 19 results comparing naoh alone with a naoh dose of 450 mg l combined with varying ues doses is shown in fig 5 for mn only mn data are shown because as previously demonstrated it was the most difficult to remove and present at a concentration much higher than lmdt water at approximately 65 mg l a naoh dose of 450 mg l was chosen to target approximately 50 mn removal based on preliminary testing but removed cd and zn to 97 which is the reason for their omission in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a naoh dose of 450 mg l at 0 mg l on ues naoh curve or interpolated point on naoh only curve with dashed lines was close to the target resulting in mn removal of approximately 44 mn removal increased with ues dose and intersected the naoh only curve at approximately 600 mg l as such this point can be interpreted as a naoh dose reduction of 150 mg l 25 with the addition of 600 mg l ues similar interpretations can be made using interpolations of both curves demonstrating that ues use could result in significant reductions of naoh dosing requirements for example if 80 mn removal was required it could be accomplished with approximately 550 mg l naoh or 450 mg l naoh with 350 mg l ues an 18 reduction in naoh considering metals removal was observed using naoh and es fig 4 sludge recycle is likely to increase metals removal if such a process were implemented an additional observation of note in fig 5 is no mn removal was observed by solely dosing naoh at 300 mg l ph 6 8 but as previously stated approximately 15 mn removal was observed at the high ues dose of 2 400 mg l ph 6 0 such behavior further supports the adsorption of mn to the ues surface as a removal mechanism 4 conclusions two different types of the same original steel slag ues and es were applied under simulated water treatment conditions for the removal of metals from two mine drainage waters one neutral and one acidic approximately four times as much ues 400 mg l compared to naoh 100 mg l was required to achieve 70 removal of cd mn and zn from near neutral ph lmdt water beyond ph values specific to each metal ues provided better removal at lower ph values compared to naoh which was attributed to metal adsorption to the ues surface most metals removal occurred within the first 10 min of ues 400 mg l and naoh 100 mg l addition however continued removal was observed over the next 110 min especially for mn at a constant ph value of 9 4 30 mg l naoh increased addition of es 0 200 mg l increased metals removal confirming adsorption was a significant removal mechanism in addition to removal via filtration of metal precipitates these results also indicate that in a full scale process sludge recycle could be implemented to enhance metals adsorption and reduce ues dose requirements eds analysis also confirmed metal adsorption through relative quantification of ues and es surface concentrations lmdt water treated with ues was easier to filter than water treated with naoh based on time to filter 500 ml through 0 45 μm filters which deserves further research into specific floc filter interactions for the very acidic at water ues 600 mg l was able to reduce naoh dose requirements by 25 600 to 450 mg l to achieve 90 mn removal compared to naoh ues represents a significant opportunity to use a waste material to sustainably reduce metals removal treatment costs for that reason future research should test steel slag

13814,substituting the conventional crude oil based products such as volatile fatty acids vfas derived from oil refineries by adequate substances produced in biowaste refineries triggers a lot of attention there is also interest in combining wastewater treatment and biowaste treatment and focus it on bio products production other than the currently established methane fermentation this paper summarizes investigations of vfas generation from separately collected municipal biowaste inoculated with anaerobic digestion plant wastewater in a batch laboratory bioreactor with 20 l volume under varying conditions the production of vfas within 72 h from batch with 7 5 ts and olr of 21 5 g l d amounted to 11 5 g l 13 5 g l and 20 5 g l for ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively the highest yield of vfas production 0 310 g vfas g vsfed was determined for ph 6 0 and olr of 21 5 g l d moreover at ph 6 0 the dominating products were higher chain acids in form of valeric and butyric acids constituting 53 and 41 of the total mass of vfas produced which distinguishes this study from existing literature keywords volatile fatty acids vfa biorefinery wastewater municipal biowaste 1 introduction currently there is a tendency for producing components and additives for food and chemical industries from various side streams 1 biowaste among many organic substrates if properly handled becomes a promising stream for the bioeconomy biowaste according to the definition provided by the eu council directive 2008 98 ec means every biodegradable waste in the form of food from households canteens enterprises etc and green waste from parks gardens etc one of the largest biowaste streams is food waste which in the eu represents more than 180 million tonnes per year 2 after leaving the field the majority of food waste is generated in the consumption chain including households and the hospitality sector restaurants hotels etc with the former ones contributing up to 70 of the whole volume of food waste 3 food waste can be classified in four groups including 1 fruit and vegetables 2 starchy foodstuff 3 meat fish and by products and 4 others e g dairy products sweets or non edible products i e bones shell skin etc 4 recent literature studies on the potential of food waste for anaerobic digestion and biorefinery processes focus mainly on residues originating from restaurants and catering services 5 8 food waste from households has been up till now only partly available as a separate stream as in many countries it is still contained within residual municipal waste the organic fraction of residual waste contributes to environmental problems becoming a potential contaminant of water and land as well as a source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover its value as a potential substrate for the bioeconomy is lost initially separate collection focused on biowaste from municipal green areas and individual gardens as it is easier to handle than food waste however implementation of the circular economy package into the european legislation imposes inter alia a eu wide obligation to separately collect all biowaste from households not later than by the year 2023 directive 2008 98 ec as amended in 2018 moreover article 11 of the aforementioned directive and article 5 of the landfill directive 1999 31 ec represent an eu wide commitment to reduce landfills usage to 10 of all municipal waste while increasing recycling routes to 65 by 2030 this is aimed inter alia to stimulate the development of new technologies for recycling of biowaste according to the european compost network 9 a total of 47 5 mio tonnes of biowaste is treated every year in the eu this amounts to 117 kg biowaste per capita corresponding to 23 of total municipal solid waste per year currently countries with most advanced biowaste collection systems like the netherlands and germany achieve a yearly collection quota of 223 and 171 kg capita respectively based on these numbers it is justified to assume that in the future an average european wide yearly biowaste collection rate of 150 kg inhabitant can be expected this would result in app 78 mio tonnes of biowaste for eu 28 which means an additional stream of approx 30 mio tonnes of mainly food waste as garden biowaste collection is already established to be available for biological conversion the food waste from households can be collected either together with garden waste or as a separate stream in the latter case the food waste is then treated in an anaerobic digestion process while the garden biowaste is treated in a composting process food waste from the hospitality sector hotels restaurants canteens etc can be collected together with household food waste by household waste collection services 10 currently in eu 28 there are 4274 plants for the treatment of biowaste of which 3403 are composting plants 738 anaerobic digestion plants and the remaining ones combine both technologies 9 composting is an attractive low cost and proven technology to restore organic matter and nutrients contained especially in the garden biowaste back to soils in the form of compost it can also directly benefit households as it can be practiced domestically by citizens 11 food waste especially if collected as a separate stream has a very high content of moisture and easily biodegradable organic matter and thus is an ideal substrate for anaerobic digestion 12 14 conventional anaerobic digestion is aimed at maximising the methane production it ranks higher than composting in the waste management hierarchy as it enables both to restore the fertilising value of biowaste and to recover energy 15 16 however more advanced technologies aim at converting the waste into useful products not only organic fertilizers but also into other bio products and or energy biofuels thus correctly managed biowaste not only ceases to constitute and environmental problem but also opens a market to sustainable new technologies the circular economy is defined by the european commission 17 as minimizing the generation of waste and maintaining the value of products materials and resources for as long as possible conversion of biomass especial residues into bio products or biofuel is a sustainable method that is a part of the biological cycle of the circular bioeconomy 18 according to the biorefinery concept the value of individual substrates should be maximized similar to the crude oil refining processes which may be a key factor of their economic advantage over the traditional production 19 methodologies which convert waste into biobased products require a wide spectrum of processes and technologies including acidogenesis bioelectrogenesis photosynthesis photofermentation etc 4 20 23 in order to design novel products it is possible to combine various side streams into new raw materials 23 according to nova institute research 24 conducted in 2017 in europe 224 biorefineries were operating including 63 sugar starch based biorefineries producing bioethanol and other chemicals 64 oil fat based biorefineries producing biodiesel 54 oil fat based biorefineries producing feedstock for oleochemistry 25 wood based biorefineries excluding those that produce pulp for paper only 5 lignocellulose based biorefineries other than wood and 13 biowaste based biorefineries among many biorefinery processes anaerobic fermentation for low molecular mass carboxylic acids c2 c7 production commonly referred to as volatile fatty acids vfas is considered as a viable biowaste conversion method 7 8 14 25 30 vfas are important intermediates and metabolites in biological processes showing relatively high production yields at low greenhouse gas emission levels nevertheless the relative complexity and instability of their production from inhomogeneous substrates such as municipal biowaste requires further studies vfas as chemical building blocks show a wide range of applications areas including food pharmaceutical leather and textile industries 14 31 32 propionic and butyric acids and their salts are used as flavours and preservatives in food and pharmaceuticals valeric acid is used in the synthesis of its esters esters of valeric acid are used in cosmetics manufacturing ethyl valerate and pentyl valerate are used as food additives because of their fruity flavours 29 other fields of vfas application are livestock feed 33 as well as in wastewater treatment in the denitrification step of biological nutrient removal 34 35 vfas are currently produced from fossil fuels 36 37 which however could be replaced by a number of biowaste streams if the process parameters and control mechanisms are fully understood less homogenous biowaste streams such as food waste could also be used which provide an economically attractive stream for conversion separation of mixed vfas into individual fractions is another technological problem yet to be solved 38 in this context the medium chain vfas show an advantage over short chain vfas as the first ones can be more easily recovered by extraction and moreover they show higher energy content than the latter ones 39 thus elongation of vfas has been subject to recent studies 40 44 however mixtures of acids and alcohols can alternatively be used as substitute for fuel ethanol 29 or as substrates for microbial production of inter alia biopolymers polyhydroxyalkanoates and polyhydroxybutyrate and lipids for biodiesel 38 this paper provides an insight into vfa production from household biowaste through anaerobic digestion which can be combined with wastewater treatment process anaerobic digestion consists of four process steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 45 vfas are produced in the first three steps acidogenesis of food waste can also produce valuable products such as hydrogen which is a clean fuel 38 the generation of vfas may be enhanced by a improving the rate of biomass hydrolysis to produce more soluble substrates for acidification b enhancing the process of acidogenesis and c inhibiting the methanogenesis 8 25 27 however according to 8 14 46 also methanogenesis can result in additional vfa production a number of previous studies investigated the effects of varying process conditions on vfa production including ph 47 50 olr 12 15 51 retention time 52 53 temperature 54 55 and different type of substrates 56 50 different combinations of these parameters were studied investigations of ph and temperature on influence on vfa production from municipal solid waste revealed the highest efficiency of vfa production under alkali and mesophilic conditions 57 on the contrary fermentation of different wastes substrates as maize silage cheese whey microalgae biomass and glucose under ph 5 7 and 11 resulted in the highest vfa production under neutral ph 50 other study 52 showed the importance of incubation time on vfa production shorter incubation time 4 days instead of 10 days provided the highest vfa production by waste sludge fermentation the objectives of this research was to obtain i a high conversion rate of biowaste to vfas and ii high share of medium chain vfas in a relatively short time as well as iii to determine the influence of different ph conditions and olr on fermentation results during 3 days long process runs 2 materials and methods the vfas generation tests were conducted in a laboratory installation consisting of a stirred enclosed reactor with a volume of 20 l a gas storage tank of 20 l and a control unit the bioreactor was operated in batch mode with continuous ph and redox monitoring the duration of each individual vfas production test was 72 h starting with a single feeding 2 1 substrates for the experiments separately collected household biowaste was used the biowaste samples were obtained from a few households and mixed together the samples were composed of a mixture of fruits and vegetables residues of cooked meals cheese bread as well as some soft garden waste like grass leaves etc parameters of the biowaste samples can be found in section 3 1 table 2 where they are compared to literature data 2 2 substrates pre treatment and inoculation the samples of biowaste were crushed by a laboratory mill with a 5 mm mesh and consequently homogenized it was inoculated with wastewater from an anaerobic digestion plant treating the organic fraction of municipal waste the inoculum containing wastewater was separated from the digestate in a mechanical press followed by centrifugation and clarification in a settlement tank it was stored in a closed container at temp 3 c the same inoculum was used for all test to allow for comparable conditions the chemical composition of the inoculum is provided in table 1 test batches were prepared with total solids ts contents of 15 and 7 5 for the 15 ts batch 12 5 l of biowaste 20 ts was taken and mixed with 5 l of distilled water and 5 l of inoculum 10 1 ts for the 7 5 ts batch 5 l of biowaste was mixed with 10 l of distilled water and 5 l of inoculum thus the 7 5 and 15 ts refer to the mixture of input biowaste and inoculum the ph was adjusted by adding naoh 2 3 bioprocess setup and control substrates together with the inoculant were fed to the bioreactor to determine the ph influence three batches were tested with a ts content of 7 5 and the ph established at 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 every hour samples were collected and examined for vfas and ethanol content the influence of the olr was tested by an additional batch with a ts content of 15 and ph set at 6 0 the olr was 21 5 g l d and 43 0 g l d respectively for 7 5 and 15 ts the main parameters to be controlled included ph redox potential electrode jumo tecline rd hd rd type 201025 germany as well as the volume and composition of the outflow gas o2 co2 ch4 h2 and h2s gas meter fresenius biobasic bg germany the volume of the gas was measured by collecting the gas in an inverted container filled with water every hour the gas was released and its composition determined 2 4 analytics the c2 c5 vfas acetic propionic butyric and valeric acid and ethanol were analysed by gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid sampling was performed every hour for 72 h samples treatment included centrifugation for 10 min at a speed of 10 000 rpm and stabilization

the biogas potential during 21 days of inoculation gb21 was determined in eudiometers according the according to vdi 4630 standard total nitrogen was determined according to the kieldahl method following digestion in sulphuric acid h2so4 total phosphorous was examined by the spectroscopic method followed digestion in nitric and perchloric acids hno3 hclo4 2 5 data analyses two metrics proposed in the literature 42 were used to compare the results of the investigations with respect to the amounts and relative proportions of vfa products 1 total molar concentration total mm of alkyl groups expressing the sum of all methyl and methylene groups in vfa in mili moles mm total mm alkyl groups c2 2 c3 3 c4 4 c5 5 c6 where cx corresponds to mm concentration of vfa of the total carbon number x and 2 average vfa chain length total mm alkyl groups total mm vfa 1 where the 1 represents the non energetic carbon carboxyl group of the vfa molecule the results presented within this paper are limited to only one run per variant it was due to limited amount of homogenous substrate biowaste and inoculum used for the presented experiments both streams are highly inhomogeneous and thus to obtain reliable results it will be necessary to verify the outcome of this study in additional tests which are planned as a topic of following research 3 results and discussion 3 1 biowaste parameters the biowaste samples collected for the analysis consisted mostly of food waste with a smaller share of garden waste grass and small branches food waste is the prevailing constituent of municipal biowaste in densely populated areas the collected waste samples were composed of approx 43 fruit and vegetables residues mainly potato apples and citrus peels 15 bread residues 15 coffee brew and 17 garden waste the remaining 10 constituting cooked meals residues according to 4 the average stoichiometries of mechanically separated and source separated organic fraction of municipal waste are c22h44o28n and c20h36o16n respectively table 2 provides characteristics of the biowaste used in the presented research which was compared with literature data on food waste composition from different sources food waste is generally characterized by a high moisture content 76 90 volatile solids in the range of 87 99 ts including 20 45 of carbon and carbohydrates lipids and proteins contents of 33 59 14 18 and 5 10 19 25 respectively 4 the examined biowaste samples showed a water content of 80 ts of 20 and relative volatile solids of 86 6 ts its biodegradability is reflected by a relatively high biogas potential 0 629 m3 kg vs corresponding to a methane production potential of 0 384 m3 kg vs from the data provided in literature it can be concluded that the methane potential from food waste ranges from 0 260 to 0 529 m3 kg vs in the current study the biogas potential was determined according to gb21 standard which is based on 21 days of incubation without stirring while in the other studies it was based on biochemical methane potential bmp tests in which samples constantly mixed for a period of 30 60 days 60 nevertheless the results show a relatively high yield of methane in table 3 the levels of macronutrients as well as of potential contaminants in the analysed biowaste are provided and compared with optimal values for anaerobic digestion provided in literature the nutrients content was sufficient to support microbial growth with 0 58 2 9 ts of total nitrogen and 0 16 0 8 ts of total phosphorous however the c to n ratio with a value of 13 4 was lower than values reported for the other wastes typically a c n ratio of 25 30 is assumed as optimum to ensure a proper anaerobic digestion process lower c n ratio may result is excess nh3 release in which nitrogen is not available for microorganisms 59 heavy metal concentrations are a vital parameter in anaerobic digestion copper and zinc and soluble forms of magnesium potassium and calcium are essential for microbial growth 68 most biomass types are characterized by an optimal nutrient composition but microelements supplementation may be required on the other hand too high metals concentrations can be limiting the bacteria growth however kitchen waste usually provide sufficient quantities of macro and microelements for microbial growth this is confirmed by a high respiration index at4 value indicating the biodegradability of the volatiles under aerobic conditions 3 2 vfas production hydrolysis is the initial step of anaerobic digestion however in many cases it can determine the rate of the whole process with other controlling parameters being ph temperature c n ratio and hydraulic retention time hrt 26 many studies have been focused on improving vfas production from biowaste by anaerobic digestion under alkaline or neutral conditions 50 however this means that a relatively high amount of naoh must be used to generate such conditions especially at higher feeding rates which may cause higher process complexity and costs the main result of low ph during anaerobic fermentation is the inhibition of methanogenesis 27 because the methanogen activity starts at ph above 6 5 previous studies have shown that the optimal ph for effective hydrogenogenesis and inhibited methanogenesis was 5 0 6 5 8 27 in this study the effect of ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 on vfas production from municipal biowaste inoculated with anaerobic wastewater from a fermentation plant was investigated the total solids content of the batch containing biowaste and wastewater from anaerobic digestion plant was 7 5 and the olr was 21 5 g l d the samples were processed in an anaerobic stirred tank for 72 h previous studies have shown that due to high availability of the organic matter in biowaste the initial 72 h are crucial for the overall vfas production and the yield does not significantly increase after 3 days the results of the investigations in terms of ethanol and total vfas concentrations in g l and vfas weigh based composition after 24 h 48 h and 72 h after process begin are presented in table 4 the total molar concentrations mm l and total alkyl groups mm l as well as average acid chain lengths are also presented here the production of vfas after 72 h of process runtime amounted to 11 5 g l 13 5 g l and 20 5 g l for the batch with ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively this amounts to vfas final concentrations of 176 mm l 203 mm l and 237 mm l thus the highest vfas concentration was achieved for the batch set at ph 6 0 a graphical presentation of the investigation results is presented in fig 1 on the left hand side the total molar concentrations mm l and total alkyl groups mm l are presented as well as average acid chain lengths the highest concentration for the batch with ph 6 0 corresponds also with the highest average chain length 4 3 for ph 6 0 as compared to 2 4 and 2 5 for ph 5 0 and 5 5 the vfas which were determined with the gc analysis included acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids their weight based composition is presented in table 4 while in fig 1 their molar cumulative concentrations during the whole process run are depicted the average chain length is computed based on vfas concentrations taking into account individual chain lengths apart from vfas the concentrations of ethanol are given it can be seen that the shares of individual compounds show different patterns in all runs batches controlled at ph 5 0 and 5 5 show the highest shares of acetic followed by propionic acids also ethanol levels obtained in these two batches shows the highest values out all three cases at the later process stages propionic acid is formed and presents a significant share of the cumulative vfas the share of butyric acid is rather low in both cases this explains the relatively low average chain length results for the ph 6 0 batch differ significantly from the other batches the concentration of ethanol is much lower here in the initial phases the formation of acetic acid and relatively lower levels of propionic acid takes place this is followed by a conversion to butyric and valeric acids which became highly dominating substances in the second half of the process run reaching 40 5 and 53 0 respectively of the total weight of vfas at the end of the process run this is reflected by the longest average chain length for the vfas generated at ph 6 0 amounting to 4 1 and 4 3 respectively in the 48th and 72nd h of the process run thus based on the obtained results it can be concluded that a ph of 6 0 allowed to achieve the highest efficiency both in terms of vfas total concentration as well as their chain length this ph phase has proven optimal for vfas chain elongation to examine the effect of increasing the olr on the vfas production another batch was run with a twice higher ts content 15 0 ts corresponding to 13 0 vs and olr of 43 0 g l d the ph for this experiment was maintained at 6 0 which was determined to be optimal results of this process run are summarized in table 5 the total vfas production was highest in this run reaching 37 3 g l after 72 h corresponding to 224 0 mm l the average vfa chain 3 8 was however slightly lower than in case of the run with 7 5 ts 4 3 the production patterns determined in this case are presented in fig 2 it can be observed that similarly to the run with 7 5 ts and ph 6 0 after initial formation of acetic and propionic acids these were replaced by butyric and valeric acids a graphical presentation of the results of the production of vfas with an increased ts content is presented in fig 2 the results of the overall process efficiency in terms of vfas quantity related to the input of total solids ts and volatile solids vs are presented in table 6 although the concentrations of the vfas are highest at a vs content of 13 0 37 3 g l see table 5 the yield of vfas production reaches the highest value for vs content of 6 5 at ph 6 0 amounting 0 310 g vfas g vsfed as compared to 0 287 g vfas g vsfed in case of a vs content of 13 thus enhancing the vs content does not improve the yield related to the input mass the gaseous emissions under varying operating conditions are depicted in fig 3 during the test runs the production of h2 co2 ch4 and h2s was determined in all batches the highest overall production of co2 was obtained followed by h2 ch4 production was very low probably due to unfavourable ph conditions also h2s generation was insignificant thus not presented in the graphs hydrogen is a product with potential application for as a fuel or basic chemical the share of hydrogen increased with the growing ph from 31 5 for ph 5 0 33 9 for ph 5 5 and 36 3 for ph 6 0 the cumulative hydrogen yield after 72 h of experiments run amounted to 22 3 28 7 and 32 2 l kg ts at 7 5 ts and ph of 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively a slightly higher h2 yield was achieved at 15 0 ts and ph 6 0 amounting to 33 5 l kg ts the higher amounts of h2 are produced in the initial process stages the later decrease of h2 may be related to its consumption in the propionic acid production process which can be described by eq 1 in propionibacterium or corynebacterium 71 1 glucose 2 h2 2 propionate 2 h 2 h2o δg r 170 kj mol at a higher ph the higher h2 generation in the later phase of the process may be related with its release during butyric acid generation in glucose fermentation the stoichiometric fermentation of glucose by c butyricum eq 2 and c tyrobutyricum eq 3 proceeds according to the equations provided 72 2 glucose 0 8 butyrate 0 4 acetate 2 4 h2 2 co2 3 glucose 0 85 butyrate 0 1 acetate 0 2 lactate 1 9 h2 1 8 co2 the results which were obtained in the presented investigations can be compared with other studies table 7 the influence of ph on vfas production from food waste was investigated in previous studies 73 74 out of four options which were tested in 73 production yields were highest for ph 6 0 followed by ph 7 ph 5 and uncontrolled conditions the vfas yield at ph 6 0 was 0 316 g g vsfed which is more than twice higher than at ph 5 0 and almost 3 times higher than under uncontrolled conditions the highest yield of vfas production observed in the cited literature was only slightly higher than the value obtained in the current study the other cited research 74 also proved the highest vfas production yields at ph 6 0 which is in accordance with the findings that hydrolytic enzymes activities are optimum at ph 6 0 and hence it leads to the highest concentrations of vfas 75 ph control is one of the crucial parameters of vfas production which is proven by very low production under uncontrolled ph conditions 76 apart from the vfas yield the results obtained in this study showed that ph control plays a very important role for the vfas composition the results revealed that the production of vfas under different ph results in different dominating acids acetic acid was peaked at ph 5 0 63 2 while the mixture of acetic acid and propionic acids were dominating at ph 5 5 57 2 and 29 7 respectively finally at ph 6 0 the dominating acids were butyric acid and valeric acid 40 5 and 53 0 respectively this was partly confirmed by previous research 36 in which acetic acid was dominating at acidic conditions and a mixture of butyric and propionic acids dominating at neutral conditions however in that study no valeric acid was produced other researchers found the highest share of butyric acid at ph 6 0 53 3 accompanied by significantly lower portion of valeric acid 9 5 73 yet other results have shown butyric acid as a dominant compound only at ph 8 10 76 the high share of the valeric acid obtained in this the current study under ph 6 0 is an interesting result not reported by other studies valeric acid has been formed also in a bioprocess based on chicken litter in a pilot biorefinery 77 a higher share of valeric acid is beneficial as it has a higher energy content and it is easier to be extracted from the vfas broth a number of recent studies focussed on vfas chain elongation allowing to understand some of the underling mechanisms 41 44 78 79 the process in which short chain vfas such as acetate are elongated by reaction with ethanol is referred to as reversed β oxidation and the microbes which were capable of this reaction include clostridium kluyveri and eubacterium pyruvativorans 80 in the literature it has been suggested that microorganisms can use vfa as an electron acceptor and hydrogen or ethanol as an electron donor to generate medium chain fatty acids such as valerate 43 32 the related reactions are described in eqs 4 and 5 43 4 propionate ethanol n valerate h2o δg r 39 kj mol 5 propionate acetate h 2h2 n valerate 2h2o δg r 48 kj mol thus in the current study chain elongation to butyric and valeric acids resulted probably from the reactions of acetic and propionic acids with hydrogen and ethanol which were generated in the process this is confirmed by low concentration of ethanol in the batch of ph 6 0 as compared to the samples at lower ph as well as decreasing emissions of h2 from the reactor due to its internal consumption 4 practical applications of this work the results presented in this paper provide a good base for further development of a biorefinery concept based on an easily available biowaste stream such as the municipal biowaste the recent changes in waste management law implementing the circular economy concept oblige the separate collection of the whole municipal biowaste stream including kitchen waste this provides an additional volume of biowaste for treatment most of it will be treated in dedicated biowaste composting and anaerobic digestion plants on the other hand due to water use savings the municipal wastewater treatment plants often have some free capacities which could be utilized this concerns also the sludge digestion chambers which could be utilized for the co treatment of excess sewage sludge with biowaste traditionally the digestion process is aimed at methane production however other higher value bioproducts like vfas and hydrogen could be considered as an alternative and economically more attractive option currently the production of vfas from biodegradable resources suffers from serious deficits hindering its industrial application apart from the overall process efficiency which still needs to be improved the other problem is recovery of the final product in order to utilize individual vfas as chemical building blocks a high product purity is required techniques applied for downstream processing constitute approximately half of the total production costs 81 lowering the overall economic viability of the process therefore further development of vfas extraction technologies is of high importance one of the approaches which was demonstrated feasible by this research is to divert the production towards higher chain vfas which can be easier extracted from the fermentation broth also from an industrial perspective it is an important finding that maintaining a pure culture fermentation is not required and vfas can be produced via mixed culture fermentation eliminating the need for maintaining sterile operating conditions in a full scale plant 5 conclusions and perspectives the current european agenda focussed on developing a circular bioeconomy opens path to new innovative and environmentally viable technologies many sources of biomass could be used as substrates for biorefineries however in order to make the technology economically attractive in comparison to conventional production abundant and low cost substrates are needed such a substrate could be municipal biowaste including food waste from households which separate collection in many member states is under development in this paper the feasibility of producing vfas from municipal biowaste was investigated on a laboratory scale the biowaste selected for the study encompassed food waste and garden waste from individual households the substrate was differed from previous studies which considered rather food waste from the hospitality sector restaurants canteens biowaste composition analyses confirmed its suitability for bioconversion the aim of the study was to verify vfas production yields from the considered biowaste at various slightly acidic ph levels ph 5 0 ph 5 5 and ph 6 0 and at two olrs the biowaste was inoculated with wastewater from an anaerobic digestion plant for municipal biowaste the vfas yields were determined with respect to acetic butyric propionic and valeric acids as well as ethanol for 72 h after process begin the vfas generation of at the end of the experiment ranged from 0 177 to 0 310 g vfas g ts the highest productivity was obtained at ph 6 0 and 7 5 ts corresponding to olr of 21 5 g l d in the batch controlled at ph 6 0 a high share of valeric acid 53 0 being the first medium chain acid c5 was achieved accompanied by similarly high share of butyric acid 40 5 the obtained results are conformed by literature findings for food waste however in the current study higher share of valeric acid in the vfas mixture at ph 6 0 was achieved which is an asset in conclusion the presented results are very promising and open possibilities for further investigations among many aspects of vfas biorefinery

13814,substituting the conventional crude oil based products such as volatile fatty acids vfas derived from oil refineries by adequate substances produced in biowaste refineries triggers a lot of attention there is also interest in combining wastewater treatment and biowaste treatment and focus it on bio products production other than the currently established methane fermentation this paper summarizes investigations of vfas generation from separately collected municipal biowaste inoculated with anaerobic digestion plant wastewater in a batch laboratory bioreactor with 20 l volume under varying conditions the production of vfas within 72 h from batch with 7 5 ts and olr of 21 5 g l d amounted to 11 5 g l 13 5 g l and 20 5 g l for ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively the highest yield of vfas production 0 310 g vfas g vsfed was determined for ph 6 0 and olr of 21 5 g l d moreover at ph 6 0 the dominating products were higher chain acids in form of valeric and butyric acids constituting 53 and 41 of the total mass of vfas produced which distinguishes this study from existing literature keywords volatile fatty acids vfa biorefinery wastewater municipal biowaste 1 introduction currently there is a tendency for producing components and additives for food and chemical industries from various side streams 1 biowaste among many organic substrates if properly handled becomes a promising stream for the bioeconomy biowaste according to the definition provided by the eu council directive 2008 98 ec means every biodegradable waste in the form of food from households canteens enterprises etc and green waste from parks gardens etc one of the largest biowaste streams is food waste which in the eu represents more than 180 million tonnes per year 2 after leaving the field the majority of food waste is generated in the consumption chain including households and the hospitality sector restaurants hotels etc with the former ones contributing up to 70 of the whole volume of food waste 3 food waste can be classified in four groups including 1 fruit and vegetables 2 starchy foodstuff 3 meat fish and by products and 4 others e g dairy products sweets or non edible products i e bones shell skin etc 4 recent literature studies on the potential of food waste for anaerobic digestion and biorefinery processes focus mainly on residues originating from restaurants and catering services 5 8 food waste from households has been up till now only partly available as a separate stream as in many countries it is still contained within residual municipal waste the organic fraction of residual waste contributes to environmental problems becoming a potential contaminant of water and land as well as a source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover its value as a potential substrate for the bioeconomy is lost initially separate collection focused on biowaste from municipal green areas and individual gardens as it is easier to handle than food waste however implementation of the circular economy package into the european legislation imposes inter alia a eu wide obligation to separately collect all biowaste from households not later than by the year 2023 directive 2008 98 ec as amended in 2018 moreover article 11 of the aforementioned directive and article 5 of the landfill directive 1999 31 ec represent an eu wide commitment to reduce landfills usage to 10 of all municipal waste while increasing recycling routes to 65 by 2030 this is aimed inter alia to stimulate the development of new technologies for recycling of biowaste according to the european compost network 9 a total of 47 5 mio tonnes of biowaste is treated every year in the eu this amounts to 117 kg biowaste per capita corresponding to 23 of total municipal solid waste per year currently countries with most advanced biowaste collection systems like the netherlands and germany achieve a yearly collection quota of 223 and 171 kg capita respectively based on these numbers it is justified to assume that in the future an average european wide yearly biowaste collection rate of 150 kg inhabitant can be expected this would result in app 78 mio tonnes of biowaste for eu 28 which means an additional stream of approx 30 mio tonnes of mainly food waste as garden biowaste collection is already established to be available for biological conversion the food waste from households can be collected either together with garden waste or as a separate stream in the latter case the food waste is then treated in an anaerobic digestion process while the garden biowaste is treated in a composting process food waste from the hospitality sector hotels restaurants canteens etc can be collected together with household food waste by household waste collection services 10 currently in eu 28 there are 4274 plants for the treatment of biowaste of which 3403 are composting plants 738 anaerobic digestion plants and the remaining ones combine both technologies 9 composting is an attractive low cost and proven technology to restore organic matter and nutrients contained especially in the garden biowaste back to soils in the form of compost it can also directly benefit households as it can be practiced domestically by citizens 11 food waste especially if collected as a separate stream has a very high content of moisture and easily biodegradable organic matter and thus is an ideal substrate for anaerobic digestion 12 14 conventional anaerobic digestion is aimed at maximising the methane production it ranks higher than composting in the waste management hierarchy as it enables both to restore the fertilising value of biowaste and to recover energy 15 16 however more advanced technologies aim at converting the waste into useful products not only organic fertilizers but also into other bio products and or energy biofuels thus correctly managed biowaste not only ceases to constitute and environmental problem but also opens a market to sustainable new technologies the circular economy is defined by the european commission 17 as minimizing the generation of waste and maintaining the value of products materials and resources for as long as possible conversion of biomass especial residues into bio products or biofuel is a sustainable method that is a part of the biological cycle of the circular bioeconomy 18 according to the biorefinery concept the value of individual substrates should be maximized similar to the crude oil refining processes which may be a key factor of their economic advantage over the traditional production 19 methodologies which convert waste into biobased products require a wide spectrum of processes and technologies including acidogenesis bioelectrogenesis photosynthesis photofermentation etc 4 20 23 in order to design novel products it is possible to combine various side streams into new raw materials 23 according to nova institute research 24 conducted in 2017 in europe 224 biorefineries were operating including 63 sugar starch based biorefineries producing bioethanol and other chemicals 64 oil fat based biorefineries producing biodiesel 54 oil fat based biorefineries producing feedstock for oleochemistry 25 wood based biorefineries excluding those that produce pulp for paper only 5 lignocellulose based biorefineries other than wood and 13 biowaste based biorefineries among many biorefinery processes anaerobic fermentation for low molecular mass carboxylic acids c2 c7 production commonly referred to as volatile fatty acids vfas is considered as a viable biowaste conversion method 7 8 14 25 30 vfas are important intermediates and metabolites in biological processes showing relatively high production yields at low greenhouse gas emission levels nevertheless the relative complexity and instability of their production from inhomogeneous substrates such as municipal biowaste requires further studies vfas as chemical building blocks show a wide range of applications areas including food pharmaceutical leather and textile industries 14 31 32 propionic and butyric acids and their salts are used as flavours and preservatives in food and pharmaceuticals valeric acid is used in the synthesis of its esters esters of valeric acid are used in cosmetics manufacturing ethyl valerate and pentyl valerate are used as food additives because of their fruity flavours 29 other fields of vfas application are livestock feed 33 as well as in wastewater treatment in the denitrification step of biological nutrient removal 34 35 vfas are currently produced from fossil fuels 36 37 which however could be replaced by a number of biowaste streams if the process parameters and control mechanisms are fully understood less homogenous biowaste streams such as food waste could also be used which provide an economically attractive stream for conversion separation of mixed vfas into individual fractions is another technological problem yet to be solved 38 in this context the medium chain vfas show an advantage over short chain vfas as the first ones can be more easily recovered by extraction and moreover they show higher energy content than the latter ones 39 thus elongation of vfas has been subject to recent studies 40 44 however mixtures of acids and alcohols can alternatively be used as substitute for fuel ethanol 29 or as substrates for microbial production of inter alia biopolymers polyhydroxyalkanoates and polyhydroxybutyrate and lipids for biodiesel 38 this paper provides an insight into vfa production from household biowaste through anaerobic digestion which can be combined with wastewater treatment process anaerobic digestion consists of four process steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 45 vfas are produced in the first three steps acidogenesis of food waste can also produce valuable products such as hydrogen which is a clean fuel 38 the generation of vfas may be enhanced by a improving the rate of biomass hydrolysis to produce more soluble substrates for acidification b enhancing the process of acidogenesis and c inhibiting the methanogenesis 8 25 27 however according to 8 14 46 also methanogenesis can result in additional vfa production a number of previous studies investigated the effects of varying process conditions on vfa production including ph 47 50 olr 12 15 51 retention time 52 53 temperature 54 55 and different type of substrates 56 50 different combinations of these parameters were studied investigations of ph and temperature on influence on vfa production from municipal solid waste revealed the highest efficiency of vfa production under alkali and mesophilic conditions 57 on the contrary fermentation of different wastes substrates as maize silage cheese whey microalgae biomass and glucose under ph 5 7 and 11 resulted in the highest vfa production under neutral ph 50 other study 52 showed the importance of incubation time on vfa production shorter incubation time 4 days instead of 10 days provided the highest vfa production by waste sludge fermentation the objectives of this research was to obtain i a high conversion rate of biowaste to vfas and ii high share of medium chain vfas in a relatively short time as well as iii to determine the influence of different ph conditions and olr on fermentation results during 3 days long process runs 2 materials and methods the vfas generation tests were conducted in a laboratory installation consisting of a stirred enclosed reactor with a volume of 20 l a gas storage tank of 20 l and a control unit the bioreactor was operated in batch mode with continuous ph and redox monitoring the duration of each individual vfas production test was 72 h starting with a single feeding 2 1 substrates for the experiments separately collected household biowaste was used the biowaste samples were obtained from a few households and mixed together the samples were composed of a mixture of fruits and vegetables residues of cooked meals cheese bread as well as some soft garden waste like grass leaves etc parameters of the biowaste samples can be found in section 3 1 table 2 where they are compared to literature data 2 2 substrates pre treatment and inoculation the samples of biowaste were crushed by a laboratory mill with a 5 mm mesh and consequently homogenized it was inoculated with wastewater from an anaerobic digestion plant treating the organic fraction of municipal waste the inoculum containing wastewater was separated from the digestate in a mechanical press followed by centrifugation and clarification in a settlement tank it was stored in a closed container at temp 3 c the same inoculum was used for all test to allow for comparable conditions the chemical composition of the inoculum is provided in table 1 test batches were prepared with total solids ts contents of 15 and 7 5 for the 15 ts batch 12 5 l of biowaste 20 ts was taken and mixed with 5 l of distilled water and 5 l of inoculum 10 1 ts for the 7 5 ts batch 5 l of biowaste was mixed with 10 l of distilled water and 5 l of inoculum thus the 7 5 and 15 ts refer to the mixture of input biowaste and inoculum the ph was adjusted by adding naoh 2 3 bioprocess setup and control substrates together with the inoculant were fed to the bioreactor to determine the ph influence three batches were tested with a ts content of 7 5 and the ph established at 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 every hour samples were collected and examined for vfas and ethanol content the influence of the olr was tested by an additional batch with a ts content of 15 and ph set at 6 0 the olr was 21 5 g l d and 43 0 g l d respectively for 7 5 and 15 ts the main parameters to be controlled included ph redox potential electrode jumo tecline rd hd rd type 201025 germany as well as the volume and composition of the outflow gas o2 co2 ch4 h2 and h2s gas meter fresenius biobasic bg germany the volume of the gas was measured by collecting the gas in an inverted container filled with water every hour the gas was released and its composition determined 2 4 analytics the c2 c5 vfas acetic propionic butyric and valeric acid and ethanol were analysed by gas chromatography gc with a flame ionization detector fid sampling was performed every hour for 72 h samples treatment included centrifugation for 10 min at a speed of 10 000 rpm and stabilization

flame respiration activity at4 was measured by an oxitop apparatus oxitop c with the controller oc 110 wtw germany in 40 g samples accuracy 0 1 g according to the method described in binner et al 58 the biogas potential during 21 days of inoculation gb21 was determined in eudiometers according the according to vdi 4630 standard total nitrogen was determined according to the kieldahl method following digestion in sulphuric acid h2so4 total phosphorous was examined by the spectroscopic method followed digestion in nitric and perchloric acids hno3 hclo4 2 5 data analyses two metrics proposed in the literature 42 were used to compare the results of the investigations with respect to the amounts and relative proportions of vfa products 1 total molar concentration total mm of alkyl groups expressing the sum of all methyl and methylene groups in vfa in mili moles mm total mm alkyl groups c2 2 c3 3 c4 4 c5 5 c6 where cx corresponds to mm concentration of vfa of the total carbon number x and 2 average vfa chain length total mm alkyl groups total mm vfa 1 where the 1 represents the non energetic carbon carboxyl group of the vfa molecule the results presented within this paper are limited to only one run per variant it was due to limited amount of homogenous substrate biowaste and inoculum used for the presented experiments both streams are highly inhomogeneous and thus to obtain reliable results it will be necessary to verify the outcome of this study in additional tests which are planned as a topic of following research 3 results and discussion 3 1 biowaste parameters the biowaste samples collected for the analysis consisted mostly of food waste with a smaller share of garden waste grass and small branches food waste is the prevailing constituent of municipal biowaste in densely populated areas the collected waste samples were composed of approx 43 fruit and vegetables residues mainly potato apples and citrus peels 15 bread residues 15 coffee brew and 17 garden waste the remaining 10 constituting cooked meals residues according to 4 the average stoichiometries of mechanically separated and source separated organic fraction of municipal waste are c22h44o28n and c20h36o16n respectively table 2 provides characteristics of the biowaste used in the presented research which was compared with literature data on food waste composition from different sources food waste is generally characterized by a high moisture content 76 90 volatile solids in the range of 87 99 ts including 20 45 of carbon and carbohydrates lipids and proteins contents of 33 59 14 18 and 5 10 19 25 respectively 4 the examined biowaste samples showed a water content of 80 ts of 20 and relative volatile solids of 86 6 ts its biodegradability is reflected by a relatively high biogas potential 0 629 m3 kg vs corresponding to a methane production potential of 0 384 m3 kg vs from the data provided in literature it can be concluded that the methane potential from food waste ranges from 0 260 to 0 529 m3 kg vs in the current study the biogas potential was determined according to gb21 standard which is based on 21 days of incubation without stirring while in the other studies it was based on biochemical methane potential bmp tests in which samples constantly mixed for a period of 30 60 days 60 nevertheless the results show a relatively high yield of methane in table 3 the levels of macronutrients as well as of potential contaminants in the analysed biowaste are provided and compared with optimal values for anaerobic digestion provided in literature the nutrients content was sufficient to support microbial growth with 0 58 2 9 ts of total nitrogen and 0 16 0 8 ts of total phosphorous however the c to n ratio with a value of 13 4 was lower than values reported for the other wastes typically a c n ratio of 25 30 is assumed as optimum to ensure a proper anaerobic digestion process lower c n ratio may result is excess nh3 release in which nitrogen is not available for microorganisms 59 heavy metal concentrations are a vital parameter in anaerobic digestion copper and zinc and soluble forms of magnesium potassium and calcium are essential for microbial growth 68 most biomass types are characterized by an optimal nutrient composition but microelements supplementation may be required on the other hand too high metals concentrations can be limiting the bacteria growth however kitchen waste usually provide sufficient quantities of macro and microelements for microbial growth this is confirmed by a high respiration index at4 value indicating the biodegradability of the volatiles under aerobic conditions 3 2 vfas production hydrolysis is the initial step of anaerobic digestion however in many cases it can determine the rate of the whole process with other controlling parameters being ph temperature c n ratio and hydraulic retention time hrt 26 many studies have been focused on improving vfas production from biowaste by anaerobic digestion under alkaline or neutral conditions 50 however this means that a relatively high amount of naoh must be used to generate such conditions especially at higher feeding rates which may cause higher process complexity and costs the main result of low ph during anaerobic fermentation is the inhibition of methanogenesis 27 because the methanogen activity starts at ph above 6 5 previous studies have shown that the optimal ph for effective hydrogenogenesis and inhibited methanogenesis was 5 0 6 5 8 27 in this study the effect of ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 on vfas production from municipal biowaste inoculated with anaerobic wastewater from a fermentation plant was investigated the total solids content of the batch containing biowaste and wastewater from anaerobic digestion plant was 7 5 and the olr was 21 5 g l d the samples were processed in an anaerobic stirred tank for 72 h previous studies have shown that due to high availability of the organic matter in biowaste the initial 72 h are crucial for the overall vfas production and the yield does not significantly increase after 3 days the results of the investigations in terms of ethanol and total vfas concentrations in g l and vfas weigh based composition after 24 h 48 h and 72 h after process begin are presented in table 4 the total molar concentrations mm l and total alkyl groups mm l as well as average acid chain lengths are also presented here the production of vfas after 72 h of process runtime amounted to 11 5 g l 13 5 g l and 20 5 g l for the batch with ph 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively this amounts to vfas final concentrations of 176 mm l 203 mm l and 237 mm l thus the highest vfas concentration was achieved for the batch set at ph 6 0 a graphical presentation of the investigation results is presented in fig 1 on the left hand side the total molar concentrations mm l and total alkyl groups mm l are presented as well as average acid chain lengths the highest concentration for the batch with ph 6 0 corresponds also with the highest average chain length 4 3 for ph 6 0 as compared to 2 4 and 2 5 for ph 5 0 and 5 5 the vfas which were determined with the gc analysis included acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids their weight based composition is presented in table 4 while in fig 1 their molar cumulative concentrations during the whole process run are depicted the average chain length is computed based on vfas concentrations taking into account individual chain lengths apart from vfas the concentrations of ethanol are given it can be seen that the shares of individual compounds show different patterns in all runs batches controlled at ph 5 0 and 5 5 show the highest shares of acetic followed by propionic acids also ethanol levels obtained in these two batches shows the highest values out all three cases at the later process stages propionic acid is formed and presents a significant share of the cumulative vfas the share of butyric acid is rather low in both cases this explains the relatively low average chain length results for the ph 6 0 batch differ significantly from the other batches the concentration of ethanol is much lower here in the initial phases the formation of acetic acid and relatively lower levels of propionic acid takes place this is followed by a conversion to butyric and valeric acids which became highly dominating substances in the second half of the process run reaching 40 5 and 53 0 respectively of the total weight of vfas at the end of the process run this is reflected by the longest average chain length for the vfas generated at ph 6 0 amounting to 4 1 and 4 3 respectively in the 48th and 72nd h of the process run thus based on the obtained results it can be concluded that a ph of 6 0 allowed to achieve the highest efficiency both in terms of vfas total concentration as well as their chain length this ph phase has proven optimal for vfas chain elongation to examine the effect of increasing the olr on the vfas production another batch was run with a twice higher ts content 15 0 ts corresponding to 13 0 vs and olr of 43 0 g l d the ph for this experiment was maintained at 6 0 which was determined to be optimal results of this process run are summarized in table 5 the total vfas production was highest in this run reaching 37 3 g l after 72 h corresponding to 224 0 mm l the average vfa chain 3 8 was however slightly lower than in case of the run with 7 5 ts 4 3 the production patterns determined in this case are presented in fig 2 it can be observed that similarly to the run with 7 5 ts and ph 6 0 after initial formation of acetic and propionic acids these were replaced by butyric and valeric acids a graphical presentation of the results of the production of vfas with an increased ts content is presented in fig 2 the results of the overall process efficiency in terms of vfas quantity related to the input of total solids ts and volatile solids vs are presented in table 6 although the concentrations of the vfas are highest at a vs content of 13 0 37 3 g l see table 5 the yield of vfas production reaches the highest value for vs content of 6 5 at ph 6 0 amounting 0 310 g vfas g vsfed as compared to 0 287 g vfas g vsfed in case of a vs content of 13 thus enhancing the vs content does not improve the yield related to the input mass the gaseous emissions under varying operating conditions are depicted in fig 3 during the test runs the production of h2 co2 ch4 and h2s was determined in all batches the highest overall production of co2 was obtained followed by h2 ch4 production was very low probably due to unfavourable ph conditions also h2s generation was insignificant thus not presented in the graphs hydrogen is a product with potential application for as a fuel or basic chemical the share of hydrogen increased with the growing ph from 31 5 for ph 5 0 33 9 for ph 5 5 and 36 3 for ph 6 0 the cumulative hydrogen yield after 72 h of experiments run amounted to 22 3 28 7 and 32 2 l kg ts at 7 5 ts and ph of 5 0 5 5 and 6 0 respectively a slightly higher h2 yield was achieved at 15 0 ts and ph 6 0 amounting to 33 5 l kg ts the higher amounts of h2 are produced in the initial process stages the later decrease of h2 may be related to its consumption in the propionic acid production process which can be described by eq 1 in propionibacterium or corynebacterium 71 1 glucose 2 h2 2 propionate 2 h 2 h2o δg r 170 kj mol at a higher ph the higher h2 generation in the later phase of the process may be related with its release during butyric acid generation in glucose fermentation the stoichiometric fermentation of glucose by c butyricum eq 2 and c tyrobutyricum eq 3 proceeds according to the equations provided 72 2 glucose 0 8 butyrate 0 4 acetate 2 4 h2 2 co2 3 glucose 0 85 butyrate 0 1 acetate 0 2 lactate 1 9 h2 1 8 co2 the results which were obtained in the presented investigations can be compared with other studies table 7 the influence of ph on vfas production from food waste was investigated in previous studies 73 74 out of four options which were tested in 73 production yields were highest for ph 6 0 followed by ph 7 ph 5 and uncontrolled conditions the vfas yield at ph 6 0 was 0 316 g g vsfed which is more than twice higher than at ph 5 0 and almost 3 times higher than under uncontrolled conditions the highest yield of vfas production observed in the cited literature was only slightly higher than the value obtained in the current study the other cited research 74 also proved the highest vfas production yields at ph 6 0 which is in accordance with the findings that hydrolytic enzymes activities are optimum at ph 6 0 and hence it leads to the highest concentrations of vfas 75 ph control is one of the crucial parameters of vfas production which is proven by very low production under uncontrolled ph conditions 76 apart from the vfas yield the results obtained in this study showed that ph control plays a very important role for the vfas composition the results revealed that the production of vfas under different ph results in different dominating acids acetic acid was peaked at ph 5 0 63 2 while the mixture of acetic acid and propionic acids were dominating at ph 5 5 57 2 and 29 7 respectively finally at ph 6 0 the dominating acids were butyric acid and valeric acid 40 5 and 53 0 respectively this was partly confirmed by previous research 36 in which acetic acid was dominating at acidic conditions and a mixture of butyric and propionic acids dominating at neutral conditions however in that study no valeric acid was produced other researchers found the highest share of butyric acid at ph 6 0 53 3 accompanied by significantly lower portion of valeric acid 9 5 73 yet other results have shown butyric acid as a dominant compound only at ph 8 10 76 the high share of the valeric acid obtained in this the current study under ph 6 0 is an interesting result not reported by other studies valeric acid has been formed also in a bioprocess based on chicken litter in a pilot biorefinery 77 a higher share of valeric acid is beneficial as it has a higher energy content and it is easier to be extracted from the vfas broth a number of recent studies focussed on vfas chain elongation allowing to understand some of the underling mechanisms 41 44 78 79 the process in which short chain vfas such as acetate are elongated by reaction with ethanol is referred to as reversed β oxidation and the microbes which were capable of this reaction include clostridium kluyveri and eubacterium pyruvativorans 80 in the literature it has been suggested that microorganisms can use vfa as an electron acceptor and hydrogen or ethanol as an electron donor to generate medium chain fatty acids such as valerate 43 32 the related reactions are described in eqs 4 and 5 43 4 propionate ethanol n valerate h2o δg r 39 kj mol 5 propionate acetate h 2h2 n valerate 2h2o δg r 48 kj mol thus in the current study chain elongation to butyric and valeric acids resulted probably from the reactions of acetic and propionic acids with hydrogen and ethanol which were generated in the process this is confirmed by low concentration of ethanol in the batch of ph 6 0 as compared to the samples at lower ph as well as decreasing emissions of h2 from the reactor due to its internal consumption 4 practical applications of this work the results presented in this paper provide a good base for further development of a biorefinery concept based on an easily available biowaste stream such as the municipal biowaste the recent changes in waste management law implementing the circular economy concept oblige the separate collection of the whole municipal biowaste stream including kitchen waste this provides an additional volume of biowaste for treatment most of it will be treated in dedicated biowaste composting and anaerobic digestion plants on the other hand due to water use savings the municipal wastewater treatment plants often have some free capacities which could be utilized this concerns also the sludge digestion chambers which could be utilized for the co treatment of excess sewage sludge with biowaste traditionally the digestion process is aimed at methane production however other higher value bioproducts like vfas and hydrogen could be considered as an alternative and economically more attractive option currently the production of vfas from biodegradable resources suffers from serious deficits hindering its industrial application apart from the overall process efficiency which still needs to be improved the other problem is recovery of the final product in order to utilize individual vfas as chemical building blocks a high product purity is required techniques applied for downstream processing constitute approximately half of the total production costs 81 lowering the overall economic viability of the process therefore further development of vfas extraction technologies is of high importance one of the approaches which was demonstrated feasible by this research is to divert the production towards higher chain vfas which can be easier extracted from the fermentation broth also from an industrial perspective it is an important finding that maintaining a pure culture fermentation is not required and vfas can be produced via mixed culture fermentation eliminating the need for maintaining sterile operating conditions in a full scale plant 5 conclusions and perspectives the current european agenda focussed on developing a circular bioeconomy opens path to new innovative and environmentally viable technologies many sources of biomass could be used as substrates for biorefineries however in order to make the technology economically attractive in comparison to conventional production abundant and low cost substrates are needed such a substrate could be municipal biowaste including food waste from households which separate collection in many member states is under development in this paper the feasibility of producing vfas from municipal biowaste was investigated on a laboratory scale the biowaste selected for the study encompassed food waste and garden waste from individual households the substrate was differed from previous studies which considered rather food waste from the hospitality sector restaurants canteens biowaste composition analyses confirmed its suitability for bioconversion the aim of the study was to verify vfas production yields from the considered biowaste at various slightly acidic ph levels ph 5 0 ph 5 5 and ph 6 0 and at two olrs the biowaste was inoculated with wastewater from an anaerobic digestion plant for municipal biowaste the vfas yields were determined with respect to acetic butyric propionic and valeric acids as well as ethanol for 72 h after process begin the vfas generation of at the end of the experiment ranged from 0 177 to 0 310 g vfas g ts the highest productivity was obtained at ph 6 0 and 7 5 ts corresponding to olr of 21 5 g l d in the batch controlled at ph 6 0 a high share of valeric acid 53 0 being the first medium chain acid c5 was achieved accompanied by similarly high share of butyric acid 40 5 the obtained results are conformed by literature findings for food waste however in the current study higher share of valeric acid in the vfas mixture at ph 6 0 was achieved which is an asset in conclusion the presented results are very promising and open possibilities for further investigations among many aspects of vfas biorefinery configuration it is crucial to investigate the influence of process temperature hydraulic retention time as well as optimum feeding modes the potential for the residue utilization should be also
