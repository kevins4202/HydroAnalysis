2600,structure identifiability of hydrological processes refers to the ability to select appropriate mathematical representation from multiple structural options although the influence of hydrological processes on model behavior varies in time this temporal relative influence has not been used to identify process structures in this work a framework is proposed to investigate the impacts of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on structure identification the framework consists of four elements 1 a blended model where hydrological process options and parameter values are regarded as integer and continuous decision variables respectively is built based on the flexible modeling framework raven 2 the temporal sensitivities of each process are derived by using sobol sensitivity analysis on a moving window 3 performance metrics with and without sensitivity weights which are derived from the temporal sensitivities are used to identify process structures respectively and 4 models identified by these two methods are compared to evaluate performance a synthetic experiment is designed to validate the proposed framework three case studies are carried out in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins in china results are summarized as follows 1 sensitivity weighted performance metrics improve the identifiability of process structures by considering the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior 2 quickflow and soil evaporation processes are the two most identifiable processes followed by infiltration baseflow and snow balance processes and 3 the model identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics is more efficient than that selected by the performance metric without sensitivity weights it is recommended that the temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes be used to identify model structures based on flexible modeling frameworks keywords flexible modeling framework blended model hydrological processes temporal sensitivity identifiability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models are effective methods to describe rainfall runoff relationships and realize accurate streamflow predictions pan et al 2019 zhang and liu 2021 establishing a hydrological model involves abstraction and simplification of multiple hydrological processes which refer to physical phenomena occurring in the catchment gharari et al 2021 guse et al 2017 konapala et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2016 singh and frevert 2006 structures of hydrological processes may vary between models since model developers have a distinctive understanding of the world or models are developed in regions with different hydrological characteristics clark et al 2008 prieto et al 2021 wrede et al 2015 with numerous hydrological models composed of diverse structures reducing model structural uncertainty is important for accurate streamflow predictions addor and melsen 2019 biondi et al 2012 euser et al 2013 kirchner 2006 knoben et al 2020 marshall et al 2005 recently many studies have been carried out on model selection to find scientifically meaningful and operationally reliable models fenicia et al 2011 typical model selection methods compare the model s ability to reproduce observed streamflow based on quantitative performance criteria or assessment frameworks euser et al 2013 gupta et al 2009 schoups et al 2008 marshall et al 2005 also implemented a bayesian approach to calculate the posterior probability of competing hydrological models in model selection while considering both model and parameter uncertainty large sample modeling studies from comparing a single model s performance over a wide variety of catchments and various models performance in a specific catchment to assessing multiple models across different conditions are conducted to understand similarities and differences of model functioning knoben et al 2020 in summary seeking a single complete and fixed model has been a dominant theme on the identification of hydrological model structures however a model with overall good performance in a basin does not necessarily indicate that each process in the model is reliably represented in addition to model performance model realism i e getting the right answers for the right reasons is also important to advance the science of hydrology beven 2018 gao et al 2020 kirchner 2006 thus structure identification of hydrological processes is necessary but hard to consider separately since structures of conventional hydrological models are usually fixed pilz et al 2020 prieto et al 2021 remmers et al 2020 flexible and modular modeling frameworks offer an opportunity to explore impacts of alternative choices of process structure and identify appropriate model configurations addor and melsen 2019 brown and craig 2020 dal molin et al 2021 kneis 2015 diverse process options which are mathematical representations of hydrological processes are integrated into these flexible and modular modeling frameworks rather than evaluating the model as a whole the structure of individual hydrological process can be substituted with various process options and analyzed solely chlumsky et al 2021 spieler et al 2020 several flexible modeling frameworks have been developed to help hydrologists tailor model structures over the past decades including fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 and raven craig et al 2020 the fuse modeling framework has been used to construct 79 different models by combining components collected from four lumped hydrological models the superflex modeling framework supports hydrologists to mix and match generic components such as reservoirs and junctions to build and test different model structures compared with the existing flexible modeling frameworks more functionalities are added to the raven modeling framework such as providing more hydrologic process algorithms and supporting lumped semi distributed modeling robust and generalized flexible modeling frameworks can provide hydrological modeling platforms for testing various modeling paradigms of hydrological processes and understand structural uncertainties chlumsky et al 2021 guenther et al 2019 mai et al 2020 mai et al 2022 pilz et al 2020 prieto et al 2021 spieler et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 hydrological process options and parameter values can be regarded as integer and continuous decision variables to form a blended model based on flexible modeling frameworks the structure of each process follows a integer distribution and the value space is a set of ordered integer numbers which are associated with process options spieler et al 2020 proposed a framework for automatic model structure identification in which process structures integer decision variables and parameter values continuous decision variables were calibrated simultaneously by a blended optimization algorithm pilz et al 2020 analyzed the structural temporal identifiability of a flexible ecohydrological simulation environment and tailored process based hydrological models for diverse conditions using the glue framework prieto et al 2021 identified process options best suited for individual hydrological processes by estimating posterior probabilities based on bayesian inference in these publications various performance metrics were used for structural identification a specific performance metric could be effective for identification of certain processes parameters but less useful for identifying other processes parameters for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency and nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated on the log transformed simulated and observed streamflow have greater emphasis on simulation of high and low flows respectively pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 certain processes parameters which dominate the hydrograph parts emphasized by the performance metric are more likely to be identifiable thus the processes parameters dominance to model behavior influences the identification results time varying sensitivity analysis has been conducted to demonstrate the temporal influence of parameters on model behavior fan et al 2016 herman et al 2013 wang et al 2021 after demonstrating that relative influence of parameters varies with time guse et al 2020b incorporated information of temporal influence into the performance metric and constructed a respective sensitivity weighted performance metric for each parameter to improve parameter identification similarly the influence of hydrological processes on model behavior in each period are different mai et al 2020 used the raven flexible modeling framework to build a blended model and explored time dependent process sensitivities however the time varying influence of hydrological processes on model behavior has not been incorporated into any performance metric used specifically for identification of process structures in this study structure identifiability of process is defined as the ability to constrain the range of process options based on additional information such as observations ghasemizade et al 2017 guse et al 2020b pilz et al 2020 accordingly three main questions are addressed 1 whether sensitivity weighted performance metrics which reflect time varying influence of hydrological processes on model behavior are useful for improving process structural identifiability 2 how the identifiability varies for different hydrological processes 3 which model is the most effective among the blended models identified by conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics the conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics are two versions of performance metrics with and without sensitivity weights respectively the conventional performance metric means a metric is used without sensitivity weighting which is compared with the proposed sensitivity weighted performance metric in this study the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the methodologies of blended model temporal sensitivity process identifiability and model evaluation a synthetic experiment is described in section 3 followed by description of three real world examples in section 4 results of case studies and discussion are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes main conclusions of the study 2 methodology to solve the three questions stated at the end of the introduction a framework with following steps is proposed 1 defining process options integer decision variable and parameter value continuous decision variable space of the original blended model section 2 1 2 detecting temporal sensitivities of each process in the blended model section 2 2 3 constructing a sensitivity weighted performance metric based on temporal sensitivities and identifying posterior structures for each process under two alternative versions of the performance metric the sensitivity weighted version with sensitivity weights and conventional version without sensitivity weights respectively section 2 3 4 evaluating the performance of the original blended model posterior blended models identified by conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics section 2 4 the flowchart of the framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 blended model the raven hydrological modeling framework craig et al 2020 is a general formulation of a surface water hydrological model it provides a wide range of hydrological process options and various combinations of options an ensemble of about 8 10 12 hydrological model configurations exists in the released version 3 0 4 of raven mai et al 2020 the raven supports a powerful platform for exploring model structural uncertainty based on the flexible and modular modeling framework hydrological researchers are no longer limited to the analysis of conventional fixed model structures but each process in the hydrological model can be altered and researched solely clark et al 2008 craig et al 2020 dal molin et al 2021 a lumped conceptual blended model running on a daily time step is built as the original model based on raven flexible modeling framework in this study hydrological process options and parameter values in the blended model are described with integer and continuous decision variables respectively selection of hydrological process options for the blended model refers to the study of mai et al 2020 chlumsky et al 2021 and mai et al 2022 as detailed in table 1 three three two three and three different options are selected for infiltration quickflow evaporation baseflow and snow balance processes respectively except those five hydrological processes with multiple process options the structure of other processes is fixed the difference between this study and the study of mai et al 2020 chlumsky et al 2021 and mai et al 2022 is that base linear analytic base vic and base topmodel are used in baseflow process of the blended model to increase option ranges in total there are five integer parameters to describe hydrological processes and 36 continuous parameters in the blended model 162 hydrological models can be produced when each hydrological process chooses a specific option on the basis of mai et al 2020 specific options of each process and parameters are listed in table 1 and table a1 respectively a conventional structure fixed model hmets is obtained when the first option in table 1 is selected for each process 2 2 temporal sensitivity analysis of hydrological processes 2 2 1 conventional sensitivity a variance based global sensitivity analysis method sobol method sobol 1993 is used in this study the method decomposes the variance of model output into individual parameters and their interactions liu et al 2020 tang et al 2007 the first order index s k eq 1 and total order index st k eq 2 are the two most used sobol indexes the first order index s k indicates the variability of model output by only changing the value of parameter k the total order index st k quantities the influence of parameter k and the interactions between parameter k and other parameters 1 s k v k v y 2 st k 1 v k v y where y is model output v y is the total variance of y v k is the variance term of the model output generated by parameter k and v k is the variance term without consideration of parameter k the simulated streamflow can be substituted by a model performance metric to be analyzed in sobol method since the controls on model performance are analyzed herman et al 2013 the mean absolute error mae is used as the performance metric guse et al 2020b ochoa tocachi et al 2016 shenify et al 2016 since mae equally emphasizes the fitting of all flow segments 3 mae 1 n i 1 n q s i q o i where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively and n is the number of observations the total order sensitivity index st k is usually used to reveal which model parameters control model performance herman et al 2013 hydrological process options and parameter values in the blended model are integer and continuous decision variables respectively when conducting sensitivity analysis both integer hydrological process options and continuous parameter values are sampled to drive model as shown in table 1 each realization of five processes is linked to an integer number the sampling of process options is carried out by sampling integer number from an integer range uniformly baroni and tarantola 2014 guenther et al 2019 the continuous parameters are sampled from the ranges listed in table a1 to distinguish temporal sensitivities which are analyzed over a moving window described in section 2 2 2 the sensitivity indexes calculated by performing sobol method over the entire time period are called conventional sensitivities in this study 2 2 2 temporal sensitivity temporal sensitivity is obtained by performing sobol method on a moving window since the estimations are less affected by atypical values in a moving window ghasemizade et al 2017 wagener et al 2003 temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity are used to quantify the temporal variability of parameter influence on the hydrograph guse et al 2020b reusser et al 2011 due to seasonal or interannual variability parameters can be important in the simulation response of specific hydrograph phases but not in other periods guse et al 2020b such as the snow module and corresponding parameters are essential in snowmelt seasons while are out of operation in the warmer summer when sobol sensitivity analysis is performed on a moving window with 2 m 1 days the model performance for the i th step is expressed as follows 4 mae i 1 2 m 1 j i m i m q s j q o j where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of observations and mae i is the model performance metric at the i th step the first order index and total order index of parameter k at the i th step is represented by s k i and st k i respectively there are 41 parameters in the blended model including five integer and 36 continuous parameters only the temporal sensitivity analysis of five hydrological processes is conducted to identify process structures 2 3 identifiability analysis of hydrological processes a behavioral approach the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 is employed to partition an ensemble of model configurations into behavioral acceptable model performance and nonbehavioral sets by performance criteria pilz et al 2020 five integer parameters i e hydrological processes and 36 continuous model parameters follow uniform distributions in parameter space the parameters are sampled n 215 i e 32 768 in this study times from the value space by latin hypercube sampling and the best p 1 in this study are selected as acceptable ensembles for each parameter by two versions of a performance metric the conventional version and sensitivity weighted version mae is used as the performance metric since temporal sensitivity information is derived by using mae to be analyzed in sobol method thus the acceptable posterior range of parameter k will be identified using threshold criterion for mae eq 3 and w m a e k eq 5 in the conventional version of mae the absolute residual of each time step is given a same weight in the sensitivity weighted mean absolute error of parameter k wmae k the absolute residuals of flow segments where the parameter k has larger relative influence than other periods are given higher weights the absolute residual of ith day is multiplied by the ith weighting factor w k i w k i is proportional to the temporal sensitivity of parameter k st k i eq 6 thus the absolute residuals of time steps when the parameter has larger relative influence will be amplified wmae k tends to emphasize fitting of the flow segments when the parameter k becomes more important 5 wmae k i 1 n w k i q s i q o i n 6 w k i st k i j 1 n st k j n where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of observations st k i and w k i are the total order sensitivity and weighting factor of parameter k at i th time step respectively w k i is derived from the daily total order sensitivity st k i k could indicate five hydrological processes i e infiltration quickflow soil evaporation baseflow and snow balance process and 36 continuous parameters since the identification of hydrological processes is mainly focused in this study only five wmae k s are constructed with temporal sensitivity indexes of five hydrological processes respectively in this study for example the weighting factors of infiltration w infiltration i is combined with the mean absolute residuals to construct the wmae infiltration when the acceptable structures of infiltration process are analyzed the best p of n model runs are selected as acceptable model ensembles for each process by two versions of performance metrics mae and wmae based on acceptable model ensembles posterior frequencies of hydrological processes are calculated for a specific process options with posterior frequencies larger than half of the maximum frequency among the options are selected to form so called constrained options guse et al 2020a guse et al 2020b which are defined as posterior options in this study there are two sets of posterior option ranges one is constraining the option ranges of processes by mae another is constraining the option range of each process by its own sensitivity weighted performance metric wmae high structure identifiability is defined as the ability to obtain structure option ranges with low uncertainty thus a process with high identifiability means that the uncertainty is small namely the number of posterior options is small 2 4 performance evaluation the original blended model introduced in section 2 1 contains all original process options in table 1 two new blended models are generated based on two sets of posterior options which are selected from the original process options by mae and wmae respectively the model performance of the original blended model the blended models identified by mae and wmae and a conventional structure fixed model hmets is evaluated parameters are sampled by latin hypercube sampling n 32768 in this study times for running each hydrological model sorted by mae the best p 1 in this study simulation results of each hydrological model are selected into the ensemble for model performance comparison the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated on the log transformed simulated and observed streamflow nselog and the mean absolute error mae are used to evaluate model performance the mae is defined in eq 3 and other metrics are defined as follows 7 nse 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 8 ns e log 1 i 1 n log q s i log q o i 2 i 1 n log q o i log q 0 2 where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge q o and log q 0 are the mean value of the observed discharge and the log transformed observed discharge and n is the number of observations nse values range from minus infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the nselog has greater emphasis on low flows mae is used to evaluate the error between the observed and simulated discharge the mae value closer to 0 indicates a smaller error 3 case study 3 1 synthetic experiment a synthetic experiment is designed to test the ability of conventional mean absolute error mae and sensitivity weighted mean absolute error wmae to identify suitable hydrological processes from the blended model a model is selected as the true model by specifying hydrological process options and parameters in the blended model six years of synthetic forcing data including daily precipitation and temperature were generated via a stochastic simulation the true model uses synthetic forcing data to generate synthetic streamflow observations the steps to analyze the structure identifiability of hydrological processes are as follows 1 experimental model setup true process structures in the synthetic model setup are the asterisked in table 1 those are the inf hmets base linear analytic soilevap topmodel base vic snobal hbv respectively 2 calculating daily process sensitivity of the blended model the temporal dynamics of process sensitivity of the blended model are obtained by performing sobol sensitivity analysis on a 11 day moving window daily weighting factors of each process are derived from their temporal sensitivities in this study the number of reference parameter sets for sobol sensitivity analysis is 1024 which seems sufficient to drive useful sensitivity estimates cuntz et al 2016 cuntz et al 2015 mai et al 2020 3 posterior frequencies analysis of each process the integer and continuous parameters in the blended model are sampled to run the model 32 768 times the best 1 model runs are selected as acceptable model configurations by mae and wmaek and used to calculate posterior frequencies of hydrological processes k 3 2 real catchment case study three basins in china the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are used as real world basins the locations and catchment characteristics are provided in fig 2 and table 2 respectively the climate of the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are plateau alpine humid and semiarid respectively the precipitation and temperature are obtained from rain and meteorological stations respectively the daily discharge is obtained from the hydrological station at the basin outlet in each basin two thirds of the data series are used for calibration and one third are for validation except that the first year is used for warm up 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the synthetic experiment fig 3 presents the daily sobol total order indexes of five hydrological processes daily precipitation and daily temperature in the synthetic experiment the darker color represents a larger total order index the temporal variabilities show that the relative influence of hydrological processes has periodicity quickflow is a major dominant process since it is the most sensitive all the time the infiltration and baseflow processes have higher sensitivities in dry periods than wet periods the sensitivity of soil evaporation process is relatively larger in the wet period the sensitivity of snow balance process is high in the snow seasons especially when the average daily temperature is around zero the intra annual sensitivity difference of baseflow and snow balance processes are larger than other processes fig 4 shows posterior frequencies of five hydrological processes identified by conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metric wmaek the infiltration quickflow and soil evaporation processes have high identifiability since only one option of each process is included in the constrained options both based on mae and wmae k the identified inf hmets base linear analytic and soilevap topmodel are the true structures for corresponding processes in the synthetic model setup the identifiability of baseflow and snow balance processes is low under mae since the number of prior and posterior options is same for the two processes the base vic and snobal hbv options are the synthetic true structures for baseflow and snow balance processes respectively however the base linear analytic and snobal simple melt options have largest posterior frequencies when identified by mae especially the posterior frequency of the true structure base vic is the lowest when identified by wmae the base vic and base topmodel options snobal simlpe melt and snobal hbv options are identified as posterior structures the options that have the largest posterior frequencies are the synthetic true structures when identified by wmae the process option with largest posterior frequency is not necessarily the true structure but the process options with larger posterior frequencies are supposed to be more likely to be the true structure the synthetic result shows wmae is more effective to identify process options that have higher probabilities to be true structures as shown in fig 3 the sensitivity of baseflow and snow balance processes is relatively high during specific periods which means the temporal importance of two processes to hydrograph however the conventional performance metric is influenced more by high flow periods since the error between simulated and observed discharge is more likely to be large the temporal importance of baseflow and snow balance processes on hydrograph in specific periods is neglected in the conventional performance metric sensitivity weighted performance metrics will help pay attention to the simulation when the hydrological processes have larger relative influence compared with mae the posterior range of hydrological processes is reduced when identified by wmae the synthetic experiment shows that wmae may provide more useful information for identification especially for hydrological processes that temporal influence on hydrograph significantly changes thus the temporal influence of hydrological processes on hydrograph can be used to improve the identifiability of hydrological processes 4 2 temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes is derived using a 11 day moving window in sobol sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 5 the multiyear mean daily sensitivity of hydrological processes displays significant intra year variability in the three studied basins the sensitivity indexes of infiltration process are small overall and especially smaller in wet periods which is similar across the studied basins quickflow is a major dominant process all the time and soil evaporation is the second most sensitive process on average in all basins baseflow process shows higher sensitivity in dry periods than wet periods since baseflow is the main component of streamflow in dry seasons the variations of influence of snow balance process on hydrograph are related to snowmelt and refreeze seasons the sensitivity variabilities of snow balance process within the year are more obvious in the tongtianhe basin than in the xunhe and wudinghe basins since the tongtianhe basin is located in the tibet plateau where the average daily temperature is less than zero for more than half a year the temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes reveals that relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior varies over time which has also been acknowledged in the previous literature guse et al 2020b herman et al 2013 mai et al 2020 however the temporal variabilities of process influence have not been used to identify the structure of hydrological processes those hydrological processes have larger conventional sensitivities would influence the value of conventional performance metrics more the conventional versions of performance metrics may miss information helpful to the structure identification of other hydrological processes table 3 shows the conventional sensitivity indexes of hydrological processes for the studied basins the conventional sensitivity indexes are estimated by using the mean absolute error over the entire calibration period eq 3 as model output in sobol analysis from the aspect of conventional total order indexes quickflow is the most sensitive process the conventional total order indexes of quickflow process are 0 62 0 67 and 0 66 in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively the conventional sensitivity index estimates show that quickflow is much more sensitive than other processes for example the total order index of quickflow 0 62 is 30 times more than of that baseflow 0 02 in the tongtianhe basin nevertheless temporal sensitivity analysis shows quickflow process is only 1 5 times more sensitive than baseflow process in the dry periods of the tongtianhe basin sub fig 5 a the relative large influence of baseflow in the dry periods is probably masked by quickflow because the conventional sensitivity is actually considered in the conventional performance metric thus temporal sensitivity could generate a sensitivity weighted performance metric for each process and help the model pay attention to the runoff simulations in the periods when the corresponding process is more influential 4 3 hydrological process identifiability after analyzing temporal dynamics of process sensitivity both conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics mae and wmae are used as threshold indexes in the glue method to identify suitable model ensembles for each hydrological process fig 6 compares the posterior frequencies of hydrological process options based on two versions of mae in the studied basins in the alpine tongtianhe basin infiltration quickflow and evaporation processes show high structure identifiability both based on mae and wmae the posterior frequencies of infiltration options inf hmets inf vic arno and inf hbv are 72 7 21 under mae and 67 12 20 under wmae respectively since both the posterior frequencies of inf vic arno and inf hbv are less than half of inf hmets only inf hmets is selected as the posterior option for infiltration process in the tongtianhe basin similarly base linear analytic and soilevap topmodel are identified as the only posterior option for quickflow and soil evaporation process respectively the identifiability of baseflow and snow balance processes under wmae is higher than that under mae base linear analytic and base vic are selected as the posterior options by mae while base linear analytic is the only identified option by wmae for snow balance process wmae recognizes snobal simple melt and snobal hbv as the posterior structures while all the three prior options appear in the posterior results identified by mae when only one option is allowed for each process six 1 1 1 2 3 and two 1 1 1 1 2 hydrological model structures can be formed based on the blended models identified by the conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metrics wmae respectively the process identifiability derived by wmae is also higher than that under mae in the xunhe and wudinghe basin in the humid xunhe basin the results identified by two performance metrics are similar except that the soilevap all and soilevap topmodel options are identified by mae but only soilevap topmodel is selected by wmae for soil evaporation process the base linear analytic is excluded in quickflow process after the identifying procedure under two versions of the performance metric the quickflow shows absolute dominance all the time and the sensitivities of other processes are also dynamically changing however the sensitivities of other processes are small all the time wmae may extract more useful information especially for the identification of hydrological processes which have temporal influence on hydrograph thus the process identifiability is low under both mae and wmae in the xunhe basin there are 108 3 2 2 3 3 and 54 3 2 1 3 3 possible models in the blended model identified by mae and wmae respectively in the semiarid wudinghe basin quickflow and soil evaporation have high identifiability base vic and soilevap topmodel are identified as the only posterior structure for quickflow and soil evaporation processes respectively inf vic arno and base topmodel appear in the posterior structures identified by mae but not in the results identified by wmae there are ultimately 27 3 1 1 3 3 and 12 2 1 1 2 3 possible models in the identified blended models of the wudinghe basin under mae and wmae respectively overall the process option ranges constrained by wmae are smaller than mae from the aspect of structures identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics quickflow and soil evaporation processes are more identifiable followed by infiltration and baseflow processes snow balance process has the lowest identifiability the hydrological processes with higher sensitivity are easier to identify than other processes besides the identifiability result shows that the appropriate model structures in the xunhe basin are more than the other two basins it is noted that the runoff coefficients are 0 21 0 43 and 0 11 in the tongthanhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively which indicates that the xunhe basin has the wettest climatic conditions most literature has concluded that models are more likely to obtain satisfied runoff simulations in the humid basins than in arid areas clark et al 2008 knoben et al 2020 which may explain why more models are appropriate in the xunhe basin 4 4 model performance parameters are sampled by latin hypercube sampling 32 768 times for running the original blended model two identified blended models under conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metrics wmae and a conventional structure fixed hydrological model hmets sorted by mae the best 1 simulation results of each model are selected into the ensemble for model performance comparison fig 7 shows the performance of blended models and the hmets model in the three studied basins compared with the original blended model yellow boxes the blended model identified by mae blue boxes improves runoff simulations from the aspect of most performance criteria except the nselog in the xunhe basin however the blended model identified by wmae purple boxes can further improve the simulation compared with the model selected by mae all the performance indicators have been improved when identified by wmae in the tongtianhe basin in the xunhe basin the superiority of models identified by wmae is especially obvious in the validation period all the models lack satisfactory performance in the wudinghe basin while the model identified by wmae still works better a smaller sampling space of hydrological process options in the blended model identified by wmae helps enhance the efficiency of sampling and then bring a better simulation in the real basins the original blended model in this study includes a conventional structure fixed hydrological model hmets here the hydrological model hmets is applied to compare with blended models as shown in fig 7 the red boxes represent the performance of hmets in the tongtianhe basin hmets performs better than original used blended model and worse than both the posterior blended models under mae and wmae however the hmets model is even inferior to the original used blended models in the xunhe from aspects of all the performance metrics and in the wudinghe basins from the aspect of nse the performance ranking order of each blended model is almost same in the studied basins the blended model identified by wmae outperforms that identified by mae whereas the latter is superior to the original used blended model except the nselog in the xunhe basin the performance ranking of the hmets model varies with basins which is consistent with previous conclusions that one size fits all models are hard to find coxon et al 2014 van esse et al 2013 in addition all models tend to achieve better performance in the tongthanhe and xunhe basins than in the wudinghe basin the wudinghe basin is located in a semi arid region with mean annual precipitation of 401 mm the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1077 mm hydrological simulation in semi arid and arid areas is still one of the difficult problems in the hydrology field besides the catchment conditions of the wudinghe basin are significantly influenced by human activities the soil and water conservation measures such as the construction of the check dams and afforestation have changed the underlying surface and the rainfall runoff relationship since the 1960 s deng et al 2016 tian et al 2019 zhang and liu 2021 thus the poor performance in the wudinghe basin could be partly attributed to the unclear and non stationary mechanism of the rainfall runoff relationship the limited structure options in the selected prior model could be another reason for the bad runoff simulations although the sensitivity weighted performance metrics identify superior process structures the effectiveness of the identified posterior models may be restricted if the appropriate structures are not included in the prior flexible model extending structure options of each hydrological process in the blended model is one of the methods to improve the simulation meanwhile a more abundant process option space in the blended model will be followed by more parameters to be analyzed and then need increased computational resources thus the prior process structures used in the blended deserve further investigation and selection however the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior has been proved effective in identifying acceptable structures by reducing search domain of hydrological process structures 5 conclusions the use of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior to construct sensitivity weighted performance metrics to identify process structures has not been discussed in the previous literature this study aims to identify appropriate structures of hydrological processes by considering relative influence in order to ensure individual hydrological processes can be researched separately a blended model with process options and parameter values being integer and continuous decision variables is used a synthetic experiment is designed to evaluate impacts of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on the structure identification three real case studies tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are conducted to explore the structure identification of hydrological processes the following conclusions are obtained 1 the synthetic experiment demonstrates that the sensitivity weighted mean absolute error improves structure identifiability of hydrological processes by considering the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior especially for hydrological processes that the temporal influence significantly changes the process options constrained by sensitivity weighted performance metrics are smaller than that under conventional performance metric which does not make use of sensitivity information 2 the quickflow and soil evaporation processes have high identifiability followed by infiltration baseflow and snow balance processes in the real world examples by combinations 2 54 and 12 models can be formed in the posterior blended models identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively 3 the model identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics is more efficient than that identified by conventional performance metrics in discharge simulations in the three studied basins with varied climatic conditions the blended model identified by conventional performance metrics outperforms the original blended model except evaluated by the nselog in the xunhe basin and the conventional fixed structure model hmets nevertheless the structure identification using sensitivity weighted performance metrics provides the most outstanding model configurations among all the blended models and the hmets model this study aims to identify structures of hydrological processes more effectively based on temporal sensitivity further work will focus on exploring the patterns of hydrological process structure for a large sample of watersheds credit authorship

2600,structure identifiability of hydrological processes refers to the ability to select appropriate mathematical representation from multiple structural options although the influence of hydrological processes on model behavior varies in time this temporal relative influence has not been used to identify process structures in this work a framework is proposed to investigate the impacts of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on structure identification the framework consists of four elements 1 a blended model where hydrological process options and parameter values are regarded as integer and continuous decision variables respectively is built based on the flexible modeling framework raven 2 the temporal sensitivities of each process are derived by using sobol sensitivity analysis on a moving window 3 performance metrics with and without sensitivity weights which are derived from the temporal sensitivities are used to identify process structures respectively and 4 models identified by these two methods are compared to evaluate performance a synthetic experiment is designed to validate the proposed framework three case studies are carried out in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins in china results are summarized as follows 1 sensitivity weighted performance metrics improve the identifiability of process structures by considering the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior 2 quickflow and soil evaporation processes are the two most identifiable processes followed by infiltration baseflow and snow balance processes and 3 the model identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics is more efficient than that selected by the performance metric without sensitivity weights it is recommended that the temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes be used to identify model structures based on flexible modeling frameworks keywords flexible modeling framework blended model hydrological processes temporal sensitivity identifiability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models are effective methods to describe rainfall runoff relationships and realize accurate streamflow predictions pan et al 2019 zhang and liu 2021 establishing a hydrological model involves abstraction and simplification of multiple hydrological processes which refer to physical phenomena occurring in the catchment gharari et al 2021 guse et al 2017 konapala et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2016 singh and frevert 2006 structures of hydrological processes may vary between models since model developers have a distinctive understanding of the world or models are developed in regions with different hydrological characteristics clark et al 2008 prieto et al 2021 wrede et al 2015 with numerous hydrological models composed of diverse structures reducing model structural uncertainty is important for accurate streamflow predictions addor and melsen 2019 biondi et al 2012 euser et al 2013 kirchner 2006 knoben et al 2020 marshall et al 2005 recently many studies have been carried out on model selection to find scientifically meaningful and operationally reliable models fenicia et al 2011 typical model selection methods compare the model s ability to reproduce observed streamflow based on quantitative performance criteria or assessment frameworks euser et al 2013 gupta et al 2009 schoups et al 2008 marshall et al 2005 also implemented a bayesian approach to calculate the posterior probability of competing hydrological models in model selection while considering both model and parameter uncertainty large sample modeling studies from comparing a single model s performance over a wide variety of catchments and various models performance in a specific catchment to assessing multiple models across different conditions are conducted to understand similarities and differences of model functioning knoben et al 2020 in summary seeking a single complete and fixed model has been a dominant theme on the identification of hydrological model structures however a model with overall good performance in a basin does not necessarily indicate that each process in the model is reliably represented in addition to model performance model realism i e getting the right answers for the right reasons is also important to advance the science of hydrology beven 2018 gao et al 2020 kirchner 2006 thus structure identification of hydrological processes is necessary but hard to consider separately since structures of conventional hydrological models are usually fixed pilz et al 2020 prieto et al 2021 remmers et al 2020 flexible and modular modeling frameworks offer an opportunity to explore impacts of alternative choices of process structure and identify appropriate model configurations addor and melsen 2019 brown and craig 2020 dal molin et al 2021 kneis 2015 diverse process options which are mathematical representations of hydrological processes are integrated into these flexible and modular modeling frameworks rather than evaluating the model as a whole the structure of individual hydrological process can be substituted with various process options and analyzed solely chlumsky et al 2021 spieler et al 2020 several flexible modeling frameworks have been developed to help hydrologists tailor model structures over the past decades including fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 and raven craig et al 2020 the fuse modeling framework has been used to construct 79 different models by combining components collected from four lumped hydrological models the superflex modeling framework supports hydrologists to mix and match generic components such as reservoirs and junctions to build and test different model structures compared with the existing flexible modeling frameworks more functionalities are added to the raven modeling framework such as providing more hydrologic process algorithms and supporting lumped semi distributed modeling robust and generalized flexible modeling frameworks can provide hydrological modeling platforms for testing various modeling paradigms of hydrological processes and understand structural uncertainties chlumsky et al 2021 guenther et al 2019 mai et al 2020 mai et al 2022 pilz et al 2020 prieto et al 2021 spieler et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 hydrological process options and parameter values can be regarded as integer and continuous decision variables to form a blended model based on flexible modeling frameworks the structure of each process follows a integer distribution and the value space is a set of ordered integer numbers which are associated with process options spieler et al 2020 proposed a framework for automatic model structure identification in which process structures integer decision variables and parameter values continuous decision variables were calibrated simultaneously by a blended optimization algorithm pilz et al 2020 analyzed the structural temporal identifiability of a flexible ecohydrological simulation environment and tailored process based hydrological models for diverse conditions using the glue framework prieto et al 2021 identified process options best suited for individual hydrological processes by estimating posterior probabilities based on bayesian inference in these publications various performance metrics were used for structural identification a specific performance metric could be effective for identification of certain processes parameters but less useful for identifying other processes parameters for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency and nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated on the log transformed simulated and observed streamflow have greater emphasis on simulation of high and low flows respectively pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 certain processes parameters which dominate the hydrograph parts emphasized by the performance metric are more likely to be identifiable thus the processes parameters dominance to model behavior influences the identification results time varying sensitivity analysis has been conducted to demonstrate the temporal influence of parameters on model behavior fan et al 2016 herman et al 2013 wang et al 2021 after demonstrating that relative influence of parameters varies with time guse et al 2020b incorporated information of temporal influence into the performance metric and constructed a respective sensitivity weighted performance metric for each parameter to improve parameter identification similarly the influence of hydrological processes on model behavior in each period are different mai et al 2020 used the raven flexible modeling framework to build a blended model and explored time dependent process sensitivities however the time varying influence of hydrological processes on model behavior has not been incorporated into any performance metric used specifically for identification of process structures in this study structure identifiability of process is defined as the ability to constrain the range of process options based on additional information such as observations ghasemizade et al 2017 guse et al 2020b pilz et al 2020 accordingly three main questions are addressed 1 whether sensitivity weighted performance metrics which reflect time varying influence of hydrological processes on model behavior are useful for improving process structural identifiability 2 how the identifiability varies for different hydrological processes 3 which model is the most effective among the blended models identified by conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics the conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics are two versions of performance metrics with and without sensitivity weights respectively the conventional performance metric means a metric is used without sensitivity weighting which is compared with the proposed sensitivity weighted performance metric in this study the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the methodologies of blended model temporal sensitivity process identifiability and model evaluation a synthetic experiment is described in section 3 followed by description of three real world examples in section 4 results of case studies and discussion are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes main conclusions of the study 2 methodology to solve the three questions stated at the end of the introduction a framework with following steps is proposed 1 defining process options integer decision variable and parameter value continuous decision variable space of the original blended model section 2 1 2 detecting temporal sensitivities of each process in the blended model section 2 2 3 constructing a sensitivity weighted performance metric based on temporal sensitivities and identifying posterior structures for each process under two alternative versions of the performance metric the sensitivity weighted version with sensitivity weights and conventional version without sensitivity weights respectively section 2 3 4 evaluating the performance of the original blended model posterior blended models identified by conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics section 2 4 the flowchart of the framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 blended model the raven hydrological modeling framework craig et al 2020 is a general formulation of a surface water hydrological model it provides a wide range of hydrological process options and various combinations of options an ensemble of about 8 10 12 hydrological model configurations exists in the released version 3 0 4 of raven mai et al 2020 the raven supports a powerful platform for exploring model structural uncertainty based on the flexible and modular modeling framework hydrological researchers are no longer limited to the analysis of conventional fixed model structures but each process in the hydrological model can be altered and researched solely clark et al 2008 craig et al 2020 dal molin et al 2021 a lumped conceptual blended model running on a daily time step is built as the original model based on raven flexible modeling framework in this study hydrological process options and parameter values in the blended model are described with integer and continuous decision variables respectively selection of hydrological process options for the blended model refers to the study of mai et al 2020 chlumsky et al 2021 and mai et al 2022 as detailed in table 1 three three two three and three different options are selected for infiltration quickflow evaporation baseflow and snow balance processes respectively except those five hydrological processes with multiple process options the structure of other processes is fixed the difference between this study and the study of mai et al 2020 chlumsky et al 2021 and mai et al 2022 is that base linear analytic base vic and base topmodel are used in baseflow process of the blended model to increase option ranges in total there are five integer parameters to describe hydrological processes and 36 continuous parameters in the blended model 162 hydrological models can be produced when each hydrological process chooses a specific option on the basis of mai et al 2020 specific options of each process and parameters are listed in table 1 and table a1 respectively a conventional structure fixed model hmets is obtained when the first option in table 1 is selected for each process 2 2 temporal sensitivity analysis of hydrological processes 2 2 1 conventional sensitivity a variance based global sensitivity analysis method sobol method sobol 1993 is used in this study the method decomposes the variance of model output into individual parameters and their interactions liu et al 2020 tang et al 2007 the first order index s k eq 1 and total order index st k eq 2 are the two most used sobol indexes the first order index s k indicates the variability of model output by only changing the value of parameter k the total order index st k quantities the influence of parameter k and the interactions between parameter k and other parameters 1 s k v k v y 2 st k 1 v k v y where y is model output v y is the total variance of y v k is the variance term of the model output generated by parameter k and v k is the variance term without consideration of parameter k the simulated streamflow can be substituted by a model performance metric to be analyzed in sobol method since the controls on model performance are analyzed herman et al 2013 the mean absolute error mae is used as the performance metric guse et al 2020b ochoa tocachi et al 2016 shenify et al 2016 since mae equally emphasizes the fitting of all flow segments 3 mae 1 n i 1 n q s i q o i where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively and n is the number of observations the total order sensitivity index st k is usually used to reveal which model parameters control model performance herman et al 2013 hydrological process options and parameter values in the blended model are integer and continuous decision variables respectively when conducting sensitivity analysis both integer hydrological process options and continuous parameter values are sampled to drive model as shown in table 1 each realization of five processes is linked to an integer number the sampling of process options is carried out by sampling integer number from an integer range uniformly baroni and tarantola 2014 guenther et al 2019 the continuous parameters are sampled from the ranges listed in table a1 to distinguish temporal sensitivities which are analyzed over a moving window described in section 2 2 2 the sensitivity indexes calculated by performing sobol method over the entire time period are called conventional sensitivities in this study 2 2 2 temporal sensitivity temporal sensitivity is obtained by performing sobol method on a moving window since the estimations are less affected by atypical values in a moving window ghasemizade et al 2017 wagener et al 2003 temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity are used to quantify the temporal variability of parameter influence on the hydrograph guse et al 2020b reusser et al 2011 due to seasonal or interannual variability parameters can be important in the simulation response of specific hydrograph phases but not in other periods guse et al 2020b such as the snow module and corresponding parameters are essential in snowmelt seasons while are out of operation in the warmer summer when sobol sensitivity analysis is performed on a moving window with 2 m 1 days the model performance for the i th step is expressed as follows 4 mae i 1 2 m 1 j i m i m q s j q o j where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of observations and mae i is the model performance metric at the i th step the first order index and total order index of parameter k at the i th step is represented by s k i and st k i respectively there are 41 parameters in the blended model including five integer and 36 continuous parameters only the temporal sensitivity analysis of five hydrological processes is conducted to identify process structures 2 3 identifiability analysis of hydrological processes a behavioral approach the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 is employed to partition an ensemble of model configurations into behavioral acceptable model performance and nonbehavioral sets by performance criteria pilz et al 2020 five integer parameters i e hydrological processes and 36 continuous model parameters follow uniform distributions in parameter space the parameters are sampled n 215 i e 32 768 in this study times from the value space by latin hypercube sampling and the best p 1 in this study are selected as acceptable ensembles for each parameter by two versions of a performance metric the conventional version and sensitivity weighted version mae is used as the performance metric since temporal sensitivity information is derived by using mae to be analyzed in sobol method thus the acceptable posterior range of parameter k will be identified using threshold criterion for mae eq 3 and w m a e k eq 5 in the conventional version of mae the absolute residual of each time step is given a same weight in the sensitivity weighted mean absolute error of parameter k wmae k the absolute residuals of flow segments where the parameter k has larger relative influence than other periods are given higher weights the absolute residual of ith day is multiplied by the ith weighting factor w k i w k i is proportional to the temporal sensitivity of parameter k st k i eq 6 thus the absolute residuals of time steps when the parameter has larger relative influence will be amplified wmae k tends to emphasize fitting of the flow segments when the parameter k becomes more important 5 wmae k i 1 n w k i q s i q o i n 6 w k i st k i j 1 n st k j n where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the number of observations st k i and w k i are the total order sensitivity and weighting factor of parameter k at i th time step respectively w k i is derived from the daily total order sensitivity st k i k could indicate five hydrological processes i e infiltration quickflow soil evaporation baseflow and snow balance process and 36 continuous parameters since the identification of hydrological processes is mainly focused in this study only five wmae k s are constructed with temporal sensitivity indexes of five hydrological processes respectively in this study for example the weighting factors of infiltration w infiltration i is combined with the mean absolute residuals to construct the wmae infiltration when the acceptable structures of infiltration process are analyzed the best p of n model runs are selected as acceptable model ensembles for each process by two versions of performance metrics mae and wmae based on acceptable model ensembles posterior frequencies of hydrological processes are calculated for a specific process options with posterior frequencies larger than half of the maximum frequency among the options are selected to form so called constrained options guse et al 2020a guse et al 2020b which are defined as posterior options in this study there are two sets of posterior option ranges one is constraining the option ranges of processes by mae another is constraining the option range of each process by its own sensitivity weighted performance metric wmae high structure identifiability is defined as the ability to obtain structure option ranges with low uncertainty thus a process with high identifiability means that the uncertainty is small namely the number of posterior options is small 2 4 performance evaluation the original blended model introduced in section 2 1 contains all original process options in table 1 two new blended models are generated based on two sets of posterior options which are selected from the original process options by mae and wmae respectively the model performance of the original blended model the blended models identified by mae and wmae and a conventional structure fixed model hmets is evaluated parameters are sampled by latin hypercube sampling n 32768 in this study times for running each hydrological model sorted by mae the best p 1 in this study simulation results of each hydrological model are selected into the ensemble for model performance comparison the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated on the log transformed simulated and observed streamflow nselog and the mean absolute error mae are used to evaluate model performance the mae is defined in eq 3 and other metrics are defined as follows 7 nse 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 8 ns e log 1 i 1 n log q s i log q o i 2 i 1 n log q o i log q 0 2 where q o i and q s i are the daily observed and simulated discharge q o and log q 0 are the mean value of the observed discharge and the log transformed observed discharge and n is the number of observations nse values range from minus infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the nselog has greater emphasis on low flows mae is used to evaluate the error between the observed and simulated discharge the mae value closer to 0 indicates a smaller error 3 case study 3 1 synthetic experiment a synthetic experiment is designed to test the ability of conventional mean absolute error mae and sensitivity weighted mean absolute error wmae to identify suitable hydrological processes from the blended model a model is selected as the true model by specifying hydrological process options and parameters in the blended model six years of synthetic forcing data including daily precipitation and temperature were generated via a stochastic simulation the true model uses synthetic forcing data to generate synthetic streamflow observations the steps to analyze the structure identifiability of hydrological processes are as follows 1 experimental model setup true process structures in the synthetic model setup are the asterisked in table 1 those are the inf hmets base linear analytic soilevap topmodel base vic snobal hbv respectively 2 calculating daily process sensitivity of the blended model the temporal dynamics of process sensitivity of the blended model are obtained by performing sobol sensitivity analysis on a 11 day moving window daily weighting factors of each process are derived from their temporal sensitivities in this study the number of reference parameter sets for sobol sensitivity analysis is 1024 which seems sufficient to drive useful sensitivity estimates cuntz et al 2016 cuntz et al 2015 mai et al 2020 3 posterior frequencies analysis of each process the integer and continuous parameters in the blended model are sampled to run the model 32 768 times the best 1 model runs are selected as acceptable model configurations by mae and wmaek and used to calculate posterior frequencies of hydrological processes k 3 2 real catchment case study three basins in china the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are used as real world basins the locations and catchment characteristics are provided in fig 2 and table 2 respectively the climate of the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are plateau alpine humid and semiarid respectively the precipitation and temperature are obtained from rain and meteorological stations respectively the daily discharge is obtained from the hydrological station at the basin outlet in each basin two thirds of the data series are used for calibration and one third are for validation except that the first year is used for warm up 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the synthetic experiment fig 3 presents the daily sobol total order indexes of five hydrological processes daily precipitation and daily temperature in the synthetic experiment the darker color represents a larger total order index the temporal variabilities show that the relative influence of hydrological processes has periodicity quickflow is a major dominant process since it is the most sensitive all the time the infiltration and baseflow processes have higher sensitivities in dry periods than wet periods the sensitivity of soil evaporation process is relatively larger in the wet period the sensitivity of snow balance process is high in the snow seasons especially when the average daily temperature is around zero the intra annual sensitivity difference of baseflow and snow balance processes are larger than other processes fig 4 shows posterior frequencies of five hydrological processes identified by conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metric wmaek the infiltration quickflow and soil evaporation processes have high identifiability since only one option of each process is included in the constrained options both based on mae and wmae k the identified inf hmets base linear analytic and soilevap topmodel are the true structures for corresponding processes in the synthetic model setup the identifiability of baseflow and snow balance processes is low under mae since the number of prior and posterior options is same for the two processes the base vic and snobal hbv options are the synthetic true structures for baseflow and snow balance processes respectively however the base linear analytic and snobal simple melt options have largest posterior frequencies when identified by mae especially the posterior frequency of the true structure base vic is the lowest when identified by wmae the base vic and base topmodel options snobal simlpe melt and snobal hbv options are identified as posterior structures the options that have the largest posterior frequencies are the synthetic true structures when identified by wmae the process option with largest posterior frequency is not necessarily the true structure but the process options with larger posterior frequencies are supposed to be more likely to be the true structure the synthetic result shows wmae is more effective to identify process options that have higher probabilities to be true structures as shown in fig 3 the sensitivity of baseflow and snow balance processes is relatively high during specific periods which means the temporal importance of two processes to hydrograph however the conventional performance metric is influenced more by high flow periods since the error between simulated and observed discharge is more likely to be large the temporal importance of baseflow and snow balance processes on hydrograph in specific periods is neglected in the conventional performance metric sensitivity weighted performance metrics will help pay attention to the simulation when the hydrological processes have larger relative influence compared with mae the posterior range of hydrological processes is reduced when identified by wmae the synthetic experiment shows that wmae may provide more useful information for identification especially for hydrological processes that temporal influence on hydrograph significantly changes thus the temporal influence of hydrological processes on hydrograph can be used to improve the identifiability of hydrological processes 4 2 temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes is derived using a 11 day moving window in sobol sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 5 the multiyear mean daily sensitivity of hydrological processes displays significant intra year variability in the three studied basins the sensitivity indexes of infiltration process are small overall and especially smaller in wet periods which is similar across the studied basins quickflow is a major dominant process all the time and soil evaporation is the second most sensitive process on average in all basins baseflow process shows higher sensitivity in dry periods than wet periods since baseflow is the main component of streamflow in dry seasons the variations of influence of snow balance process on hydrograph are related to snowmelt and refreeze seasons the sensitivity variabilities of snow balance process within the year are more obvious in the tongtianhe basin than in the xunhe and wudinghe basins since the tongtianhe basin is located in the tibet plateau where the average daily temperature is less than zero for more than half a year the temporal sensitivity of hydrological processes reveals that relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior varies over time which has also been acknowledged in the previous literature guse et al 2020b herman et al 2013 mai et al 2020 however the temporal variabilities of process influence have not been used to identify the structure of hydrological processes those hydrological processes have larger conventional sensitivities would influence the value of conventional performance metrics more the conventional versions of performance metrics may miss information helpful to the structure identification of other hydrological processes table 3 shows the conventional sensitivity indexes of hydrological processes for the studied basins the conventional sensitivity indexes are estimated by using the mean absolute error over the entire calibration period eq 3 as model output in sobol analysis from the aspect of conventional total order indexes quickflow is the most sensitive process the conventional total order indexes of quickflow process are 0 62 0 67 and 0 66 in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively the conventional sensitivity index estimates show that quickflow is much more sensitive than other processes for example the total order index of quickflow 0 62 is 30 times more than of that baseflow 0 02 in the tongtianhe basin nevertheless temporal sensitivity analysis shows quickflow process is only 1 5 times more sensitive than baseflow process in the dry periods of the tongtianhe basin sub fig 5 a the relative large influence of baseflow in the dry periods is probably masked by quickflow because the conventional sensitivity is actually considered in the conventional performance metric thus temporal sensitivity could generate a sensitivity weighted performance metric for each process and help the model pay attention to the runoff simulations in the periods when the corresponding process is more influential 4 3 hydrological process identifiability after analyzing temporal dynamics of process sensitivity both conventional and sensitivity weighted performance metrics mae and wmae are used as threshold indexes in the glue method to identify suitable model ensembles for each hydrological process fig 6 compares the posterior frequencies of hydrological process options based on two versions of mae in the studied basins in the alpine tongtianhe basin infiltration quickflow and evaporation processes show high structure identifiability both based on mae and wmae the posterior frequencies of infiltration options inf hmets inf vic arno and inf hbv are 72 7 21 under mae and 67 12 20 under wmae respectively since both the posterior frequencies of inf vic arno and inf hbv are less than half of inf hmets only inf hmets is selected as the posterior option for infiltration process in the tongtianhe basin similarly base linear analytic and soilevap topmodel are identified as the only posterior option for quickflow and soil evaporation process respectively the identifiability of baseflow and snow balance processes under wmae is higher than that under mae base linear analytic and base vic are selected as the posterior options by mae while base linear analytic is the only identified option by wmae for snow balance process wmae recognizes snobal simple melt and snobal hbv as the posterior structures while all the three prior options appear in the posterior results identified by mae when only one option is allowed for each process six 1 1 1 2 3 and two 1 1 1 1 2 hydrological model structures can be formed based on the blended models identified by the conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metrics wmae respectively the process identifiability derived by wmae is also higher than that under mae in the xunhe and wudinghe basin in the humid xunhe basin the results identified by two performance metrics are similar except that the soilevap all and soilevap topmodel options are identified by mae but only soilevap topmodel is selected by wmae for soil evaporation process the base linear analytic is excluded in quickflow process after the identifying procedure under two versions of the performance metric the quickflow shows absolute dominance all the time and the sensitivities of other processes are also dynamically changing however the sensitivities of other processes are small all the time wmae may extract more useful information especially for the identification of hydrological processes which have temporal influence on hydrograph thus the process identifiability is low under both mae and wmae in the xunhe basin there are 108 3 2 2 3 3 and 54 3 2 1 3 3 possible models in the blended model identified by mae and wmae respectively in the semiarid wudinghe basin quickflow and soil evaporation have high identifiability base vic and soilevap topmodel are identified as the only posterior structure for quickflow and soil evaporation processes respectively inf vic arno and base topmodel appear in the posterior structures identified by mae but not in the results identified by wmae there are ultimately 27 3 1 1 3 3 and 12 2 1 1 2 3 possible models in the identified blended models of the wudinghe basin under mae and wmae respectively overall the process option ranges constrained by wmae are smaller than mae from the aspect of structures identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics quickflow and soil evaporation processes are more identifiable followed by infiltration and baseflow processes snow balance process has the lowest identifiability the hydrological processes with higher sensitivity are easier to identify than other processes besides the identifiability result shows that the appropriate model structures in the xunhe basin are more than the other two basins it is noted that the runoff coefficients are 0 21 0 43 and 0 11 in the tongthanhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively which indicates that the xunhe basin has the wettest climatic conditions most literature has concluded that models are more likely to obtain satisfied runoff simulations in the humid basins than in arid areas clark et al 2008 knoben et al 2020 which may explain why more models are appropriate in the xunhe basin 4 4 model performance parameters are sampled by latin hypercube sampling 32 768 times for running the original blended model two identified blended models under conventional performance metric mae and sensitivity weighted performance metrics wmae and a conventional structure fixed hydrological model hmets sorted by mae the best 1 simulation results of each model are selected into the ensemble for model performance comparison fig 7 shows the performance of blended models and the hmets model in the three studied basins compared with the original blended model yellow boxes the blended model identified by mae blue boxes improves runoff simulations from the aspect of most performance criteria except the nselog in the xunhe basin however the blended model identified by wmae purple boxes can further improve the simulation compared with the model selected by mae all the performance indicators have been improved when identified by wmae in the tongtianhe basin in the xunhe basin the superiority of models identified by wmae is especially obvious in the validation period all the models lack satisfactory performance in the wudinghe basin while the model identified by wmae still works better a smaller sampling space of hydrological process options in the blended model identified by wmae helps enhance the efficiency of sampling and then bring a better simulation in the real basins the original blended model in this study includes a conventional structure fixed hydrological model hmets here the hydrological model hmets is applied to compare with blended models as shown in fig 7 the red boxes represent the performance of hmets in the tongtianhe basin hmets performs better than original used blended model and worse than both the posterior blended models under mae and wmae however the hmets model is even inferior to the original used blended models in the xunhe from aspects of all the performance metrics and in the wudinghe basins from the aspect of nse the performance ranking order of each blended model is almost same in the studied basins the blended model identified by wmae outperforms that identified by mae whereas the latter is superior to the original used blended model except the nselog in the xunhe basin the performance ranking of the hmets model varies with basins which is consistent with previous conclusions that one size fits all models are hard to find coxon et al 2014 van esse et al 2013 in addition all models tend to achieve better performance in the tongthanhe and xunhe basins than in the wudinghe basin the wudinghe basin is located in a semi arid region with mean annual precipitation of 401 mm the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1077 mm hydrological simulation in semi arid and arid areas is still one of the difficult problems in the hydrology field besides the catchment conditions of the wudinghe basin are significantly influenced by human activities the soil and water conservation measures such as the construction of the check dams and afforestation have changed the underlying surface and the rainfall runoff relationship since the 1960 s deng et al 2016 tian et al 2019 zhang and liu 2021 thus the poor performance in the wudinghe basin could be partly attributed to the unclear and non stationary mechanism of the rainfall runoff relationship the limited structure options in the selected prior model could be another reason for the bad runoff simulations although the sensitivity weighted performance metrics identify superior process structures the effectiveness of the identified posterior models may be restricted if the appropriate structures are not included in the prior flexible model extending structure options of each hydrological process in the blended model is one of the methods to improve the simulation meanwhile a more abundant process option space in the blended model will be followed by more parameters to be analyzed and then need increased computational resources thus the prior process structures used in the blended deserve further investigation and selection however the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior has been proved effective in identifying acceptable structures by reducing search domain of hydrological process structures 5 conclusions the use of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior to construct sensitivity weighted performance metrics to identify process structures has not been discussed in the previous literature this study aims to identify appropriate structures of hydrological processes by considering relative influence in order to ensure individual hydrological processes can be researched separately a blended model with process options and parameter values being integer and continuous decision variables is used a synthetic experiment is designed to evaluate impacts of temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on the structure identification three real case studies tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins are conducted to explore the structure identification of hydrological processes the following conclusions are obtained 1 the synthetic experiment demonstrates that the sensitivity weighted mean absolute error improves structure identifiability of hydrological processes by considering the temporal relative influence of hydrological processes on model behavior especially for hydrological processes that the temporal influence significantly changes the process options constrained by sensitivity weighted performance metrics are smaller than that under conventional performance metric which does not make use of sensitivity information 2 the quickflow and soil evaporation processes have high identifiability followed by infiltration baseflow and snow balance processes in the real world examples by combinations 2 54 and 12 models can be formed in the posterior blended models identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics in the tongtianhe xunhe and wudinghe basins respectively 3 the model identified by sensitivity weighted performance metrics is more efficient than that identified by conventional performance metrics in discharge simulations in the three studied basins with varied climatic conditions the blended model identified by conventional performance metrics outperforms the original blended model except evaluated by the nselog in the xunhe basin and the conventional fixed structure model hmets nevertheless the structure identification using sensitivity weighted performance metrics provides the most outstanding model configurations among all the blended models and the hmets model this study aims to identify structures of hydrological processes more effectively based on temporal sensitivity further work will focus on exploring the patterns of hydrological process structure for a large sample of watersheds credit authorship

2601,the optimal implementation of low impact development lid practices remains an open research issue multiobjective optimization moo based on physically based models facilitates lid sizing but requires large computational budgets we developed and validated a surrogate moo framework based on machine learning ml models to obtain satisfactory optimal solutions with an affordable computational cost first a calibrated and validated storm water management model swmm was driven by a 2 year 120 min chicago pattern storm with random lid areas for generating 10 000 samples second ml models including multiple linear regression mlr generalized regression neural network grnn and backpropagation neural network bpnn were trained and validated to predict catchment total outflow cto and catchment peak outflow cpo third using the outperformed ml models as surrogates the lid areas were optimized by non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii to minimize construction costs cto and cpo the results obtained for an urban catchment in fengxi china demonstrated that 1 bpnn outperformed mlr and grnn in terms of accuracy while the training time 40 min was 6857 times and 706 times that of mlr 0 35 s and grnn 3 4 s models respectively 2 the optimization process using bpnn models as surrogates converged well indicating the efficiency of the proposed framework 3 under the marginal effect the permeable pavement was identified as the leading practice for most pareto solutions followed by bioretention cell and green roof moreover a subcatchment with a higher runoff coefficient was deemed preferable for lid implementation 4 outflow reduction by the lids was significant cto and cpo were reduced by 28 6 56 9 and 27 5 48 3 respectively but negligible for retarding the time of cpo 5 the optimization time was reduced by 95 82 using the surrogate based moo instead of the swmm based model when the training time of the bpnn models was ignored this study provides insights into the

the supplementary data 1 introduction storms are a risk factor in urban areas growing problems of waterlogging pollution and degraded ecosystems in numerous cities have raised concerns about stormwater management the decreasing permeable ground and increasing extreme rainfall are probable reasons for these problems recent research suggests that the interaction of green and gray infrastructures can effectively control stormwater low impact development practices lids such as retention based green roof gr infiltration based porous pavement pp or permeable pavement and bioretention cells bc or rain garden jefferson et al 2017 kuller et al 2017 have been implemented in several urban catchments to mitigate storm related problems yang 2017 spatial allocation e g selecting placing and sizing of lids to meet design criteria remains a significant challenge yu et al 2022 which is commonly solved using spatial multicriteria analysis or scenario analysis based on hydrological models however near optimal solutions can be obtained only when the scenarios are representative luan et al 2019 in contrast combining multiobjective optimization moo with hydrologic models can obtain the global optimum and handle intensive calculations zhang and chui 2018 for example a compact optimization software called the system for urban stormwater treatment and analysis integration integrates a cost analysis module the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii and the storm water management model swmm a widely used open source and user friendly lid module dong et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however in the case of large catchments simplification is required owing to the high computational burden and memory requirements swmm ostrich macro et al 2019 provides optimal lid allocation solutions with a large selection of algorithms and can easily meet the requirements of engineers nonetheless modifying and improving these tools is challenging owing to their low flexibility and transferability consequently some physically based model algorithm tools that integrate hydrodynamic models with search algorithms have been developed for optimal lid allocation popular algorithms include nsga ii alamdari and sample 2019 yang et al 2019 the third evolution step of generalized differential evolution li et al 2022 borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm eckart et al 2018 piscopo et al 2021 multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm liu et al 2019 simulated annealing huang et al 2018 particle swarm duan et al 2016 and pattern search baek et al 2015 some search algorithms perform better than others in specific cases for example the marginal cost based greedy strategy outperforms nsga ii in terms of computational efficiency and convergence for lid allocation as it requires fewer iterations for searching and the current optimal solution always covers previous ones xu et al 2018 however the method is challenging to operate when there are numerous candidate lids and suitable sites the search algorithms can be more advanced and efficient nonetheless physically based model algorithm methods are time consuming and computation intensive because of the massive objective evaluations a single run of a physically based model for calculating objectives often requires minutes hours days or even months and the search process involves vast iterations executing numerous objective calculations although valuable the tools above incur considerable computational costs thus surrogate models also known as metamodels with sufficient details satisfactory accuracy and higher speed have been used to efficiently substitute parts or all of the physically based models broad et al 2015 gong et al 2016 lu et al 2019 there are two types of surrogate models lower fidelity physically based surrogates which lower the resolution of the inputs outputs or internal processes of the original model and response surface surrogates also known as statistical models which replace the computationally expensive components of the original model with faster alternatives razavi et al 2012b the former relies on strict assumptions whereas the latter maintains the original model s resolution but is more independent however it is challenging to train and validate response surface surrogates and their estimates can be uncertain in the case of highly complex response surfaces razavi et al 2021 surrogate modeling using supervised machine learning ml methods for water related problems has increased bermúdez et al 2018 razavi et al 2012a zounemat kermani et al 2021 such as kriging brunetti et al 2017 and multiple layer perceptron cui et al 2022 gu et al 2020 latifi et al 2019 raei et al 2019 saadatpour et al 2020 however previous studies have seldom developed and tested ml based surrogate models over swmm simulations to optimally size lids i e optimize the surface area multiple linear regression mlr jato espino et al 2018 is easy to use but unlikely to handle high dimensional problems generalized regression neural network grnn seyedashraf et al 2021 has a simple structure of neural networks and calculates fast but it seems unsuitable for cases with vast samples backpropagation neural network bpnn huang et al 2015 performs well in various fields but the training and testing may be complicated these methods have strong potential to be used with swmm to size lids for outflow capture in urban catchments in this work surrogate models are developed using mlr grnn and bpnn the best surrogate is then incorporated into nsga ii as lumped simulators to determine the areas of gr pp and bc in each subcatchment the proposed framework is applied to a small urban catchment simultaneously considering objectives of construction costs catchment total outflow and catchment peak outflow 2 study area the weihe river no 8 system zone wr8 0 8453 km2 fig 1 d is an urban catchment located in the sponge city construction pilot region http ecohydrology ihp org demosites view 1220 fig 1c of fengxi new city fig 1b in shaanxi province china fig 1a its average annual precipitation is 552 0 mm and rainfall from july to september accounts for 50 60 annual amount this region covers a layer of non self weight collapsible loess with an elevation of 380 5 384 3 m since 2013 the pilot region has been constructed using a lid based stormwater management system the land use types include park greenspaces 25 5 residential land 16 0 transportation land 11 8 educational facilities 4 6 industrial land 1 2 and undeveloped space 40 9 specifically gr pp and bc have been widely implemented because they are most suitable for local conditions and most effective for runoff capture yang et al 2021 3 methods the inputs and outputs of surrogate models on an urban drainage system are usually decision and problem specific state variables such as catchment total outflow cto i e runoff volume m3 and catchment peak outflow cpo i e peak flow m3 s giacomoni and joseph 2017 a surrogate based moo framework was developed using ml models to size the lids fig 2 this consists of three parts 1 lid ratios i e the ratio of a lid area to its feasible area in a subcatchment were generated within specified lower and upper boundaries to calculate lid areas thus creating input files for swmm swmm was then executed to simulate the catchment outflow time series thereby calculating the cto and cpo the construction costs of these lids were also calculated thus a set of lid ratio and their corresponding costs cto and cpo were concatenated as samples 2 these samples were used to train validate and test the ml models to predict cto and cpo performances of the ml models were evaluated and the best models were selected for surrogating cto and cpo in the optimization process 3 the surrogate based moo model was solved using nsga ii to obtain pareto solutions of the lid ratios furthermore the optimization results and framework efficiency were analyzed 3 1 storm water management model swmm is a widely used semi distributed hydrologic hydraulic model for urban catchments alamdari et al 2017 rossman 2015 as the model does not directly support matlab this study employed the matswmm toolbox developed by riaño briceño et al 2016 which is an alternative for simulating stormflow dynamics in sewer networks and on overland surfaces the model utilized the 120 minute chicago approach synthetic storm event with a time to peak ratio of 0 35 a 2 year return period and a time step of 1 min as forcing data yang et al 2021 the model generalized the study area into one outfall 21 conduits 21 junctions and nine non uniform subcatchments table s1 summarizes the swmm parameters of gr pp and bc the catchment outflow time series retrieved from the swmm simulations were used to calculate the cto and cpo 1 cto t 1 t q t δ t 2 cpo max t t q t where δ t t and t denote the time step 1 min step number and number of steps i e the modeling last three days respectively q t is the average outflow rate of the catchment at t t h time step m3 s 3 2 multiobjective optimization because waterlogging is the biggest concern in wr8 three conflicting objective functions were used to trade off the construction costs of the lids cto and cpo 3 min f x x d c o s t x c t o x c p o x 4 x x 1 x 2 x j x n l i d 4 cost x j n l i d c j x j s j where x is a row vector of the decision variables corresponding to lid ratios x j denotes the ratio of the j t h lid area to the allowable area for that type in the corresponding subcatchment s j n l i d is the number of lids in the catchment and c j is the unit price of the j t h lid the feasible region d for the decision variables is between the lower and upper boundaries 6 l b x u b the available area for installing a lid within a subcatchment is limited by the lid restrictions and field conditions eckart et al 2017 table 1 for more details on the estimation method refer to xu et al 2018a in terms of search nsga ii is a robust extensively used and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm because of its high performance on moo problems deb et al 2002 liu et al 2020 and has proven to be effective in many water related studies specifically the gamultiobj function in matlab which uses a variant of nsga ii was employed table s2 all computations were run with one thread on a personal computer with an intel core i7 11700 cpu 2 50 ghz and 16 gb of ram 3 3 sampling algorithm performance of ml models improves with the number of training samples which mainly varies between 1000 and 10 000 garzón et al 2022 algorithm 1 was used to generate 10 000 samples fig 3 four types of points exist owing to different space filling designs linearly spaced 1000 points 1000 random points generated uniformly 4000 random points generated using latin hypercube sampling lu et al 2022 regis and shoemaker 2007 zhang et al 2019 and 4000 random points stratified by 20 folds where each is generated using latin hypercube sampling subsequently a random non stratified partition was used on the 10 000 data points dividing them into a training set and a test holdout set with a training ratio of 0 7 i e 7000 and 3000 samples were used to train and test the ml models respectively the symbols for the algorithm are as follows inp is a class containing a template input file of the swmm n l i d n s u b and n s a m are the number of lids in the catchment subcatchments and samples respectively x j k is the lid ratio of j th lids for sample k l b and u b are n l i d by 1 row vectors of the lower and upper

less data intensive ml models mlr grnn and bpnn than swmm were trained validated and tested on the samples to select the best surrogate models for the following optimization note that the predictor was lid ratios and the predictands were cto or cpo 3 4 1 multiple linear regression the mlr is a simple and interpretable model that can predict the dependent variables based on the independent variables its general expression jato espino et al 2018 is 7 y α j 1 n l i d β j a j ε where y is the predictand i e the cto or cpo a j is the area of the j t h lids n l i d represents the number of lids α β j and ε are the regression constant residuals and coefficient estimate respectively the least squares method was used to deduce the regression model 3 4 2 generalized regression neural network the grnn is a radial network with a feedforward architecture which is widely used in runoff forecasting because of its robust nonlinear mapping ability owing to non parametric regression and output calculation according to the maximum probability principle specht 1991 its training is faster than that of multiple layer perceptron although the accuracy may be slightly lower seyedashraf et al 2021 two grnn models for the cto and cpo were built separately the numbers of neurons in the input pattern summation and output layers were 27 7000 1 and 1 respectively fig s1 these models were not sensitive to the spread i e smoothing factor of radial functions σ in our experiment the generalization errors were identical irrespective of the spread value of grnn thus the spread was set to 1 3 4 3 backpropagation neural network bpnn is a widely used artificial neural network that contains a feedforward network and backward error propagation and has performed well in various fields of hydrology it minimizes the mean squared error of the output with the s type function an activation function and least squares algorithm the steps to obtain the best bpnn model for cto or cpo are as follows 1 a trial and error approach berkhahn et al 2019 was used to determine the hyperparameters bpnn models with one hidden layer were developed 30 times each with 1 to 30 sigmoid neurons in the hidden layer 2 each model was trained 100 times using the levenberg marquardt algorithm abba et al 2020 with the following parameters maximum number of epochs to train 1000 maximum time to train infinite and minimum error 10 7 3 the generated 3000 bpnn models were compared based on the root mean square error rmse eq 10 thus the hidden layer sizes of the best bpnn models for cto and cpo were determined to be 21 fig 4 the architectures of the bpnn model for predicting the cto and cpo are plotted in fig s2 3 4 4 performance criteria prediction accuracy and computational speed of the ml models were quantified for performance assessment the former was evaluated using the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape rmse determination coefficient dc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias ahmadisharaf et al 2019 moriasi et al 2015 the mae mape and rmse values range from 0 to with smaller values indicating good performance the nse ranges from to 1 and a larger value denotes better agreement e g a value of 1 indicates a perfect prediction the pbias varies from to where values near zero indicate good performance song et al 2022 the error metrics

k 4 results and discussion this section evaluates the performance of ml models analyzes the cost effectiveness of pareto solutions and discusses computational efficiency 4 1 machine learning model performance to analyze the errors of the ml models in predicting cto and cpo we plotted their raw residuals calculated by swmm minus fitted values from an ml model on the test set fig 5 fig 5 shows that mlr models predicted well with small outflows grnn models predicted bad with middle outflows and bpnn models performed well for all outflows for bpnn the residuals were between 60 84 and 74 26 m3 cto and 0 03 and 0 03 m3 s cpo and the maximum percentage errors were 0 74 cto and 1 15 cpo this may be attributed to the great capability of bpnn models for solving nonlinear approximation and high dimensional problems the training and generalization errors of the ml models are listed in table 2 for training performance of the grnn models was the best followed by the bpnn models and finally the mlr models for testing performance of the bpnn models was the best followed by the mlr and grnn models the bpnn model outperformed in cto and cpo prediction whereas the mlr and grnn models equally underperformed in summary the bpnn models exhibited the best robustness and generalization ability among the ml models however training time of the bpnn model 2400 s was 6857 times that of the mlr model 0 35 s and 706 times that of the grnn model 3 4 s the computational time of bpnn is challenging due to its complex structure fig s2 on vast training samples the time is highly affected by both sample numbers and hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers and loops regardless the moo used bpnn models as surrogates to estimate cto and cpo 4 2 cost effectiveness of pareto solutions hypervolume is one of the best indicators for assessing the convergence of the optimization process for a moo problem and denotes the volume of the objective space enveloped by the front with a reference point the hypervolume values in our study generally increased with increasing generations fig 6 implying good convergence of the optimization process the pareto front of the moo model fig 7 contained 350 non dominated solutions as the population size and pareto fraction were set table s2 to 1000 and 0 35 respectively the cost ranged from 2 22 107 to 1 44 108 cny the cto varied from 7702 96 to 12795 04 m3 the cpo ranged from 2 76 to 3 89 m3 s the parallel axis plot fig 7b was used to understand the tradeoffs between the above objectives therefore any optimal solution could be selected based on the decision maker s preferences to arrange the areas of the lids values of the decision variables for the pareto solutions fig 8 indicate that in most subcatchments pp black dots has the largest lid ratios followed by bc magenta dots and finally gr green dots in most cases pp was the most efficient lid for outflow reduction regardless of the construction cost as the costs increased more pp was implemented until its lid ratio nonmonotonically approximated 100 subsequently bc and gr started to proliferate because the feasible area for building pp became zero from this point bc was prior to gr in most subcatchments which can be explained similarly ratio of the total lid area within a subcatchment to the subcatchment area referred to as the lid fraction for pareto solutions varied from 0 027 to 0 719 fig s4 subcatchments 3 and 5 had larger lid fractions indicating that they were preferred candidates for lid implementation in their feasible areas correlation coefficients between lid fractions of the subcatchments and their runoff coefficients for the pareto solutions ranged from 0 21 to 0 928 fig 9 for half of the pareto solutions the coefficients were 0 5 indicating strong correlations and suggesting that lids were preferable in subcatchments with larger runoff coefficients this finding is consistent with that of liang et al 2019 which confirms that the optimal area of the lids strongly correlates with the impervious area ratio outflow hydrographs of four specific scenarios for sizing lids i e solutions without lids pareto solution with the lowest cost pareto solution with the highest cost and solution with full lids were plotted following the swmm simulations fig 10 cto and cpo of the pareto solutions were reduced by 28 6 56 9 and 27 5 48 3 than those without lids respectively however the appearance time of peak outflow did not change significantly regardless of the lid ratios or lid fractions suggesting that the combined application of gr pp and bc can significantly reduce the outflow volume and peak flow rate but can rarely retard the outflow under the design storm this finding is consistent with the results of palla and gnecco 2015 and yang et al 2021 furthermore marginal effects were observed on the cost and cto cpo for the pareto solutions fig 11 the two concave curves displayed the law of increasing marginal costs and points of diminishing returns slowdowns in the dropping rates of cto and cpo were evident on the lines when the cost rose to 4 20 107 cny moreover cpo declined before the cost reached 1 23 108 cny but increased afterward this phenomenon agrees with the results observed in previous studies fry and maxwell 2017 kumar et al 2022 liu et al 2016 implying that the cost effectiveness of lids decreases once the most cost efficient lids are completely implemented on feasible sites 4 3 computational efficiency performance of the bpnn models in predicting the cto and cpo was validated in section 4 1 and their residuals in pareto solutions were further checked fig 12 the residuals of cto ranged from 25 10 to 54 9 m3 those of cpo ranged from 0 042 to 0 012 m3 s and the maximum percentage errors of cto and cpo were 0 27 and 0 22 respectively therefore the pareto solutions of the bpnn based moo were acceptable although the errors predicted by bpnn models may be an issue for future research the runtime of an objective function with surrogates i e using bpnn models to predict cto and cpo is 0 2 0 3 s and 2 4 s with a swmm simulation i e the time to make a sample using algorithm 1 the objective function ran 249 000 times as the surrogate based moo stopped at 249 generations with each generation having a population size of 1000 thus the proposed framework reduced its elapsed time because it ran the swmm 10 000 times to create samples whereas an swmm based optimization i e the objective function calculates cto and cpo by swmm simulations requires 249 000 swmm simulations therefore we can infer that when not considering the learning time of surrogates their operation time drops to 4 28 of that of swmm based optimization this justifies the use of surrogate models for optimally sizing the lids 4 4 guidelines existing programs in cities similar to our demo site can benefit from our research such as weinan baoji tongchuan pingliang qingyang tianshui lanzhou guyuan and yinchuan we also believe our framework can be adapted for other areas on the other hand urban planners engineers and others may benefit from three aspects constructing bpnn models without researching other two ml models implementing the lids following principles obtained from our conclusions on the cost effectiveness of pareto solutions modifying the proposed framework to solve various lids related and storm related problems the matlab codes for this study have been offered to the supplementary data still many considerations must be taken when applying the proposed framework for example the generalization of the drainage network the attributes and numbers of lids the applicability of methods used in the swmm model and the calibration approach hyperparameters of surrogates and nsga ii 5 conclusions we proposed and validated a surrogate based moo framework to size the lids within each subcatchment to minimize the construction cost cto and cpo we conclude that 1 bpnn models outperformed mlr and grnn in predicting cto and cpo and had the best robustness and generalization abilities while being more time consuming 2 the optimization process using bpnn models to surrogate cto and cpo converged well indicating that they can replace the swmm model for satisfactory prediction 3 for most pareto solutions pp was preferred to bc and gr for outflow reduction and a subcatchment with a larger runoff coefficient was preferable for implementing lids 4 pareto solutions with marginal effects significantly reduced but rarely retarded outflows 5 optimal solutions can be effectively and efficiently obtained using the nsga ii with surrogate models based on bpnn models this study demonstrates that surrogate based moo excelled in sizing lids future studies can be conducted on 1 exploring surrogate resets e g by dynamic training to ensure that the search points are tightly clustered around the incumbent as the bpnn models were not iteratively updated during the search in this study 2 evaluating the efficiency ease of development robustness and explainability of ml and moo models 3 investigating the sources of model uncertainty which may derive from the input data structure and parameters for example parameters of lids for swmm samples and hyperparameters for bpnn and parameters of nsga ii 4 perfecting the design of decision variables and objectives of moo models by considering other

integration integrates a cost analysis module the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii and the storm water management model swmm a widely used open source and user friendly lid module dong et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however in the case of large catchments simplification is required owing to the high computational burden and memory requirements swmm ostrich macro et al 2019 provides optimal lid allocation solutions with a large selection of algorithms and can easily meet the requirements of engineers nonetheless modifying and improving these tools is challenging owing to their low flexibility and transferability consequently some physically based model algorithm tools that integrate hydrodynamic models with search algorithms have been developed for optimal lid allocation popular algorithms include nsga ii alamdari and sample 2019 yang et al 2019 the third evolution step of generalized differential evolution li et al 2022 borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm eckart et al 2018 piscopo et al 2021 multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm liu et al 2019 simulated annealing huang et al 2018 particle swarm duan et al 2016 and pattern search baek et al 2015 some search algorithms perform better than others in specific cases for example the marginal cost based greedy strategy outperforms nsga ii in terms of computational efficiency and convergence for lid allocation as it requires fewer iterations for searching and the current optimal solution always covers previous ones xu et al 2018 however the method is challenging to operate when there are numerous candidate lids and suitable sites the search algorithms can be more advanced and efficient nonetheless physically based model algorithm methods are time consuming and computation intensive because of the massive objective evaluations a single run of a physically based model for calculating objectives often requires minutes hours days or even months and the search process involves vast iterations executing numerous objective calculations although valuable the tools above incur considerable computational costs thus surrogate models also known as metamodels with sufficient details satisfactory accuracy and higher speed have been used to efficiently substitute parts or all of the physically based models broad et al 2015 gong et al 2016 lu et al 2019 there are two types of surrogate models lower fidelity physically based surrogates which lower the resolution of the inputs outputs or internal processes of the original model and response surface surrogates also known as statistical models which replace the computationally expensive components of the original model with faster alternatives razavi et al 2012b the former relies on strict assumptions whereas the latter maintains the original model s resolution but is more independent however it is challenging to train and validate response surface surrogates and their estimates can be uncertain in the case of highly complex response surfaces razavi et al 2021 surrogate modeling using supervised machine learning ml methods for water related problems has increased bermúdez et al 2018 razavi et al 2012a zounemat kermani et al 2021 such as kriging brunetti et al 2017 and multiple layer perceptron cui et al 2022 gu et al 2020 latifi et al 2019 raei et al 2019 saadatpour et al 2020 however previous studies have seldom developed and tested ml based surrogate models over swmm simulations to optimally size lids i e optimize the surface area multiple linear regression mlr jato espino et al 2018 is easy to use but unlikely to handle high dimensional problems generalized regression neural network grnn seyedashraf et al 2021 has a simple structure of neural networks and calculates fast but it seems unsuitable for cases with vast samples backpropagation neural network bpnn huang et al 2015 performs well in various fields but the training and testing may be complicated these methods have strong potential to be used with swmm to size lids for outflow capture in urban catchments in this work surrogate models are developed using mlr grnn and bpnn the best surrogate is then incorporated into nsga ii as lumped simulators to determine the areas of gr pp and bc in each subcatchment the proposed framework is applied to a small urban catchment simultaneously considering objectives of construction costs catchment total outflow and catchment peak outflow 2 study area the weihe river no 8 system zone wr8 0 8453 km2 fig 1 d is an urban catchment located in the sponge city construction pilot region http ecohydrology ihp org demosites view 1220 fig 1c of fengxi new city fig 1b in shaanxi province china fig 1a its average annual precipitation is 552 0 mm and rainfall from july to september accounts for 50 60 annual amount this region covers a layer of non self weight collapsible loess with an elevation of 380 5 384 3 m since 2013 the pilot region has been constructed using a lid based stormwater management system the land use types include park greenspaces 25 5 residential land 16 0 transportation land 11 8 educational facilities 4 6 industrial land 1 2 and undeveloped space 40 9 specifically gr pp and bc have been widely implemented because they are most suitable for local conditions and most effective for runoff capture yang et al 2021 3 methods the inputs and outputs of surrogate models on an urban drainage system are usually decision and problem specific state variables such as catchment total outflow cto i e runoff volume m3 and catchment peak outflow cpo i e peak flow m3 s giacomoni and joseph 2017 a surrogate based moo framework was developed using ml models to size the lids fig 2 this consists of three parts 1 lid ratios i e the ratio of a lid area to its feasible area in a subcatchment were generated within specified lower and upper boundaries to calculate lid areas thus creating input files for swmm swmm was then executed to simulate the catchment outflow time series thereby calculating the cto and cpo the construction costs of these lids were also calculated thus a set of lid ratio and their corresponding costs cto and cpo were concatenated as samples 2 these samples were used to train validate and test the ml models to predict cto and cpo performances of the ml models were evaluated and the best models were selected for surrogating cto and cpo in the optimization process 3 the surrogate based moo model was solved using nsga ii to obtain pareto solutions of the lid ratios furthermore the optimization results and framework efficiency were analyzed 3 1 storm water management model swmm is a widely used semi distributed hydrologic hydraulic model for urban catchments alamdari et al 2017 rossman 2015 as the model does not directly support matlab this study employed the matswmm toolbox developed by riaño briceño et al 2016 which is an alternative for simulating stormflow dynamics in sewer networks and on overland surfaces the model utilized the 120 minute chicago approach synthetic storm event with a time to peak ratio of 0 35 a 2 year return period and a time step of 1 min as forcing data yang et al 2021 the model generalized the study area into one outfall 21 conduits 21 junctions and nine non uniform subcatchments table s1 summarizes the swmm parameters of gr pp and bc the catchment outflow time series retrieved from the swmm simulations were used to calculate the cto and cpo 1 cto t 1 t q t δ t 2 cpo max t t q t where δ t t and t denote the time step 1 min step number and number of steps i e the modeling last three days respectively q t is the average outflow rate of the catchment at t t h time step m3 s 3 2 multiobjective optimization because waterlogging is the biggest concern in wr8 three conflicting objective functions were used to trade off the construction costs of the lids cto and cpo 3 min f x x d c o s t x c t o x c p o x 4 x x 1 x 2 x j x n l i d 4 cost x j n l i d c j x j s j where x is a row vector of the decision variables corresponding to lid ratios x j denotes the ratio of the j t h lid area to the allowable area for that type in the corresponding subcatchment s j n l i d is the number of lids in the catchment and c j is the unit price of the j t h lid the feasible region d for the decision variables is between the lower and upper boundaries 6 l b x u b the available area for installing a lid within a subcatchment is limited by the lid restrictions and field conditions eckart et al 2017 table 1 for more details on the estimation method refer to xu et al 2018a in terms of search nsga ii is a robust extensively used and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm because of its high performance on moo problems deb et al 2002 liu et al 2020 and has proven to be effective in many water related studies specifically the gamultiobj function in matlab which uses a variant of nsga ii was employed table s2 all computations were run with one thread on a personal computer with an intel core i7 11700 cpu 2 50 ghz and 16 gb of ram 3 3 sampling algorithm performance of ml models improves with the number of training samples which mainly varies between 1000 and 10 000 garzón et al 2022 algorithm 1 was used to generate 10 000 samples fig 3 four types of points exist owing to different space filling designs linearly spaced 1000 points 1000 random points generated uniformly 4000 random points generated using latin hypercube sampling lu et al 2022 regis and shoemaker 2007 zhang et al 2019 and 4000 random points stratified by 20 folds where each is generated using latin hypercube sampling subsequently a random non stratified partition was used on the 10 000 data points dividing them into a training set and a test holdout set with a training ratio of 0 7 i e 7000 and 3000 samples were used to train and test the ml models respectively the symbols for the algorithm are as follows inp is a class containing a template input file of the swmm n l i d n s u b and n s a m are the number of lids in the catchment subcatchments and samples respectively x j k is the lid ratio of j th lids for sample k l b and u b are n l i d by 1 row vectors of the lower and upper

less data intensive ml models mlr grnn and bpnn than swmm were trained validated and tested on the samples to select the best surrogate models for the following optimization note that the predictor was lid ratios and the predictands were cto or cpo 3 4 1 multiple linear regression the mlr is a simple and interpretable model that can predict the dependent variables based on the independent variables its general expression jato espino et al 2018 is 7 y α j 1 n l i d β j a j ε where y is the predictand i e the cto or cpo a j is the area of the j t h lids n l i d represents the number of lids α β j and ε are the regression constant residuals and coefficient estimate respectively the least squares method was used to deduce the regression model 3 4 2 generalized regression neural network the grnn is a radial network with a feedforward architecture which is widely used in runoff forecasting because of its robust nonlinear mapping ability owing to non parametric regression and output calculation according to the maximum probability principle specht 1991 its training is faster than that of multiple layer perceptron although the accuracy may be slightly lower seyedashraf et al 2021 two grnn models for the cto and cpo were built separately the numbers of neurons in the input pattern summation and output layers were 27 7000 1 and 1 respectively fig s1 these models were not sensitive to the spread i e smoothing factor of radial functions σ in our experiment the generalization errors were identical irrespective of the spread value of grnn thus the spread was set to 1 3 4 3 backpropagation neural network bpnn is a widely used artificial neural network that contains a feedforward network and backward error propagation and has performed well in various fields of hydrology it minimizes the mean squared error of the output with the s type function an activation function and least squares algorithm the steps to obtain the best bpnn model for cto or cpo are as follows 1 a trial and error approach berkhahn et al 2019 was used to determine the hyperparameters bpnn models with one hidden layer were developed 30 times each with 1 to 30 sigmoid neurons in the hidden layer 2 each model was trained 100 times using the levenberg marquardt algorithm abba et al 2020 with the following parameters maximum number of epochs to train 1000 maximum time to train infinite and minimum error 10 7 3 the generated 3000 bpnn models were compared based on the root mean square error rmse eq 10 thus the hidden layer sizes of the best bpnn models for cto and cpo were determined to be 21 fig 4 the architectures of the bpnn model for predicting the cto and cpo are plotted in fig s2 3 4 4 performance criteria prediction accuracy and computational speed of the ml models were quantified for performance assessment the former was evaluated using the mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape rmse determination coefficient dc nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias ahmadisharaf et al 2019 moriasi et al 2015 the mae mape and rmse values range from 0 to with smaller values indicating good performance the nse ranges from to 1

k 4 results and discussion this section evaluates the performance of ml models analyzes the cost effectiveness of pareto solutions and discusses computational efficiency 4 1 machine learning model performance to analyze the errors of the ml models in predicting cto and cpo we plotted their raw residuals calculated by swmm minus fitted values from an ml model on the test set fig 5 fig 5 shows that mlr models predicted well with small outflows grnn models predicted bad with middle outflows and bpnn models performed well for all outflows for bpnn the residuals were between 60 84 and 74 26 m3 cto and 0 03 and 0 03 m3 s cpo and the maximum percentage errors were 0 74 cto and 1 15 cpo this may be attributed to the great capability of bpnn models for solving nonlinear approximation and high dimensional problems the training and generalization errors of the ml models are listed in table 2 for training performance of the grnn models was the best followed by the bpnn models and finally the mlr models for testing performance of the bpnn models was the best followed by the mlr and grnn models the bpnn model outperformed in cto and cpo prediction whereas the mlr and grnn models equally underperformed in summary the bpnn models exhibited the best robustness and generalization ability among the ml models however training time of the bpnn model 2400 s was 6857 times that of the mlr model 0 35 s and 706 times that of the grnn model 3 4 s the computational time of bpnn is challenging due to its complex structure fig s2 on vast training samples the time is highly affected by both sample numbers and hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers and loops regardless the moo used bpnn models as surrogates to estimate cto and cpo 4 2 cost effectiveness of pareto solutions hypervolume is one of the best indicators for assessing the convergence of the optimization process for a moo problem and denotes the volume of the objective space enveloped by the front with a reference point the hypervolume values in our study generally increased with increasing generations fig 6 implying good convergence of the optimization process the pareto front of the moo model fig 7 contained 350 non dominated solutions as the population size and pareto fraction were set table s2 to 1000 and 0 35 respectively the cost ranged from 2 22 107 to 1 44 108 cny the cto varied from 7702 96 to 12795 04 m3 the cpo ranged from 2 76 to 3 89 m3 s the parallel axis plot fig 7b was used to understand the tradeoffs between the above objectives therefore any optimal solution could be selected based on the decision maker s preferences to arrange the areas of the lids values of the decision variables for the pareto solutions fig 8 indicate that in most subcatchments pp black dots has the largest lid ratios followed by bc magenta dots and finally gr green dots in most cases pp was the most efficient lid for outflow reduction regardless of the construction cost as the costs increased more pp was implemented until its lid ratio nonmonotonically approximated 100 subsequently bc and gr started to proliferate because the feasible area for building pp became zero from this point bc was prior to gr in most subcatchments which can be explained similarly ratio of the total lid area within a subcatchment to the subcatchment area referred to as the lid fraction for pareto solutions varied from 0 027 to 0 719 fig s4 subcatchments 3 and 5 had larger lid fractions indicating that they were preferred candidates for lid implementation in their feasible areas correlation coefficients between lid fractions of the subcatchments and their runoff coefficients for the pareto solutions ranged from 0 21 to 0 928 fig 9 for half of the pareto solutions the coefficients were 0 5 indicating strong correlations and suggesting that lids were preferable in subcatchments with larger runoff coefficients this finding is consistent with that of liang et al 2019 which confirms that the optimal area of the lids strongly correlates with the impervious area ratio outflow hydrographs of four specific scenarios for sizing lids i e solutions without lids pareto solution with the lowest cost pareto solution with the highest cost and solution with full lids were plotted following the swmm simulations fig 10 cto and cpo of the pareto solutions were reduced by 28 6 56 9 and 27 5 48 3 than those without lids respectively however the appearance time of peak outflow did not change significantly regardless of the lid ratios or lid fractions suggesting that the combined application of gr pp and bc can significantly reduce the outflow volume and peak flow rate but can rarely retard the outflow under the design storm this finding is consistent with the results of palla and gnecco 2015 and yang et al 2021 furthermore marginal effects were observed on the cost and cto cpo for the pareto solutions fig 11 the two concave curves displayed the law of increasing marginal costs and points of diminishing returns slowdowns in the dropping rates of cto and cpo were evident on the lines when the cost rose to 4 20 107 cny moreover cpo declined before the cost reached 1 23 108 cny but increased afterward this phenomenon agrees with the results observed in previous studies fry and maxwell 2017 kumar et al 2022 liu et al 2016 implying that the cost effectiveness of lids decreases once the most cost efficient lids are completely implemented on feasible sites 4 3 computational efficiency performance of the bpnn models in predicting the cto and cpo was validated in section 4 1 and their residuals in pareto solutions were further checked fig 12 the residuals of cto ranged from 25 10 to 54 9 m3 those of cpo ranged from 0 042 to 0 012 m3 s and the maximum percentage errors of cto and cpo were 0 27 and 0 22 respectively therefore the pareto solutions of the bpnn based moo were acceptable although the errors predicted by bpnn models may be an issue for future research the runtime of an objective function with surrogates i e using bpnn models to predict cto and cpo is 0 2 0 3 s and 2 4 s with a swmm simulation i e the time to make a sample using algorithm 1 the objective function ran 249 000 times as the surrogate based moo stopped at 249 generations with each generation having a population size of 1000 thus the proposed framework reduced its elapsed time because it ran the swmm 10 000 times to create samples whereas an swmm based optimization i e the objective function calculates cto and cpo by swmm simulations requires 249 000 swmm simulations therefore we can infer that when not considering the learning time of surrogates their operation time drops to 4 28 of that of swmm based optimization this justifies the use of surrogate models for optimally sizing the lids 4 4 guidelines existing programs in cities similar to our demo site can benefit from our research such as weinan baoji tongchuan pingliang qingyang tianshui lanzhou guyuan and yinchuan we also believe our framework can be adapted for other areas on the other hand urban planners engineers and others may benefit from three aspects constructing bpnn models without researching other two ml models implementing the lids following principles obtained from our conclusions on the cost effectiveness of pareto solutions modifying the proposed framework to solve various lids related and storm related problems the matlab codes for this study have been offered to the supplementary data still many considerations must be taken when applying the proposed framework for example the generalization of the drainage network the attributes and numbers of lids the applicability of methods used in the swmm model and the calibration approach hyperparameters of surrogates and nsga ii 5 conclusions we proposed and validated a surrogate based moo framework to size the lids within each subcatchment to minimize the construction cost cto and cpo we conclude that 1 bpnn models outperformed mlr and grnn in predicting cto and cpo and had the best robustness and generalization abilities while being more time consuming 2 the optimization process using bpnn models to surrogate cto and cpo converged well indicating that they can replace the swmm model for satisfactory prediction 3 for most pareto solutions pp was preferred to bc and gr for outflow reduction and a subcatchment with a larger runoff coefficient was preferable for implementing lids 4 pareto solutions with marginal effects significantly reduced but rarely retarded outflows 5 optimal solutions can be effectively and efficiently obtained using the nsga ii with surrogate models based on bpnn models this study demonstrates that surrogate based moo excelled in sizing lids future studies can be conducted on 1 exploring surrogate resets e g by dynamic training to ensure that the search points are tightly clustered around the incumbent as the bpnn models were not iteratively updated during the search in this study 2 evaluating the efficiency ease of development robustness and explainability of ml and moo models 3 investigating the sources of model uncertainty which may derive from the input data structure and parameters for example parameters of lids for swmm samples and hyperparameters for bpnn and parameters of nsga ii 4 perfecting the design of decision variables and objectives of moo models by considering other

2602,the focus of this paper is to establish a new general model framework considering both hydraulic fractures with finite conductivity and heterogeneous characteristics of multiple connected regions by using boundary element method with this framework we can calculate the pressure performance of any heterogeneous reservoir the innovation is that the complex fracture flow boundary shape and heterogeneous characteristics can be flexibly considered in the model transient pressure of fractured horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoir is obtained by using stehfest numerical inversion method subsequently this proposed regional heterogeneity model was validated by using numerical simulation methods the results show that the proposed heterogeneous model can be divided into five flow segments which are bilinear flow linear flow radial flow first boundary dominated flow and second boundary dominated flow however the research results show that the presence or absence of some flow sections is closely related to the regional permeability ratio and the regional storage capacity ratio as the two most important parameters of heterogeneous reservoir the permeability ratio and regional storage capacity of heterogeneous reservoir will have a huge impact on the pressure response and pressure field the sensitivity analysis shows that these two factors will lead to the deformation of the pressure field distribution and affect the flow characteristics and cause some flow segments to fail to appear the smaller the regional storage capacity ratio the deeper the v shape and the more fluid supplied from the outer zone to the inner zone this study also suggests that the fracture conductivity mainly affects the early flow characteristics and the smaller the conductivity the greater the pressure loss in addition irregular boundary will also cause important deformation of pressure field and the area size will affect the late flow characteristics and the smaller the area the greater the pressure loss the new semi analytical solutions can form a series of typical curves and be applied to the well test analysis of multi stage fracturing horizontal wells in heterogeneous and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs the findings of this study can help for better understanding of the influence of reservoir heterogeneity on pressure response and find some applications in well testing for inverse problems in heterogeneous reservoirs keywords pressure transient green s function boundary elements method irregular heterogeneous reservoirs fractured horizontal wells data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the shale oil and gas revolution has broken out in the united states it can be said that the outbreak of the shale oil and gas revolution has completely changed the energy pattern of the united states followed by china the shale gas revolution has broken out and is about to enter the shale oil era it is no exaggeration to say that the outbreak of shale oil and gas revolution will change the world energy pattern wang et al 2018a at present tight reservoir development technology mainly includes horizontal well and multi stage fracturing technology so as to obtain relatively high production many scholars have done a lot of work on the flow simulation of fracture network in fractured confined aquifers which can be analytical semi analytical or numerical methods at present the linear flow model is generally used in the relevant analytical model which equates the fracture network development area into a high permeability strip and the flow of fluid in the fracture is simplified as linear flow sen 1986 stalgorova and mattar 2013 zerzar and bettam 2004 medeiros f 2008 among them introduced the trilinear flow model into the volume fracturing horizontal well model and divided the reservoir fluid seepage into three types of flow in the region conventional formation linear flow matrix linear flow between fractures and finally linear flow from the interior of fractures to horizontal wells meyer et al 2010 introduced the boundary interference condition of fractures into the trilinear flow equation and obtained the approximate analytical solution of fractured horizontal wells with limited conductivity mattar et al 2012 further subdivided its physical model based on the three linear flow model subdivided the inner region into two regions with different physical properties and considered the simple heterogeneity of srv region however the physical model constructed by the existing analytical method greatly simplifies the real reservoir characteristics at the same time due to the limitation of mathematical solution method it is powerless in the face of complex problems such as complex fracture network and arbitrary boundary reservoir guo et al 2012 in order to simplify the solution process the simulation of complex fracture network is approximately simulated by double porosity model and these results are widely used in petroleum engineering and groundwater literature warren and root 1963 jenkins and prentice 1982 dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1984 gerke and van genuchten 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 jourde et al 2002 they study the fracture problem and assume that the aquifer or reservoir is a uniform double medium one is the fracture system and the other is the matrix system warren and root 1963 moench 1984 the matrix system can be spherical layered columnar or cubic and the fracture system is assumed to be all orthogonal because such models adopt the assumption of uniform distribution the spacing shape and occurrence between fractures are the same dougherty and babu 1984 gerke and van genuchten 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 the above scholars simulate the pressure field and drawdown distribution of natural fracture system based on the ideal natural fracture system model however the ideal hypothetical conditions of fracture system are not accord with the real geological conditions in tight reservoir natural fractures may be randomly distributed and fracture length orientation and intersection mode are often different in recent years discrete fracture network models dfm have been developed to describe such complex fractures these models can accurately simulate fracture pressure or drawdown field so as to be applied to well test analysis and productivity prediction some scholars use numerical methods by taking the fracture area as the inner boundary of the grid clearly define the geometry and location parameters of each fracture in the reservoir and define its porosity and permeability properties so as to truly restore the conditions of the reservoir noorishad and mohsen 1982 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2003 pankaj 2018 numerical methods can be used to consider both complex fractures and heterogeneity in fractured confined aquifers however due to the complete meshing of the whole reservoir or aquifer and the need to update each time step it often consumes a lot of calculation time in addition due to the low accuracy of numerical dispersion the early flow behavior cannot be observed boundary element or semi analytical method is a good alternative method it does not need to be discretized in the whole reservoir or aquifer but only on the inner or outer boundary or interface due to the small scale discretization it greatly improves the running speed in the past few decades this kind of method has attracted the attention of many scholars gringarten et al 1974 jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 cinco et al 1988 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018a dejam et al 2018 wang et al 2021 gringarten et al 1974 proposed a coupled semi analytical model of a single vertical fracture in confined aquifers and the pressure distribution around the vertical fracture was obtained jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 proposed a linear flow model to simulate the drawdown behavior in fractures in fractured confined aquifers cinco et al 1988 proposed a coupling model of finite conductivity fracture and reservoir dejam et al 2018 proposed a new solution to study pressure transient behavior of a vertical well producing from a bounded dual porosity formation their solution is developed by using laplace transform and the finite fourier cosine transform methods the reservoir adopts analytical solution and the fracture adopts numerical solution which is the pioneer work of fracture semi analytical simulation based on his work later scholars wang et al 2018a wang et al 2021 extended this method to flow simulation of complex fracture network to simulate pressure or drawdown distribution and transient behavior in the confined aquifers due to the high brittleness of reservoir artificial fracturing can produce multiple fractures form a complex network system with natural fractures and increase the oil drainage area and permeability of reservoir system izadi and yildiz 2009 wang et al 2021 asadi et al 2020 developed a semi analytical solution of fractured horizontal wells where the double porosity method is used to describe the natural fractures they have successfully used this model to make a large number of parameter optimization designs volume fracturing fractures and natural fractures in tight reservoir and fractured reservoirs form a complex fracture network which often leads to strong heterogeneity around the main fractures wang et al 2017 li et al 2021 therefore multiple discontinuous or continuous heterogeneous areas may be distributed in a block and the boundary shape of the reconstruction area may not be regular due to uneven stress fig 1 under the joint action of this heterogeneity and complex fracture network the pressure characteristics of horizontal wells will change greatly because of this heterogeneous and irregular boundary effect it brings great challenges to pressure calculation wang et al 2017 proposed a semi analytical model of horizontal wells crossing multiple connected heterogeneous regions in rectangular boundary reservoirs this model is extended to multi stage fractured horizontal wells li et al 2021 but this model is not a general framework and is difficult to be extended to more complex heterogeneous situations wang et al 2018b proposed a general framework to solve the annular heterogeneity problem by using the boundary element method this framework can further develop many models but the flow problem of complex fracture networks is not discussed in his article wang et al 2021 proposed a semi analytical method to study the drawdown and pressure distribution of a vertical well in a homogeneous confined aquifer with complex fracture networks chen and liu 2022 proposed a coupling model of fracture and reservoir in rectangular closed reservoir with complex fracture networks to study the pressure transient behavior of multi stage fractured horizontal wells here we can conclude that the previous well test analysis of fractured reservoirs can be divided into two stages the first stage is a single well test analysis model for vertically fractured wells most representative of which are gringarten 1974 and cinco et al 1988 they did pioneering work mainly developing a new solution by coupling the fracture flow equation with the matrix flow equation morteza dejam et al 2018 presented a new solution for a vertical well producing from a bounded or finite dual porosity formation they did not discuss the solution of multistage fracturing horizontal wells with the development of multi stage fracturing technology for horizontal wells the development of unconventional reservoirs has become a hot spot some scholars asadi et al 2020 chen and liu 2022 began to study the new solutions of the finite conductivity multistage fracturing horizontal wells including the discrete network model most of these solutions are based on the assumption of homogeneous reservoir or dual porosity and the boundary conditions are usually infinite circular or rectangular in other words the boundary is regular however in the real development process of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs since volume fracturing often forms multiple heterogeneous regions new solutions for multi stage fracturing horizontal wells in such heterogeneous reservoirs need to be proposed this paper will propose a new semi analytical solution for multistage fracturing horizontal wells considering the heterogeneity of multiple regions and finite conductivity has been considered into this model in this paper the influence function of the composite conductivity is used which makes it unnecessary to solve the complex fracture coupling equation the biggest innovation is that the complex fracture flow boundary shape and heterogeneous characteristics can be flexibly considered in the model the proposed model framework lays a foundation for the establishment of more complex well test analysis model the purpose of this paper is to establish a general model framework considering both complex fracture network and heterogeneous characteristics of multiple connected regions by using boundary element method this framework enables us to fully understand the new idea of boundary element method in solving heterogeneous problems in the tight reservoirs with complex fracture networks firstly we establish a complex fracture network reservoir model and fracture element model under arbitrary shape boundary then the complex seam mesh model with arbitrary shape boundary is discretized by boundary element method and the general heterogeneous boundary element model framework is established then a conductivity function is used to establish the finite conductivity model at the same time the reservoir model and the external boundary conditions are combined to form a linear equation group of a horizontal well intercepted by complex fracture network in heterogeneous tight reservoir or fractured confined aquifers with multiple connected regions in laplace space which is solved by gaussian elimination method to obtain the pressure of horizontal well in laplace space next the real spatial pressure response is obtained by stehfest numerical inversion method finally the pressure transient response of multi stage fractured horizontal wells with arbitrary boundary in tight reservoirs or fractured confined aquifers with multiple connected regions is analyzed in detail the rest of this paper is organized as follows and fig 2 show the steps of the work in terms of a flowchart section 2 presents the model establishment and a general framework to obtain its boundary element formulation in laplace domain the model validation with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case is provided in section 3 some important results and analysis are discussed in the section 4 and the summary the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 method 2 1 physical model fig 3

p d b q d c q fd 0 as shown in fig 1 there is a closed outer boundary condition so there is 18 β q d 0 in addition in the domain the total production of hydraulic fracture segments should be equal to the total production of horizontal wells so there is 19 i q fd 1 s where i is the unit row vector of n total elements combining eqs 16 to 19 yields the following matrix equation 20 a f b f c f β a b c

obtain the unknown boundary pressure flux for fracture element and wellbore pressure in order to obtain the real space pressure p d value it can be inversed to the real space by stehfest 1970 numerical inversion method 2 5 solution of a finite conductivity fractured horizontal well connected in multi heterogeneous regions the solution and symbol annotation of the finite conductivity multistage fracturing horizontal well in multiple heterogeneous regions are found in appendix c the schematic diagram of multi stage fracturing horizontal well model connected in multi heterogeneous areas is shown in fig 5 a according to the boundary integral matrix 14 we can list the equations of ω1 note that there are no wells in domain 1 and the integral on the boundary γ1 is counterclockwise the integral on the boundary γ2 is clockwise as shown in fig 5 b arrow direction 21 a 1 p d 1 b 1 q d 1 a 12 p d 12 b 12 q d 12 a 13 p d 13 b 13 q d 13 a 14 p d 14 b 14 q d 14 0 among them a1 b1 a12 b12 a13 b13 a14 and b14 are the matrix of n1 n12 n13 n14 rows and the number of columns are n1 n2 n12 n12 n13 n13 n14 and n14 respectively p d 1 and q d 1 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ1 and n1 element column vectors p d 12 and q d 12 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ12 and n12 element column vectors p d 13 and q d 13 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ13 and n13 element column vectors p d 14 and q d 14 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ14 and n14 element column vectors according to the boundary integral matrix 14 we can list the boundary node equations of ω2 ω3 and ω4 it should be noted that there are fracture segments in domains 3 4 and 5 and the integral on the boundary γ3 γ4 γ5 is counterclockwise γ2 is clockwise as shown in fig 5 c arrow direction and at the interface γ12 γ13 γ14 γ23 γ34 using the condition of equal flow and pressure the equation is obtained 22 a 21 p d 12 b 21 q d 12 a 23 p d 23 b 23 q d 23 c 2 q fd 2 0 23 a 31 p d 13 b 31 q d 13 a 32 p d 23 b 32 q d 23 a 34 p d 34 b 34 q d 34 c 3 q fd 3 0 24 a 41 p d 14 b 41 q d 14 a 43 p d 34 b 43 q d 34 c 4 q fd 4 0 the outer boundary is closed there shall be 25 β 1 q d 1 0 the inner boundary conditions are established based on the fracture segments and fracture segments are distributed in each domain therefore based on equation 15 we can write the inner boundary conditions of each region in the form of matrix as follows 26 β 2 p df 2 a f 21 p d 12 b f 21 q d 12 a f 23 p d 23 b f 23 q d 23 c f 2 q fd 2 0 27 β 3 p df 3 a f 31 p d 13 b f 31 q d 13 a f 32 p d 23

hydraulic fracture segments in different heterogeneous regions should be equal to the total production of horizontal wells so there is 29 i 2 q fd 2 i 3 q fd 3 i 4 q fd 4 1 s combining eqs 21 to 29 yields the matrix equation which shows those unknowns are not boundary flow and pressure fracture section flow and horizontal well pressure there are n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 boundary element and fracture section nodes in the equation and there are ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 fracture section nodes the flow pressure of boundary element nodes is unknown and each node has a pressure and a flow the flow of fracture section nodes is unknown and the pressure is equal to the horizontal wellbore pressure so there are 2 n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 1 unknowns eq 21 lists n1 n12 n13 n14 equations eq 22 24 list n12 n23 n13 n23 n34 and n14 n34 respectively eq 25 lists n1 equations eq 26 29 list ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 and 1 equation respectively now we have listed 2 n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 1 equations which are equal to the total number of unknown variables therefore the horizontal well pressure solution can be obtained by combining these equations in order to obtain the real space pressure p d value it can be inversed to the real space by stehfest 1970 numerical inversion method 3 model validation the proposed boundary element model is a semi analytical model which does not need discrete elements in the whole domain the discrete element is only divided at the boundary including the outer boundary the multi region connected boundary and the fracture element for comparison with numerical simulation we choose two cases the first case is a completely homogeneous case and the permeability of each region is equal the second case is a four zone heterogeneous case where a horizontal well passes through multiple connected heterogeneous regions 3 1 comparison with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case a numerical simulator is used to verify a simple model the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 20 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 6 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located in the center of the reservoir the subgraph of fig 6 shows that this reservoir is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 k2 k3 k4 respectively the colors of different regions represent different permeability ratios however in this homogeneous model k1 k2 k3 k4 1 the storage capacity coefficient for 4 blocks is also set to 1 for w1 w2 w3 w4 respectively fig 6 shows the consistency of the validation results between the numerical simulation and the proposed model which verifies the accuracy of our model however the phenomenon of numerical dispersion appears when the numerical simulation simulates the pressure behavior for a small time therefore when analyzing the behavior of pressure disturbance in a small time numerical simulation will appear powerless the verification of this model shows that not all flow segments appear because the reservoir width is only three times the length of the fracture so the pressure wave will soon reach the boundary it can be seen from the pressure curve that when the dimensionless time is greater than 5 the pressure curve rises rapidly in a straight line of unit slope 3 2 comparison with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case fig 7 shows the validation of the proposed model with numerical simulation results for the heterogeneous case the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 20 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 6 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located at the center of the reservoir the subgraph of fig 7 shows that this reservoir is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 15 respectively the colors of different regions represent different permeability ratios from the pressure and pressure derivative curve it can be seen that for heterogeneous cases the fitting results of pressure and pressure derivative curve are very good which verifies the accuracy of the model when the dimensionless time is less than 0 01 the numerical simulation results appear numerical dispersion phenomenon but the proposed model can still calculate accurately because the permeability ratio is relatively large in areas 2 3 and 4 some special flow sections do not appear 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow characteristics analysis for the multizone heterogeneous case the double logarithm diagram of pressure and pressure derivative can reflect the flow characteristics of a certain fluid in a heterogeneous region in order to show the characteristics of all flow sections as much as possible we set the reservoir size larger the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 200 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 60 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located at the center of the reservoir the reservoir shown in the subgraph of fig 8 is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 15 respectively as shown in fig 8 the flow segment can be divided into five segments the first section is a bilinear flow section and the pressure and pressure derivative curve reflect the straight line section with a 1 4 slope during this flow period the hydraulic fracture and the fluid in the srv reconstruction area flow at the same time the hydraulic fracture supplies to the wellbore and the srv reconstruction area supplies to the hydraulic fracture the second stage is the linear flow stage showing a 1 2 slope straight line segment on the derivative curve this stage is mainly the fluid in the srv area replenishing the hydraulic fractures the third flow stage is the radial flow section in this stage the fluid in the non srv area begins to supply to the srv area the fourth flow stage is the flow section dominated by the first boundary and the pressure derivative curve reflects the straight line section with a 1 2 slope at this stage the fluid flow reaches the near boundary the last stage is the second boundary dominating flow section in which the far boundary fluid flows in this multi region heterogeneous model the dimensionless fracture spacing is 5 and the first radial flow segment does not appear due to the small fracture spacing 4 2 influence of area of irregular regions on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions as shown in fig 9 the multi heterogeneous region is composed of four regions and the permeability of each region may be the same or different in this analysis k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 5 10 and 15 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 fig 10 shows influence of area of irregular area on typical curve the area of the entire irregular region is set to 93 23 932 3 and 9323 it can be seen from the pressure curve in fig 8 that the area of the irregular region mainly affects the late flow when the dimensionless time is greater than 5 the smaller the area the greater the pressure loss in the later stage it can be seen from the pressure derivative curve that the area of the region will significantly affect the flow characteristics the larger the area of the region the more complete the flow segment appears with the reduction of the area of the irregular region some special flow sections may disappear fig 11 shows evolution of pressure field in irregular region at different time it can be seen from the figure that when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 01 the pressure drop mainly occurs near the crack and this time is in the bilinear flow stage when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 1 it can be seen that the pressure field near the fracture in each heterogeneous area is significantly different the area with permeability ratio k2 5 in that area has the largest pressure drop due to poor permeability the area with permeability ratio k4 15 has the best permeability and the pressure drop is the smallest at this time we can see that the pressure wave propagates to the inner boundary but at this time the influence near the boundary is small when the dimensionless time is equal to 1 the waiting field diagram shows that the irregular boundary has been reached we can see that the disturbance of the pressure wave is also an irregular shape which is related to the shape of the inner boundary at this time the derivative curve appears upward this is because the permeability of the area with permeability k1 1 in the outer zone is worse when the pressure wave propagates from the area with good physical property to the area with poor physical property the curve will rise and rise but this stage is not a linear flow but is the result of physical property changes when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 the pressure wave propagates to the outer boundary in an irregular shape 4 3 influence of permeability ratio on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions in this analysis the regional storage ratio w1 w2 w3 and w4 are set to 1 1 1 and 1 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the different permeability ratios are shown in fig 12 the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 5 is the case 1 the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 10 k3 5 k4 10 is the case 2 and the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 0 2 k3 1 k4 0 2 is the case 3 in the first two cases the permeability of internal areas 2 3 and 4 is better than that of area 1 fig 12 shows effects of different permeability ratios on typical curves in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions from the dimensionless pressure curve it can be seen that the dimensionless pressure in case 3 is much higher than that in the first two cases which also implies that the pressure loss is the largest in this case this is because the permeability ratio in the inner zone of case 3 is much smaller than that in the outer zone thus increasing the pressure loss in the early flow period the pressure loss of case 1 is slightly larger than that of case 2 this is because the sum of permeability in case 1 is slightly smaller than that in case 2 from the dimensionless pressure derivative curve it can be seen that there are more flow segment characteristics in case 3 mainly including bilinear flow segment linear flow segment quasi radial flow segment and boundary dominated flow segment however in the first two cases some flow segment characteristics cannot be found this is because when the permeability of the inner zone is small the pressure disturbance propagation is slow and more flow segments can appear when the permeability is large the pressure disturbance propagation affects the flow characteristics this can also be seen in fig 13 which shows evolution of pressure field different permeability ratios on typical curves in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions from fig 13 a and b show that the pressure disturbance as a whole presents an irregular shape and propagates to the boundary which is mainly affected by the irregular boundary it can also be seen that when the permeability of region 3 is higher than that of regions 2 and 4 the pressure loss near the fracture in region 3 is smaller as shown in fig 13 a however when the permeability ratio of region 3 is smaller than that of regions 2 and 4 the fracture pressure loss in region 3 is greater when the permeability of the inner zone is less than that of the outer zone as shown in fig 13 c at the same time the pressure propagation is also confined to the vicinity of the fracture and the propagation radius of the pressure wave is very small 4 4 influence of regional storage capacity ratio on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions in this analysis the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the different regional storage capacity ratios are shown in fig 14 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 is the case 1 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 01 w3 0 04 w4 0 01 is the case 2 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 001 w3 0 004 w4 0 001 is the case 3 and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 0001 w3 0 0004 w4 0 0001 is the case 4 in these cases the storage capacity ratio of the inner zone is gradually reduced fig 14 shows influence of different regional storage capacity ratio on typical curve in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions the regional storage capacity ratio reflects the storage capacity of the fluid in the region it can be seen from the pressure curve and derivative curve in fig 14 that when the storage capacity ratios of the four regions are the same corresponding to the first case the pressure loss is the lowest because the permeability ratios of the four regions are different and the permeability of the inner region is relatively small some special flow sections appear however as the storage capacity ratio of the inner zone gradually decreases the derivative curve shows a v shape which represents that the flow at this stage is from the outer zone to the inner zone the smaller the regional storage capacity ratio the deeper the v shape and the more fluid supplied from the outer zone to the inner zone fig 15 shows influence of different regional storage capacity on pressure field distribution in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from fig 15 that the larger the storage capacity ratio in the inner area the slower the propagation speed of the pressure wave to the outside and the smaller the possibility of getting external supply as the storage capacity ratio in the inner area gradually decreases the propagation speed of the pressure wave to the outside becomes faster however the growth rate of the propagation speed of this pressure wave gradually decreases in other words the storage volume ratio cannot influence the propagation speed of the pressure wave without limitation 4 5 influence of fracture conductivity on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 5 20 50 and 300 for four cases fig 16 shows the influence of different fracture conductivity on type curves in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from the pressure curve in the figure that the influence of fracture conductivity on the dimensionless pressure curve is mainly concentrated when the dimensionless time is less than 1 with the decrease of the conductivity the pressure loss increases gradually this also implies that a smaller fracture conductivity requires a larger pressure drop to produce the same output when the dimensionless time is greater than 1 all dimensionless pressure curves almost coincide implying that in the late stage of seepage the pressure loss is consistent and not affected by the fracture conductivity it can be seen from the derivative curve that the fracture conductivity seriously affects the early flow characteristics with the increase of fracture conductivity the bilinear flow section gradually disappears fig 17 shows the distribution and evolution of pressure field in multi region heterogeneous reservoir with high conductivity as can be seen from fig 17 a when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 1 the pressure wave propagation is mainly concentrated near the crack in the heterogeneous region as time goes on when the dimensionless time is equal to 1 the pressure wave in each heterogeneous region of the pressure wave diffuses outward however the pressure wave propagates faster in region 3 as shown in fig 17 b because the permeability ratio of this region is larger than that of other regions the pressure waves in region 2 and region 4 propagate slowly and the range appears to be the same when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 the pressure wave propagates far as can be seen from fig 17 c the equipotential lines between the fractures in several regions are connected into double kinks the equipotential lines at a distance are similar to elliptical shapes but affected by the boundary the equipotential lines show irregular phase in addition at the junction between regions it is obvious that the equipotential line has been seriously deformed under the influence of physical property changes when the dimensionless time is equal to 100 the pressure wave continues to propagate far away at this time the pressure wave mainly extends along the direction of the fracture and the pressure loss in this direction is the largest and it is also slowly expanding perpendicular to the direction of the fracture the deformation form of the equipotential line of the pressure field is seriously affected by the boundary of the heterogeneous region 4 6 influence of fracture number on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 the number of fractures is set to 4 5 7 and 10 respectively fig 18 shows the influence of different fracture number on type curves in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from the figure that the influence of the number of fractures on the pressure curve is mainly concentrated in the early and middle stages when the dimensionless time is less than 100 with the decrease of the fracture number the pressure loss increases gradually this also implies that a smaller fracture number requires a larger pressure drop to produce the same output derivative curve shows that with the increase of the number of fractures the interference becomes serious the transition flow appears and the linear flow time becomes shorter fig 19 shows the distribution and evolution of pressure field in multi region heterogeneous reservoir under different fracture number it can be seen from the pressure field diagram that when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 all pressure waves propagate to the inner region boundary since the permeability of regions 2 and 4 is only 1 5 of that of regions 1 and 3 the pressure drop near the fractures in regions 2 and 4 is greater the propagation of pressure wave shows a trend of squeezing towards the middle region the isobars spread outwards in an irregular shape with the increase of the number of fractures the propagation speed of pressure wave becomes slower and the pressure loss around the fractures decreases since the permeability difference between region 2 and region 4 is relatively large the equipotential lines among them are concentrated near the region in addition in the region with high permeability the interference between fractures increases with the number of fractures increasing 4 7 comparison of pressure response between irregular shaped reservoirs and rectangular reservoirs the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 0 2 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 here we compare the pressure response of irregular shaped reservoirs and rectangular reservoirs in both cases we keep the area of the region the same and the area of the entire reservoir is 244 5 the total area of the inner zone is 93 23 see the sub figure of fig 20 for the schematic diagram of the two cases it can be seen from fig 20 that the irregular shape boundary has a certain influence on the pressure response in the early stage all pressure curves coincide in the late stage of flow the dimensionless pressure curve shows that the pressure of the irregular boundary is slightly lower than that of the rectangular reservoir suggesting that the reservoir with the irregular boundary will lead to small pressure loss it can be seen from the derivative curve that the shape of the boundary mainly affects the period of quasi steady flow and the irregular boundary condition prolongs the time of radial flow 4 8 advantages and limitation of the presented model in numerical methods such as finite element method numerical grid to characterize the reservoir is required to be established in the first step sufficiently large grid size is usually required to reduce the truncation error and enhance the simulation accuracy huge grid numbers may cause heavy computational burden which may require large computer memory and storage space in some cases when dealing with complex problems if the boundary shape changes the numerical mesh also needs to be changed accordingly for each update which may result in even more computational burden and may make the numerical simulation infeasible to perform the proposed model can flexibly deal with the flow problem of heterogeneous reservoirs without the need to divide the grid in the entire reservoir greatly reducing the calculation workload and does not require a lot of data preparation moreover the computational accuracy of the proposed model is sometimes comparable to that of the analytical solution in addition because it is solved in laplace space the discrete time is not needed which greatly reduces the computational complexity this article also reflects some limitations the use principle of bem is to find the green function of the problem for some more complex problems the green function may not exist or may not be easy to find which affects the promotion of bem in addition in the reservoir with strong heterogeneity there are many heterogeneous regions to be divided which will seriously restrict the use of the boundary element method in this case its computational efficiency cannot be reflected however we are still willing to believe that when solving the problem of unconventional reservoir flow from the perspective of computational complexity there is indeed the accuracy of analytical solution and the ability to deal with complex heterogeneity 5 summary and conclusions through the study the following conclusions were derived 1 this paper presents a general framework with boundary elements method to simulate pressure transient behavior for a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures in regional heterogeneous shale reservoirs with multiple connected regions the presented model has the ability to deal with the heterogeneity caused by volume fracturing and can obtain any result with any reservoir boundary shape 2 through this semi analytical model the reservoir can get accurate results without any mesh the accuracy of the model has been verified by numerical simulation in two cases i e homogeneous case and multi region connected heterogeneous case which shows that the proposed model is very reliable 3 flow characteristics for the multizone heterogeneous case is analyzed and divided into five segments i e bi linear flow segment showing 1 4 slope straight line on the derivative curves linear flow segment showing 1 2 slope straight line on the derivative curves radial flow segment the first boundary dominated flow segment and the second boundary dominated segment some flow segments cannot be observed due to parameter setting if the parameters are properly selected special flow segments such as the first radial flow the cross flow segment from the outer zone to the inner zone may also appear 4 the influence of the fracture and reservoir parameters on type curves for the multizone heterogeneous case is analyzed in detail mainly including area of irregular regions regional

2602,the focus of this paper is to establish a new general model framework considering both hydraulic fractures with finite conductivity and heterogeneous characteristics of multiple connected regions by using boundary element method with this framework we can calculate the pressure performance of any heterogeneous reservoir the innovation is that the complex fracture flow boundary shape and heterogeneous characteristics can be flexibly considered in the model transient pressure of fractured horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoir is obtained by using stehfest numerical inversion method subsequently this proposed regional heterogeneity model was validated by using numerical simulation methods the results show that the proposed heterogeneous model can be divided into five flow segments which are bilinear flow linear flow radial flow first boundary dominated flow and second boundary dominated flow however the research results show that the presence or absence of some flow sections is closely related to the regional permeability ratio and the regional storage capacity ratio as the two most important parameters of heterogeneous reservoir the permeability ratio and regional storage capacity of heterogeneous reservoir will have a huge impact on the pressure response and pressure field the sensitivity analysis shows that these two factors will lead to the deformation of the pressure field distribution and affect the flow characteristics and cause some flow segments to fail to appear the smaller the regional storage capacity ratio the deeper the v shape and the more fluid supplied from the outer zone to the inner zone this study also suggests that the fracture conductivity mainly affects the early flow characteristics and the smaller the conductivity the greater the pressure loss in addition irregular boundary will also cause important deformation of pressure field and the area size will affect the late flow characteristics and the smaller the area the greater the pressure loss the new semi analytical solutions can form a series of typical curves and be applied to the well test analysis of multi stage fracturing horizontal wells in heterogeneous and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs the findings of this study can help for better understanding of the influence of reservoir heterogeneity on pressure response and find some applications in well testing for inverse problems in heterogeneous reservoirs keywords pressure transient green s function boundary elements method irregular heterogeneous reservoirs fractured horizontal wells data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the shale oil and gas revolution has broken out in the united states it can be said that the outbreak of the shale oil and gas revolution has completely changed the energy pattern of the united states followed by china the shale gas revolution has broken out and is about to enter the shale oil era it is no exaggeration to say that the outbreak of shale oil and gas revolution will change the world energy pattern wang et al 2018a at present tight reservoir development technology mainly includes horizontal well and multi stage fracturing technology so as to obtain relatively high production many scholars have done a lot of work on the flow simulation of fracture network in fractured confined aquifers which can be analytical semi analytical or numerical methods at present the linear flow model is generally used in the relevant analytical model which equates the fracture network development area into a high permeability strip and the flow of fluid in the fracture is simplified as linear flow sen 1986 stalgorova and mattar 2013 zerzar and bettam 2004 medeiros f 2008 among them introduced the trilinear flow model into the volume fracturing horizontal well model and divided the reservoir fluid seepage into three types of flow in the region conventional formation linear flow matrix linear flow between fractures and finally linear flow from the interior of fractures to horizontal wells meyer et al 2010 introduced the boundary interference condition of fractures into the trilinear flow equation and obtained the approximate analytical solution of fractured horizontal wells with limited conductivity mattar et al 2012 further subdivided its physical model based on the three linear flow model subdivided the inner region into two regions with different physical properties and considered the simple heterogeneity of srv region however the physical model constructed by the existing analytical method greatly simplifies the real reservoir characteristics at the same time due to the limitation of mathematical solution method it is powerless in the face of complex problems such as complex fracture network and arbitrary boundary reservoir guo et al 2012 in order to simplify the solution process the simulation of complex fracture network is approximately simulated by double porosity model and these results are widely used in petroleum engineering and groundwater literature warren and root 1963 jenkins and prentice 1982 dougherty and babu 1984 moench 1984 gerke and van genuchten 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 jourde et al 2002 they study the fracture problem and assume that the aquifer or reservoir is a uniform double medium one is the fracture system and the other is the matrix system warren and root 1963 moench 1984 the matrix system can be spherical layered columnar or cubic and the fracture system is assumed to be all orthogonal because such models adopt the assumption of uniform distribution the spacing shape and occurrence between fractures are the same dougherty and babu 1984 gerke and van genuchten 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 the above scholars simulate the pressure field and drawdown distribution of natural fracture system based on the ideal natural fracture system model however the ideal hypothetical conditions of fracture system are not accord with the real geological conditions in tight reservoir natural fractures may be randomly distributed and fracture length orientation and intersection mode are often different in recent years discrete fracture network models dfm have been developed to describe such complex fractures these models can accurately simulate fracture pressure or drawdown field so as to be applied to well test analysis and productivity prediction some scholars use numerical methods by taking the fracture area as the inner boundary of the grid clearly define the geometry and location parameters of each fracture in the reservoir and define its porosity and permeability properties so as to truly restore the conditions of the reservoir noorishad and mohsen 1982 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2003 pankaj 2018 numerical methods can be used to consider both complex fractures and heterogeneity in fractured confined aquifers however due to the complete meshing of the whole reservoir or aquifer and the need to update each time step it often consumes a lot of calculation time in addition due to the low accuracy of numerical dispersion the early flow behavior cannot be observed boundary element or semi analytical method is a good alternative method it does not need to be discretized in the whole reservoir or aquifer but only on the inner or outer boundary or interface due to the small scale discretization it greatly improves the running speed in the past few decades this kind of method has attracted the attention of many scholars gringarten et al 1974 jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 cinco et al 1988 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018a dejam et al 2018 wang et al 2021 gringarten et al 1974 proposed a coupled semi analytical model of a single vertical fracture in confined aquifers and the pressure distribution around the vertical fracture was obtained jenkins and prentice 1982 sen 1986 proposed a linear flow model to simulate the drawdown behavior in fractures in fractured confined aquifers cinco et al 1988 proposed a coupling model of finite conductivity fracture and reservoir dejam et al 2018 proposed a new solution to study pressure transient behavior of a vertical well producing from a bounded dual porosity formation their solution is developed by using laplace transform and the finite fourier cosine transform methods the reservoir adopts analytical solution and the fracture adopts numerical solution which is the pioneer work of fracture semi analytical simulation based on his work later scholars wang et al 2018a wang et al 2021 extended this method to flow simulation of complex fracture network to simulate pressure or drawdown distribution and transient behavior in the confined aquifers due to the high brittleness of reservoir artificial fracturing can produce multiple fractures form a complex network system with natural fractures and increase the oil drainage area and permeability of reservoir system izadi and yildiz 2009 wang et al 2021 asadi et al 2020 developed a semi analytical solution of fractured horizontal wells where the double porosity method is used to describe the natural fractures they have successfully used this model to make a large number of parameter optimization designs volume fracturing fractures and natural fractures in tight reservoir and fractured reservoirs form a complex fracture network which often leads to strong heterogeneity around the main fractures wang et al 2017 li et al 2021 therefore multiple discontinuous or continuous heterogeneous areas may be distributed in a block and the boundary shape of the reconstruction area may not be regular due to uneven stress fig 1 under the joint action of this heterogeneity and complex fracture network the pressure characteristics of horizontal wells will change greatly because of this heterogeneous and irregular boundary effect it brings great challenges to pressure calculation wang et al 2017 proposed a semi analytical model of horizontal wells crossing multiple connected heterogeneous regions in rectangular boundary reservoirs this model is extended to multi stage fractured horizontal wells li et al 2021 but this model is not a general framework and is difficult to be extended to more complex heterogeneous situations wang et al 2018b proposed a general framework to solve the annular heterogeneity problem by using the boundary element method this framework can further develop many models but the flow problem of complex fracture networks is not discussed in his article wang et al 2021 proposed a semi analytical method to study the drawdown and pressure distribution of a vertical well in a homogeneous confined aquifer with complex fracture networks chen and liu 2022 proposed a coupling model of fracture and reservoir in rectangular closed reservoir with complex fracture networks to study the pressure transient behavior of multi stage fractured horizontal wells here we can conclude that the previous well test analysis of fractured reservoirs can be divided into two stages the first stage is a single well test analysis model for vertically fractured wells most representative of which are gringarten 1974 and cinco et al 1988 they did pioneering work mainly developing a new solution by coupling the fracture flow equation with the matrix flow equation morteza dejam et al 2018 presented a new solution for a vertical well producing from a bounded or finite dual porosity formation they did not discuss the solution of multistage fracturing horizontal wells with the development of multi stage fracturing technology for horizontal wells the development of unconventional reservoirs has become a hot spot some scholars asadi et al 2020 chen and liu 2022 began to study the new solutions of the finite conductivity multistage fracturing horizontal wells including the discrete network model most of these solutions are based on the assumption of homogeneous reservoir or dual porosity and the boundary conditions are usually infinite circular or rectangular in other words the boundary is regular however in the real development process of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs since volume fracturing often forms multiple heterogeneous regions new solutions for multi stage fracturing horizontal wells in such heterogeneous reservoirs need to be proposed this paper will propose a new semi analytical solution for multistage fracturing horizontal wells considering the heterogeneity of multiple regions and finite conductivity has been considered into this model in this paper the influence function of the composite conductivity is used which makes it unnecessary to solve the complex fracture coupling equation the biggest innovation is that the complex fracture flow boundary shape and heterogeneous characteristics can be flexibly considered in the model the proposed model framework lays a foundation for the establishment of more complex well test analysis model the purpose of this paper is to establish a general model framework considering both complex fracture network and heterogeneous characteristics of multiple connected regions by using boundary element method this framework enables us to fully understand the new idea of boundary element method in solving heterogeneous problems in the tight reservoirs with complex fracture networks firstly we establish a complex fracture network reservoir model and fracture element model under arbitrary shape boundary then the complex seam mesh model with arbitrary shape boundary is discretized by boundary element method and the general heterogeneous boundary element model framework is established then a conductivity function is used to establish the finite conductivity model at the same time the reservoir model and the external boundary conditions are combined to form a linear equation group of a horizontal well intercepted by complex fracture network in heterogeneous tight reservoir or fractured confined aquifers with multiple connected regions in laplace space which is solved by gaussian elimination method to obtain the pressure of horizontal well in laplace space next the real spatial pressure response is obtained by stehfest numerical inversion method finally the pressure transient response of multi stage fractured horizontal wells with arbitrary boundary in tight reservoirs or fractured confined aquifers with multiple connected regions is analyzed in detail the rest of this paper is organized as follows and fig 2 show the steps of the work in terms of a flowchart section 2 presents the model establishment and a general framework to obtain its boundary element formulation in laplace domain the model validation with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case is provided in section 3 some important results and analysis are discussed in the section 4 and the summary the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 method 2 1 physical model fig 3

p d b q d c q fd 0 as shown in fig 1 there is a closed outer boundary condition so there is 18 β q d 0 in addition in the domain the total production of hydraulic fracture segments should be equal to the total production of horizontal wells so there is 19 i q fd 1 s where i is the unit row vector of n total elements combining eqs 16 to 19 yields the following matrix equation 20 a f b f c f β a b c

obtain the unknown boundary pressure flux for fracture element and wellbore pressure in order to obtain the real space pressure p d value it can be inversed to the real space by stehfest 1970 numerical inversion method 2 5 solution of a finite conductivity fractured horizontal well connected in multi heterogeneous regions the solution and symbol annotation of the finite conductivity multistage fracturing horizontal well in multiple heterogeneous regions are found in appendix c the schematic diagram of multi stage fracturing horizontal well model connected in multi heterogeneous areas is shown in fig 5 a according to the boundary integral matrix 14 we can list the equations of ω1 note that there are no wells in domain 1 and the integral on the boundary γ1 is counterclockwise the integral on the boundary γ2 is clockwise as shown in fig 5 b arrow direction 21 a 1 p d 1 b 1 q d 1 a 12 p d 12 b 12 q d 12 a 13 p d 13 b 13 q d 13 a 14 p d 14 b 14 q d 14 0 among them a1 b1 a12 b12 a13 b13 a14 and b14 are the matrix of n1 n12 n13 n14 rows and the number of columns are n1 n2 n12 n12 n13 n13 n14 and n14 respectively p d 1 and q d 1 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ1 and n1 element column vectors p d 12 and q d 12 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ12 and n12 element column vectors p d 13 and q d 13 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ13 and n13 element column vectors p d 14 and q d 14 are nodes pressure and flux on the boundary γ14 and n14 element column vectors according to the boundary integral matrix 14 we can list the boundary node equations of ω2 ω3 and ω4 it should be noted that there are fracture segments in domains 3 4 and 5 and the integral on the boundary γ3 γ4 γ5 is counterclockwise γ2 is clockwise as shown in fig 5 c arrow direction and at the interface γ12 γ13 γ14 γ23 γ34 using the condition of equal flow and pressure the equation is obtained 22 a 21 p d 12 b 21 q d 12 a 23 p d 23 b 23 q d 23 c 2 q fd 2 0 23 a 31 p d 13 b 31 q d 13 a 32 p d 23 b 32 q d 23 a 34 p d 34 b 34 q d 34 c 3 q fd 3 0 24 a 41 p d 14 b 41 q d 14 a 43 p d 34 b 43 q d 34 c 4 q fd 4 0 the outer boundary is closed there shall be 25 β 1 q d 1 0 the inner boundary conditions are established based on the fracture segments and fracture segments are distributed in each domain therefore based on equation 15 we can write the inner boundary conditions of each region in the form of matrix as follows 26 β 2 p df 2 a f 21 p d 12 b f 21 q d 12 a f 23 p d 23 b f 23 q d 23 c f 2 q fd 2 0 27 β 3 p df 3 a f 31 p d 13 b f 31 q d 13 a f 32 p d 23

hydraulic fracture segments in different heterogeneous regions should be equal to the total production of horizontal wells so there is 29 i 2 q fd 2 i 3 q fd 3 i 4 q fd 4 1 s combining eqs 21 to 29 yields the matrix equation which shows those unknowns are not boundary flow and pressure fracture section flow and horizontal well pressure there are n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 boundary element and fracture section nodes in the equation and there are ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 fracture section nodes the flow pressure of boundary element nodes is unknown and each node has a pressure and a flow the flow of fracture section nodes is unknown and the pressure is equal to the horizontal wellbore pressure so there are 2 n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 1 unknowns eq 21 lists n1 n12 n13 n14 equations eq 22 24 list n12 n23 n13 n23 n34 and n14 n34 respectively eq 25 lists n1 equations eq 26 29 list ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 and 1 equation respectively now we have listed 2 n1 n12 n13 n14 n23 n34 ntotal2 ntotal3 ntotal4 1 equations which are equal to the total number of unknown variables therefore the horizontal well pressure solution can be obtained by combining these equations in order to obtain the real space pressure p d value it can be inversed to the real space by stehfest 1970 numerical inversion method 3 model validation the proposed boundary element model is a semi analytical model which does not need discrete elements in the whole domain the discrete element is only divided at the boundary including the outer boundary the multi region connected boundary and the fracture element for comparison with numerical simulation we choose two cases the first case is a completely homogeneous case and the permeability of each region is equal the second case is a four zone heterogeneous case where a horizontal well passes through multiple connected heterogeneous regions 3 1 comparison with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case a numerical simulator is used to verify a simple model the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 20 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 6 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located in the center of the reservoir the subgraph of fig 6 shows that this reservoir is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 k2 k3 k4 respectively the colors of different regions represent different permeability ratios however in this homogeneous model k1 k2 k3 k4 1 the storage capacity coefficient for 4 blocks is also set to 1 for w1 w2 w3 w4 respectively fig 6 shows the consistency of the validation results between the numerical simulation and the proposed model which verifies the accuracy of our model however the phenomenon of numerical dispersion appears when the numerical simulation simulates the pressure behavior for a small time therefore when analyzing the behavior of pressure disturbance in a small time numerical simulation will appear powerless the verification of this model shows that not all flow segments appear because the reservoir width is only three times the length of the fracture so the pressure wave will soon reach the boundary it can be seen from the pressure curve that when the dimensionless time is greater than 5 the pressure curve rises rapidly in a straight line of unit slope 3 2 comparison with numerical simulation for a homogeneous case fig 7 shows the validation of the proposed model with numerical simulation results for the heterogeneous case the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 20 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 6 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located at the center of the reservoir the subgraph of fig 7 shows that this reservoir is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 15 respectively the colors of different regions represent different permeability ratios from the pressure and pressure derivative curve it can be seen that for heterogeneous cases the fitting results of pressure and pressure derivative curve are very good which verifies the accuracy of the model when the dimensionless time is less than 0 01 the numerical simulation results appear numerical dispersion phenomenon but the proposed model can still calculate accurately because the permeability ratio is relatively large in areas 2 3 and 4 some special flow sections do not appear 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow characteristics analysis for the multizone heterogeneous case the double logarithm diagram of pressure and pressure derivative can reflect the flow characteristics of a certain fluid in a heterogeneous region in order to show the characteristics of all flow sections as much as possible we set the reservoir size larger the reservoir is a regular rectangular reservoir with a dimensionless reservoir length of 200 and a dimensionless reservoir width of 60 a horizontal well with 3 fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 this horizontal well is located at the center of the reservoir the reservoir shown in the subgraph of fig 8 is composed of four blocks with different permeability ratios k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 15 respectively as shown in fig 8 the flow segment can be divided into five segments the first section is a bilinear flow section and the pressure and pressure derivative curve reflect the straight line section with a 1 4 slope during this flow period the hydraulic fracture and the fluid in the srv reconstruction area flow at the same time the hydraulic fracture supplies to the wellbore and the srv reconstruction area supplies to the hydraulic fracture the second stage is the linear flow stage showing a 1 2 slope straight line segment on the derivative curve this stage is mainly the fluid in the srv area replenishing the hydraulic fractures the third flow stage is the radial flow section in this stage the fluid in the non srv area begins to supply to the srv area the fourth flow stage is the flow section dominated by the first boundary and the pressure derivative curve reflects the straight line section with a 1 2 slope at this stage the fluid flow reaches the near boundary the last stage is the second boundary dominating flow section in which the far boundary fluid flows in this multi region heterogeneous model the dimensionless fracture spacing is 5 and the first radial flow segment does not appear due to the small fracture spacing 4 2 influence of area of irregular regions on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions as shown in fig 9 the multi heterogeneous region is composed of four regions and the permeability of each region may be the same or different in this analysis k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 5 10 and 15 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 fig 10 shows influence of area of irregular area on typical curve the area of the entire irregular region is set to 93 23 932 3 and 9323 it can be seen from the pressure curve in fig 8 that the area of the irregular region mainly affects the late flow when the dimensionless time is greater than 5 the smaller the area the greater the pressure loss in the later stage it can be seen from the pressure derivative curve that the area of the region will significantly affect the flow characteristics the larger the area of the region the more complete the flow segment appears with the reduction of the area of the irregular region some special flow sections may disappear fig 11 shows evolution of pressure field in irregular region at different time it can be seen from the figure that when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 01 the pressure drop mainly occurs near the crack and this time is in the bilinear flow stage when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 1 it can be seen that the pressure field near the fracture in each heterogeneous area is significantly different the area with permeability ratio k2 5 in that area has the largest pressure drop due to poor permeability the area with permeability ratio k4 15 has the best permeability and the pressure drop is the smallest at this time we can see that the pressure wave propagates to the inner boundary but at this time the influence near the boundary is small when the dimensionless time is equal to 1 the waiting field diagram shows that the irregular boundary has been reached we can see that the disturbance of the pressure wave is also an irregular shape which is related to the shape of the inner boundary at this time the derivative curve appears upward this is because the permeability of the area with permeability k1 1 in the outer zone is worse when the pressure wave propagates from the area with good physical property to the area with poor physical property the curve will rise and rise but this stage is not a linear flow but is the result of physical property changes when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 the pressure wave propagates to the outer boundary in an irregular shape 4 3 influence of permeability ratio on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions in this analysis the regional storage ratio w1 w2 w3 and w4 are set to 1 1 1 and 1 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the different permeability ratios are shown in fig 12 the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 5 k3 10 k4 5 is the case 1 the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 10 k3 5 k4 10 is the case 2 and the permeability ratio for k1 1 k2 0 2 k3 1 k4 0 2 is the case 3 in the first two cases the permeability of internal areas 2 3 and 4 is better than that of area 1 fig 12 shows effects of different permeability ratios on typical curves in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions from the dimensionless pressure curve it can be seen that the dimensionless pressure in case 3 is much higher than that in the first two cases which also implies that the pressure loss is the largest in this case this is because the permeability ratio in the inner zone of case 3 is much smaller than that in the outer zone thus increasing the pressure loss in the early flow period the pressure loss of case 1 is slightly larger than that of case 2 this is because the sum of permeability in case 1 is slightly smaller than that in case 2 from the dimensionless pressure derivative curve it can be seen that there are more flow segment characteristics in case 3 mainly including bilinear flow segment linear flow segment quasi radial flow segment and boundary dominated flow segment however in the first two cases some flow segment characteristics cannot be found this is because when the permeability of the inner zone is small the pressure disturbance propagation is slow and more flow segments can appear when the permeability is large the pressure disturbance propagation affects the flow characteristics this can also be seen in fig 13 which shows evolution of pressure field different permeability ratios on typical curves in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions from fig 13 a and b show that the pressure disturbance as a whole presents an irregular shape and propagates to the boundary which is mainly affected by the irregular boundary it can also be seen that when the permeability of region 3 is higher than that of regions 2 and 4 the pressure loss near the fracture in region 3 is smaller as shown in fig 13 a however when the permeability ratio of region 3 is smaller than that of regions 2 and 4 the fracture pressure loss in region 3 is greater when the permeability of the inner zone is less than that of the outer zone as shown in fig 13 c at the same time the pressure propagation is also confined to the vicinity of the fracture and the propagation radius of the pressure wave is very small 4 4 influence of regional storage capacity ratio on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case fig 9 shows coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions in this analysis the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively according to the actual situation of fracturing reconstruction the boundary line of the reconstruction area and the boundary line of the whole area are irregular a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 and dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the different regional storage capacity ratios are shown in fig 14 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 is the case 1 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 01 w3 0 04 w4 0 01 is the case 2 the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 001 w3 0 004 w4 0 001 is the case 3 and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 0 0001 w3 0 0004 w4 0 0001 is the case 4 in these cases the storage capacity ratio of the inner zone is gradually reduced fig 14 shows influence of different regional storage capacity ratio on typical curve in heterogeneous reservoirs in irregular regions the regional storage capacity ratio reflects the storage capacity of the fluid in the region it can be seen from the pressure curve and derivative curve in fig 14 that when the storage capacity ratios of the four regions are the same corresponding to the first case the pressure loss is the lowest because the permeability ratios of the four regions are different and the permeability of the inner region is relatively small some special flow sections appear however as the storage capacity ratio of the inner zone gradually decreases the derivative curve shows a v shape which represents that the flow at this stage is from the outer zone to the inner zone the smaller the regional storage capacity ratio the deeper the v shape and the more fluid supplied from the outer zone to the inner zone fig 15 shows influence of different regional storage capacity on pressure field distribution in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from fig 15 that the larger the storage capacity ratio in the inner area the slower the propagation speed of the pressure wave to the outside and the smaller the possibility of getting external supply as the storage capacity ratio in the inner area gradually decreases the propagation speed of the pressure wave to the outside becomes faster however the growth rate of the propagation speed of this pressure wave gradually decreases in other words the storage volume ratio cannot influence the propagation speed of the pressure wave without limitation 4 5 influence of fracture conductivity on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 5 20 50 and 300 for four cases fig 16 shows the influence of different fracture conductivity on type curves in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from the pressure curve in the figure that the influence of fracture conductivity on the dimensionless pressure curve is mainly concentrated when the dimensionless time is less than 1 with the decrease of the conductivity the pressure loss increases gradually this also implies that a smaller fracture conductivity requires a larger pressure drop to produce the same output when the dimensionless time is greater than 1 all dimensionless pressure curves almost coincide implying that in the late stage of seepage the pressure loss is consistent and not affected by the fracture conductivity it can be seen from the derivative curve that the fracture conductivity seriously affects the early flow characteristics with the increase of fracture conductivity the bilinear flow section gradually disappears fig 17 shows the distribution and evolution of pressure field in multi region heterogeneous reservoir with high conductivity as can be seen from fig 17 a when the dimensionless time is equal to 0 1 the pressure wave propagation is mainly concentrated near the crack in the heterogeneous region as time goes on when the dimensionless time is equal to 1 the pressure wave in each heterogeneous region of the pressure wave diffuses outward however the pressure wave propagates faster in region 3 as shown in fig 17 b because the permeability ratio of this region is larger than that of other regions the pressure waves in region 2 and region 4 propagate slowly and the range appears to be the same when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 the pressure wave propagates far as can be seen from fig 17 c the equipotential lines between the fractures in several regions are connected into double kinks the equipotential lines at a distance are similar to elliptical shapes but affected by the boundary the equipotential lines show irregular phase in addition at the junction between regions it is obvious that the equipotential line has been seriously deformed under the influence of physical property changes when the dimensionless time is equal to 100 the pressure wave continues to propagate far away at this time the pressure wave mainly extends along the direction of the fracture and the pressure loss in this direction is the largest and it is also slowly expanding perpendicular to the direction of the fracture the deformation form of the equipotential line of the pressure field is seriously affected by the boundary of the heterogeneous region 4 6 influence of fracture number on typical curve for the multizone heterogeneous case the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 1 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 the number of fractures is set to 4 5 7 and 10 respectively fig 18 shows the influence of different fracture number on type curves in irregular shaped reservoirs it can be seen from the figure that the influence of the number of fractures on the pressure curve is mainly concentrated in the early and middle stages when the dimensionless time is less than 100 with the decrease of the fracture number the pressure loss increases gradually this also implies that a smaller fracture number requires a larger pressure drop to produce the same output derivative curve shows that with the increase of the number of fractures the interference becomes serious the transition flow appears and the linear flow time becomes shorter fig 19 shows the distribution and evolution of pressure field in multi region heterogeneous reservoir under different fracture number it can be seen from the pressure field diagram that when the dimensionless time is equal to 10 all pressure waves propagate to the inner region boundary since the permeability of regions 2 and 4 is only 1 5 of that of regions 1 and 3 the pressure drop near the fractures in regions 2 and 4 is greater the propagation of pressure wave shows a trend of squeezing towards the middle region the isobars spread outwards in an irregular shape with the increase of the number of fractures the propagation speed of pressure wave becomes slower and the pressure loss around the fractures decreases since the permeability difference between region 2 and region 4 is relatively large the equipotential lines among them are concentrated near the region in addition in the region with high permeability the interference between fractures increases with the number of fractures increasing 4 7 comparison of pressure response between irregular shaped reservoirs and rectangular reservoirs the coordinate diagram of heterogeneous reservoir connected by multiple regions is shown in fig 9 where the regional storage ratio k1 k2 k3 and k4 are set to 1 0 2 0 2 and 0 2 respectively and the regional storage capacity ratio for w1 1 w2 1 w3 1 w4 1 a horizontal well passes through three different reconstruction zones with three fractures where dimensionless fracture length lfdj is set to 2 the dimensionless conductivity cfdj for every fracture is set to 20 here we compare the pressure response of irregular shaped reservoirs and rectangular reservoirs in both cases we keep the area of the region the same and the area of the entire reservoir is 244 5 the total area of the inner zone is 93 23 see the sub figure of fig 20 for the schematic diagram of the two cases it can be seen from fig 20 that the irregular shape boundary has a certain influence on the pressure response in the early stage all pressure curves coincide in the late stage of flow the dimensionless pressure curve shows that the pressure of the irregular boundary is slightly lower than that of the rectangular reservoir suggesting that the reservoir with the irregular boundary will lead to small pressure loss it can be seen from the derivative curve that the shape of the boundary mainly affects the period of quasi steady flow and the irregular boundary condition prolongs the time of radial flow 4 8 advantages and limitation of the presented model in numerical methods such as finite element method numerical grid to characterize the reservoir is required to be established in the first step sufficiently large grid size is usually required to reduce the truncation error and enhance the simulation accuracy huge grid numbers may cause heavy computational burden which may require large computer memory and storage space in some cases when dealing with complex problems if the boundary shape changes the numerical mesh also needs to be changed accordingly for each update which may result in even more computational burden and may make the numerical simulation infeasible to perform the proposed model can flexibly deal with the flow problem of heterogeneous reservoirs without the need to divide the grid in the entire reservoir greatly reducing the calculation workload and does not require a lot of data preparation moreover the computational accuracy of the proposed model is sometimes comparable to that of the analytical solution in addition because it is solved in laplace space the discrete time is not needed which greatly reduces the computational complexity this article also reflects some limitations the use principle of bem is to find the green function of the problem for some more complex problems the green function may not exist or may not be easy to find which affects the promotion of bem in addition in the reservoir with strong heterogeneity there are many heterogeneous regions to be divided which will seriously restrict the use of the boundary element method in this case its computational efficiency cannot be reflected however we are still willing to believe that when solving the problem of unconventional reservoir flow from the perspective of computational complexity there is indeed the accuracy of analytical solution and the ability to deal with complex heterogeneity 5 summary and conclusions through the study the following conclusions were derived 1 this paper presents a general framework with boundary elements method to simulate pressure transient behavior for a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures in regional heterogeneous shale reservoirs with multiple connected regions the presented model has the ability to deal with the heterogeneity caused by volume fracturing and can obtain any result with any reservoir boundary shape 2 through this semi analytical model the reservoir can get accurate results without any mesh the accuracy of the model has been verified by numerical simulation in two cases i e homogeneous case and multi region connected heterogeneous case which shows that the proposed model is very reliable 3 flow characteristics for the multizone heterogeneous case is analyzed and divided into five segments i e bi linear flow segment showing 1 4 slope straight line on the derivative curves linear flow segment showing 1 2 slope straight line on the derivative curves radial flow segment the first boundary dominated flow segment and the second boundary dominated segment some flow segments cannot be observed due to parameter setting if the parameters are properly selected special flow segments such as the first radial flow the cross flow segment from the outer zone to the inner zone may also appear 4 the influence of the fracture and reservoir parameters on type curves for the multizone heterogeneous case is analyzed in detail mainly including area of irregular regions regional

2603,mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw are distributed worldwide and the impact of freeze thaw processes on the groundwater cycle is substantial for these mountainous areas the rational division of two key parameters namely the groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu and groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp is a prerequisite for the scientific evaluation of groundwater resource quantity this is especially important for the changbai mountains in jilin province china which have a distinct geology formed by volcanic processes and have experienced soil seasonal freeze thaw cycle implying drastic impacts on the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resources based on the groundwater flow system theory and considering the influences of freeze thaw cycles on the groundwater resource quantity we propose a new strategy to deal with the division of gcus and gcps three first level gcus eight second level gcus and fifty third level gcus were delineated within the changbai mountains five gcps were then determined and the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity was calculated for the different gcus and gcps the groundwater resource quantity in the five gcps no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting periods accounted for 62 25 11 51 11 58 5 05 and 9 61 of the total respectively the results provide a scientific basis for the exploitation of groundwater resource in different regions and periods of the study area and the proposed method offers a new reference strategy for the evaluation of groundwater resource in similar regions abbreviations dfm dual parameter filtering method gcp groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcu groundwater

was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a component of water resources groundwater resource generally has a regulatory effect on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources gao et al 2020 li et al 2019 wada et al 2012 the accurate evaluation of groundwater resource quantity is therefore essential for the effective development and utilization of the resources castellazzi et al 2016 muchingami et al 2019 particularly in mountainous areas where groundwater is unevenly distributed and is considerably affected by seasonal changes somers et al 2018 in comparison to plains mountainous areas are associated with greater challenges in terms of researching groundwater circulation evolution and evaluating groundwater resource quantity marques et al 2011 in recent years the frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events such as extreme rainfall events high temperatures and persistent drought have increased resende et al 2018 unesco 2020 mountainous areas are highly sensitive to these climate changes owing to their colder climatic conditions marques et al 2011 gomes et al 2021 rangwala and miller 2012 somers et al 2018 feng et al 2022 mountainous areas are often the source of rivers which play an important role in water supply for industrial agricultural and domestic uses within the mountainous region as well as the downstream systems taucare et al 2020 investigation of the groundwater cycle and the assessment of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas are therefore important research topics gurtz et al 2003 unesco 2020 generally the evaluation of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas is challenging due to the complexity of groundwater systems lezzaik and milewski 2018 manning and solomon 2005 oyarzún et al 2017 the methods commonly used for calculating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas include numerical and the water balance methods boronina et al 2003 marques et al 2011 the groundwater numerical model requires a clear understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer medium and the porosity and permeability of rock formations in addition it requires the use of long term monitoring data of the groundwater table and other variables however these datasets are often not abundant for mountainous areas idrizovic et al 2020 ofterdinger et al 2010 marques et al 2011 therefore various types of water balance studies have been employed in mountainous areas to quantify groundwater storage recharge and discharge andermann et al 2012 clark et al 2014 cochand et al 2019 hood and hayashi 2015 markovich et al 2019 previous investigations have shown that many mountain rivers are mainly driven by groundwater cochand et al 2019 eckhardt 2008 viviroli et al 2007 this provides a basis for estimating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas using the baseflow i e groundwater discharge separation method the traditional water balance method has been widely used to evaluate groundwater resource quantity and to support the scientific development utilization and protection of water resources in various regions markovich et al 2019 zhou 2009 when using the water balance method to calculate the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu and groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp should be divided the gcus are broadly similar to hydrological response unit hru but focus on the factors specifically affecting the distribution of groundwater resource quantity the common method is to divide gcus according to the lithologic and geomorphic unit characteristics mainly based on the idea of a groundwater water bearing system corniello et al 2018 zhang 2008 for the gcp one hydrological year is usually used as the basic period to calculate the groundwater resource quantity of each gcu liu 2014 wang and dai 2021 zhang 2008 however this typical strategy has the following limitations when applied to mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw 1 regarding gcu division the division of gcu mainly focuses on the concept of groundwater water bearing systems i e the water bearing rock series that has a unified hydraulic connection and is enclosed by an aquiclude or aquitard however the complex terrain and geological conditions in mountainous areas make the flow and distribution of groundwater more complex gleeson and manning 2008 winter 2001 the heterogeneities of the geological conditions combined with the complex topography can cause groundwater to be exported or imported across the boundary of the topographically defined watershed fan 2019 therefore a groundwater water bearing system may span multiple groundwater flow systems markovich et al 2019 thus the assessment of groundwater resource of different gcus is based on the concept that groundwater water bearing system cannot effectively serve the development and utilization of groundwater in different local areas of mountainous regions in contrast the concept of the groundwater flow system is better suited for objectively describing the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity than that of groundwater water bearing system in a mountainous area the groundwater flow system refers to the groundwater flow with uniform temporal and spatial evolution according to the runoff process from the recharge area source to discharge area sink in a groundwater system therefore it better reflects the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 2 regarding gcp division freeze thaw processes effectively alter the structure and permeability of the soil as the temperature and moisture varies which in turn substantially impact the formation and migration of groundwater and its distribution dai et al 2019 hagedorn 2020 lone et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 the frozen soil acts as a low permeability formation which substantially hinders the infiltration of surface water lyu et al 2022 considering this the commonly used gcp method overlooks this effect of seasonal freeze thaw on the temporal variation of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas therefore the results cannot effectively guide the dynamic exploitation and utilization of groundwater within these regions approximately 50 5 of the land area in the northern hemisphere and 53 5 of the land area in china experiences seasonal freeze thaw cycles zhang et al 2003 cao 2017 therefore it is necessary to devise a new strategy for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw to completely understand formation characteristics of groundwater and the effect of the seasonal freeze thaw cycle on groundwater resource quantity in this study using the changbai mountains as an example we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of hydrogeological conditions and topographical features of this region and proposed a new strategy suitable for evaluating the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw the proposed strategy is expected to provide a reference for the accurate evaluation of groundwater resource quantity and support the dynamic development utilization and protection of groundwater resource in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the changbai mountains located in southeast jilin province china fig 1 experience seasonal freeze thaw process changbai tianchi lake is situated near the southeast corner of the mountains the study area 126 30 127 49 e 41 42 42 49 n spans over 13 465 km2 and has an elevation of 550 2 600 m as the highest mountains in northeast china the changbai mountains are the source area of several large rivers wang et al 2013 shen et al 2013 the study area is characterized by a typical temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation during 1960 2010 ranging from 686 to 1 400 mm showing an increase with elevation the majority of precipitation falls between june and august zhao et al 2015 accounting for approximately 60 of the annual precipitation the average annual temperature decreases with elevation from approximately 2 8 c at 700 m to 3 8 c at 2 000 m yu 2011 the temperature of the region ranges from 20 0 c to 20 9 c in july and from 17 7 c to 15 5 c in january summers in the study area are short and rainy whereas the winters are long and cold soil freezing begins in mid november and thawing begins in april of the following year the area has 110 120 frost free days guo et al 2016 in the study area atmospheric precipitation is the only recharge source of groundwater according to the field investigation and previous research the groundwater table in the mountainous area is always higher than the river valley water level in the study area discharging to the river is the main way of groundwater discharge in the changbai mountains moreover in the dry season baseflow accounts for 90 of the total surface runoff wang and dai 2021 there are several major rivers in the study area including the songhua second songhua zhuzi songjiang manjiang erdao and dasha rivers hydrologic stations have been set up in these major basins to monitor surface runoff and water temperature the study area experiences soil freeze thaw cycles seasonally with a freezing depth of 0 7 2 3 m the average freeze thaw process generally lasts approximately eight months from october to april of the following year zhou et al 2011 the study area consists of a series of ne trending mountains and broad inter mountain basins with large topographic fluctuations with the main peak of changbai mountain as the center the terrain elevation gradually decreases to the surrounding terrain the study area is home to well developed active faults and volcanic structures are also widespread in the region fig 2 the area has experienced multiple stages of volcanic eruptions including basalt shield formation trachyte cone formation and eruption slag stage the basalt caprock formed in the shield building stage is widely exposed in the study area with a thickness of 15 350 m it has resulted in the formation of a step like platform landform thus forming the volcanic lava low and high platforms fig 2 sun et al 2019 the abundance of pores in these basalts provides favorable conditions for the storage and migration of groundwater in the study area wang and dai 2021 the formation and distribution of groundwater in the study area are controlled by complex geological structures and multi stage volcanic activity according to the characteristics of the water bearing formation the groundwater can be divided into basalt fissure bedrock fissure clastic rock pore fissure and carbonate rock fissure karst waters basalt fissure water is mainly distributed in the high and low platform areas of the volcanic lava the aquifer is composed of stomatal basalt with good reservoir conditions and abundant groundwater in areas where bedrock fissure water is distributed the water bearing formations are composed of granite and diorite and can be characterized by unevenly developed structural fissures with relatively poor groundwater abundance the bedrock is directly exposed to the surface or covered by a 10 20 cm thick humus layer these conditions are responsible for relatively slow groundwater movement in the bedrock in the clastic rock basin area water in primarily confined in the pore fissures its water bearing rock formation includes sandstone conglomerate and pyroclastic rocks with well developed fissures and relatively abundant groundwater the carbonate rock fissure karst water is distributed in the mid west of the study area and its distribution area is small the groundwater abundance in the changbai mountains has been investigated and evaluated in previous studies based on streamflow monitoring data of a hydrologic station zhang 2008 and wang and dai 2021 estimated regional jingyu fusong and antu counties groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method to be 14 48 108 and 11 55 108 m3 a respectively since wang and dai 2021 used the minimum runoff in the dry season as the baseflow separation data the calculation result of groundwater resource quantity was smaller than that of zhang 2008 yang 2003 using the large spring discharge accumulation method evaluated regional jingyu and fusong counties groundwater resource quantity to be 6 25 108 m3 a however the results of this method likely underestimated the total resource quantity as it is impossible to measure the discharge of all springs in other previous studies the assessment of groundwater resource quantity was conducted considering one year as the calculation period with no time division within that year rendering only one gcp furthermore the division of the gcus was primarily based on the type of water bearing formation although these previous determined groundwater quantity values have some shortcomings in terms of the gcp and gcu division the results still provide a comparative basis for this study 2 2 research strategy in this study we propose a new strategy for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw based on the topography lithology type of water bearing formation and characteristics of seasonal freeze thaw processes in the study area fig 3 the proposed strategy accounts for the shortcomings of the gcu division from previous calculations of groundwater resource in mountainous areas and the negligence of the influence of freeze thaw processes in previous studies the appropriate division of gcus and gcps is a key prerequisite for calculating groundwater resource quantity dividing multiple gcus can effectively express the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in mountain areas furthermore the division of multiple gcps can effectively express the impact of the freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity in this study the division of gcus was based on the groundwater flow system along with hydrogeological unit characteristics fig 3 the principles for the division of gcus were as follows i gcus were divided considering the comprehensive influence of the surface watershed topography landform and lithology ii groundwater within the same groundwater flow system can be assumed to have a unified hydraulic connection with a unified flow field and spatiotemporal evolution of water quantity along the flow direction toth 1980 therefore the unified flow field among different water bearing rock series was used as the basis for the division of the groundwater flow system iii the groundwater division coincided with the corresponding surface watershed to ensure the independence of the each gcu from the angle perspective of groundwater exploitation and utilization the concept of the groundwater flow system is suitable for objectively describing the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity in a mountainous area comparing to the method that commonly used in the division of gcu this strategy can better reflect the non uniform distribution of groundwater in mountainous areas the division of gcp was conducted on the basis of the influence of the soil freeze thaw process on the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity the principles for the division of gcp are as follows i the gcp was divided into more stages according to the soil seasonal freeze thaw process ii the variation of atmospheric temperature soil temperature and soil liquid water content in the soil freeze thaw process was comprehensively considered iii the difference of soil freeze thaw process at different altitudes and locations in study area was considered the difference in the gcp division in this paper was that a hydrological year was subdivided into more periods by considering the influence of the freeze thaw process on the temporal distribution of groundwater resources 2 3 data sources to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the study area we collected geological and hydrogeological survey reports from multiple time periods furthermore the monitoring data for 10 consecutive years were collected from seven river hydrologic stations and meteorological data were collected from two weather stations four field surveys were carried out between august 2020 and january 2022 we examined 20 geological survey sites and 35 soil survey sites 39 survey sites of groundwater table and 31 survey sites of river level fig 4 two real time monitoring points teros 12 soil moisture sensors of soil moisture temperature and conductance and six groundwater table monitoring points hobo u20 water pressure sensors were established fig

station fig 5 from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the china meteorological data network https www data cma cn the daily cumulative precipitation fig 6 from 8 00 to 20 00 was recorded using an artificial sensor with a pluviometer air temperatures were monitored using a temperature sensor hwn 201 runoff data were collected from the northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences and included the daily observed runoff data of seven hydrologic stations s1 s7 in the study area from 2006 to 2016 fig 5 recharged by meltwater and seasonal precipitation the annual streamflow of the rivers presented double flood peaks fig 6 runoff from april to may accounted for 23 3 to 35 7 of the annual runoff and that from july to august accounted for 29 3 to 36 1 of the annual runoff fig 6 to obtain real time soil temperature and liquid water content data for describing the freeze thaw process of soil two real time soil moisture monitors teros 12 were deployed in the field fig 5 at sites ts01 and ts02 site ts01 was located in choushui town fig 5 in the intermountain basin where the topsoil type was baijiang soil clayey silt the depth of the groundwater table at ts01 was 10 m site ts02 was located in songjianghe town fig 5 on the basalt platform where the topsoil type was brunisolic soil sandy soil the depth of the groundwater table at ts02 was 5 m the baijiang and brunisolic soils are widely distributed in the study area fig 5 the total area of the two soil types accounted for approximately 88 of the study area therefore the two monitoring sites were representative of the typical soil type and topography of the study area the settings of the soil monitoring profiles are displayed in fig 7 the monitoring depths were set at 20 40 70 100 and 150 cm the soil temperature and liquid water content were monitored in real time at specific depths to completely understand the freezing and thawing process in different areas when soil temperature drops below 0 c the moisture in the soil starts to freeze thus a stable negative temperature indicated that the soil was frozen 2 4 method for calculating groundwater resource quantity the term groundwater resource quantity has different connotations staudinger et al 2019 in this study it refers to the sustainably obtainable quantity of groundwater under natural conditions and is differentiated from the entire amount of groundwater in the saturated zone in general the amount of groundwater in an aquifer including the amount below the fluctuating groundwater table as well as the runoff is greater than average groundwater discharge over many years from the perspective of the exploitation and utilization of groundwater resource the continuous recharge or stable discharge of a groundwater system is of great importance chi et al 2009 from the perspective of water balance for a groundwater system with rhythmic water level changes the sustainably obtainable quantity of groundwater resource can be estimated based on the data of groundwater discharge for multiple years for the study area it was difficult to accurately evaluate the total groundwater amount including the groundwater runoff and stock below the fluctuation zone of the groundwater level owing to the complex geological conditions for groundwater in mountainous areas in general there may be inconsistencies between the groundwater watershed and surface watershed owing to the constraints of different geological conditions and topography which can lead to the drainage of groundwater into adjacent basins through underground runoff markovich et al 2019 in such scenarios the estimation of groundwater resource quantity by baseflow separation in mountainous areas could be biased the present field survey and previous studies in the study area have confirmed that the groundwater in the changbai mountains is primarily discharged into surface water rivers in the form of baseflow wang and dai 2021 this lays a foundation for the estimation of groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method in this study previous studies have shown that using continuous groundwater discharge to estimate available groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas is an effective and feasible approach cochand et al 2019 eckhardt 2008 moreover all seven hydrologic stations in the study area have long series of monitoring data providing a favorable basis for the evaluation of groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method baseflow which is the amount of groundwater discharged into the river can be calculated from runoff data using the baseflow separation method there are different baseflow separation methods eckhardt 2005 welch and allen 2012 yang et al 2019 one of them the dual parameter filtering method dfm has been widely used because it avoids the subjectivity and randomness of manual hydrologic chart separation eckhardt 2005 relevant studies have shown that the dfm can effectively calculate baseflow in mountainous areas li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the baseflow equation in dfm is presented in eq 1 1 q b i 1 b f i max α q b i 1 1 α b f i max q i 1 α b f i max where α represents the recession index bfi max represents the maximum baseflow index i represents the time step q b i represents the baseflow at the i th moment m3 s and q i represents the total runoff m3 s lastly q b represents the corresponding total baseflow amount of each hydrologic station s1 s7 in the control area in the watershed controlled by hydrological station the groundwater resource quantity in the controlled area is obtained by baseflow separation method on this basis the groundwater runoff modulus grm of the watershed is calculated for watersheds without hydrologic station control the analogy watershed which has hydrologic station were determined by comparing the topographic and hydrogeological conditions then the groundwater runoff modulus of the analogy watershed is applied to the watershed without a hydrologic station by the hydrogeologic analogy method finally the groundwater resource quantity in the watershed without hydrologic station control is calculated the formulas used in the calculation are as follows 2 gr m third l e v e l q b t f hydr 3 q g t h i r d l e v e l f third l e v e l g r m third l e v e l where qb t represents the baseflow of each gcp m3 t grmthird level represents the groundwater runoff modulus in the third level gcu m3 t km2 f hydr represents the control area of the hydrologic station km2 q g third level represents the groundwater resource quantity of the third level gcu at each gcp m3 t fthird level represents the area of the third level gcu km2 and t represents the number of days of the gcp 3 results based on the proposed research strategy the gcus and gcps were divided before the calculation of groundwater resource quantity 3 1 division of groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu the gcu division of the study area was performed according to the abovementioned three principles of gcu division first three first level gcus system i ii and iii were defined according to the surface basin of the macro regional topography and patterns of groundwater runoff fig 8 second based on the division of first level gcus and taking into account the local surface watershed and the direction of groundwater flow eight second level gcus subsystem i1 i2 i3 ii1 ii2 ii3 iii1 and iii2 were defined fig 9 finally based on the division of first level and second level gcus third level gcus were divided considering the influence of the characteristics of water bearing formations and local topographic factors seven types of water bearing formations a g were identified with a total of 50 third level gcus fig 9 the area lithology elevation and topsoil type of the gcus are listed in table 1 3 2 division of the groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp based on the atmospheric temperature data of the jy and dg weather stations the soil temperature and liquid water content of the soil monitoring sites ts01 and ts02 fig 10 and fig 11 a field survey of freezing and thawing states and five gcps no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting were defined the characteristics of each gcp are as follows ① no freezing period from may 1 to september 30 lasting 153 days the soil was non frozen and the soil temperature was consistently above 0 c fig 10 affected by precipitation the liquid water content of the soil showed a regular fluctuation fig 11 ② unstable freezing period from october 1 to november 20 lasting 51 days at the beginning of october the temperature at night was below 0 c according to the field survey the surface soil began to freeze in the mountains at relatively high altitudes the soil temperature at different depths began to gradually decline especially at a depth of 20 cm fig 10 affected by the freeze thaw process the liquid water content of the soil showed a sudden upsurge trend or a sudden declining trend fig 11 therefore we considered october 1 as the starting point for the unstable freezing period with a continuous drop in temperature the soil shifted to the stable freezing period ③ stable freezing period from november 21 to february 14 lasting 86 days after november 21 both the atmospheric day and night temperatures were consistently below 0 c and the topsoil was frozen steadily affected by freezing the volumetric water content of soil at the 20 and 40 cm depths showed remarkable declining trends fig 11 by the beginning of the following january the atmospheric and soil temperatures began to rise however during the rise the soil temperature at the monitoring depths remained below 0 c at depths shallower than 70 cm and the soil remained in a stable freezing state fig 10 the liquid water content of the soil reached the lowest value ④ unstable melting period from february 15 to march 31 lasting 45 days by february 15 the atmospheric temperature was above 0 c during the day and below 0 c at night during this period the surface soil was considerably affected by atmospheric temperature soil temperature at 20 cm depth increased evidently with the rise and fall in air temperature soil water began to melt during the day and freeze at night affected by the freezing and thawing processes the liquid water content of the upper soil layers 20 and 40 cm showed a fluctuating upward trend fig 11 ⑤ stable melting period from april 1 to 30 lasting 30 days following april 1 the air temperatures continuously increased with occasional drops below 0 c the soil temperature at 20 cm depth also began to increase steadily and a stage of stable melting was reached these data combined with the field survey indicated that during april 8 25 the soil still contained ice and was melting in some areas at relatively high altitudes by the end of april the soil had completely melted fig 10 recharged by meltwater the liquid water content in the middle and upper parts of the soil 20 40 and 70 cm showed a rapid upward trend and then began to decline slowly until the end of april therefore considering the regional differences in the thawing process april 30 was selected as the end date of the stable thawing period 3 3 calculation of groundwater resource quantity the baseflow qb of each gcp was calculated in the control area of different hydrologic stations s1 s7 according to eq 1 the ratio of baseflow to the total runoff in the control area of each hydrologic station is shown in fig 12 the smallest ratio value occurred in the no freezing period and the highest in the stable freezing period the variation trend in the baseflow to runoff ratio indicates the influence of freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity the grm in seven types of third level gcus a g was obtained using eq 2 the results are shown in table 2 according to the division of the third level gcus in the study area the grm of the 50 third level gcus was calculated for the five gcps fig 13 the groundwater resource quantity of the 50 third level gcus was calculated using eq 3 then the groundwater resource quantity of the corresponding second level gcus was obtained by adding the groundwater resource quantity of all third level gcus similarly the groundwater resource quantity of the first level gcus was determined by adding the groundwater resource quantity of the corresponding second level gcus 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater resource quantity the groundwater resource quantity in the study area was calculated based on the proposed strategy fig 14 the groundwater resource quantity was 14 24 108 m3 a as this result does not consider the exploitation of large mineral springs in the study area it should be considered conservative previous work in the study area estimated the groundwater resource quantity zhang 2008 but with different study area boundaries which were not consistent with those in the current study upon converting the equivalent area the groundwater resource quantity of previously reported was 14 48 108 m3 a in the equivalent area this value is similar to our result considering that our result was conservative it can be inferred that our calculation results of the total groundwater resource quantity are reliable the current study contributes remarkably to the field by proposing a new approach of the strategy which considers the influence of freeze thaw cycles and is based on the concept of the groundwater flow system in addition the spatial and temporal distribution differences of groundwater resource quantity in seasonal freeze thaw mountains is carefully reflected at different locations and time periods of the study area based on the calculation results of groundwater resource quantities in 50 third level gcus we obtained the groundwater resource quantity in the eight corresponding second level gcus and then the amount of the three first level gcus was determined the groundwater resource quantity of system i was 2 70 108 m3 a accounting for 18 96 of the total that of system ii was 6 64 108 m3 a accounting for 46 63 of the total and that of system iii was 4 90 108 m3 a accounting for 34 41 of the total the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the eight second level gcus is as follows for the three second level gcus in system i the amount of groundwater resources of i1 naerhong subsystem was 0 80 108 m3 a accounting for 29 63 of system i the amount of groundwater resources of i2 zhuzi subsystem was 1 14 108 m3 a accounting for 42 22 of system i and that of i3 zhengshen subsystem was 0 76 108 m3 a accounting for 28 15 of system i fig 14 the subsystem i1 and i2 had similar areas 1 147 and 1 070 km2 respectively table 1 however groundwater resource quantity in i2 were considerably more abundant than those in i1 this is due to the abundant basalt pores and fissures in the water bearing medium in i2 although the area of i1 was slightly larger than that of i2 the amount of groundwater resources in i1 was only 70 18 of that in i2 this is due to the water bearing medium of i1 being mainly composed of granite bedrock fissures for subsystem i3 although its total area 750 km2 was substantially smaller than that of i1 1 147 km2 the amount of groundwater resources in i3 was highly similar to that in i1 this is attributed to a bigger area 301 km2 of basalt pore fissure water in i3 than that in i1 108 km2 table 1 therefore it was determined that the basalt pore fissure water bearing medium has abundant groundwater system ii had the most abundant groundwater resources owing to its wide distribution of basalt in the areas surrounding tianchi lake altitude 1 000 m which contains well developed basalt pores and fissures the groundwater resource quantity was abundant with a grm higher than 17 104 m3 a km2 the sum of all five gcps in the basalt platform area with an altitude of less than 1 000 m the grm was approximately 10 104 m3 a km2 which equals the sum of the five gcps furthermore the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in system ii was also impacted by topography the amount of groundwater resources of subsystem ii1 lazi subsystem was 1 08 108 m3 a accounting for 16 29 of the total groundwater resource quantity of system ii that of subsystem ii2 songjiang subsystem was 2 94 108 m3 a accounting for 44 34 of the total and that of subsystem ii3 manjiang subsystem was 2 61 108 m3 a accounting for 39 37 of the total fig 14 in areas of the subsystem ii2 and ii3 with elevations 1 000 m the surface was covered by volcanic ash soil table 1 which has high porosity and good permeability facilitating precipitation infiltration into the ground li et al 2007 in addition the basalt rock layer in the subsystem ii2 and ii3 was 100 m in thickness with abundant pores and fissures and is characterized by good connectivity with strong permeability therefore the groundwater resource quantity in the subsystem ii2 and ii3 are abundant accounting for 81 71 of the total groundwater resource quantity of system ii impacted by the variation in the water bearing medium and subsystem area the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in system iii varied greatly the groundwater resource quantity in subsystem iii1 gudong subsystem was poor with only 0 56 108 m3 a accounting for 11 43 of the total groundwater resource quantity in system iii however the groundwater resource quantity in subsystem iii2 erdaobai subsystem was relatively large 4 27 108 m3 a accounting for 88 57 of the total fig 14 the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the eight second level gcus is shown in fig 14 these results of the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in different subsystems can potentially guide groundwater resource exploitation within the study area on a reasonable and scientific basis 4 2 temporal distribution characteristics of groundwater resource quantity the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in each gcp was determined for the different gcus in the study area fig 15 shows that the temporal variation in the groundwater resource quantity in the study area was substantial indicating that the seasonal freeze thaw process remarkably impacted the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity it was also confirmed that it is necessary to consider the influence of freezing thawing while calculating groundwater resource quantity the no freezing period lasted 153 days and correlated with the most abundant quantity of groundwater resources the quantity was 8 87 108 m3 in that period accounting for 62 25 of the total amount fig 15 most of the precipitation occurred during the no freezing period and groundwater was recharged by the infiltration of precipitation without the retardation influence of the freeze thaw process during that period the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 5 80 106 m3 d fig 16 the unstable freezing period lasted 51 days and the groundwater resource quantity was 1 63 108 m3 accounting for 11 51 of the total amount in that period under the combined influence of reduced precipitation and topsoil freezing infiltration recharge decreased considerably in addition the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 3 20 106 m3 d fig 16 for the stable freezing period which lasted 86 days the groundwater resource quantity was 1 65 108 m3 accounting for 11 58 of the total during that period according to the real time soil monitoring data fig 10 the thickness of the frozen soil reached 70 cm in depth the frozen soil had low permeability and the precipitation mainly consisted of snow under the joint impact of these factors the infiltration recharge decreased substantially as a result the groundwater resource quantity gradually decreased during this period and the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 1 92 106 m3 d fig 16 although the groundwater discharge into the river decreased during unstable and stable freezing periods the contribution ratio of baseflow to the river increased fig 12 during the period of decreased precipitation which was mainly in the form of snow the direct surface water runoff decreased simultaneously xie et al 2021 as a result the ratio of baseflow to the river gradually increased during the freezing period fig 12 the unstable and stable melting periods lasted 45 and 30 days respectively the groundwater resource quantity in the unstable melting period was 0 72 108 m3 accounting for 5 05 of the total whereas during the stable melting period it was 1 37 108 m3 accounting for 9 61 of the total the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 1 60 106 m3 d in the unstable melting period and 4 57 106 m3 d in the stable melting period fig 16 upon comparing the average daily groundwater resource quantity in different gcps fig 16 it was found that the average daily groundwater resource quantity was highest in the no freezing period followed by that in the stable melting period during the stable melting period where the frozen water in the soil began to melt and the soil permeability gradually increased demand et al 2019 lyu et al 2022 the groundwater could accept recharge by precipitation meltwater and lateral upstream groundwater input collectively therefore the groundwater discharge into the river the base flow was relatively large in that period fig 6 interestingly the minimum daily average of groundwater resource quantity was observed during the unstable melting period rather than during the stable freezing period the values were 1 92 106 and 1 60 106 m3 d respectively one of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the retardation effect of groundwater recharge in the study area cheng et al 2022 the study of the dynamic change in groundwater levels in the study area further confirms this inference cheng et al 2022 4 3 spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater resource based on the strategy proposed in this study we determined the allocation of groundwater resource in different zones fig 14 and periods fig 15 in the study area the daily average groundwater resource quantity in different periods was also determined fig 16 consistent with the above mentioned results the spatial and temporal distribution of the groundwater resource quantity in different second level gcus is shown in fig 17 the figure shows that the subsystems i1 and i3 had a smaller groundwater resource quantity whereas subsystems ii2 and ii3 had a relatively large groundwater resource quantity subsystem iii2 had the most abundant groundwater resource quantity in terms of groundwater resource exploitation the total amount in each system and the change in daily groundwater resource based on different periods should be comprehensively considered overall the results provided a favorable basis for considering groundwater exploitation across different regions and according to different periods in the study area the optimal management of the development and utilization of groundwater in the study area needs to be combined with the characteristics of industrial and agricultural production and domestic water and the local government s development planning the impact of the distribution of nature reserves in the study area on the development and utilization of water resources also needs to be considered optimizing the development utilization and management of groundwater resources in the study area based on the results of this research is the main research focus in the next stage of work 5 conclusion based on the concept of the groundwater flow system and considering the influence of seasonal freeze thaw processes on groundwater resource a new strategy was proposed to deal with the spatiotemporal distribution of the groundwater resource quantity in the changbai mountains the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 for the mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw rational division of gcus and gcps is the key prerequisite for scientific evaluation of groundwater resources because of the complexity of the terrain and geological conditions in mountainous areas the usual practice of dividing gcus according to lithologic and geomorphic unit characteristics is not a good strategy this study demonstrated that the gcu s division strategy based on the groundwater flow system theory can better express the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in mountainous areas and thus is more conducive to the accurate calculation of groundwater resource quantity in these areas and to guide the exploitation of groundwater resources 2 it is necessary to consider the effect of freeze thaw processes while calculating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas the division of multiple gcps can effectively express the impact of the freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity the groundwater resource quantity in the no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting periods accounted for 62 25 11 51 11 58 5 05 and 9 61 of the total respectively the calculation results of groundwater resource quantity in each gcp support the dynamic exploitation of groundwater resource in the study area 3 based on the calculation results of total groundwater resource quantity of different gcus and gcps and combined with the daily groundwater resource quantity in the different gcus of the study area the spatial and temporal distribution map of groundwater resource quantity was developed the map provides a new basis for planning the exploitation of groundwater resource at different regions and periods of the study area seasonal freeze thaw mountains are distributed worldwide the complex terrain and geological conditions of mountainous areas and the influence of freeze thaw cycles make the accurate calculation of groundwater resource quantity in these areas difficult considering the changbai mountain area of china as an example this study proposed a new strategy to deal with the calculation of groundwater resource quantity in seasonal freeze thaw mountainous areas our findings can be used as a reference for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in other seasonal freeze thaw mountainous areas funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

2603,mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw are distributed worldwide and the impact of freeze thaw processes on the groundwater cycle is substantial for these mountainous areas the rational division of two key parameters namely the groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu and groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp is a prerequisite for the scientific evaluation of groundwater resource quantity this is especially important for the changbai mountains in jilin province china which have a distinct geology formed by volcanic processes and have experienced soil seasonal freeze thaw cycle implying drastic impacts on the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resources based on the groundwater flow system theory and considering the influences of freeze thaw cycles on the groundwater resource quantity we propose a new strategy to deal with the division of gcus and gcps three first level gcus eight second level gcus and fifty third level gcus were delineated within the changbai mountains five gcps were then determined and the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity was calculated for the different gcus and gcps the groundwater resource quantity in the five gcps no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting periods accounted for 62 25 11 51 11 58 5 05 and 9 61 of the total respectively the results provide a scientific basis for the exploitation of groundwater resource in different regions and periods of the study area and the proposed method offers a new

was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a component of water resources groundwater resource generally has a regulatory effect on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources gao et al 2020 li et al 2019 wada et al 2012 the accurate evaluation of groundwater resource quantity is therefore essential for the effective development and utilization of the resources castellazzi et al 2016 muchingami et al 2019 particularly in mountainous areas where groundwater is unevenly distributed and is considerably affected by seasonal changes somers et al 2018 in comparison to plains mountainous areas are associated with greater challenges in terms of researching groundwater circulation evolution and evaluating groundwater resource quantity marques et al 2011 in recent years the frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events such as extreme rainfall events high temperatures and persistent drought have increased resende et al 2018 unesco 2020 mountainous areas are highly sensitive to these climate changes owing to their colder climatic conditions marques et al 2011 gomes et al 2021 rangwala and miller 2012 somers et al 2018 feng et al 2022 mountainous areas are often the source of rivers which play an important role in water supply for industrial agricultural and domestic uses within the mountainous region as well as the downstream systems taucare et al 2020 investigation of the groundwater cycle and the assessment of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas are therefore important research topics gurtz et al 2003 unesco 2020 generally the evaluation of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas is challenging due to the complexity of groundwater systems lezzaik and milewski 2018 manning and solomon 2005 oyarzún et al 2017 the methods commonly used for calculating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas include numerical and the water balance methods boronina et al 2003 marques et al 2011 the groundwater numerical model requires a clear understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer medium and the porosity and permeability of rock formations in addition it requires the use of long term monitoring data of the groundwater table and other variables however these datasets are often not abundant for mountainous areas idrizovic et al 2020 ofterdinger et al 2010 marques et al 2011 therefore various types of water balance studies have been employed in mountainous areas to quantify groundwater storage recharge and discharge andermann et al 2012 clark et al 2014 cochand et al 2019 hood and hayashi 2015 markovich et al 2019 previous investigations have shown that many mountain rivers are mainly driven by groundwater cochand et al 2019 eckhardt 2008 viviroli et al 2007 this provides a basis for estimating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas using the baseflow i e groundwater discharge separation method the traditional water balance method has been widely used to evaluate groundwater resource quantity and to support the scientific development utilization and protection of water resources in various regions markovich et al 2019 zhou 2009 when using the water balance method to calculate the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu and groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp should be divided the gcus are broadly similar to hydrological response unit hru but focus on the factors specifically affecting the distribution of groundwater resource quantity the common method is to divide gcus according to the lithologic and geomorphic unit characteristics mainly based on the idea of a groundwater water bearing system corniello et al 2018 zhang 2008 for the gcp one hydrological year is usually used as the basic period to calculate the groundwater resource quantity of each gcu liu 2014 wang and dai 2021 zhang 2008 however this typical strategy has the following limitations when applied to mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw 1 regarding gcu division the division of gcu mainly focuses on the concept of groundwater water bearing systems i e the water bearing rock series that has a unified hydraulic connection and is enclosed by an aquiclude or aquitard however the complex terrain and geological conditions in mountainous areas make the flow and distribution of groundwater more complex gleeson and manning 2008 winter 2001 the heterogeneities of the geological conditions combined with the complex topography can cause groundwater to be exported or imported across the boundary of the topographically defined watershed fan 2019 therefore a groundwater water bearing system may span multiple groundwater flow systems markovich et al 2019 thus the assessment of groundwater resource of different gcus is based on the concept that groundwater water bearing system cannot effectively serve the development and utilization of groundwater in different local areas of mountainous regions in contrast the concept of the groundwater flow system is better suited for objectively describing the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity than that of groundwater water bearing system in a mountainous area the groundwater flow system refers to the groundwater flow with uniform temporal and spatial evolution according to the runoff process from the recharge area source to discharge area sink in a groundwater system therefore it better reflects the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 2 regarding gcp division freeze thaw processes effectively alter the structure and permeability of the soil as the temperature and moisture varies which in turn substantially impact the formation and migration of groundwater and its distribution dai et al 2019 hagedorn 2020 lone et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 the frozen soil acts as a low permeability formation which substantially hinders the infiltration of surface water lyu et al 2022 considering this the commonly used gcp method overlooks this effect of seasonal freeze thaw on the temporal variation of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas therefore the results cannot effectively guide the dynamic exploitation and utilization of groundwater within these regions approximately 50 5 of the land area in the northern hemisphere and 53 5 of the land area in china experiences seasonal freeze thaw cycles zhang et al 2003 cao 2017 therefore it is necessary to devise a new strategy for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw to completely understand formation characteristics of groundwater and the effect of the seasonal freeze thaw cycle on groundwater resource quantity in this study using the changbai mountains as an example we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of hydrogeological conditions and topographical features of this region and proposed a new strategy suitable for evaluating the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw the proposed strategy is expected to provide a reference for the accurate evaluation of groundwater resource quantity and support the dynamic development utilization and protection of groundwater resource in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the changbai mountains located in southeast jilin province china fig 1 experience seasonal freeze thaw process changbai tianchi lake is situated near the southeast corner of the mountains the study area 126 30 127 49 e 41 42 42 49 n spans over 13 465 km2 and has an elevation of 550 2 600 m as the highest mountains in northeast china the changbai mountains are the source area of several large rivers wang et al 2013 shen et al 2013 the study area is characterized by a typical temperate continental monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation during 1960 2010 ranging from 686 to 1 400 mm showing an increase with elevation the majority of precipitation falls between june and august zhao et al 2015 accounting for approximately 60 of the annual precipitation the average annual temperature decreases with elevation from approximately 2 8 c at 700 m to 3 8 c at 2 000 m yu 2011 the temperature of the region ranges from 20 0 c to 20 9 c in july and from 17 7 c to 15 5 c in january summers in the study area are short and rainy whereas the winters are long and cold soil freezing begins in mid november and thawing begins in april of the following year the area has 110 120 frost free days guo et al 2016 in the study area atmospheric precipitation is the only recharge source of groundwater according to the field investigation and previous research the groundwater table in the mountainous area is always higher than the river valley water level in the study area discharging to the river is the main way of groundwater discharge in the changbai mountains moreover in the dry season baseflow accounts for 90 of the total surface runoff wang and dai 2021 there are several major rivers in the study area including the songhua second songhua zhuzi songjiang manjiang erdao and dasha rivers hydrologic stations have been set up in these major basins to monitor surface runoff and water temperature the study area experiences soil freeze thaw cycles seasonally with a freezing depth of 0 7 2 3 m the average freeze thaw process generally lasts approximately eight months from october to april of the following year zhou et al 2011 the study area consists of a series of ne trending mountains and broad inter mountain basins with large topographic fluctuations with the main peak of changbai mountain as the center the terrain elevation gradually decreases to the surrounding terrain the study area is home to well developed active faults and volcanic structures are also widespread in the region fig 2 the area has experienced multiple stages of volcanic eruptions including basalt shield formation trachyte cone formation and eruption slag stage the basalt caprock formed in the shield building stage is widely exposed in the study area with a thickness of 15 350 m it has resulted in the formation of a step like platform landform thus forming the volcanic lava low and high platforms fig 2 sun et al 2019 the abundance of pores in these basalts provides favorable conditions for the storage and migration of groundwater in the study area wang and dai 2021 the formation and distribution of groundwater in the study area are controlled by complex geological structures and multi stage volcanic activity according to the characteristics of the water bearing formation the groundwater can be divided into basalt fissure bedrock fissure clastic rock pore fissure and carbonate rock fissure karst waters basalt fissure water is mainly distributed in the high and low platform areas of the volcanic lava the aquifer is composed of stomatal basalt with good reservoir conditions and abundant groundwater in areas where bedrock fissure water is distributed the water bearing formations are composed of granite and diorite and can be characterized by unevenly developed structural fissures with relatively poor groundwater abundance the bedrock is directly exposed to the surface or covered by a 10 20 cm thick humus layer these conditions are responsible for relatively slow groundwater movement in the bedrock in the clastic rock basin area water in primarily confined in the pore fissures its water bearing rock formation includes sandstone conglomerate and pyroclastic rocks with well developed fissures and relatively abundant groundwater the carbonate rock fissure karst water is distributed in the mid west of the study area and its distribution area is small the groundwater abundance in the changbai mountains has been investigated and evaluated in previous studies based on streamflow monitoring data of a hydrologic station zhang 2008 and wang and dai 2021 estimated regional jingyu fusong and antu counties groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method to be 14 48 108 and 11 55 108 m3 a respectively since wang and dai 2021 used the minimum runoff in the dry season as the baseflow separation data the calculation result of groundwater resource quantity was smaller than that of zhang 2008 yang 2003 using the large spring discharge accumulation method evaluated regional jingyu and fusong counties groundwater resource quantity to be 6 25 108 m3 a however the results of this method likely underestimated the total resource quantity as it is impossible to measure the discharge of all springs in other previous studies the assessment of groundwater resource quantity was conducted considering one year as the calculation period with no time division within that year rendering only one gcp furthermore the division of the gcus was primarily based on the type of water bearing formation although these previous determined groundwater quantity values have some shortcomings in terms of the gcp and gcu division the results still provide a comparative basis for this study 2 2 research strategy in this study we propose a new strategy for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw based on the topography lithology type of water bearing formation and characteristics of seasonal freeze thaw processes in the study area fig 3 the proposed strategy accounts for the shortcomings of the gcu division from previous calculations of groundwater resource in mountainous areas and the negligence of the influence of freeze thaw processes in previous studies the appropriate division of gcus and gcps is a key prerequisite for calculating groundwater resource quantity dividing multiple gcus can effectively express the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in mountain areas furthermore the division of multiple gcps can effectively express the impact of the freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity in this study the division of gcus was based on the groundwater flow system along with hydrogeological unit characteristics fig 3 the principles for the division of gcus were as follows i gcus were divided considering the comprehensive influence of the surface watershed topography landform and lithology ii groundwater within the same groundwater flow system can be assumed to have a unified hydraulic connection with a unified flow field and spatiotemporal evolution of water quantity along the flow direction toth 1980 therefore the unified flow field among different water bearing rock series was used as the basis for the division of the groundwater flow system iii the groundwater division coincided with the corresponding surface watershed to ensure the independence of the each gcu from the angle perspective of groundwater exploitation and utilization the concept of the groundwater flow system is suitable for objectively describing the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity in a mountainous area comparing to the method that commonly used in the division of gcu this strategy can better reflect the non uniform distribution of groundwater in mountainous areas the division of gcp was conducted on the basis of the influence of the soil freeze thaw process on the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity the principles for the division of gcp are as follows i the gcp was divided into more stages according to the soil seasonal freeze thaw process ii the variation of atmospheric temperature soil temperature and soil liquid water content in the soil freeze thaw process was comprehensively considered iii the difference of soil freeze thaw process at different altitudes and locations in study area was considered the difference in the gcp division in this paper was that a hydrological year was subdivided into more periods by considering the influence of the freeze thaw process on the temporal distribution of groundwater resources 2 3 data sources to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the study area we collected geological and hydrogeological survey reports from multiple time periods furthermore the monitoring data for 10 consecutive years were collected from seven river hydrologic stations and meteorological data were collected from two weather stations four field surveys were carried out between august 2020 and january 2022 we examined 20 geological survey sites and 35 soil survey sites 39 survey sites of groundwater table and 31 survey sites of river level fig 4 two real time monitoring points teros 12 soil moisture sensors of soil moisture temperature and conductance and six groundwater table monitoring points hobo u20 water pressure sensors were established fig 4 the related photographs are included in appendix 1 the daily meteorological data precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and average temperature of the jingyu jy and donggang dg weather station fig 5 from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the china meteorological data network https www data cma cn the daily cumulative precipitation fig 6 from 8 00 to 20 00 was recorded using an artificial sensor with a pluviometer air temperatures were monitored using a temperature sensor hwn 201 runoff data were collected from the northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences and included the daily observed runoff data of seven hydrologic stations s1 s7 in the study area from 2006 to 2016 fig 5 recharged by meltwater and seasonal precipitation the annual streamflow of the rivers presented double flood peaks fig 6 runoff from april to may accounted for 23 3 to 35 7 of the annual runoff and that from july to august accounted for 29 3 to 36 1 of the annual runoff fig 6 to obtain real time soil temperature and liquid water content data for describing the freeze thaw process of soil two real time soil moisture monitors teros 12 were deployed in the field fig 5 at sites ts01 and ts02 site ts01 was located in choushui town fig 5 in the intermountain basin where the topsoil type was baijiang soil clayey silt the depth of the groundwater table at ts01 was 10 m site ts02 was located in songjianghe town fig 5 on the basalt platform where the topsoil type was brunisolic soil sandy soil the depth of the groundwater table at ts02 was 5 m the baijiang and brunisolic soils are widely distributed in the study area fig 5 the total area of the two soil types accounted for approximately 88 of the study area therefore the two monitoring sites were representative of the typical soil type and topography of the study area the settings of the soil monitoring profiles are displayed in fig 7 the monitoring depths were set at 20 40 70 100 and 150 cm the soil temperature and liquid water content were monitored in real time at specific depths to completely understand the freezing and thawing process in different areas when soil temperature drops below 0 c the moisture in the soil starts to freeze thus a stable negative temperature indicated that the soil was frozen 2 4 method for calculating groundwater resource quantity the term groundwater resource quantity has different connotations staudinger et al 2019 in this study it refers to the sustainably obtainable quantity of groundwater under natural conditions and is differentiated from the entire amount of groundwater in the saturated zone in general the amount of groundwater in an aquifer including the amount below the fluctuating groundwater table as well as the runoff is greater than average groundwater discharge over many years from the perspective of the exploitation and utilization of groundwater resource the continuous recharge or stable discharge of a groundwater system is of great importance chi et al 2009 from the perspective of water balance for a groundwater system with rhythmic water level changes the sustainably obtainable quantity of groundwater resource can be estimated based on the data of groundwater discharge for multiple years for the study area it was difficult to accurately evaluate the total groundwater amount including the groundwater runoff and stock below the fluctuation zone of the groundwater level owing to the complex geological conditions for groundwater in mountainous areas in general there may be inconsistencies between the groundwater watershed and surface watershed owing to the constraints of different geological conditions and topography which can lead to the drainage of groundwater into adjacent basins through underground runoff markovich et al 2019 in such scenarios the estimation of groundwater resource quantity by baseflow separation in mountainous areas could be biased the present field survey and previous studies in the study area have confirmed that the groundwater in the changbai mountains is primarily discharged into surface water rivers in the form of baseflow wang and dai 2021 this lays a foundation for the estimation of groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method in this study previous studies have shown that using continuous groundwater discharge to estimate available groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas is an effective and feasible approach cochand et al 2019 eckhardt 2008 moreover all seven hydrologic stations in the study area have long series of monitoring data providing a favorable basis for the evaluation of groundwater resource quantity using the baseflow separation method baseflow which is the amount of groundwater discharged into the river can be calculated from runoff data using the baseflow separation method there are different baseflow separation methods eckhardt 2005 welch and allen 2012 yang et al 2019 one of them the dual parameter filtering method dfm has been widely used because it avoids the subjectivity and randomness of manual hydrologic chart separation eckhardt 2005 relevant studies have shown that the dfm can effectively calculate baseflow in mountainous areas li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the baseflow equation in dfm is presented in eq 1 1 q b i 1 b f i max α q b i 1 1 α b f i max q i 1 α b f i max where α represents the recession index bfi max represents the maximum baseflow index i represents the time step q b i represents the baseflow at the i th moment m3 s and q i represents the total runoff m3 s lastly q b represents the corresponding total baseflow amount of each hydrologic station s1 s7 in the control area in the watershed controlled by hydrological station the groundwater resource quantity in the controlled area is obtained by baseflow separation method on this basis the groundwater runoff modulus grm of the watershed is calculated for watersheds without hydrologic station control the analogy watershed which has hydrologic station were determined by comparing the topographic and hydrogeological conditions then the groundwater runoff modulus of the analogy watershed is applied to the watershed without a hydrologic station by the hydrogeologic analogy method finally the groundwater resource quantity in the watershed without hydrologic station control is calculated the formulas used in the calculation are as follows 2 gr m third l e v e l q b t f hydr 3 q g t h i r d l e v e l f third l e v e l g r m third l e v e l where qb t represents the baseflow of each gcp m3 t grmthird level represents the groundwater runoff modulus in the third level gcu m3 t km2 f hydr represents the control area of the hydrologic station km2 q g third level represents the groundwater resource quantity of the third level gcu at each gcp m3 t fthird level represents the area of the third level gcu km2 and t represents the number of days of the gcp 3 results based on the proposed research strategy the gcus and gcps were divided before the calculation of groundwater resource quantity 3 1 division of groundwater resource quantity calculation unit gcu the gcu division of the study area was performed according to the abovementioned three principles of gcu division first three first level gcus system i ii and iii were defined according to the surface basin of the macro regional topography and patterns of groundwater runoff fig 8 second based on the division of first level gcus and taking into account the local surface watershed and the direction of groundwater flow eight second level gcus subsystem i1 i2 i3 ii1 ii2 ii3 iii1 and iii2 were defined fig 9 finally based on the division of first level and second level gcus third level gcus were divided considering the influence of the characteristics of water bearing formations and local topographic factors seven types of water bearing formations a g were identified with a total of 50 third level gcus fig 9 the area lithology elevation and topsoil type of the gcus are listed in table 1 3 2 division of the groundwater resource quantity calculation period gcp based on the atmospheric temperature data of the jy and dg weather stations the soil temperature and liquid water content of the soil monitoring sites ts01 and ts02 fig 10 and fig 11 a field survey of freezing and thawing states and five gcps no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting were defined the characteristics of each gcp are as follows ① no freezing period from may 1 to september 30 lasting 153 days the soil was non frozen and the soil temperature was consistently above 0 c fig 10 affected by precipitation the liquid water content of the soil showed a regular fluctuation fig 11 ② unstable freezing period from october 1 to november 20 lasting 51 days at the beginning of october the temperature at night was below 0 c according to the field survey the surface soil began to freeze in the mountains at relatively high altitudes the soil temperature at different depths began to gradually decline especially at a depth of 20 cm fig 10 affected by the freeze thaw process the liquid water content of the soil showed a sudden upsurge trend or a sudden declining trend fig 11 therefore we considered october 1 as the starting point for the unstable freezing period with a continuous drop in temperature the soil shifted to the stable freezing period ③ stable freezing period from november 21 to february 14 lasting 86 days after november 21 both the atmospheric day and night temperatures were consistently below 0 c and the topsoil was frozen steadily affected by freezing the volumetric water content of soil at the 20 and 40 cm depths showed remarkable declining trends fig 11 by the beginning of the following january the atmospheric and soil temperatures began to rise however during the rise the soil temperature at the monitoring depths remained below 0 c at depths shallower than 70 cm and the soil remained in a stable freezing state fig 10 the liquid water content of the soil reached the lowest value ④ unstable melting period from february 15 to march 31 lasting 45 days by february 15 the atmospheric temperature was above 0 c during the day and below 0 c at night during this period the surface soil was considerably affected by atmospheric temperature soil temperature at 20 cm depth increased evidently with the rise and fall in air temperature soil water began to melt during the day and freeze at night affected by the freezing and thawing processes the liquid water content of the upper soil layers 20 and 40 cm showed a fluctuating upward trend fig 11 ⑤ stable melting period from april 1 to 30 lasting 30 days following april 1 the air temperatures continuously increased with occasional drops below 0 c the soil temperature at 20 cm depth also began to increase steadily and a stage of stable melting was reached these data combined with the field survey indicated that during april 8 25 the soil still contained ice and was melting in some areas at relatively high altitudes by the end of april the soil had completely melted fig 10 recharged by meltwater the liquid water content in the middle and upper parts of the soil 20 40 and 70 cm showed a rapid upward trend and then began to decline slowly until the end of april therefore considering the regional differences in the thawing process april 30 was selected as the end date of the stable thawing period 3 3 calculation of groundwater resource quantity the baseflow qb of each gcp was calculated in the control area of different hydrologic stations s1 s7 according to eq 1 the ratio of baseflow to the total runoff in the control area of each hydrologic station is shown in fig 12 the smallest ratio value occurred in the no freezing period and the highest in the stable freezing period the variation trend in the baseflow to runoff ratio indicates the influence of freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity the grm in seven types of third level gcus a g was obtained using eq 2 the results are shown in table 2 according to the division of the third level gcus in the study area the grm of the 50 third level gcus was calculated for the five gcps fig 13 the groundwater resource quantity of the 50 third level gcus was calculated using eq 3 then the groundwater resource quantity of the corresponding second level gcus was obtained by adding the groundwater resource quantity of all third level gcus similarly the groundwater resource quantity of the first level gcus was determined by adding the groundwater resource quantity of the corresponding second level gcus 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater resource quantity the groundwater resource quantity in the study area was calculated based on the proposed strategy fig 14 the groundwater resource quantity was 14 24 108 m3 a as this result does not consider the exploitation of large mineral springs in the study area it should be considered conservative previous work in the study area estimated the groundwater resource quantity zhang 2008 but with different study area boundaries which were not consistent with those in the current study upon converting the equivalent area the groundwater resource quantity of previously reported was 14 48 108 m3 a in the equivalent area this value is similar to our result considering that our result was conservative it can be inferred that our calculation results of the total groundwater resource quantity are reliable the current study contributes remarkably to the field by proposing a new approach of the strategy which considers the influence of freeze thaw cycles and is based on the concept of the groundwater flow system in addition the spatial and temporal distribution differences of groundwater resource quantity in seasonal freeze thaw mountains is carefully reflected at different locations and time periods of the study area based on the calculation results of groundwater resource quantities in 50 third level gcus we obtained the groundwater resource quantity in the eight corresponding second level gcus and then the amount of the three first level gcus was determined the groundwater resource quantity of system i was 2 70 108 m3 a accounting for 18 96 of the total that of system ii was 6 64 108 m3 a accounting for 46 63 of the total and that of system iii was 4 90 108 m3 a accounting for 34 41 of the total the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the eight second level gcus is as follows for the three second level gcus in system i the amount of groundwater resources of i1 naerhong subsystem was 0 80 108 m3 a accounting for 29 63 of system i the amount of groundwater resources of i2 zhuzi subsystem was 1 14 108 m3 a accounting for 42 22 of system i and that of i3 zhengshen subsystem was 0 76 108 m3 a accounting for 28 15 of system i fig 14 the subsystem i1 and i2 had similar areas 1 147 and 1 070 km2 respectively table 1 however groundwater resource quantity in i2 were considerably more abundant than those in i1 this is due to the abundant basalt pores and fissures in the water bearing medium in i2 although the area of i1 was slightly larger than that of i2 the amount of groundwater resources in i1 was only 70 18 of that in i2 this is due to the water bearing medium of i1 being mainly composed of granite bedrock fissures for subsystem i3 although its total area 750 km2 was substantially smaller than that of i1 1 147 km2 the amount of groundwater resources in i3 was highly similar to that in i1 this is attributed to a bigger area 301 km2 of basalt pore fissure water in i3 than that in i1 108 km2 table 1 therefore it was determined that the basalt pore fissure water bearing medium has abundant groundwater system ii had the most abundant groundwater resources owing to its wide distribution of basalt in the areas surrounding tianchi lake altitude 1 000 m which contains well developed basalt pores and fissures the groundwater resource quantity was abundant with a grm higher than 17 104 m3 a km2 the sum of all five gcps in the basalt platform area with an altitude of less than 1 000 m the grm was approximately 10 104 m3 a km2 which equals the sum of the five gcps furthermore the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in system ii was also impacted by topography the amount of groundwater resources of subsystem ii1 lazi subsystem was 1 08 108 m3 a accounting for 16 29 of the total groundwater resource quantity of system ii that of subsystem ii2 songjiang subsystem was 2 94 108 m3 a accounting for 44 34 of the total and that of subsystem ii3 manjiang subsystem was 2 61 108 m3 a accounting for 39 37 of the total fig 14 in areas of the subsystem ii2 and ii3 with elevations 1 000 m the surface was covered by volcanic ash soil table 1 which has high porosity and good permeability facilitating precipitation infiltration into the ground li et al 2007 in addition the basalt rock layer in the subsystem ii2 and ii3 was 100 m in thickness with abundant pores and fissures and is characterized by good connectivity with strong permeability therefore the groundwater resource quantity in the subsystem ii2 and ii3 are abundant accounting for 81 71 of the total groundwater resource quantity of system ii impacted by the variation in the water bearing medium and subsystem area the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in system iii varied greatly the groundwater resource quantity in subsystem iii1 gudong subsystem was poor with only 0 56 108 m3 a accounting for 11 43 of the total groundwater resource quantity in system iii however the groundwater resource quantity in subsystem iii2 erdaobai subsystem was relatively large 4 27 108 m3 a accounting for 88 57 of the total fig 14 the spatial distribution of groundwater resource quantity in the eight second level gcus is shown in fig 14 these results of the distribution of groundwater resource quantity in different subsystems can potentially guide groundwater resource exploitation within the study area on a reasonable and scientific basis 4 2 temporal distribution characteristics of groundwater resource quantity the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity in each gcp was determined for the different gcus in the study area fig 15 shows that the temporal variation in the groundwater resource quantity in the study area was substantial indicating that the seasonal freeze thaw process remarkably impacted the temporal distribution of groundwater resource quantity it was also confirmed that it is necessary to consider the influence of freezing thawing while calculating groundwater resource quantity the no freezing period lasted 153 days and correlated with the most abundant quantity of groundwater resources the quantity was 8 87 108 m3 in that period accounting for 62 25 of the total amount fig 15 most of the precipitation occurred during the no freezing period and groundwater was recharged by the infiltration of precipitation without the retardation influence of the freeze thaw process during that period the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 5 80 106 m3 d fig 16 the unstable freezing period lasted 51 days and the groundwater resource quantity was 1 63 108 m3 accounting for 11 51 of the total amount in that period under the combined influence of reduced precipitation and topsoil freezing infiltration recharge decreased considerably in addition the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 3 20 106 m3 d fig 16 for the stable freezing period which lasted 86 days the groundwater resource quantity was 1 65 108 m3 accounting for 11 58 of the total during that period according to the real time soil monitoring data fig 10 the thickness of the frozen soil reached 70 cm in depth the frozen soil had low permeability and the precipitation mainly consisted of snow under the joint impact of these factors the infiltration recharge decreased substantially as a result the groundwater resource quantity gradually decreased during this period and the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 1 92 106 m3 d fig 16 although the groundwater discharge into the river decreased during unstable and stable freezing periods the contribution ratio of baseflow to the river increased fig 12 during the period of decreased precipitation which was mainly in the form of snow the direct surface water runoff decreased simultaneously xie et al 2021 as a result the ratio of baseflow to the river gradually increased during the freezing period fig 12 the unstable and stable melting periods lasted 45 and 30 days respectively the groundwater resource quantity in the unstable melting period was 0 72 108 m3 accounting for 5 05 of the total whereas during the stable melting period it was 1 37 108 m3 accounting for 9 61 of the total the average daily groundwater resource quantity was 1 60 106 m3 d in the unstable melting period and 4 57 106 m3 d in the stable melting period fig 16 upon comparing the average daily groundwater resource quantity in different gcps fig 16 it was found that the average daily groundwater resource quantity was highest in the no freezing period followed by that in the stable melting period during the stable melting period where the frozen water in the soil began to melt and the soil permeability gradually increased demand et al 2019 lyu et al 2022 the groundwater could accept recharge by precipitation meltwater and lateral upstream groundwater input collectively therefore the groundwater discharge into the river the base flow was relatively large in that period fig 6 interestingly the minimum daily average of groundwater resource quantity was observed during the unstable melting period rather than during the stable freezing period the values were 1 92 106 and 1 60 106 m3 d respectively one of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the retardation effect of groundwater recharge in the study area cheng et al 2022 the study of the dynamic change in groundwater levels in the study area further confirms this inference cheng et al 2022 4 3 spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater resource based on the strategy proposed in this study we determined the allocation of groundwater resource in different zones fig 14 and periods fig 15 in the study area the daily average groundwater resource quantity in different periods was also determined fig 16 consistent with the above mentioned results the spatial and temporal distribution of the groundwater resource quantity in different second level gcus is shown in fig 17 the figure shows that the subsystems i1 and i3 had a smaller groundwater resource quantity whereas subsystems ii2 and ii3 had a relatively large groundwater resource quantity subsystem iii2 had the most abundant groundwater resource quantity in terms of groundwater resource exploitation the total amount in each system and the change in daily groundwater resource based on different periods should be comprehensively considered overall the results provided a favorable basis for considering groundwater exploitation across different regions and according to different periods in the study area the optimal management of the development and utilization of groundwater in the study area needs to be combined with the characteristics of industrial and agricultural production and domestic water and the local government s development planning the impact of the distribution of nature reserves in the study area on the development and utilization of water resources also needs to be considered optimizing the development utilization and management of groundwater resources in the study area based on the results of this research is the main research focus in the next stage of work 5 conclusion based on the concept of the groundwater flow system and considering the influence of seasonal freeze thaw processes on groundwater resource a new strategy was proposed to deal with the spatiotemporal distribution of the groundwater resource quantity in the changbai mountains the main conclusions of the study are as follows 1 for the mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze thaw rational division of gcus and gcps is the key prerequisite for scientific evaluation of groundwater resources because of the complexity of the terrain and geological conditions in mountainous areas the usual practice of dividing gcus according to lithologic and geomorphic unit characteristics is not a good strategy this study demonstrated that the gcu s division strategy based on the groundwater flow system theory can better express the complexity of hydrogeological conditions in mountainous areas and thus is more conducive to the accurate calculation of groundwater resource quantity in these areas and to guide the exploitation of groundwater resources 2 it is necessary to consider the effect of freeze thaw processes while calculating groundwater resource quantity in mountainous areas the division of multiple gcps can effectively express the impact of the freeze thaw process on groundwater resource quantity the groundwater resource quantity in the no freezing unstable freezing stable freezing unstable melting and stable melting periods accounted for 62 25 11 51 11 58 5 05 and 9 61 of the total respectively the calculation results of groundwater resource quantity in each gcp support the dynamic exploitation of groundwater resource in the study area 3 based on the calculation results of total groundwater resource quantity of different gcus and gcps and combined with the daily groundwater resource quantity in the different gcus of the study area the spatial and temporal distribution map of groundwater resource quantity was developed the map provides a new basis for planning the exploitation of groundwater resource at different regions and periods of the study area seasonal freeze thaw mountains are distributed worldwide the complex terrain and geological conditions of mountainous areas and the influence of freeze thaw cycles make the accurate calculation of groundwater resource quantity in these areas difficult considering the changbai mountain area of china as an example this study proposed a new strategy to deal with the calculation of groundwater resource quantity in seasonal freeze thaw mountainous areas our findings can be used as a reference for evaluating groundwater resource quantity in other seasonal freeze thaw mountainous areas funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

2604,many applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions require soil moisture sm estimates at fine resolutions soil moisture estimates of current satellite missions are normally at coarse spatial resolutions such as 25 36 km for soil moisture and ocean salinity smos sm data many spatial downscaling approaches have been developed to get finer resolution sm apparent thermal inertia ati as a reliable approximation of thermal inertia ti that could be derived from daily fine resolution optical thermal remote sensing rs data has been testified to be highly related to sm however the empirical relationship between ati and sm varies with vegetation cover density the main purpose of this study is to develop an ati based sm downscaling method that is free of vegetation cover effects the study was conducted in naqu areas in the central tibetan plateau tp in southwest china where spatially intensive in situ sm measurements were routinely obtained european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture combined product version 4 2 was used for this study the fine resolution 1 km ati data were derived from the collection 6 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products a modified quantile quantile q q adjustment method was applied to correct the bias of the cci sm data before downscaling a non linear regression model between bias corrected cci sm and fine resolution ati was built to disaggregate the bias corrected sm to spatial resolution of 1 km in this model enhanced vegetation index evi was introduced to globally and quantitatively adjust the vegetation effect in the relationship between sm and ati the bias corrected cci sm and the downscaled 1 km resolution sm were evaluated using the in situ sm measurements obtained from the multi scale soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tp ctp smtmn in the study area the results indicate that the proposed modified q q adjustment method effectively reduced the bias of the original cci sm data bias 0 m3 m3 the downscaled 1 km resolution sm shows fine scale spatial variability of soil moisture and preserves the accuracy r 0 552 and temporal variability of the bias corrected cci sm the accuracies of the downscaled sm over areas with different vegetation cover show quite good consistency the uncertainties of the proposed sm spatial downscaling method were comprehensively analyzed the proposed ati based sm downscaling algorithm is applicable to generating representative and consistent high spatial resolution sm over areas

introduction as one of important and essential environmental variables soil moisture sm affects many exchange processes of material and energy including hydrological and atmospheric processes fischer

fields such as weather forecasting scipal et al 2008 water resource management dobriyal et al 2012 drought analysis sheffield et al 2004 agricultural production tao et al 2003 and many others domains hence it is utmost significant to obtain spatially and temporally complete and accurate information of sm compared with in situ measurements of sm remote sensing rs is an efficient and convenient approach to get spatial distribution information of sm over large and heterogeneous coverage lu et al 2014 peng et al 2016 because of an evident relevance between sm and soil dielectric properties many kinds of passive and active satellite microwave sensors have been extensively used for surface sm retrievals since the late 1970s such as the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e the active microwave instrument wind scatterometer ami ws onboard european remote sensing satellites ers 1 and 2 and the advanced scatterometer ascat onboard the meteorological operational satellite metop a and b mohanty et al 2017 petropoulos et al 2015 passive and active microwave sensors can penetrate the cloud and consequently ignore the influence of cloud on observing surface sm numerous studies have shown that there existed the difference and complementarity between active and passive sm products under different land cover types de jeu et al 2008 dorigo et al 2010 dorigo et al 2015 peng et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 realizing that it is feasible and potential to merge different passive and active microwave products into a global consistent and long term sm database gonzález zamora et al 2019 the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci projects have produced their sm products spanning the period 1978 2018 dorigo et al 2017 esa cci sm products version 4 2 consist of seven passive and four active microwave sm products passive microwave products include smmr the special sensor microwave imager ssm i the microwave imager from the tropical rainfall measuring mission tmi amsr e the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 the windsat polarimetric radiometer windsat and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos active microwave products include ers 1 ami ws ers 2 ami ws ascat a and ascat b although the evaluations to the cci sm product based on in situ sm measurements showed good accuracies dorigo et al 2017 dorigo et al 2015 liu et al 2012 liu et al 2011 the 25 km spatial resolution of the cci sm is hard to meet the application requirements of sm in few or sub kilometers spatial resolution walker and houser 2004 in order to improve the spatial resolution of sm while keeping the advantages of the microwave sm products the coarse spatial resolution sm data have been disaggregated by integrating with high resolution hr rs ancillary data to get finer spatial resolution sm product liu et al 2018 peng et al 2015b peng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 higher resolution rs observations from both microwave and optical thermal visible near infrared thermal infrared sensors and the derived variables have been used as proxies for low resolution lr sm downscaling choi and hur 2012 das et al 2011 merlin et al 2010 narayan et al 2006 song et al 2014 for instance national aeronautics and space administration nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission blended 36 km resolution radiometer and 3 km resolution radar data to obtain 9 km resolution sm estimations entekhabi et al 2010a though the radar products have stopped transmitting due to an anomaly involving the radar s high power amplifier in july 2015 smap mission showed that combining passive and active microwave rs data for concurrent synchronous observations could obtain sm estimates at 9 km resolution das et al 2014 some attempts have been made to deal with the lack of radar data for example the smap level 2 enhanced passive soil moisture product 9 km have been developed and assessed by chan et al 2018 and das et al 2019 have replaced the radar data of smap with the copernicus project sentinel 1a 1b synthetic aperture radar sar data to generate the smap sentinel1 active passive high resolution product 1 km or 3 km however sar data such as sentinel 1 have longer revisit period than the optical thermal rs data such as modis it is hard to obtain daily hr sm product by blending sar and radiometer data on the other side optical thermal rs data also play a significant part as proxies in lr sm downscaling the triangle trapezoid methods have been used for sm downscaling based on the empirical regression relationship between land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi surface albedo and sm over sparse vegetation cover regions carlson et al 1994 chauhan et al 2003 comparing to the triangle trapezoid approaches which directly utilize lst and ndvi as proxies for sm downscaling it is a more intuitive effective and theoretical method to extract a proxy which can intuitively reflect spatial distribution of sm at hr from various indices related to sm peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 so far various proxies have been applied to spatial downscaling of low resolution satellite sm data based upon empirical or physical relationship between the proxies and sm representative proxies for sm downscaling include soil evaporative efficiency see merlin et al 2012 merlin et al 2008 soil wetness sw index kim and hogue 2012 vegetation temperature condition index vtci peng et al 2015b peng et al 2016 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi wang et al 2016 these proxy based methods make great use of the multisource and long period hr data of the optical thermal sensors peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 however the quality of the optical thermal data is severely hindered by missing data due to the coverage of clouds djamai et al 2016 molero et al 2016 song et al 2019 thus the accuracy of the downscaled sm from this kind of methods greatly relies on the accuracies of the proxies that represents sm spatial variation at hr peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 so choosing and getting appropriate proxy is critical to lr sm downscaling thermal inertia ti or thermal property sellers 1965 defined as the magnitude of the thermal variations of a substance to a time variant surface energy flux has been found to be closely related to near surface sm or surface composition price 1977 the formula of ti consists of the material s bulk density specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity and the accuracy of thermal conductivity basically determines the quality of the coupling between sm and ti minacapilli et al 2009 however these parameters can hardly be derived directly from rs so some alternatives of ti based on rs data were developed fang et al 2013 short and stuart 1982 van doninck et al 2011 fang et al 2013 proposed daily temperature change as an alternative of ti for sm downscaling compared with the proxies containing only the lst value on one observation time fang and lakshmi 2014 kim and hogue 2012 merlin et al 2012 peng et al 2015a wang et al 2016 the diurnal temperature difference derived from two daily satellite lst observations was used as an approximation of diurnal soil temperature difference and showed better correlation to daily mean sm fang et al 2018 senanayake et al 2019 however diurnal soil temperature difference between two times observations in one day is not sufficient to characterize the true diurnal surface temperature amplitudes and the relationship between diurnal soil temperature difference and daily mean sm varies with seasons vegetation density and soil texture senanayake et al 2019 compared to the diurnal soil temperature difference apparent thermal inertia ati was proposed as a better approximation of ti short and stuart 1982 ati is defined as a measure of the proportion of radiation energy absorbed divided by the consequent temperature change cracknell and xue 1996 short and stuart 1982 the superiority of ati to ti in application is that ati could be calculated based on surface albedo and diurnal surface temperature difference from satellite data van doninck et al 2011 derived diurnal surface temperature amplitudes of each pixel by a multitemporal approach which was based on a sinusoidal fitting of the diurnal surface temperature variation with at least two daily satellite lst observations in one pixel and diurnal surface temperature amplitudes of each pixel were subsequently combined with surface albedo to obtain daily ati for each pixel moreover a solar correction factor was introduced into the calculation of ati in order to compensate for seasonal variation in solar insolation short and stuart 1982 thus ati shows a stronger correspondence to sm than diurnal soil temperature difference does notarnicola et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 have come up with a similar regression relationship between sm and ati and the latter was used for upscaling in situ sm at point scale to a certain spatial scale e g 1 km over the past two decades the relationship between sm and ati has been utilized by numerous studies for hr sm estimation under different types of land cover such as barren or sparsely vegetated cai et al 2007 song and jia 2016 croplands notarnicola et al 2013 sohrabinia et al 2014 and forest chang et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 nevertheless because the amplitude of diurnal temperature difference is smaller in wet areas than in dry areas price 1985 the applications of ati for sm downscaling is limited to only sparsely vegetated areas chang et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 for this reason some studies only applied the empirical ati sm relationship for sm downscaling in condition where the ndvi 0 4 song and jia 2016 to overcome the vegetation effect in the ati sm regression lu et al 2014 established an ati ndvi space by replacing lst in the lst ndvi feature space so as to obtain 1 km spatial resolution sm over regions from bare soil to full cover vegetation unfortunately the assumption of the linear correlation between sm and ati in this model limited its performance notarnicola et al 2013 qin et al 2013 fang et al 2018 and fang et al 2013 developed a linear regression model based on the ti relationship between diurnal temperature difference and daily sm within each ndvi interval for downscaling lr sm product they assumed that the linear relationship is fixed in each ndvi interval with the downscaling algorithms from fang et al 2013 considering the influences of season vegetation density and the soil texture senanayake et al 2021b senanayake et al 2021a and senanayake et al 2019 firstly classified the entire regression model into 24 classes i e three ndvi classes two soil classes and four seasonal classes and then established the relationship between the diurnal soil temperature difference and the daily mean sm within each class for downscaling coarse resolution satellite sm products nevertheless there are two main limitations in the piecewise fitting model proposed by fang et al 2013 and senanayake et al 2019 one limitation is that there usually exist the discontinuities between each class of the piecewise fitting model resulting in the visible discontinuities of downscaled results between the regions of each class another is that the linear relationship between diurnal temperature difference and daily sm still can be effected by vegetation conditions within each ndvi class obviously the piecewise fitting model does not globally and quantitatively solve the influence of vegetation conditions on the ti relationship between daily temperature changes and daily sm thus to generate the consistent and accurate downscaled sm data based on the ti or ati sm relationship it is critical to develop a global and quantitative model to modulate the effect of vegetation condition on the ti or ati sm relationship in the downscaling method the main aim of this paper is to present a new coarse resolution satellite sm downscaling algorithm with satellite derived hr ati as major proxy while globally and quantitatively taking account of the effect of vegetation conditions on the empirical relationship between ati and sm to generate spatiotemporally complete and consistent hr sm dataset this paper is organized as follows the study area and the data used for study are described in section 2 the schematic paradigm of the whole research the data processing method the bias correction method for satellite sm data ati estimation method the sm downscaling models and the evaluation strategy are presented in section 3 the models performance evaluation the downscaled sm accuracy assessments and the uncertainties analysis are presented in section 4 the whole paper is concluded in section 5 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the study area extents from latitudes 31 n to 34 n and longitudes 91 e to 94 e and is located in naqu area in the central tp in the southwestern china fig 1 it has a high elevation from 3802 to 6513 m within an area of 300 km 300 km as is known to all the climate of the asian continent has been profoundly affected by the energy and water dynamics of the entire tp qin et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the terrain in this study area is quite complex as is shown in fig 1 except for the relatively flat terrain in the southwest and northeast there are rolling mountains called tanggula mountains across the northwest to east and extremely undulating surface in the southeast with tanggula mountains as a boundary the south of the border is the monsoon climate with precipitation concentrated in summer and the north is mainly continental climate which is less affected by the monsoon in addition this area is located at the junction of the semi humid and semi arid regions of the plateau sub frigid zone and its annual precipitation is about 400 mm from northwest to southeast vegetation types change gradually from alpine grassland to alpine meadow and then to alpine shrub and meadow the soil consists of a large amount of sand and silt and a small amount of clay with a large spatial heterogeneity the data sets about types of climate and vegetation are provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn 2 2 data sets a summary of the datasets used in this study is given in table 1 detailed data descriptions are given in the following sections 2 2 1 in situ measurements of soil moisture the in situ measurements of sm in this study area are obtained from the multi scale soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tp ctp smtmn yang et al 2013 the locations of the in situ measurement stations are shown in fig 1 during august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 there were a total of 57 stations used to measure soil moisture and temperature at four depths 0 5 10 20 and 40 cm and at three networks with different spatial scales 1 0 0 3 and 0 1 the number of stations within the corresponding esa cci 25 km pixel is shown in fig 1 there is a total of 12 cci sm pixels containing the collocated measurement stations including one pixel with one site one pixel with two sites five pixels with three sites two pixels with four sites two pixels with five sites and one pixel with twenty one sites the satellite sm products from microwave rs represent the sm in the top 2 5 cm of soil dorigo et al 2017 ulaby et al 1982 and the retrieved sm data based on the optical thermal rs products only capture the few millimeters measurements under the soil surface van doninck et al 2011 so we choose the in situ sm measurements at 0 5 cm depth to evaluate the satellite sm results the temporal resolution of the in situ sm measurements is 30 min with the time zone at utc 8 00 because the optical thermal rs data are obtained at local solar time of utc 6 00 the 30 min in situ sm observations were adjusted to utc 6 00 to temporally match the in situ sm and the optical thermal rs data and then these 30 min measurements were averaged to estimate daily in situ sm measurements hereafter in situ sm refers to daily in situ sm to avoid the impact of soil freezing on sm observation only the data in the period from july 26 to august 24 2013 a total of 30 days were used for this study more information about the ctp smtmn dataset are described in yang et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 2 2 2 esa cci soil moisture data the esa cci sm product used in this study is version 4 2 it includes three surface sm data sets the active passive and the combined product the active product consists of four active ers 1 ami ws ers 2 ami ws ascat a and ascat b microwave products and the passive product consists of seven passive smmr ssm i tmi amsr e amsr2 windsat and smos microwave products more details about passive and active data sets refer to dorigo et al 2017 the combined product is a merged product based upon the previous two data sets with 2 5 cm penetration depth dorigo et al 2017 ulaby et al 1982 because the active and passive sensors are complementary for retrieving surface sm under different land cover types dorigo et al 2015 we choose the combined product so that we can take advantages of both passive and active sm products moreover the combined cci sm product generally outperforms the single sensor input products with higher accuracy and better spatiotemporally completeness dorigo et al 2017 the surface sm of combined product has spatial resolution of 25 km 0 25 on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs 84 reference system and temporal resolution of 1 day with the time zone at utc 0 00 the combined product searches for all available microwave products as the input datasets of the merging process within a range of 12 h centered on the reference time at 0 00 utc dorigo et al 2015 considering the time zone of the study area is utc 6 00 the satellite sm data over this study area between 18 00 on the previous day and 18 00 on the day at local solar time were merged to generate combined esa cci sm product specifically the cci sm data used in this study only come from the fusion of amsr2 only descending overpass and ascat a b both ascending and descending overpasses for more details on the description and the retrieval and merging algorithm of esa cci sm dataset please refer to liu et al 2012 liu et al 2011 wagner et al 2012 gruber et al 2017 and dorigo et al 2017 2 2 3 modis optical thermal data this study used three ancillary satellite datasets including lst vegetation index vi and surface albedo quality from the collection 6 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products these modis products are distributed through the nasa level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov at goddard space flight center the lst datasets come from the collection 6 modis terra lst and emissivity daily l3 global 1 km grid products mod11a1 and modis aqua lst and emissivity daily l3 global 1 km grid products myd11a1 the vi datasets containing ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi data layers are obtained from the collection 6 modis terra vi 16 day l3 global 1 km grid products mod13a2 on the one hand the saturation problem over high biomass areas and soil noise problem of ndvi can be overcome by using evi which was constructed by decoupling the canopy background signal and reducing atmospheric influences huete et al 2002 miura et al 2001 potithep et al 2013 son et al 2014 on the other hand ndvi was found to be more sensitive to vegetation in arid and semi arid regions with low biomass suggesting that ndvi may be a better estimator of root zone sm in arid and semi arid environments didan et al 2008 schnur et al 2010 senay et al 2007 considering soil noise problem and our study period within the vegetation growth season evi was chosen for representing vegetation condition in this study pixels covered by snow and water where surface sm cannot be retrieved were masked using the quality information of the collection 6 modis terra and aqua brdf albedo quality daily l3 global 500 m grid products mcd43a2 compared with previous versions the collection 6 mcd43a2 products use current day snow condition rather than the majority snow condition of the 16 day period 2 2 4 glass broadband albedo product spatiotemporally complete and consistent land surface albedo product was critical for estimating ati the broadband albedo product of the global land surface satellite glass project glass02a06 liang et al 2013 was used for ati estimation in this study glass broadband albedo product was obtained from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn the glass albedo product shows similar accuracy to the mcd43 as was validated at the fluxnet sites in liu et al 2013b the modis mcd43 product has many spatial gaps in the cloud contaminated and the permanent and seasonal snow covered areas however the spatial gaps in glass land surface albedo product were filled by using the statistics based temporal filtering stf algorithm liu et al 2013a the glass albedo product used in this study has 8 day temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution more information about the characterization and the retrieval temporal filter and gap filling algorithm of the glass albedo product can be found in liu et al 2013b and qu et al 2014 2 2 5 cmorph crt precipitation product precipitation product was used for analyzing the uncertainties of the downscaled sm the precipitation product used in this study were generated by the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa joyce et al 2004 the cmorph version 1 0 dataset includes the raw only satellite based precipitation estimates and the bias corrected precipitation products cmorph crt ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip cmorph v1 0 in the inter comparison studies of jiang et al 2017 and xie et al 2017 the cmorph crt product shows consistently superior performance in representing the globally spatiotemporal patterns and variations of precipitation in regions from 60 s to 60 n considering the spatial and temporal resolutions of the cci sm product we chose the cmorph crt data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h with the time zone at utc 0 00 for analyzing the effect of precipitation on the accuracy of the downscaled sm 3 methodology the methodology of downscaling lr cci sm data 25 km to 1 km resolution based on ati is schematically presented in fig 2 it is consisted of four steps a validation and bias correction of the cci sm based on the in situ sm measurements b processing of the ancillary satellite data which includes the reconstructing of lst under cloudy conditions interpolating the 8 day composited surface albedo to daily data and interpolating the 16 day composited evi data to daily evi c computing ati based on the daily surface albedo and reconstructed lst from step b and denoising the estimated ati d building the nonlinear regression model to downscale the 25 km resolution bias corrected cci sm to 1 km resolution 3 1 cci soil moisture validation and bias correction a quality control procedure was applied to the cci sm before further analysis the cci sm data with flag values from 1 to 63 or 127 nan are masked in order to exclude the low quality sm data which are influenced by freezing extremely dense vegetation and other conditions for the quality flags please refer to the product specification document psd of the cci sm product https www esa soilmoisture cci org node 139 the validation of the quality controlled cci sm data hereafter original cci sm refers to quality controlled cci sm was performed by comparing the original cci sm with the average of all in situ sm measurements within the corresponding 25 km pixel from august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 to make the average in situ sm measurements be representative to the cci sm at 25 km resolution five cci sm pixels containing at least 4 in situ measurements were chosen for validation montzka et al 2020 similarly for evaluating the corrected results the bias corrected cci sm data were validated with same method as the original cci sm data to better evaluate the performance of the sm downscaling method a bias correction procedure based on in situ sm measurements was applied to the cci sm before it was downscaled a modified quantile quantile q q adjustment method which was originally proposed to correct biases of total column ozone datasets from different sensors by bai et al 2016 was used for correcting the bias of the original cci sm data fig 3 illustrates the principles of the modified q q adjustment for bias correction one of the superiorities of the modified q q adjustment to the original q q adjustment is that it is suitable to conditions in which the numbers of raw and control observation data are different for cci sm data the control cci observations represent the cci sm pixels with sufficient in situ sm measurements and the raw cci observations represent the cci sm pixels without sufficient in situ sm measurements the number of control cci observations are not equal to the raw cci observations thus we used the modified q q adjustment method for bias correction of cci sm in this study the cci sm estimates covering at least 4 valid in situ measurements and the collocated average in situ sm measurements were used as two control observations for bias correction of cci sm from august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 the raw observations consist of the cci sm estimates including 4 valid in situ measurements the original cci sm data were divided into two parts the raw sms and the control sms the bias correction process of the original cci sm data can be summarized as follows a bias correction of the cci sm data belonging to the control sms by the relationship of cumulative distribution functions cdfs between the control cci observations and the average collocated in situ observations b bias correction of the cci sm data belonging to the raw observation by the modified q q adjustment method a sm value sm obs j in the raw observed cci sm data thick black line in fig 3 the raw observations are denoted as sm obs j hereafter is calibrated to the in situ measurement level dashed line in fig 3 defined as projected cci sm data denoted as sm prj j by removing the bias the modified q q adjustment is modeled using eq 1 1 sm prj j s m obs j δ s m j where j is the position of specific cci sm value on the corresponding cdf curve the larger of the j value the greater the cdf value of the corresponding sm sm prj j denotes the jth value in the projected cci sm value at the in situ measurement level sm obs j is the jth value in the raw observed cci sm data and δsm j is the bias between cci sm and in situ sm at the given sm obs j the details of the computation of δsm j are described in appendix a after bias correction the bias corrected cci sm data defined as all cci sm data that have been corrected for bias consisted of the projected cci sm data from the raw observation and the bias corrected data from the control observation 3 2 data processing both satellite data and in situ observations were processed for ati estimation and rs sm downscaling the geographic latitude longitude coordinate based on the wgs84 reference system is used as the spatial reference of re projection in order to keep spatial consistency of the cci sm modis lst glass land surface albedo and cmorph crt data quality control was applied to all the satellite data before further process because the sm downscaling algorithm we proposed is built upon the regression relationship between the sm at 25 km resolution and the corresponding evi and ati at 1 km resolution it is of critical importance for having adequate number of available 1 km resolution evi and ati pixels within the corresponding 25 km scale cci sm pixel however the availability of ati is often hampered by the absence of lst due to the coverage of clouds so the number of 25 km resolution cci sm pixels which contain the sufficient available 1 km scale ati and evi pixels are rather limited the number of original ati and evi pixels as available input samples maybe too small to meet the requirements of building the downscaling model thus before calculating ati the remotely sensed daily land surface temperature reconstruction rsdast model proposed by sun et al 2017 was applied to the modis lst data for reconstructing the clear sky lst over cloudy regions so that a spatiotemporally continuous daily day night lst data was obtained the rsdast model reconstructs clear sky lsts for areas contaminated by cloud using only clear sky neighboring lsts from nearby dates according to sun et al 2017 the lst reconstruction using rsdast model has coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 72 0 89 bias of 0 02 0 21 k and root mean square error rmse of 0 92 1 16 k for flat areas and r 2 of 0 81 0 89 bias of 0 35 1 52 k rmse of 1 42 2 24 k for mountainous areas the glass 8 day shortwave 0 3 5 0 μm albedo datasets including the white sky albedo wsa and black sky albedo bsa fields are interpolated to daily data with a linear interpolation function sohrabinia et al 2014 as the actual blue sky surface albedo is necessary for ati estimation we assume that the actual surface albedo is the average of wsa and bsa since their difference is very small and they have high correlation r 0 9949 over the study area in the whole year of 2013 li et al 2015 tang et al 2018 we fit the time series of 16 day composited evi data mod13a2 using a piecewise logistic model zhang et al 2003 to get the daily evi data for ati estimation the pixels covered by snow and water in the lst land surface albedo and evi data are masked based on the collocated quality flag information of mcd43a2 3 3 apparent thermal inertia estimation ati has been proposed as a surrogate indicator for the ti and has been proved to be an appropriate proxy of surface sm qin et al 2013 song and jia 2016 van doninck et al 2011 veroustraete et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 moreover ati is actually a measure of the magnitude of the temperature amplitude driven by the absorbed radiative energy since the water heat capacity is relatively large the more water content a soil contains the more resistance it has to the external perturbation qin et al 2013 in this study ati was taken as the main proxy for surface sm downscaling here the ati k 1 is calculated using eq 2 2 ati c 1 a a where c is the solar correction factor a is the actual surface albedo and a k is the amplitude of diurnal lst cycle the solar correction factor c changes over space and time to normalize for solar flux variations with latitude and solar declination the amplitude of diurnal lst cycle a represents the maximum lst difference during a day to calculate ati according to eq 2 the interpolated daily surface albedo and the reconstructed daily day night lst data mentioned in section 3 2 were used eq 2 is proposed by van doninck et al 2011 the details of the ati estimation method are described in appendix b once the ati was estimated two further processing steps were performed to reduce the noise existed in the ati data the first step is to determine the range of valid ati values in this study the 0 0 7957 k 1 corresponding ati value when cdf ati 0 9999 is chosen as the reasonable range according to the cdf of ati data statistics the second step is to apply a moving window averaging filter mwa notarnicola et al 2013 to further reduce the noise that caused by persistent clouds that are not successfully detected in the cloud mask 3 4 soil moisture downscaling algorithm when both the absorbed energy and the soil composition remain unchanged more water content leads to smaller temperature amplitude and in turn greater ati according to eq 2 qin et al 2013 thus the rationale of the sm downscaling algorithm in this study is based on the statistical correlation between surface sm and ati because the sensitivity of ati to sm decreases with the increase of vegetation cover notarnicola et al 2013 evi as a global adjustment factor was used to quantitatively modulate the empirical functional relationship between sm and ati under different vegetation conditions the original empirical relationship between sm and ati were proposed and constructed by qin et al 2013 and notarnicola et al 2013 which was expressed as eq 3 3 s m r a r b r ln a t i r c r where s m r and at i r denotes sm and ati at resolution r ar br and cr are the coefficients to be decided by regression analysis based on the research results in notarnicola et al 2013 for a given range of sm values greater ndvi value led to narrower dynamics range of ati leading the corresponding regression curve of sm and ati became steeper with greater ndvi value thus to quantitatively modulate the effect of vegetation condition on the empirical function relationship between sm and ati we re formulate the empirical function relationship between sm and ati by introducing vi as a global adjustment factor as is presented in eq 4 4 s m r a r b r ln a t i r c r d r v i r e r f r where v i r denotes vi at resolution r dr er and fr are the regression coefficients for quantifying the effect of vi on the relationship between sm and ati in this study evi was chosen for representing vegetation condition section 2 2 3 here we assume that the empirical relationship between sm and ati is continuously and nonlinearly modulated by evi value as long as the six coefficients in eq 4 were estimated at hr the sm at hr could be retrieved based on eq 4 when the hr ati and evi are available however only satellite sm products at lr are available for downscaling thus it is necessary to develop a new algorithm based on the eq 4 to estimate regression coefficients at hr by directly using satellite sm products at lr in this study the coefficients in eq 4 were obtained by directly relating hr ati and vi to lr sm and the relationship between hr ati vi and lr sm was built based on a song and jia 2016 which is used to relate the lr sm smlr to the hr sm smhr within the corresponding lr pixel as is expressed in eq 5 5 s m lr 1 n i 1 n s m hr i where n is the number of the hr pixels within the corresponding lr pixel in this study only 25 km resolution pixels with at least 80 available 1 km scale sm pixels were used for regression analysis by combining eqs 4 and 5 the lr sm and hr ati and vi are linked in order to calculate the regression coefficients at hr according to eq 6 6 s m lr 1 n i 1 n a hr b hr ln a t i hr i c hr d hr v i hr i e hr f hr a hr 1 n i 1 n d hr v i hr i e hr b hr 1 n i 1 n ln a t i hr i c hr d hr v i hr i e hr f hr where ati hr i and vi hr i denote ati and vi at hr respectively ahr bhr chr dhr ehr and fhr are the regression coefficients at hr n is the number of the hr pixels within the corresponding lr pixel the combined process is based on the following assumptions a for accuracy of regression analysis in the case of sufficient input samples the temporal and spatial heterogeneity can be ignored so as to keep the consistent relationship and coefficients in eq 4 for all hr pixels b the scale effect is taken into account in this process so the regression coefficients at hr are free of spatial scale effect 3 5 evaluation strategy 3 5 1 evaluation of the downscaling algorithm the downscaling algorithm was evaluated from three aspects a evaluating spatial scale effect of the regression coefficients at hr b evaluating the reasonability and significance of the proposed empirical function relationship between ati evi and sm c evaluating the accuracy of the regression analysis between lr sm and hr ati and vi as mentioned in section 3 4 for taking regression coefficients at hr into eq 4 to estimate 1 km sm it is necessary to assume that the scale effect of regression coefficients can be ignored however regression coefficients at hr which were obtained by eq 6 are derived from two different spatial resolutions cci sm at 25 km ati and evi at 1 km so it is very difficult to guarantee that the regression coefficients at hr are free of spatial scale effect in order to analyze the scale effect on the regression coefficients at hr the specific strategy consists of 4 steps a obtaining the regression coefficients at hr by eq 6 with 25 km bias corrected cci sm and corresponding 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi b bringing regression coefficients at hr into eq 4 to estimate hr sm 1 km with the 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi and aggregating the hr sm to 25 km scale by eq 5 as aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution c aggregating 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi to 25 km resolution to estimate the sm at 25 km resolution by eq 4 with the regression coefficients at hr and defining this 25 km sm as regressed sm at 25 km resolution d comparing all aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and regressed sm at 25 km resolution based on the above evaluation strategy the influence of scale effect on regression coefficients at hr can be directly evaluated and quantitatively analyzed after obtaining the regression coefficients of eq 6 the 3 d fitted surface of the regression relationship between ati evi and sm at hr would be determined based on eq 4 and the reasonability and significance of the proposed empirical function relationship between ati evi and sm could be evaluated by analyzing the 3 d fitted surface for evaluating the accuracy of the regression analysis between lr sm and hr ati and vi in eq 6 we compared the aggregated downscaled sm with the bias corrected cci sm at 25 km resolution 3 5 2 evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture the downscaled sm was evaluated based on three main aspects including spatial pattern temporal profile and the comparison with the in situ sm measurements the spatial pattern of the downscaled sm maps in this study area were evaluated with the corresponding bias corrected cci sm and evi maps on doy 209 220 and 232 in 2013 to evaluate the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm under different vegetation cover conditions during the study period the in situ observation stations are divided into three groups presenting stations with high moderate and low vegetation cover during the study period respectively cd05 ms3518 and ms3488 stations were selected as representative stations with high moderate and low levels of average evi respectively the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm the collocated in situ sm and the bias corrected cci sm together with the daily cumulative cmorph crt precipitation were compared at the selected three sites the downscaled sm data were validated by comparison with the average of all in situ sm measurements in the corresponding 1 km pixel from july 26 to august 24 in 2013 except one downscaled sm pixel with 2 stations c2 and f1 other pixels contain no more than 1 in situ measurement given that the spatial heterogeneity of sm may influence the spatial representativeness of 1 in situ measurement within 1 km resolution the validations of the downscaled sm pixels with at least 1 or 2 in situ measurements were implemented respectively and compared each other moreover we compared the regression relationship between the downscaled sm and the collocated in situ sm without or with evi as an adjustment factor respectively in order to evaluate the influence of the vegetation conditions on the downscaled results significantly the uncertainty of reconstructed lst in ati modeling could impact the accuracy of downscaled sm so the downscaled sm based on the original modis lst or the reconstructed lst were validated respectively and compared each other 3 5 3 evaluation metrics the statistical metrics including correlation coefficient r bias unbiased root mean square error ubrmse entekhabi et al 2010b

s m p i and s m q i are the mean values of all s m p i and s m q i 4 results and discussion 4 1 cci soil moisture validation and bias correction fig 4 a shows the multi year temporal profile of original cci sm data and average collocated in situ sm see section 3 1 within the corresponding cci sm pixel which is marked by blue rectangular frame as shown in fig 1 fig 4b shows the temporal evolution of daily cumulative cmorph crt precipitation along with original cci sm and the corresponding average in situ sm in 2013 between approximately october and april of the following years the cci sm data are missing or discarded based on the quality control information since the soil is frozen in these periods the temporal variation of the cci sm data is similar to that of in situ sm measurements in the multi year temporal profile despite the underestimation of cci sm during most available observation periods since the late april both in situ and cci sm rise significantly with the increase of precipitation throughout the study period which is from doy 207 to 236 in 2013 the overall trend of both sm observations is downward but the original cci sm data are more sensitive to precipitation than the corresponding in situ sm against the average collocated in situ sm measurements fig 5 shows the validation results of the original cci sm and the bias corrected cci sm respectively fig 5a shows that the original cci sm have a relatively high correlation coefficient r 0 64 but with large bias 0 071 m3 m3 low slope 0 387 and large mae 0 077 m3 m3 which means that most of original cci sm are underestimated validation to the bias corrected cci sm fig 5b shows similar correlation coefficient r 0 627 but much less bias 0 m3 m3 higher slope 0 627 and less mae 0 062 m3 m3 the distribution of the samples of the bias corrected cci sm appears obviously closer and more symmetric around the 1 1 line than that of original cci sm ee 77 8 versus ee 70 67 in terms of ubrmse the cloud of points from bias corrected cci sm becomes more dispersed than that of original cci sm ubrmse 0 082 m3 m3 versus ubrmse 0 073 m3 m3 as the bias correction method based on cdfs stretches the value range of original data as shown in fig 3 4 2 evaluation of the downscaling algorithm for evaluating and analyzing the impact of scale effect on regression coefficients at hr we compared aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution with regressed sm at 25 km resolution section 3 5 1 as is shown in fig 6 the result shows very low errors bias 0 003 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 003 m3 m3 and mae 0 003 m3 m3 very high correlation coefficient r 0 999 and the slope 1 02 is close to 1 0 this verified our assumption that the regression coefficients of the downscaling algorithm are free of spatial scale effect so the regression coefficients at hr obtained by eq 6 can be brought into eq 4 to estimate sm at 1 km resolution as described in section 3 4 after getting the regression coefficients of eq 6 and applying them to eq 4 the 3 d fitted surface of the regression relationship between ati evi and sm based on eq 4 is shown in fig 7 and the values of ar br cr dr er and fr in eq 4 are 0 092 0 03 0 009 23 806 0 345 and 0 305 respectively it shows a good correlation r 0 726 between the fitting surface and data used for regression fig 7a shows that given evi the regression relationship between sm and ati follows a monotonically increasing natural logarithm function which is consistent with the empirical function mentioned by qin et al 2013 and notarnicola et al 2013 but the coefficients of the natural logarithm functional relationships vary with the evi values we chose sm values in a fixed range from 0 to 0 4 m3 m3 in fig 7 for analyzing the effect of vegetation condition on the relationship between sm and ati as shown in fig 7b the corresponding ati value range is about 0 01 0 15 k 1 referring to the regression curve when evi 0 and the ati value range is about 0 035 0 0625 k 1 referring to the regression curve when evi 0 6 this means that for a fixed range of sm variation with the increase of evi the corresponding ati range become narrower and less sensitive to the sm variation this finding is consistent with those in cai et al 2007 and notarnicola et al 2013 fig 7c shows that when sm 0 m3 m3 the corresponding ati value increases as the evi value increases this should be because in the case that the sm is almost 0 ati is mainly determined by soil composition and vegetation condition and based on eq 2 the denser the vegetation the larger the value of ati due to the smaller surface albedo tian et al 2014 and smaller amplitude of diurnal temperature cycle to further quantitatively evaluate the performance of the downscaling algorithm the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and the bias corrected cci sm as the input data in eq 6 were compared in fig 8 the result presents a low error bias 0 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 06 m3 m3 mae 0 043 m3 m3 a good correlation coefficient r 0 726 and relatively high slope 0 528 most importantly the ee of all aggregated downscaled sm values is 88 44 when compared with the bias corrected cci sm values which means the sm downscaling algorithm is almost unbiased with very low uncertainties there is a small fraction of aggregated downscaled sm samples which underestimate the corresponding bias corrected cci sm values in fig 8 the causes leading to these underestimations will be further analyzed and discussed in section 4 5 4 3 spatial pattern and temporal profile of the downscaled soil moisture fig 9 shows the spatial distributions of the bias corrected cci sm fig 9a the downscaled 1 km sm fig 9b and the corresponding evi fig 9c on doy 209 220 and 232 respectively in general the downscaled sm shows good consistency with corresponding bias corrected cci sm in spatial pattern but the downscaled ones show fine spatial variations of sm the downscaled sm shows good consistency with lr cci sm under various evi values indicating that the proposed sm downscaling method effectively mitigates the influence of vegetation condition on the relationship between sm and ati because hr ati and evi pixels are available in most regions the downscaled hr sm data are almost complete where lr sm data are originally missing however the downscaled results with high average sm underestimate bias corrected cci sm in the eastern and southern regions at doy 209 by visual interpretation the reason of this underestimation will be discussed in detail in section 4 5 as is shown in fig 10 at all three stations cd05 ms3518 and ms3488 the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm and the collocated in situ sm are consistent at all three evi levels although the downscaled sm is a little smaller than the in situ sm in certain time periods i e doy from 223 to 233 in fig 10a under condition with very densely vegetated surface the downscaled sm values are closer to the in situ sm observations than the bias corrected cci sm values are the temporal variations of the downscaled sm the collocated in situ measurements and the bias corrected cci sm show similar responses to the precipitation among three sm data with different spatial scales cci sm is most sensitive to precipitation it increases most at the same or next day with the precipitation events i e doy 207 219 228 and 234 in fig 10a and decreases most during the period of little or no precipitation events i e doy from 208 to 215 and from 219 to 222 in fig 10a c meanwhile the response of the downscaled sm to precipitation is more similar to that of the in situ sm and its fluctuation range is smaller than that of cci sm which indicates that the downscaled sm improves spatial representativeness of cci sm however when the stations with high sm value have little or no precipitation in the following days i e doy from 208 to 215 in fig 10a c the downscaled sm values will decrease more and faster than the in situ sm measurements the main reason of above phenomenon is discrepancy of sm loss due to different depth of sm observations jackson 1973 the downscaled sm values and the in situ sm measurements are few millimeters van doninck et al 2011 and 5 cm under the soil surface respectively 4 4 validation of the downscaled sm using the in situ sm measurements fig 11 compares the downscaled sm and the collocated average in situ sm measurements see section 3 1 at the 53 sm observation stations in the study period as shown in fig 11a the data are distributed near the 1 1 line with a relatively good correlation coefficient r 0 552 and low bias 0 014 m3 m3 compared to the in situ sm values the ee of all downscaled sm values is 61 71 however in most cases only 1 in situ measurement within a 1 km resolution pixel the in situ sm measurement at only one station may not well represent the corresponding 1 km downscaled sm due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of sm in the study area leading to some validation samples in fig 11a deviating from the 1 1 line with ubrmse 0 097 m3 m3 mae 0 076 m3 m3 and slope 0 404 when downscaled sm pixels with at least 2 in situ measurements were selected for validation the results fig 11b show much lower errors ubrmse 0 036 m3 m3 and mae 0 032 m3 m3 higher correlation coefficient r 0 893 and higher slope 1 075 than those of fig 11a and the bias 0 018 m3 m3 is very close to that of fig 11a this means that the errors and uncertainties of the downscaled sm shown in fig 11a are mainly due to the low spatial representativeness of in situ sm measurements not due to the downscaling algorithm to further analyze whether the presented sm downscaling algorithm effectively mitigates or even eliminates the effect of vegetation conditions we compared the regression relationship between the downscaled sm and collocated in situ sm without or with evi as an adjustment factor respectively as are shown in fig 12 a and b the difference of the 2 correlation coefficients is merely 0 007 as is shown in fig 12c when evi is 0 6 with the in situ sm ranges from 0 to 0 6 m3 m3 the largest discrepancies of the corresponding downscaled sm values obtained from the 2 fitted surfaces range just from 0 044 to 0 02 m3 m3 these results indicate that the relationship between the downscaled sm and the in situ sm is just very slightly affected by vegetation condition which confirms that the proposed sm downscaling algorithm is robust for regions with different vegetation conditions to evaluate the impacts of the uncertainty of reconstructed lst in ati modeling on the accuracy of downscaled sm the downscaled sm based on the original high quality modis lst and the downscaled sm based on the reconstructed lst were validated respectively and compared each other as are shown in fig 13 when the validation was conducted in cases at least 1 sm observation station is available in a 1 km pixel fig 13a and b the metrics of these two validations have no significant differences r 0 508 bias 0 001 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 093 m3 m3 mae 0 072 m3 m3 slope 0 364 and ee 66 09 versus r 0 579 bias 0 022 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 098 m3 m3 mae 0 079 m3 m3 slope 0 426 and ee 59 07 likewise when the validations were conducted in cased there were at least 2 in situ measurements in one 1 km pixel the validation results as shown in fig 13c and d respectively are also in good consistency the differences of r bias ubrmse mae and slopes are 0 005 0 03 m3 m3 0 001 m3 m3 0 019 m3 m3 and 0 162 respectively these results indicate that the procedure of lst reconstruction using the rsdast model sun et al 2017 has no significant impact on the accuracy of the downscaled sm the evaluation results at pixels with at least 2 in situ measurements fig 13c and d are much better than the corresponding results at pixels with only one in situ measurements fig 13a and b which again confirms that the errors and uncertainties of the validation results are mainly due to the less representativeness of in situ sm data not due to the spatial downscaling algorithm 4 5 analysis of the underestimation in the downscaled soil moisture when the aggregated downscaled sm were compared with the bias corrected cci sm at 25 km resolution to assess the accuracy of the regression analysis in the downscaling algorithm section 4 2 fig 8 presents that there are 150 outliers with negative residuals outside an expected error range of 0 05 15 the distribution of these outliers in the scatterplot is regular and not as random as that of outliers with positive residuals this indicates that these outliers with negative residuals are not random errors and there should be other factors that cause the underestimation of some downscaled sm values to quantitatively analyze the effect of the process of reconstructing clear sky lst we compared the 25 km scale residuals from fig 8 and the ratio of 1 km scale ati pixels from reconstructed lst pixels in all available ati pixels within the corresponding 25 km scale cci pixels which was defined as the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst fig 14 illustrates that the residuals are mainly concentrated between 0 1 m3 m3 in the range of ratio 0 to 100 the error bars in fig 14 show that when the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is greater than 80 the corresponding standard deviations of residuals increase but the mean values of residuals do not change regularly with the increase of ratio the above results show that larger ratio of ati from reconstructed lst may introduce larger uncertainties but the increase of ratio will not cause overall negative deviations to all downscaled sm thus the process of reconstructing clear sky lst is not the direct cause of those outliers with negative residuals in fig 8 in fact the cci sm represents the merged sm of several satellite observations which have different observation times section 2 2 2 we defined these observation times from several satellite sm products as the cci sm observation time in contrast the downscaled sm were mainly estimated by using the daily scale ati and evi so their sm values reflected the overall situation of sm throughout the day in the case of non synchronous observation time between the cci sm and the downscaled sm we discussed the causes of outliers with negative residuals in three cases a the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is very small if some abrupt changes i e irrigation or short term precipitation of surface sm occurred within the observation time of cci sm the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution may not capture these abrupt changes and would underestimate the corresponding cci sm this is because the abrupt surface sm rising caused by short term precipitation will dry out soon within a day deardorff 1977 jackson 1973 roundy et al 1997 especially for the downscaled sm regressed from optical thermal observations which is only sensitive to the sm of the top few millimeters of soil b the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is very large if there was continuous cloud coverage throughout the day this would cause a serious lack of available modis lst pixels the aggregated downscaled sm pixels at 25 km resolution which are mostly regressed from the reconstructed lst pixels could seriously underestimate the cci sm values with precipitation events during the observation time c the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is medium the underestimation could be related to precipitation events occurring within the cci observation time which were not well reflected by the downscaled sm from the combination of the original modis lst and the reconstructed lst based on the analyses of above three cases we assumed that the precipitation event within the cci sm observation time was major factor for the underestimation of the downscaled sm we utilized per 3 hour cumulative precipitation data from the cmorph crt product to verify the above hypothesis by statistically analyze the outlier samples in fig 8 among all 150 underestimated samples 85 of them have short term precipitation events during the cci sm observation time and 29 samples have short term precipitation events in their nearest 8 pixels during the cci sm observation time 76 of the underestimated samples in fig 8 have short term precipitation events at the pixels or the nearest pixels during the cci sm observation time specifically we selected two representative outliers with very small or very large ratio of ati from reconstructed ati respectively for checking the effect of the precipitation events within the cci observation time on the underestimation of the downscaled sm as was shown in fig 15 for the low ratio 9 28 of ati from reconstructed lst fig 15a shows that the short term precipitation within the cci sm observation time result in bias corrected cci sm value being underestimated by the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution residual 0 147 m3 m3 as shown in fig 15b the missing of all modis lst ratio 100 in conjunction with precipitation events within the cci sm observation time leads to larger deviation residual 0 287 m3 m3 between aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and bias corrected cci sm in summary the underestimations of downscaled sm are mainly caused by the short term precipitation events happening within the cci sm observation time which the downscaled sm based on daily scale ati could hardly capture 5 conclusions this paper presents a new ati based lr satellite sm downscaling method which considers the effect of vegetation condition on the relationship between ati and sm the main difference between the presented sm downscaling method and the previous ti and ati based downscaling methods is that vi indicating vegetation cover condition was introduced to globally quantitatively and accurately modulate the vegetation effects on the relationship between ati and sm so our method is more robust and more accurate for regions with different vegetation conditions than the previous studies and the accuracy of downscaled results is independent of the vegetation cover conditions the main conclusions are as follows 1 cci sm products need to be bias corrected before the spatial downscaling algorithm was applied to the modified q q adjustment method is effective for correcting bias of cci sm products 2 an ati based sm spatial downscaling algorithm was presented to generate spatiotemporally complete consistent and accurate 1 km resolution sm products by introducing evi as a global vegetation cover adjustment factor the presented sm downscaling algorithm based on ati is nearly free of vegetation effect the accuracies of the downscaled 1 km spatial resolution sm are consistent in areas with different evis 3 the aggregated spatially downscaled sm and the bias corrected cci sm show good consistencies in spatial patterns temporal profiles and accuracies which indicates that the proposed sm downscaling algorithm itself is unbiased 4 the process of lst reconstruction does not introduce much uncertainties into the downscaled sm the major errors lie in the downscaled sm are mainly attributed to the inconsistencies between the instantaneous observation of the cci sm and the daily scale sm indicated by ati especially in cases there are short term precipitation and drying out process in a day in summary the sm downscaling algorithm presented in this paper is effective and applicable to generating spatiotemporally complete consistent and accurate higher spatial resolution sm datasets in areas from low to very dense vegetation cover while it is not applicable to areas with extremely dense vegetation cover where the ati no longer indicates the sm djamai et al 2016 molero et al 2016 song et al 2019 the presented sm downscaling algorithm could be applicable in other areas and for downscaling of other lr satellite sm products such as smap sm products and the sm products simulated by land surface models credit

2604,many applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions require soil moisture sm estimates at fine resolutions soil moisture estimates of current satellite missions are normally at coarse spatial resolutions such as 25 36 km for soil moisture and ocean salinity smos sm data many spatial downscaling approaches have been developed to get finer resolution sm apparent thermal inertia ati as a reliable approximation of thermal inertia ti that could be derived from daily fine resolution optical thermal remote sensing rs data has been testified to be highly related to sm however the empirical relationship between ati and sm varies with vegetation cover density the main purpose of this study is to develop an ati based sm downscaling method that is free of vegetation cover effects the study was conducted in naqu areas in the central tibetan plateau tp in southwest china where spatially intensive in situ sm measurements were routinely obtained european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture combined product version 4 2 was used for this study the fine resolution 1 km ati data were derived from the collection 6 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products a modified quantile quantile q q adjustment method was applied to correct the bias of the cci sm data before downscaling a non linear regression model between bias corrected cci sm and fine resolution ati was built to disaggregate the bias corrected sm to spatial resolution of 1 km in this model enhanced vegetation index evi was introduced to globally and quantitatively adjust the vegetation effect in the relationship between sm and ati the bias corrected cci sm and the downscaled 1 km resolution sm were evaluated using the in situ sm measurements obtained from the multi scale soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tp ctp smtmn in the study area the results indicate that the proposed modified q q adjustment method effectively reduced the bias of the original cci sm data bias 0 m3 m3 the downscaled 1 km resolution sm shows fine scale spatial variability of soil moisture and preserves the accuracy r 0 552 and temporal variability of the bias corrected cci sm the accuracies of the downscaled sm over areas with different vegetation cover show quite good consistency the uncertainties of the proposed sm spatial downscaling method were comprehensively analyzed the proposed ati based sm downscaling algorithm is applicable to generating representative and consistent high spatial resolution sm over areas

introduction as one of important and essential environmental variables soil moisture sm affects many exchange processes of material and energy including hydrological and atmospheric processes fischer et al 2007 vereecken et al 2008 water cycle larson et al 2008 and energy exchange between soil and the near surface atmosphere daly and porporato 2005 sm datasets have been widely applied to numerous fields such as weather forecasting scipal et al 2008 water resource management dobriyal et al 2012 drought analysis sheffield et al 2004 agricultural production tao et al 2003 and many others domains hence it is utmost significant to obtain spatially and temporally complete and accurate information of sm compared with in situ measurements of sm remote sensing rs is an efficient and convenient approach to get spatial distribution information of sm over large and heterogeneous coverage lu et al 2014 peng et al 2016 because of an evident relevance between sm and soil dielectric properties

sm data have been disaggregated by integrating with high resolution hr rs ancillary data to get finer spatial resolution sm product liu et al 2018 peng et al 2015b peng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 higher resolution rs observations from both microwave and optical thermal visible near infrared thermal infrared sensors and the derived variables have been used as proxies for low resolution lr sm downscaling choi and hur 2012 das et al 2011 merlin et al 2010 narayan et al 2006 song et al 2014 for instance national aeronautics and space administration nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission blended 36 km resolution radiometer and 3 km resolution radar data to obtain 9 km resolution sm estimations entekhabi et al 2010a though the radar products have stopped transmitting due to an anomaly involving the radar s high power amplifier in july 2015 smap mission showed that combining passive and active microwave rs data for concurrent synchronous observations could obtain sm estimates at 9 km resolution das et al 2014 some attempts have been made to deal with the lack of radar data for example the smap level 2 enhanced passive soil moisture product 9 km have been developed and assessed by chan et al 2018 and das et al 2019 have replaced the radar data of smap with the copernicus project sentinel 1a 1b synthetic aperture radar sar data to generate the smap sentinel1 active passive high resolution product 1 km or 3 km however sar data such as sentinel 1 have longer revisit period than the optical thermal rs data such as modis it is hard to obtain daily hr sm product by blending sar and radiometer data on the other side optical thermal rs data also play a significant part as proxies in lr sm downscaling the triangle trapezoid methods have been used for sm downscaling based on the empirical regression relationship between land surface temperature lst normalized difference vegetation index ndvi surface albedo and sm over sparse vegetation cover regions carlson et al 1994 chauhan et al 2003 comparing to the triangle trapezoid approaches which directly utilize lst and ndvi as proxies for sm downscaling it is a more intuitive effective and theoretical method to extract a proxy which can intuitively reflect spatial distribution of sm at hr from various indices related to sm peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 so far various proxies have been applied to spatial downscaling of low resolution satellite sm data based upon empirical or physical relationship between the proxies and sm representative proxies for sm downscaling include soil evaporative efficiency see merlin et al 2012 merlin et al 2008 soil wetness sw index kim and hogue 2012 vegetation temperature condition index vtci peng et al 2015b peng et al 2016 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi wang et al 2016 these proxy based methods make great use of the multisource and long period hr data of the optical thermal sensors peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 however the quality of the optical thermal data is severely hindered by missing data due to the coverage of clouds djamai et al 2016 molero et al 2016 song et al 2019 thus the accuracy of the downscaled sm from this kind of methods greatly relies on the accuracies of the proxies that represents sm spatial variation at hr peng et al 2017 wei et al 2019 so choosing and getting appropriate proxy is critical to lr sm downscaling thermal inertia ti or thermal property sellers 1965 defined as the magnitude of the thermal variations of a substance to a time variant surface energy flux has been found to be closely related to near surface sm or surface composition price 1977 the formula of ti consists of the material s bulk density specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity and the accuracy of thermal conductivity basically determines the quality of the coupling between sm and ti minacapilli et al 2009 however these parameters can hardly be derived directly from rs so some alternatives of ti based on rs data were developed fang et al 2013 short and stuart 1982 van doninck et al 2011 fang et al 2013 proposed daily temperature change as an alternative of ti for sm downscaling compared with the proxies containing only the lst value on one observation time fang and lakshmi 2014 kim and hogue 2012 merlin et al 2012 peng et al 2015a wang et al 2016 the diurnal temperature difference derived from two daily satellite lst observations was used as an approximation of diurnal soil temperature difference and showed better correlation to daily mean sm fang et al 2018 senanayake et al 2019 however diurnal soil temperature difference between two times observations in one day is not sufficient to characterize the true diurnal surface temperature amplitudes and the relationship between diurnal soil temperature difference and daily mean sm varies with seasons vegetation density and soil texture senanayake et al 2019 compared to the diurnal soil temperature difference apparent thermal inertia ati was proposed as a better approximation of ti short and stuart 1982 ati is defined as a measure of the proportion of radiation energy absorbed divided by the consequent temperature change cracknell and xue 1996 short and stuart 1982 the superiority of ati to ti in application is that ati could be calculated based on surface albedo and diurnal surface temperature difference from satellite data van doninck et al 2011 derived diurnal surface temperature amplitudes of each pixel by a multitemporal approach which was based on a sinusoidal fitting of the diurnal surface temperature variation with at least two daily satellite lst observations in one pixel and diurnal surface temperature amplitudes of each pixel were subsequently combined with surface albedo to obtain daily ati for each pixel moreover a solar correction factor was introduced into the calculation of ati in order to compensate for seasonal variation in solar insolation short and stuart 1982 thus ati shows a stronger correspondence to sm than diurnal soil temperature difference does notarnicola et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 have come up with a similar regression relationship between sm and ati and the latter was used for upscaling in situ sm at point scale to a certain spatial scale e g 1 km over the past two decades the relationship between sm and ati has been utilized by numerous studies for hr sm estimation under different types of land cover such as barren or sparsely vegetated cai et al 2007 song and jia 2016 croplands notarnicola et al 2013 sohrabinia et al 2014 and forest chang et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 nevertheless because the amplitude of diurnal temperature difference is smaller in wet areas than in dry areas price 1985 the applications of ati for sm downscaling is limited to only sparsely vegetated areas chang et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 for this reason some studies only applied the empirical ati sm relationship for sm downscaling in condition where the ndvi 0 4 song and jia 2016 to overcome the vegetation effect in the ati sm regression lu et al 2014 established an ati ndvi space by replacing lst in the lst ndvi feature space so as to obtain 1 km spatial resolution sm over regions from bare soil to full cover vegetation unfortunately the assumption of the linear correlation between sm and ati in this model limited its performance notarnicola et al 2013 qin et al 2013 fang et al 2018 and fang et al 2013 developed a linear regression model based on the ti relationship between diurnal temperature difference and daily sm within each ndvi interval for downscaling lr sm product they assumed that the linear relationship is fixed in each ndvi interval with the downscaling algorithms from fang et al 2013 considering the influences of season vegetation density and the soil texture senanayake et al 2021b senanayake et al 2021a and senanayake et al 2019 firstly classified the entire regression model into 24 classes i e three ndvi classes two soil classes and four seasonal classes and then established the relationship between the diurnal soil temperature difference and the daily mean sm within each class for downscaling coarse resolution satellite sm products nevertheless there are two main limitations in the piecewise fitting model proposed by fang et al 2013 and senanayake et al 2019 one limitation is that there usually exist the discontinuities between each class of the piecewise fitting model resulting in the visible discontinuities of downscaled results between the regions of each class another is that the linear relationship between diurnal temperature difference and daily sm still can be effected by vegetation conditions within each ndvi class obviously the piecewise fitting model does not globally and quantitatively solve the influence of vegetation conditions on the ti relationship between daily temperature changes and daily sm thus to generate the consistent and accurate downscaled sm data based on the ti or ati sm relationship it is critical to develop a global and quantitative model to modulate the effect of vegetation condition on the ti or ati sm relationship in the downscaling method the main aim of this paper is to present a new coarse resolution satellite sm downscaling algorithm with satellite derived hr ati as major proxy while globally and quantitatively taking account of the effect of vegetation conditions on the empirical relationship between ati and sm to generate spatiotemporally complete and consistent hr sm dataset this paper is organized as follows the study area and the data used for study are described in section 2 the schematic paradigm of the whole research the data processing method the bias correction method for satellite sm data ati estimation method the sm downscaling models and the evaluation strategy are presented in section 3 the models performance evaluation the downscaled sm accuracy assessments and the uncertainties analysis are presented in section 4 the whole paper is concluded in section 5 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the study area extents from latitudes 31 n to 34 n and longitudes 91 e to 94 e and is located in naqu area in the central tp in the southwestern china fig 1 it has a high elevation from 3802 to 6513 m within an area of 300 km 300 km as is known to all the climate of the asian continent has been profoundly affected by the energy and water dynamics of the entire tp qin et al 2013 yang et al 2011 the terrain in this study area is quite complex as is shown in fig 1 except for the relatively flat terrain in the southwest and northeast there are rolling mountains called tanggula mountains across the northwest to east and extremely undulating surface in the southeast with tanggula mountains as a boundary the south of the border is the monsoon climate with precipitation concentrated in summer and the north is mainly continental climate which is less affected by the monsoon in addition this area is located at the junction of the semi humid and semi arid regions of the plateau sub frigid zone and its annual precipitation is about 400 mm from northwest to southeast vegetation types change gradually from alpine grassland to alpine meadow and then to alpine shrub and meadow the soil consists of a large amount of sand and silt and a small amount of clay with a large spatial heterogeneity the data sets about types of climate and vegetation are provided by data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn 2 2 data sets a summary of the datasets used in this study is given in table 1 detailed data descriptions are given in the following sections 2 2 1 in situ measurements of soil moisture the in situ measurements of sm in this study area are obtained from the multi scale soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central tp ctp smtmn yang et al 2013 the locations of the in situ measurement stations are shown in fig 1 during august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 there were a total of 57 stations used to measure soil moisture and temperature at four depths 0 5 10 20 and 40 cm and at three networks with different spatial scales 1 0 0 3 and 0 1 the number of stations within the corresponding esa cci 25 km pixel is shown in fig 1 there is a total of 12 cci sm pixels containing the collocated measurement stations including one pixel with one site one pixel with two sites five pixels with three sites two pixels with four sites two pixels with five sites and one pixel with twenty one sites the satellite sm products from microwave rs represent the sm in the top 2 5 cm of soil dorigo et al 2017 ulaby et al 1982 and the retrieved sm data based on the optical thermal rs products only capture the few millimeters measurements under the soil surface van doninck et al 2011 so we choose the in situ sm measurements at 0 5 cm depth to evaluate the satellite sm results the temporal resolution of the in situ sm measurements is 30 min with the time zone at utc 8 00 because the optical thermal rs data are obtained at local solar time of utc 6 00 the 30 min in situ sm observations were adjusted to utc 6 00 to temporally match the in situ sm and the optical thermal rs data and then these 30 min measurements were averaged to estimate daily in situ sm measurements hereafter in situ sm refers to daily in situ sm to avoid the impact of soil freezing on sm observation only the data in the period from july 26 to august 24 2013 a total of 30 days were used for this study more information about the ctp smtmn dataset are described in yang et al 2013 and qin et al 2013 2 2 2 esa cci soil moisture data the esa cci sm product used in this study is version 4 2 it includes three surface sm data sets the active passive and the combined product the active product consists of four active ers 1 ami ws ers 2 ami ws ascat a and ascat b microwave products and the passive product consists of seven passive smmr ssm i tmi amsr e amsr2 windsat and smos microwave products more details about passive and active data sets refer to dorigo et al 2017 the combined product is a merged product based upon the previous two data sets with 2 5 cm penetration depth dorigo et al 2017 ulaby et al 1982 because the active and passive sensors are complementary for retrieving surface sm under different land cover types dorigo et al 2015 we choose the combined product so that we can take advantages of both passive and active sm products moreover the combined cci sm product generally outperforms the single sensor input products with higher accuracy and better spatiotemporally completeness dorigo et al 2017 the surface sm of combined product has spatial resolution of 25 km 0 25 on the world geodetic system 1984 wgs 84 reference system and temporal resolution of 1 day with the time zone at utc 0 00 the combined product searches for all available microwave products as the input datasets of the merging process within a range of 12 h centered on the reference time at 0 00 utc dorigo et al 2015 considering the time zone of the study area is utc 6 00 the satellite sm data over this study area between 18 00 on the previous day and 18 00 on the day at local solar time were merged to generate combined esa cci sm product specifically the cci sm data used in this study only come from the fusion of amsr2 only descending overpass and ascat a b both ascending and descending overpasses for more details on the description and the retrieval and merging algorithm of esa cci sm dataset please refer to liu et al 2012 liu et al 2011 wagner et al 2012 gruber et al 2017 and dorigo et al 2017 2 2 3 modis optical thermal data this study used three ancillary satellite datasets including lst vegetation index vi and surface albedo quality from the collection 6 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products these modis products are distributed through the nasa level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov at goddard space flight center the lst datasets come from the collection 6 modis terra lst and emissivity daily l3 global 1 km grid products mod11a1 and modis aqua lst and emissivity daily l3 global 1 km grid products myd11a1 the vi datasets containing ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi data layers are obtained from the collection 6 modis terra vi 16 day l3 global 1 km grid products mod13a2 on the one hand the saturation problem over high biomass areas and soil noise problem of ndvi can be overcome by using evi which was constructed by decoupling the canopy background signal and reducing atmospheric influences huete et al 2002 miura et al 2001 potithep et al 2013 son et al 2014 on the other hand ndvi was found to be more sensitive to vegetation in arid and semi arid regions with low biomass suggesting that ndvi may be a better estimator of root zone sm in arid and semi arid environments didan et al 2008 schnur et al 2010 senay et al 2007 considering soil noise problem and our study period within the vegetation growth season evi was chosen for representing vegetation condition in this study pixels covered by snow and water where surface sm cannot be retrieved were masked using the quality information of the collection 6 modis terra and aqua brdf albedo quality daily l3 global 500 m grid products mcd43a2 compared with previous versions the collection 6 mcd43a2 products use current day snow condition rather than the majority snow condition of the 16 day period 2 2 4 glass broadband albedo product spatiotemporally complete and consistent land surface albedo product was critical for estimating ati the broadband albedo product of the global land surface satellite glass project glass02a06 liang et al 2013 was used for ati estimation in this study glass broadband albedo product was obtained from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn the glass albedo product shows similar accuracy to the mcd43 as was validated at the fluxnet sites in liu et al 2013b the modis mcd43 product has many spatial gaps in the cloud contaminated and the permanent and seasonal snow covered areas however the spatial gaps in glass land surface albedo product were filled by using the statistics based temporal filtering stf algorithm liu et al 2013a the glass albedo product used in this study has 8 day temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution more information about the characterization and the retrieval temporal filter and gap filling algorithm of the glass albedo product can be found in liu et al 2013b and qu et al 2014 2 2 5 cmorph crt precipitation product precipitation product was used for analyzing the uncertainties of the downscaled sm the precipitation product used in this study were generated by the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph at national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa joyce et al 2004 the cmorph version 1 0 dataset includes the raw only satellite based precipitation estimates and the bias corrected precipitation products cmorph crt ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip cmorph v1 0 in the inter comparison studies of jiang et al 2017 and xie et al 2017 the cmorph crt product shows consistently superior performance in representing the globally spatiotemporal patterns and variations of precipitation in regions from 60 s to 60 n considering the spatial and temporal resolutions of the cci sm product we chose the cmorph crt data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h with the time zone at utc 0 00 for analyzing the effect of precipitation on the accuracy of the downscaled sm 3 methodology the methodology of downscaling lr cci sm data 25 km to 1 km resolution based on ati is schematically presented in fig 2 it is consisted of four steps a validation and bias correction of the cci sm based on the in situ sm measurements b processing of the ancillary satellite data which includes the reconstructing of lst under cloudy conditions interpolating the 8 day composited surface albedo to daily data and interpolating the 16 day composited evi data to daily evi c computing ati based on the daily surface albedo and reconstructed lst from step b and denoising the estimated ati d building the nonlinear regression model to downscale the 25 km resolution bias corrected cci sm to 1 km resolution 3 1 cci soil moisture validation and bias correction a quality control procedure was applied to the cci sm before further analysis the cci sm data with flag values from 1 to 63 or 127 nan are masked in order to exclude the low quality sm data which are influenced by freezing extremely dense vegetation and other conditions for the quality flags please refer to the product specification document psd of the cci sm product https www esa soilmoisture cci org node 139 the validation of the quality controlled cci sm data hereafter original cci sm refers to quality controlled cci sm was performed by comparing the original cci sm with the average of all in situ sm measurements within the corresponding 25 km pixel from august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 to make the average in situ sm measurements be representative to the cci sm at 25 km resolution five cci sm pixels containing at least 4 in situ measurements were chosen for validation montzka et al 2020 similarly for evaluating the corrected results the bias corrected cci sm data were validated with same method as the original cci sm data to better evaluate the performance of the sm downscaling method a bias correction procedure based on in situ sm measurements was applied to the cci sm before it was downscaled a modified quantile quantile q q adjustment method which was originally proposed to correct biases of total column ozone datasets from different sensors by bai et al 2016 was used for correcting the bias of the original cci sm data fig 3 illustrates the principles of the modified q q adjustment for bias correction one of the superiorities of the modified q q adjustment to the original q q adjustment is that it is suitable to conditions in which the numbers of raw and control observation data are different for cci sm data the control cci observations represent the cci sm pixels with sufficient in situ sm measurements and the raw cci observations represent the cci sm pixels without sufficient in situ sm measurements the number of control cci observations are not equal to the raw cci observations thus we used the modified q q adjustment method for bias correction of cci sm in this study the cci sm estimates covering at least 4 valid in situ measurements and the collocated average in situ sm measurements were used as two control observations for bias correction of cci sm from august 1 2010 to december 31 2014 the raw observations consist of the cci sm estimates including 4 valid in situ measurements the original cci sm data were divided into two parts the raw sms and the control sms the bias correction process of the original cci sm data can be summarized as follows a bias correction of the cci sm data belonging to the control sms by the relationship of cumulative distribution functions cdfs between the control cci observations and the average collocated in situ observations b bias correction of the cci sm data belonging to the raw observation by the modified q q adjustment method a sm value sm obs j in the raw observed cci sm data thick black line in fig 3 the raw observations are denoted as sm obs j hereafter is calibrated to the in situ measurement level dashed line in fig 3 defined as projected cci sm data denoted as sm prj j by removing the bias the modified q q adjustment is modeled using eq 1 1 sm prj j s m obs j δ s m j where j is the position of specific cci sm value on the corresponding cdf curve the larger of the j value the greater the cdf value of the corresponding sm sm prj j denotes the jth value in the projected cci sm value at the in situ measurement level sm obs j is the jth value in the raw observed cci sm data and δsm j is the bias between cci sm and in situ sm at the given sm obs j the details of the computation of δsm j are described in appendix a after bias correction the bias corrected cci sm data defined as all cci sm data that have been corrected for bias consisted of the projected cci sm data from the raw observation and the bias corrected data from the control observation 3 2 data processing both satellite data and in situ observations were processed for ati estimation and rs sm downscaling the geographic latitude longitude coordinate based on the wgs84 reference system is used as the spatial reference of re projection in order to keep spatial consistency of the cci sm modis lst glass land surface albedo and cmorph crt data quality control was applied to all the satellite data before further process because the sm downscaling algorithm we proposed is built upon the regression relationship between the sm at 25 km resolution and the corresponding evi and ati at 1 km resolution it is of critical importance for having adequate number of available 1 km resolution evi and ati pixels within the corresponding 25 km scale cci sm pixel however the availability of ati is often hampered by the absence of lst due to the coverage of clouds so the number of 25 km resolution cci sm pixels which contain the sufficient available 1 km scale ati and evi pixels are rather limited the number of original ati and evi pixels as available input samples maybe too small to meet the requirements of building the downscaling model thus before calculating ati the remotely sensed daily land surface temperature reconstruction rsdast model proposed by sun et al 2017 was applied to the modis lst data for reconstructing the clear sky lst over cloudy regions so that a spatiotemporally continuous daily day night lst data was obtained the rsdast model reconstructs clear sky lsts for areas contaminated by cloud using only clear sky neighboring lsts from nearby dates according to sun et al 2017 the lst reconstruction using rsdast model has coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 72 0 89 bias of 0 02 0 21 k and root mean square error rmse of 0 92 1 16 k for flat areas and r 2 of 0 81 0 89 bias of 0 35 1 52 k rmse of 1 42 2 24 k for mountainous areas the glass 8 day shortwave 0 3 5 0 μm albedo datasets including the white sky albedo wsa and black sky albedo bsa fields are interpolated to daily data with a linear interpolation function sohrabinia et al 2014 as the actual blue sky surface albedo is necessary for ati estimation we assume that the actual surface albedo is the average of wsa and bsa since their difference is very small and they have high correlation r 0 9949 over the study area in the whole year of 2013 li et al 2015 tang et al 2018 we fit the time series of 16 day composited evi data mod13a2 using a piecewise logistic model zhang et al 2003 to get the daily evi data for ati estimation the pixels covered by snow and water in the lst land surface albedo and evi data are masked based on the collocated quality flag information of mcd43a2 3 3 apparent thermal inertia estimation ati has been proposed as a surrogate indicator for the ti and has been proved to be an appropriate proxy of surface sm qin et al 2013 song and jia 2016 van doninck et al 2011 veroustraete et al 2012 verstraeten et al 2006 moreover ati is actually a measure of the magnitude of the temperature amplitude driven by the absorbed radiative energy since the water heat capacity is relatively large the more water content a soil contains the more resistance it has to the external perturbation qin et al 2013 in this study ati was taken as the main proxy for surface sm downscaling here the ati k 1 is calculated using eq 2 2 ati c 1 a a where c is the solar correction factor a is the actual surface albedo and a k is the amplitude of diurnal lst cycle the solar correction factor c changes over space and time to normalize for solar flux variations with latitude and solar declination the amplitude of diurnal lst cycle a represents the maximum lst difference during a day to calculate ati according to eq 2 the interpolated daily surface albedo and the reconstructed daily day night lst data mentioned in section 3 2 were used eq 2 is proposed by van doninck et al 2011 the details of the ati estimation method are described in appendix b once the ati was estimated two further processing steps were performed to reduce the noise existed in the ati data the first step is to determine the range of valid ati values in this study the 0 0 7957 k 1 corresponding ati value when cdf ati 0 9999 is chosen as the reasonable range according to the cdf of ati data statistics the second step is to apply a moving window averaging filter mwa notarnicola et al 2013 to further reduce the noise that caused by persistent clouds that are not successfully detected in the cloud mask 3 4 soil moisture downscaling algorithm when both the absorbed energy and the soil composition remain unchanged more water content leads to smaller temperature amplitude and in turn greater ati according to eq 2 qin et al 2013 thus the rationale of the sm downscaling algorithm in this study is based on the statistical correlation between surface sm and ati because the sensitivity of ati to sm decreases with the increase of vegetation cover notarnicola et al 2013 evi as a global adjustment factor was used to quantitatively modulate the empirical functional relationship between sm and ati under different vegetation conditions the original empirical relationship between sm and ati were proposed and constructed by qin et al 2013 and notarnicola et al 2013 which was expressed as eq 3 3 s m r a r b r ln a t i r c r where s m r and at i r denotes sm and ati at resolution r ar br and cr are the coefficients to be decided by regression analysis based on the research results in notarnicola et al 2013 for a given range of sm values greater ndvi value led to narrower dynamics range of ati leading the corresponding regression curve of sm and ati became steeper with greater ndvi value thus to quantitatively modulate the effect of vegetation condition on the empirical function relationship between sm and ati we re formulate the empirical function relationship between sm and ati by introducing vi as a global adjustment factor as is presented in eq 4 4 s m r a r b r ln a t i r c r d r v i r e r f r where v i r denotes vi at resolution r dr er and fr are the regression coefficients for quantifying the effect of vi on the relationship between sm and ati in this study evi was chosen for representing vegetation condition section 2 2 3 here we assume that the empirical relationship between sm and ati is continuously and nonlinearly modulated by evi value as long as the six coefficients in eq 4 were estimated at hr the sm at hr could be retrieved based on eq 4 when the hr ati and evi are available however only satellite sm products at lr are available for downscaling thus it is necessary to develop a new algorithm based on the eq 4 to estimate regression coefficients at hr by directly using satellite sm products at lr in this study the coefficients in eq 4 were obtained by directly relating hr ati and vi to lr sm and the relationship between hr ati vi and lr sm was built based on a song and jia 2016 which is used to relate the lr sm smlr to the hr sm smhr within the corresponding lr pixel as is expressed in eq 5 5 s m lr 1 n i 1 n s m hr i where n is the number of the hr pixels within the corresponding lr pixel in this study only 25 km resolution pixels with at least 80 available 1 km scale sm pixels were used for regression analysis by combining eqs 4 and 5 the lr sm and hr ati and vi are linked in order to calculate the regression coefficients at hr according to eq 6 6 s m lr 1 n i 1 n a hr b hr ln a t i hr i c hr d hr v i hr i e hr f hr a hr 1 n i 1 n d hr v i hr i e hr b hr 1 n i 1 n ln a t i hr i c hr d hr v i hr i e hr f hr where ati hr i and vi hr i denote ati and vi at hr respectively ahr bhr chr dhr ehr and fhr are the regression coefficients at hr n is the number of the hr pixels within the corresponding lr pixel the combined process is based on the following assumptions a for accuracy of regression analysis in the case of sufficient input samples the temporal and spatial heterogeneity can be ignored so as to keep the consistent relationship and coefficients in eq 4 for all hr pixels b the scale effect is taken into account in this process so the regression coefficients at hr are free of spatial scale effect 3 5 evaluation strategy 3 5 1 evaluation of the downscaling algorithm the downscaling algorithm was evaluated from three aspects a evaluating spatial scale effect of the regression coefficients at hr b evaluating the reasonability and significance of the proposed empirical function relationship between ati evi and sm c evaluating the accuracy of the regression analysis between lr sm and hr ati and vi as mentioned in section 3 4 for taking regression coefficients at hr into eq 4 to estimate 1 km sm it is necessary to assume that the scale effect of regression coefficients can be ignored however regression coefficients at hr which were obtained by eq 6 are derived from two different spatial resolutions cci sm at 25 km ati and evi at 1 km so it is very difficult to guarantee that the regression coefficients at hr are free of spatial scale effect in order to analyze the scale effect on the regression coefficients at hr the specific strategy consists of 4 steps a obtaining the regression coefficients at hr by eq 6 with 25 km bias corrected cci sm and corresponding 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi b bringing regression coefficients at hr into eq 4 to estimate hr sm 1 km with the 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi and aggregating the hr sm to 25 km scale by eq 5 as aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution c aggregating 1 km filtered ati and fitted evi to 25 km resolution to estimate the sm at 25 km resolution by eq 4 with the regression coefficients at hr and defining this 25 km sm as regressed sm at 25 km resolution d comparing all aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and regressed sm at 25 km resolution based on the above evaluation strategy the influence of scale effect on regression coefficients at hr can be directly evaluated and quantitatively analyzed after obtaining the regression coefficients of eq 6 the 3 d fitted surface of the regression relationship between ati evi and sm at hr would be determined based on eq 4 and the reasonability and significance of the proposed empirical function relationship between ati evi and sm could be evaluated by analyzing the 3 d fitted surface for evaluating the accuracy of the regression analysis between lr sm and hr ati and vi in eq 6 we compared the aggregated downscaled sm with the bias corrected cci sm at 25 km resolution 3 5 2 evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture the downscaled sm was evaluated based on three main aspects including spatial pattern temporal profile and the comparison with the in situ sm measurements the spatial pattern of the downscaled sm maps in this study area were evaluated with the corresponding bias corrected cci sm and evi maps on doy 209 220 and 232 in 2013 to evaluate the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm under different vegetation cover conditions during the study period the in situ observation stations are divided into three groups presenting stations with high moderate and low vegetation cover during the study period respectively cd05 ms3518 and ms3488 stations were selected as representative stations with high moderate and low levels of average evi respectively the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm the collocated in situ sm and the bias corrected cci sm together with the daily cumulative cmorph crt precipitation were compared at the selected three sites the downscaled sm data were validated by comparison with the average of all in situ sm measurements in the corresponding 1 km pixel from july 26 to august 24 in 2013 except one downscaled sm pixel with 2 stations c2 and f1 other pixels contain no more than 1 in situ measurement given that the spatial heterogeneity of sm may influence the spatial representativeness of 1 in situ measurement within 1 km resolution the validations of the downscaled sm pixels with at least 1 or 2 in situ measurements were implemented respectively and compared each other moreover we compared the regression relationship between the downscaled sm and the collocated in situ sm without or with evi as an adjustment factor respectively in order to evaluate the influence of the vegetation conditions on the downscaled results significantly the uncertainty of reconstructed lst in ati modeling could impact the accuracy of downscaled sm so the downscaled sm based on the original modis lst or the reconstructed lst were validated respectively and compared each other 3 5 3 evaluation metrics the statistical metrics including correlation coefficient r bias unbiased root mean square error ubrmse entekhabi et al 2010b

original cci sm data and average collocated in situ sm see section 3 1 within the corresponding cci sm pixel which is marked by blue rectangular frame as shown in fig 1 fig 4b shows the temporal evolution of daily cumulative cmorph crt precipitation along with original cci sm and the corresponding average in situ sm in 2013 between approximately october and april of the following years the cci sm data are missing or discarded based on the quality control information since the soil is frozen in these periods the temporal variation of the cci sm data is similar to that of in situ sm measurements in the multi year temporal profile despite the underestimation of cci sm during most available observation periods since the late april both in situ and cci sm rise significantly with the increase of precipitation throughout the study period which is from doy 207 to 236 in 2013 the overall trend of both sm observations is downward but the original cci sm data are more sensitive to precipitation than the corresponding in situ sm against the average collocated in situ sm measurements fig 5 shows the validation results of the original cci sm and the bias corrected cci sm respectively fig 5a shows that the original cci sm have a relatively high correlation coefficient r 0 64 but with large bias 0 071 m3 m3 low slope 0 387 and large mae 0 077 m3 m3 which means that most of original cci sm are underestimated validation to the bias corrected cci sm fig 5b shows similar correlation coefficient r 0 627 but much less bias 0 m3 m3 higher slope 0 627 and less mae 0 062 m3 m3 the distribution of the samples of the bias corrected cci sm appears obviously closer and more symmetric around the 1 1 line than that of original cci sm ee 77 8 versus ee 70 67 in terms of ubrmse the cloud of points from bias corrected cci sm becomes more dispersed than that of original cci sm ubrmse 0 082 m3 m3 versus ubrmse 0 073 m3 m3 as the bias correction method based on cdfs stretches the value range of original data as shown in fig 3 4 2 evaluation of the downscaling algorithm for evaluating and analyzing the impact of scale effect on regression coefficients at hr we compared aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution with regressed sm at 25 km resolution section 3 5 1 as is shown in fig 6 the result shows very low errors bias 0 003 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 003 m3 m3 and mae 0 003 m3 m3 very high correlation coefficient r 0 999 and the slope 1 02 is close to 1 0 this verified our assumption that the regression coefficients of the downscaling algorithm are free of spatial scale effect so the regression coefficients at hr obtained by eq 6 can be brought into eq 4 to estimate sm at 1 km resolution as described in section 3 4 after getting the regression coefficients of eq 6 and applying them to eq 4 the 3 d fitted surface of the regression relationship between ati evi and sm based on eq 4 is shown in fig 7 and the values of ar br cr dr er and fr in eq 4 are 0 092 0 03 0 009 23 806 0 345 and 0 305 respectively it shows a good correlation r 0 726 between the fitting surface and data used for regression fig 7a shows that given evi the regression relationship between sm and ati follows a monotonically increasing natural logarithm function which is consistent with the empirical function mentioned by qin et al 2013 and notarnicola et al 2013 but the coefficients of the natural logarithm functional relationships vary with the evi values we chose sm values in a fixed range from 0 to 0 4 m3 m3 in fig 7 for analyzing the effect of vegetation condition on the relationship between sm and ati as shown in fig 7b the corresponding ati value range is about 0 01 0 15 k 1 referring to the regression curve when evi 0 and the ati value range is about 0 035 0 0625 k 1 referring to the regression curve when evi 0 6 this means that for a fixed range of sm variation with the increase of evi the corresponding ati range become narrower and less sensitive to the sm variation this finding is consistent with those in cai et al 2007 and notarnicola et al 2013 fig 7c shows that when sm 0 m3 m3 the corresponding ati value increases as the evi value increases this should be because in the case that the sm is almost 0 ati is mainly determined by soil composition and vegetation condition and based on eq 2 the denser the vegetation the larger the value of ati due to the smaller surface albedo tian et al 2014 and smaller amplitude of diurnal temperature cycle to further quantitatively evaluate the performance of the downscaling algorithm the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and the bias corrected cci sm as the input data in eq 6 were compared in fig 8 the result presents a low error bias 0 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 06 m3 m3 mae 0 043 m3 m3 a good correlation coefficient r 0 726 and relatively high slope 0 528 most importantly the ee of all aggregated downscaled sm values is 88 44 when compared with the bias corrected cci sm values which means the sm downscaling algorithm is almost unbiased with very low uncertainties there is a small fraction of aggregated downscaled sm samples which underestimate the corresponding bias corrected cci sm values in fig 8 the causes leading to these underestimations will be further analyzed and discussed in section 4 5 4 3 spatial pattern and temporal profile of the downscaled soil moisture fig 9 shows the spatial distributions of the bias corrected cci sm fig 9a the downscaled 1 km sm fig 9b and the corresponding evi fig 9c on doy 209 220 and 232 respectively in general the downscaled sm shows good consistency with corresponding bias corrected cci sm in spatial pattern but the downscaled ones show fine spatial variations of sm the downscaled sm shows good consistency with lr cci sm under various evi values indicating that the proposed sm downscaling method effectively mitigates the influence of vegetation condition on the relationship between sm and ati because hr ati and evi pixels are available in most regions the downscaled hr sm data are almost complete where lr sm data are originally missing however the downscaled results with high average sm underestimate bias corrected cci sm in the eastern and southern regions at doy 209 by visual interpretation the reason of this underestimation will be discussed in detail in section 4 5 as is shown in fig 10 at all three stations cd05 ms3518 and ms3488 the temporal profiles of the downscaled sm and the collocated in situ sm are consistent at all three evi levels although the downscaled sm is a little smaller than the in situ sm in certain time periods i e doy from 223 to 233 in fig 10a under condition with very densely vegetated surface the downscaled sm values are closer to the in situ sm observations than the bias corrected cci sm values are the temporal variations of the downscaled sm the collocated in situ measurements and the bias corrected cci sm show similar responses to the precipitation among three sm data with different spatial scales cci sm is most sensitive to precipitation it increases most at the same or next day with the precipitation events i e doy 207 219 228 and 234 in fig 10a and decreases most during the period of little or no precipitation events i e doy from 208 to 215 and from 219 to 222 in fig 10a c meanwhile the response of the downscaled sm to precipitation is more similar to that of the in situ sm and its fluctuation range is smaller than that of cci sm which indicates that the downscaled sm improves spatial representativeness of cci sm however when the stations with high sm value have little or no precipitation in the following days i e doy from 208 to 215 in fig 10a c the downscaled sm values will decrease more and faster than the in situ sm measurements the main reason of above phenomenon is discrepancy of sm loss due to different depth of sm observations jackson 1973 the downscaled sm values and the in situ sm measurements are few millimeters van doninck et al 2011 and 5 cm under the soil surface respectively 4 4 validation of the downscaled sm using the in situ sm measurements fig 11 compares the downscaled sm and the collocated average in situ sm measurements see section 3 1 at the 53 sm observation stations in the study period as shown in fig 11a the data are distributed near the 1 1 line with a relatively good correlation coefficient r 0 552 and low bias 0 014 m3 m3 compared to the in situ sm values the ee of all downscaled sm values is 61 71 however in most cases only 1 in situ measurement within a 1 km resolution pixel the in situ sm measurement at only one station may not well represent the corresponding 1 km downscaled sm due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of sm in the study area leading to some validation samples in fig 11a deviating from the 1 1 line with ubrmse 0 097 m3 m3 mae 0 076 m3 m3 and slope 0 404 when downscaled sm pixels with at least 2 in situ measurements were selected for validation the results fig 11b show much lower errors ubrmse 0 036 m3 m3 and mae 0 032 m3 m3 higher correlation coefficient r 0 893 and higher slope 1 075 than those of fig 11a and the bias 0 018 m3 m3 is very close to that of fig 11a this means that the errors and uncertainties of the downscaled sm shown in fig 11a are mainly due to the low spatial representativeness of in situ sm measurements not due to the downscaling algorithm to further analyze whether the presented sm downscaling algorithm effectively mitigates or even eliminates the effect of vegetation conditions we compared the regression relationship between the downscaled sm and collocated in situ sm without or with evi as an adjustment factor respectively as are shown in fig 12 a and b the difference of the 2 correlation coefficients is merely 0 007 as is shown in fig 12c when evi is 0 6 with the in situ sm ranges from 0 to 0 6 m3 m3 the largest discrepancies of the corresponding downscaled sm values obtained from the 2 fitted surfaces range just from 0 044 to 0 02 m3 m3 these results indicate that the relationship between the downscaled sm and the in situ sm is just very slightly affected by vegetation condition which confirms that the proposed sm downscaling algorithm is robust for regions with different vegetation conditions to evaluate the impacts of the uncertainty of reconstructed lst in ati modeling on the accuracy of downscaled sm the downscaled sm based on the original high quality modis lst and the downscaled sm based on the reconstructed lst were validated respectively and compared each other as are shown in fig 13 when the validation was conducted in cases at least 1 sm observation station is available in a 1 km pixel fig 13a and b the metrics of these two validations have no significant differences r 0 508 bias 0 001 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 093 m3 m3 mae 0 072 m3 m3 slope 0 364 and ee 66 09 versus r 0 579 bias 0 022 m3 m3 ubrmse 0 098 m3 m3 mae 0 079 m3 m3 slope 0 426 and ee 59 07 likewise when the validations were conducted in cased there were at least 2 in situ measurements in one 1 km pixel the validation results as shown in fig 13c and d respectively are also in good consistency the differences of r bias ubrmse mae and slopes are 0 005 0 03 m3 m3 0 001 m3 m3 0 019 m3 m3 and 0 162 respectively these results indicate that the procedure of lst reconstruction using the rsdast model sun et al 2017 has no significant impact on the accuracy of the downscaled sm the evaluation results at pixels with at least 2 in situ measurements fig 13c and d are much better than the corresponding results at pixels with only one in situ measurements fig 13a and b which again confirms that the errors and uncertainties of the validation results are mainly due to the less representativeness of in situ sm data not due to the spatial downscaling algorithm 4 5 analysis of the underestimation in the downscaled soil moisture when the aggregated downscaled sm were compared with the bias corrected cci sm at 25 km resolution to assess the accuracy of the regression analysis in the downscaling algorithm section 4 2 fig 8 presents that there are 150 outliers with negative residuals outside an expected error range of 0 05 15 the distribution of these outliers in the scatterplot is regular and not as random as that of outliers with positive residuals this indicates that these outliers with negative residuals are not random errors and there should be other factors that cause the underestimation of some downscaled sm values to quantitatively analyze the effect of the process of reconstructing clear sky lst we compared the 25 km scale residuals from fig 8 and the ratio of 1 km scale ati pixels from reconstructed lst pixels in all available ati pixels within the corresponding 25 km scale cci pixels which was defined as the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst fig 14 illustrates that the residuals are mainly concentrated between 0 1 m3 m3 in the range of ratio 0 to 100 the error bars in fig 14 show that when the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is greater than 80 the corresponding standard deviations of residuals increase but the mean values of residuals do not change regularly with the increase of ratio the above results show that larger ratio of ati from reconstructed lst may introduce larger uncertainties but the increase of ratio will not cause overall negative deviations to all downscaled sm thus the process of reconstructing clear sky lst is not the direct cause of those outliers with negative residuals in fig 8 in fact the cci sm represents the merged sm of several satellite observations which have different observation times section 2 2 2 we defined these observation times from several satellite sm products as the cci sm observation time in contrast the downscaled sm were mainly estimated by using the daily scale ati and evi so their sm values reflected the overall situation of sm throughout the day in the case of non synchronous observation time between the cci sm and the downscaled sm we discussed the causes of outliers with negative residuals in three cases a the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is very small if some abrupt changes i e irrigation or short term precipitation of surface sm occurred within the observation time of cci sm the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution may not capture these abrupt changes and would underestimate the corresponding cci sm this is because the abrupt surface sm rising caused by short term precipitation will dry out soon within a day deardorff 1977 jackson 1973 roundy et al 1997 especially for the downscaled sm regressed from optical thermal observations which is only sensitive to the sm of the top few millimeters of soil b the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is very large if there was continuous cloud coverage throughout the day this would cause a serious lack of available modis lst pixels the aggregated downscaled sm pixels at 25 km resolution which are mostly regressed from the reconstructed lst pixels could seriously underestimate the cci sm values with precipitation events during the observation time c the ratio of ati from the reconstructed lst is medium the underestimation could be related to precipitation events occurring within the cci observation time which were not well reflected by the downscaled sm from the combination of the original modis lst and the reconstructed lst based on the analyses of above three cases we assumed that the precipitation event within the cci sm observation time was major factor for the underestimation of the downscaled sm we utilized per 3 hour cumulative precipitation data from the cmorph crt product to verify the above hypothesis by statistically analyze the outlier samples in fig 8 among all 150 underestimated samples 85 of them have short term precipitation events during the cci sm observation time and 29 samples have short term precipitation events in their nearest 8 pixels during the cci sm observation time 76 of the underestimated samples in fig 8 have short term precipitation events at the pixels or the nearest pixels during the cci sm observation time specifically we selected two representative outliers with very small or very large ratio of ati from reconstructed ati respectively for checking the effect of the precipitation events within the cci observation time on the underestimation of the downscaled sm as was shown in fig 15 for the low ratio 9 28 of ati from reconstructed lst fig 15a shows that the short term precipitation within the cci sm observation time result in bias corrected cci sm value being underestimated by the aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution residual 0 147 m3 m3 as shown in fig 15b the missing of all modis lst ratio 100 in conjunction with precipitation events within the cci sm observation time leads to larger deviation residual 0 287 m3 m3 between aggregated downscaled sm at 25 km resolution and bias corrected cci sm in summary the underestimations of downscaled sm are mainly caused by the short term precipitation events happening within the cci sm observation time which the downscaled sm based on daily scale ati could hardly capture 5 conclusions this paper presents a new ati based lr satellite sm downscaling method which considers the effect of vegetation condition on the relationship between ati and sm the main difference between the presented sm downscaling method and the previous ti and ati based downscaling methods is that vi indicating vegetation cover condition was introduced to globally quantitatively and accurately modulate the vegetation effects on the relationship between ati and sm so our method is more robust and more accurate for regions with different vegetation conditions than the previous studies and the accuracy of downscaled results is independent of the vegetation cover conditions the main conclusions are as follows 1 cci sm products need to be bias corrected before the spatial downscaling algorithm was applied to the modified q q adjustment method is effective for correcting bias of cci sm products 2 an ati based sm spatial downscaling algorithm was presented to generate spatiotemporally complete consistent and accurate 1 km resolution sm products by introducing evi as a global vegetation cover adjustment factor the presented sm downscaling algorithm based on ati is nearly free of vegetation effect the accuracies of the downscaled 1 km spatial resolution sm are consistent in areas with different evis 3 the aggregated spatially downscaled sm and the bias corrected cci sm show good consistencies in spatial patterns temporal profiles and accuracies which indicates that the proposed sm downscaling algorithm itself is unbiased 4 the process of lst reconstruction does not introduce much uncertainties into the downscaled sm the major errors lie in the downscaled sm are mainly attributed to the inconsistencies between the instantaneous observation of the cci sm and the daily scale sm indicated by ati especially in cases there are short term precipitation and drying out process in a day in summary the sm downscaling algorithm presented in this paper is effective and applicable to generating spatiotemporally complete consistent and accurate higher spatial resolution sm datasets in areas from low to very dense vegetation cover while it is not applicable to areas with extremely dense vegetation cover where the ati no longer indicates the sm djamai et al 2016 molero et al 2016 song et al 2019 the presented sm downscaling algorithm could be applicable in other areas and for downscaling of other lr satellite sm products such as smap sm products and the sm products simulated by land surface models credit
