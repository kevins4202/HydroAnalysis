12545,the polymer inclusion membranes pims are an economical alternative to the several advanced wastewater treatments previously employed for tetracycline tc remediation this study investigates the potential of pim consisting of an anionic charged bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp carrier embedded in polyvinyl chloride pvc for aqueous tc microcontaminant remediation ft ir sem porometry water uptake and contact angle pim s properties were evaluated the optimum hdehp pim proved to be physically and chemically stable after prolonged transportation experiments with a mass loss ranging from 0 46 0 02 to 10 13 0 50 the extraction and transportation efficiency obtained at a low tc concentration of 5 mg l was 79 and 77 using the optimum pim containing 50 hdehp carrier and at optimum conditions the study shows that self plasticised pvc polymer embedded with hdehp carrier satisfactorily transports low residue tc better than the previously reported self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier furthermore the hdehp pim was highly selective and more stable in an acidic than in an alkaline media the study also shows that increasing the stirring speed enhances the transportation efficiency and duration with an accumulation factor of 11 17 1 04 and 7 86 5 61 at 500 and 700 rpm respectively hence significant transportation of low tc concentration using cost effective self plasticised hdehp pim is feasible however further investigation is required for improved performance reduced transportation duration and stability studies based on pim reusability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hdehp self plasticised pim stability carrier data availability this study s raw processed data can only be shared on request as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction tetracycline tc is a frequently used antibiotic drug for human or veterinary therapeutics and an additive in agricultural feeds 1 various pharmaceutical compounds as low as parts per trillion have recently been detected in soil and water due to the improved analytical sensitivity in the last decade 2 3 several articles have reported the presence of new compounds classified as emerging compounds in wastewater and other aquatic environments unfortunately most emerging organic pharmaceutical contaminants remain unregulated and their impact on human health is still poorly understood 3 4 tc residue has been identified as the most common antibiotic residue detected in the form of a parental drug a metabolized product or tc metal complex in the aquatic environment probably due to its high quality broad spectrum affordability and extensive therapeutic application 1 5 hence it is frequently detected in accumulation from domestic and hospital wastewater reservoirs or as a circulated pollutant in surface and groundwater constituting potential hazards to human health and ecosystems 1 3 tc residue is capable of causing severe environmental threats to humans and animals in the form of antibiotic resistance leading to the development of a new kind of disease 1 6 the antibiotic resistance of tc to microorganisms was revealed from a recent surveillance study in some parts of european indicating that 66 9 of e coli and 44 9 of klebsiella species were resistant to tc while on a global scale 8 7 and 24 3 resistance for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and streptococcus pneumonia respectively were identified 1 7 the finding of low concentrations of hormones and antibiotics ng l in drinking water and wastewaters and their subsequent accumulation in animals as revealed by several studies suggest a link between environmental exposures to hormones and deteriorating trends in human health including decreases in male sperm count an increase in testicular prostate ovarian and breast cancer and reproductive malfunctions 8 9 as reported by koyuncu et al 10 similarly kraemer et al 11 reported that as low as 1 μg ml of tc could cause dysbiosis and increase mortality in susceptible aquatic animals zebrafish embryos the several documented scientific reports on the severe environmental risk of residual organic emerging contaminants such as tc make it imperative to adequately remove them from drinking water unfortunately the remediation capacity of primary treatment techniques is ineffective for the satisfactory removal of residual antibiotics from wastewater in wwtp 12 there is therefore an ongoing effort to design efficient affordable and environmentally friendly advanced treatment techniques to remediate organic effluent 13 such advanced treatment technologies include adsorption membrane filtration advanced oxidation process reverse osmosis flocculation and coagulation 1 4 14 however most advanced treatment techniques are limited by technical and economic factors such as high energy high operational cost and an expensive large quantity of hazardous chemicals worst still some of the techniques have insufficient selectivity for practical commercial applications 15 16 hence a polymer material with excellent selectivity to contaminants of interest and high elution and reusability functions is being sought 12 recently polymer inclusion membranes pims a relatively emerging innovative liquid membrane have been identified as a highly efficient selective and attractive alternative to remediate industrial metals and pharmaceutical residues from water 16 18 39 however while the pim techniques have been applied to remediate several metallic contaminants until recently only a handful of researchers have explored the use of pim to remove pharmaceutical organic contaminants among these few are the removal of ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole antibiotics 19 20 ibuprofen 21 23 progesterone 22 tetracyclines tcs and sulfonamides sas 24 25 transportation of a 5 mg l mix feed solution of six frequently used antibiotics four sulfonamides sas and two tetracyclines tcs using pim was investigated by aida garcia rodríguez et al 24 25 in their work they reported that the cta based plasticised pim containing 26 aliquat 336 and 44 2 nitrophenyloctyl ether npoe as plasticisers had a 100 tc transportation efficiency compared to the 0 and 50 obtained for the self plasticised pvc pim containing 31 aliquat 336 and plasticised pvc pim containing 26 aliquat 336 44 npoe respectively furthermore they concluded that the cta aliquat 336 2 nitrophenyloctyl ether composite pim transported tc better than the additively plasticised and self plasticised pvc based pims several studies have shown that the physiochemical property and transport mechanisms of pim are influenced by the components used in its fabrication particularly the type of carrier embedded during its fabrication 26 55 hence the choice of appropriate carrier type plays a fundamental role in the selective separation of a particular analyte and the stability of the resulting membrane 27 28 although anionic cationic and neutral or solvating carriers have been extensively investigated as extracting media for different applications and on an industrial scale 27 the compatibility of pvc based pim embedded with different carriers has motivated growing interest in applying pims for the separation recovery of several organic and metallic chemical species 29 however the use of the pvc cationic aliqaut 336 carrier pim in an alkaline medium is prone to instability due to a dehalogenation reaction occurring within the polymer matrix and possible dehydrochlorination reactions between the poly chloroethene from pvc with a base in the presence of quaternary ammonium aliquat 336 carrier resulting in a non transparent darkened pim 30 this problem likely accounts for the reported nil tc transportation using the self plasticised pvc cationic aliquat 336 carrier pim 24 the challenges of low extraction efficiency and stability of pim are among the major challenges limiting its industrial application therefore the present study evaluates the efficiency and potential of using economically self plasticised pvc pim embedded with a varied amount of bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp as an anionic carrier hdehp pim to extract and transport low concentration of tc microcontaminant residue from imitated laboratory wastewater the use of hdehp pim for transporting aqueous tc to the best of our knowledge has not been reported furthermore the effect of carrier and receiving phase concentration stirring speed initial feed concentration and initial feed ph on the performance efficiency of the optimum pim was investigated in addition preliminary chemical stability of the fabricated pims in alkaline and acidic media and after prolonged transportation duration was also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate 97 hdehp sigma aldrich germany as a carrier polyvinylchloride pvc mw 43 000 as polymer tetrahydrofuran thf 99 9 sigma aldrich darmstadt germany as the solvent ultrapure tetracycline hydrochloride c22h24n2o8 hcl mw 480 90 g mol to prepare wastewater imitate 2 2 membrane preparation to prepare the dope solution a base polymer pvc and a varied amount of hdehp carrier were dissolved in thf table 2 under continuous magnetic stirring until a homogeneous solution was obtained the solution was then sonicated in an elmasonic s30h sonicator germany and poured on a cleaned smooth flat glass plate pre set at 30 μm thickness on elcometer 4340 united kingdom automatic film applicator knife the formed membrane was left on the glass plate at room temperature to allow the organic solvent to evaporate for 24 h finally the resulting partly dried membranes were peeled carefully from the glass plate and allowed further drying beyond 24 h before characterization and performance evaluation 2 3 membrane characterization in a preliminary investigation all the fabricated pvc hedpa embedded pim except pim f which is not only physically unstable but also appeared flaccid and cloudy were examined by fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy ftir sem surface morphology water uptake contact angle ca and chemical and physical stabilities the membrane thickness variation was measured using a digital screw micrometer further investigation using the porometry was employed to elucidate the changes in the morphological properties of the optimum pim 2 4 membrane surface morphology scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3000 tokyo japan was employed to obtain information about the membrane surface and cross section morphology the microstructure of the membrane initially gold plated using quorum sc7620 laughton east sussex usa was examined at 100 and 1500 magnification respectively 2 5 membrane s pore characteristics and thickness the membrane thickness micron was measured in triplicates with a screw micrometer with an accuracy of 0 01 mm 31 gas porometry gas absorption was employed to evaluate the average pore size and their distribution porosity of the pristine pims a and optimum c using the capillary flow porometer previously immersed in a porefil 16 dyne cm for 24 h the membranes were then subsequently placed in the membrane cell of the porometer and the wet up dry up mode of the membrane was determined 33 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ir spectra were recorded with the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet 10 waltham ma usa to identify the interrelations among the pims composite components 32 scans were collected for each pim measurement over the 4000 500 cm 1 spectral range and the resulting spectra were analyzed using omnic software version 5 2a 2 7 membrane physical stability the physical stability of polymer inclusion membrane is a significant parameter in membrane characterization for any practical application ideally a good pim should be transparent and flexible such that there is no tearing or visually deformed when bent 34 hence most pim fabricators usually add a plasticising agent to support its physical structure 36 therefore the fabricated pims flexibility was assessed by carefully twisting a 4 4 size of each membrane and any tearing or visible distortion was observed 30 2 8 chemical stability the classical superiority and higher commerciality potentials of a polymer inclusion membrane over all the other liquid membranes in terms of its performance and chemical stability have been established 37 38 however the relative instability of pim during the long term separation process and certain strong aqueous media remained a drawback to its robust industrial application 19 therefore it is crucial to evaluate the chemical stability of fabricated pim in specific aquatic environments and during prolonged separation applications the chemical stability of fabricated pim in selected solutions of interest can be determined indirectly by weight loss which has been experimentally well correlated quantitatively to the leaching of the embedded carrier from the membrane microstructure 37 40 each 3 2 cm of the hdehp embedded pim was immersed in 50 ml of appropriate medium 1 m hno3 ph 1 and 0 05 m naoh ph 12 in a 100 ml vial tightly capped and shaken at 400 rpm in an orbital mixer protech model si 1000 at 28 0 1 c for 24 h the pims were later placed on a dry filter paper in a petri dish and allowed to dry in an oven at 40 c until a constant dry weight was obtained the percentage weight loss due to carrier loss in the membrane was calculated using eq 1 duplicate measurements were conducted for each membrane 1 mass loss wi wf wo 100 where wi is the initial weight of the pim and wf is the final pim s constant weight after drying 2 9 contact angle and water uptake the contact angle θ of the pims was determined to access their hydrophilicity the angle was measured using an image processing software equipped with a goniometer rame hart 250 fi usa and a sessile droplet of 4 5 ml deionized water at ambient temperature 25 1 c then a random average analyzed replicates values from 5 spots were taken as the pim s contact angle to minimize experimental errors water uptake was also conducted to assess the hydrophilicity of the fabricated pims a circular piece of each pre weight fabricated pims a e 30 mm was immersed in water and allowed to stand at room temperature 25 9 1 c for 24 h the soaked pims were removed using forceps and adhering surficial water was mopped up carefully the wet membrane was weighed and placed in a vacuum oven at 60 c until a constant dry weight was obtained 41 42 the percentage of water uptake was calculated using eq 11 the analysis was done in duplicates to minimize experimental errors the average values were reported as the percentage water uptake u 11 water

varied hno3 concentrations in the receiving phase solution was investigated by evaluating the rate of tc removal and transportation using a varied concentration of hno3 0 1 0 2 1 and 2 m 43 44 2 11 tetracycline transportation pim with a diffusing area of 2 5 cm diameter clamped between 250 ml capacity diffusion cell ml on teflon support was under study the receiving compartment was filled with hno3 44 45 the feed compartment was filled with a varied aqueous tc concentration 5 10 and 15 mg l each working solution was prepared daily by appropriately diluting previously refrigerated stock solutions with deionized water milli q plus system millipore 18 2 mω cm at 25 c each diffusion cell and phase was homogenized simultaneously on an identical magnetic stirrer at uniform stirring speeds the concentration of tc in both phases was determined by u vis spectrometry at 276 nm optimum absorbance wavelength after 24 h intervals 46 47 2 12 pim performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the understudy pims the tetracycline separability was determined by calculating its removal efficiency r transportation efficiency t initial flux j and accumulation factor calculated by

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir analysis was employed to identify the interactions among the components used in fabricating the pristine fig 1 a and hdehp embedded pims fig 1 b 49 50 the identified spectra of the pims and their corresponding assignments as presented in table 1 shows the absorbance peaks corresponding functional group and assignments of the pvc and hdehp carrier the saturated ch aliphatic bending ch peaks were identified at 1430 cm 1 scissors and 1330 cm 1 twisting while the peaks at 2970 2910 and 2850 cm 1 represented the ch stretching functional group 51 the modes at 1250 and 684 cm 1 represent the numerous ch modes near cl and the c cl gauche bond 52 the broad peak at 1600 cm 1 corresponds to the oh stretching of water 53 while the peak at 1060 cm 1 indicates the co stretching of primary alcohol finally the peak at 956 cm 1 represents ch2 rocking peaks and the 832 600 cm 1 depicts the cc stretching 49 the distinct peaks of the embedded bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp carrier in pim c as indicated in blue colour in fig 1 b were identified at the weak peak of 2860 cm 1 indicating the csp2 h and the group csp3 h at 2930 cm 1 stretching while the phosphates functional group occurred at 1020 and 1230 cm 1 assigned to the po stretching and po respectively 19 49 3 1 1 sem morphologies the sem surface morphology of fabricated pims as presented in fig 2 a shows that pims a d has an apparent homogeneous symmetric dense microstructure indicating a uniform distribution and interfacial interaction of the hdehp embedded carrier in the pvc polymer matrix 56 however for pim e with increased hdehp carrier concentration 66 7 agglomerate particles were observed on the surface of the membrane the comparative cross section morphology of the optimum pim c and the pristine pim a are presented in fig 2 c with a distinct internal morphology the image shows that the pristine pim a is microscopically homogenous and dense while pim c also appeared microscopically dense but with heterogeneous micro channeling pores according to xu et al 57 at higher carrier concentrations above 40 the carrier is partially entangled within the polymer matrix while some of the carriers form a evidently porous microchannels structure that serves as an enhancement pathway through which the extracted hdehp tc complex could diffuse 57 59 3 1 2 contact angle and water uptake of hdehp pim the effect of the hdehp carrier concentration in the fabricated pim on its hydrophilicity property was investigated by assessing its contact angle and water uptake the results show that the contact angle fig 2 b decreased while the water uptake table 2 increased correspondingly as the amount of carrier increased this pattern indicates a progressive increase in hydrophilicity of the pims from its initial highly hydrophobic nature as indicated in the pristine pim a with the contact angle value of 84 14 0 06 θ and water uptake value of 5 39 0 41 to a more hydrophilic pim d with 70 42 0 05 θ and 37 92 1 02 for the contact angle and water uptake respectively therefore the lipophilic hdehp carrier successfully modified the pvc polymer to a relatively more hydrophilic pim however a slight increase in the contact angle for pim e was observed which is attributable to the slight surface roughness of the pim and apparent swelling of the polymer matrix at a high hdehp carrier in addition it has been reported that a small regular array of roughness on the membrane efficiently trapped air limiting the available space contact area between dropped water and the rough membrane surface 60 62 3 1 3 physical stability a good and acceptable polymer inclusion membrane should be visually homogeneous transparent flexible and free of droplets of extractant droplets on its surface 63 the physical assessment results as presented in table 2 show that the embedded hdehp carrier significantly plasticised the membranes and enhanced their physical stability compared to pure pvc pim the brittleness of the pure pvc membrane can be traced to the rigid three dimensional structure of the pvc base polymer 64 ionic quaternary ammonium carriers such as the bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid hdehp and aliquat 336 carriers can plasticise pims without an additional plasticiser the self plasticising carrier s ability has been related to physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity hydrogen bonding capacity and ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions in its liquid state at room temperature 63 65 66 maiphetlho et al 41 reported high flexibility of self plasticised pim containing 60 40 w t pvc hdehp carrier pims b e are physically stable but pim a is brittle to manual deformation while pim f appears cloudy flaccid and mechanically unstable table 2 hence pim f was discarded as unsuitable for further investigation while pim a compared with the physical stability improved pims b e with increased polymer chain mobility indicated by their flexibility and transparency was investigated for its potential for remediating aquatic tc 67 furthermore contrary to kazemi et al 68 we successfully fabricated physically stable pims embedded with 60 and 67 hdehp carriers which is higher than the 55 limit stated in their work this is made possible partly due to our study s non additional external plasticiser and membrane fabrication method our team is investigating the latter factor 3 1 4 membranes pim thickness and pore characteristics the results of the measured membrane thickness of pims a e as presented in table 3 indicate that the membrane thickness increases as the carrier concentration increases the increment varied from the original pre set thickness of 30 μm with the aid of casting knife film applicators by 16 7 for the pristine pim a without embedded carrier and as much as 293 3 to the pim e embedded with the highest hdehp carriers 66 7 it is well known that membrane thickness is inversely proportional to the membrane permeation rate and its flux across the membrane hence the slight reduction in tc transportation efficiency observed for pims d and e fig 4 even though both are embedded with higher carrier concentration 69 pim fabrication using the automatic casting thin film applicator has the advantage of pre setting the desired pim thickness however it has been reported that due to volatility of carrier during the evaporation of the thf solvent used in pim fabrication which results in bulked membranes believed to house a viscous liquid formed underneath when the thf solvent evaporates within the pim s polymer matrix it is opined that the expansion of the membrane structure bulking creates the liquid pathways within the membrane needed for the transportation of the anionic hdehp tc complex this phenomenon has been described as the formation of two separate domains in its microstructures 26 70 71 the seeming inhomogeneity of the pim c s cross section image and irregular micropores distribution porous structure is likely due to the added hdehp carrier 73 unarguably the limitation of the sem acquisitions may not confirm these possibilities sufficiently however this speculative structure termed liquid pores was also reported by gherasim et al 52 for a pvc pim embedded with 50 d2ehpa which the authors believed enhanced its sorption capacity and transport properties hence to further examine the morphological details of the optimum pim c in comparison to the pristine pim a the result of the porometry analysis as presented in table 3 show that the pore size and pim s porosity decreased significantly when the hdepa carrier is 50 from the initial 0 22 0 04 and 10 4 3 1 pristine pim a to 0 15 0 06 and 0 2 0 1 respectively the reduction in both the pores size and porosity of the optimum pim c due to the penetration of the hdehp carrier inside the support pores rather than being anchored on its surface can be related to the high selectivity and flexibility mechanical stability of the pim it has been reported that the selectivity of liquid membranes depends highly on both the pore size and its fixed charge density and hence the carrier facilitated transportation efficiency which is directly related to the selectivity of the membrane also increased with reduced pore size and porosity due to the donnan exclusion principle 74 76 alnajrani alsager 72 and sarkar et al 73 have equally described the possibility of this phenomenon 3 1 5 chemical stability studies based on the effect of hdehp concentration stirring speeds and acidic alkaline media ph the chemical stability of the hdehp pims at different carrier concentrations was investigated by measuring the mass loss of the pim after a prolonged period 216 h and the result obtained is presented in fig 3 a similarly the results of the investigation of the effect of stirring speed and media ph acidic and alkaline media on membrane stability are equally shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the prolonged transportation stability of the pims generally decreases with an increase in the amount of incorporated hdehp carrier as indicated by the increasing mass loss of the pims from 0 46 0 02 for the pim a with nil carrier content to 10 13 0 50 for pim e containing the 66 7 hdehp carrier as shown in fig 3 a the mass loss of pim has been attributed to the leaching of the carrier into the solution due to either formation of emulsion droplets or pressure differences within the membrane 74 75 the effect of stirring speed on the stability of the optimum pim c showed that there was a significant difference in the mass loss when the transportation was conducted at 500 rpm 3 70 0 4 compared to when the stirring speed was 700 rpm 7 60 0 5 as indicated in fig 3 b the lower stability of the pim at a higher stirring speed may be attributed to turbulence induced carrier leakage at the stirring speed of 700 rpm 38 76 the result of the chemical stability of the hdehp pims in a highly alkaline and acidic medium is presented in fig 3 c the result revealed that hdehp pim is more stable in the acidic medium with minimum mass loss 0 846 0 111 6 90 0 60 compared to the higher mass loss 11 01 1 30 40 42 0 89 in the alkaline medium the lower resistance of pvc polymer in an alkaline medium is due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting in the darkening of pims 77 78 3 1 6 hdehp pim s tetracycline extraction and transportation performance evaluation pim s productive and selectivity performance can be evaluated in terms of its molecule throughput in terms of flux and separation efficiency measured in terms of its analyte extraction and transportation at specified conditions 25 79 therefore to determine the optimal membrane carrier composition in the fabricated pims the effect of carrier concentration on the extraction and transportation of tc in an acidic receiving phase of the hdehp pims was assessed on their removal and transportation efficiency under varied process conditions the investigation was first preliminarily conducted with 10 mg l tc wastewater at initial feed ph 3 with 0 2 m hno3 as the receiving phase solution and at 500 rpm stirring speed to select the optimum pim based on hdehp carrier concentration 3 1 7 effect of carrier concentration and duration on transportation of tetracycline the transportation efficiency of pim is a critical determinative factor in assessing its performance because a suitable pim should not only extract a target solute but should effectively transport the same to the receiving phase with little or no accumulation 72 therefore the preliminary investigation used a prolonged experimental duration of 216 h to select the optimum pim carrier concentration and evaluate membrane stability for prolonged usage the effect of carrier concentration on the extraction and transportation of tc using the hdehp pim is presented in fig 4 similar to what is reported in the literature a higher experimental time and hdehp carrier concentration resulted in increased removal r and transportation t efficiencies due to the formation of more tc solute carrier complexes and increased diffusion coefficient of the tc carrier molecule s complex 25 57 69 however there was a slight decrease in the removal efficiency for pim e containing 66 7 hdehp carrier concentration probably due to the coalescence of the liquid micro domains formed at increased carrier concentration as indicated by a similar oddly slight decrease in the hydrophilicity of the pim e fig 2 b the pim containing 60 hdehp carrier pim d has the highest extraction efficiency 68 03 3 86 which is marginally higher than pim c 67 54 1 39 but the latter pim with 66 30 0 94 transported tc is significantly better than the 63 12 2 74 efficiency of the former on the other hand the relatively high amount of carrier in the embedded pim c 50 resulted in high transportation efficiencies and low accumulation factor probably due to its lower thickness 56 0 1 00 μm and sufficiently high carrier concentration because according to sellami et al 81 and nghiem et al 82 to ensure satisfactory transportation properties of pims it is necessary to use a high quantity of carrier 40 therefore the ability of self plasticised hdehp pim containing 50 hdehp in the present study to enhance the tc solute s transportation effectively justifies the position of kazemi et al 80 on the insignificant contributory role of commonly added plasticisers tbp npoe dbp and tehp in improving the performance flux of a pvc based pim containing 50 wt hdehp carrier furthermore a recent study by kazemi et al reported a high bi iii extraction efficiency using a 50 pvc 50 hdehp carrier pim 68 80 according to the authors the higher efficiency at 50 concentration is due to the extractant s increased plasticising effect resulting in decreased resistance to solute diffusion traditional pim passive facilitated transportation has been conducted beyond 40 h for metals 41 83 and more particularly for organic antibiotics pharmaceutical compounds for which it has been demonstrated that equilibrium is achieved beyond 24 h extraction and transportation using pim 19 20 25 to this end several solutions have been proffered to reduce the transportation duration including increasing the agitation speed temperature pim s surface area receiver solution ionic strength and application of electro membrane among others to enhance the efficiency and the rate of solute transportation 25 81 hence the effect of the concentration of the hno3 receiving phase and stirring speeds on the efficiency of tc transportation was investigated 3 1 8 effect of receiving phase solutions concentration on tetracycline transportation efficiency the ph and the ionic strength of the feed and receiving solutions are critical factors affecting the efficiency of carrier mediated absorption and transportation processes it is also useful in elucidating the type of interaction governing the sorption process of the analyte 25 27 86 87 98 the results of the effect of the varied hno3 receiving solutions 0 1 2 m for tc transportation is as presented in fig 5 similar to what was observed by parolo et al 84 and lu et al 87 transportation efficiency increased as the stripping solution s ionic strength increased it was observed that after 48 h transportation duration and when the ionic strength was 2 m 70 of tc was transported while only 44 was transported when the ionic strength was 0 1 m this observed trend indicates a higher tc removal and transportation capacity when the ionic strength of the hno3 receiving phase was increased to 2 m at low feed ph of 3 44 45 hence judging from this trend it can be inferred that the electrostatic interaction is the main driving force for the sorption of positively charged tc species acidic solute solution on the anionic carrier hdehp because according to lu et al 87 the high sorption affinity of the tc at low ph but higher ionic strength for the receiver solution could be due to the occurrence of electrostatic attraction which is ph dependent at different ionic strengths further investigations were conducted using 2 m hno3 as the optimum receiving solution phase 66 3 1 9 effect of stirring speeds on tetracycline transportation efficiency it has been previously reported that the extraction efficiency of pim generally increases with increasing stirring speed due to a substantial decrease in the thickness of the diffusion layer hence to explore the possibility of enhancing extraction and transportation the effect of stirring speeds from 500 to 800 rpm was investigated 80 the result showed an increased tc transportation performance efficiency as the stirring speed increased similarly a significant reduction in the transportation duration from 216 h was utilized at the preliminary stage to 45 h while its transportation efficiency increased from 70 at 500 rpm to 75 at the optimum speed of 700 rpm as presented in fig 6 this observation indicates that an increased stirring speed significantly enhanced the rate and efficiency of tc transportation due to mechanically facilitated mass transfer of the analyte and the active carrier complex 88 however a slight decrease 73 was observed when the stirring speed was increased to 800 rpm due perhaps due to the reduction in boundary layer thickness leading to possible turbulence induced carrier leakage as the stirring speed increases and a subsequent decrease in performance 38 76 80 indeed the appropriate stirring speed is a careful synergistic compromise that depends on the target solute membrane composition and several other critical factors governing facilitated transportation using pim 29 hence different studied stirring speeds have been employed from previous works of literature for example sellami et al 72 reported using 1000 rpm kazemi yaftian 75 and olasupo et al 20 reportedly studied at 200 650 rpm and 650 rpm respectively furthermore darvishi et al 81 applied 450 600 rpm cai et al 82 and benosmane et al 38 utilized 600 rpm ling mohd suah 83 and sellami et al 84 reported 500 rpm while aranda merino et al 85 and abdul halim et al 89 worked with a relatively lower stirring speed of 400 rpm and 150 350 rpm respectively hence subsequent investigations were carried out at the optimum stirring speed of 700 rpm using the optimum pim c 3 1 10 effect of initial tetracycline feed concentration the result for the transportation efficiency of the optimum pim c for tc is presented in fig 7 it is observed that an increase in the initial tc feed concentration leads to an increase in the removal efficiency from 79 at 5 mg l to 83 at 15 mg l however as the initial feed concentration increased its transportation efficiency decreased from 77 at 5 mg l to 75 at 10 and 74 at 15 mg l this observation shows that the slight decrease in transportation at higher concentrations 10 and 15 mg l could be due to the partial blockage of the membrane active sites by the tc solutes removed from the feed 83 19 20 the possibility of blockage of active sites can be substantiated by the 9 accumulation factor 1 35 mg tc as against the 10 accumulation factor 0 5 mg tc at a lower concentration of 5 mg l the result of the initial flux table 3 shows that electromigration and mass transfer of tc across the membrane was higher at 15 mg l 5 53 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 than at a lower concentration of 5 mg l 0 69 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 the electrostatic interaction between the cationic tc analyte and the anionic active hdehp carrier site seems to govern its transportation mechanism which enables faster transportation at a lower concentration olasupo et al 20 and gherasim et al 66 reported similar observations however aqueous tc is generally present at a very low concentration therefore just like other emerging pharmaceutical contaminants it had to await improvement in analytical instruments that could detect it at a micron level before its discovery as a pollutant in water 91 therefore the effect of initial feed ph was further investigated at an initial feed concentration of 5 mg l 3 1 11 effect of initial feed ph adjustment on tetracycline transportation efficiency the efficiency of antibiotic transportation using pim is feed ph dependent which is reportedly optimum at the alkaline solute solution for the cationic carrier aliquat 336 and acidic solute solution for the anionic carrier hdehp when these compounds exist in their anionic and cationic forms respectively 25 27 however tc is an amphiphilic molecule with multiple ionizable functional groups that can exist in solution as cations ph 3 32 anions ph 7 78 and or amphoteric ions 3 32 ph 7 78 otherwise known as zwitterionic forms furthermore the result of the chemical stability of the hdehp pims revealed that hdehp pim is more stable in the acidic medium with minimum mass loss 0 846 0 111 6 90 0 60 compared to the higher mass loss 11 01 1 30 40 42 0 89 in the alkaline medium fig 3 c the lower resistance of pvc polymer in an alkaline medium is due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting in the darkening of pims 77 78 advantageously since the extraction transportation of tc and pim stability using the cationic hdehp carrier exchanger is favored at an acidic ph all the experiments were conducted at low ph initial feed 3 3 by adjusting the ph of 5 mg l tc feed solutions using 0 1 m hcl as a buffer solution to 3 ph 1 5 the effect of the initial feed ph at 3 2 5 and 1 5 potentiometrically monitored on the efficiency of tc transportation is presented in fig 8 the result shows that there was only a marginal difference in the extraction transportation efficiency at ph 1 5 70 67 and 2 5 71 68 in contrast tc tetracycline extraction and transportation significantly increased to 79 77 at initial feed ph 3 in a similar study conducted by kolev et al 92 using a similar acidic carrier di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid an optimum ph 3 was also reported for the selective extraction and transportation of zn ii into an acidic hcl receiving phase however as according to the authors an hdehp carrier is a phosphoric acid extractant that releases h into the solution through cation exchange during the extraction process the evidence of the release of h into the solution was also observed at the end of the extraction in the current study which resulted in a drastic drop in the medium s acidity 3 1 12 effect of initial feed concentration and stirring speed on pim s initial flux and accumulation factor to study the influence of the feed concentration and stirring speed on the accumulation factor and initial tc flux performance of the optimum hdehp pim c the solute accumulated within the membrane and the initial flux after 45 and 5 h transportation durations respectively were investigated for comparison 75 the principle of membrane flux is hinged on the diffusion of a highly concentrated analyte in the feed phase to a lower concentration in the receiving phase as described by fick s first law of diffusion 93 the result as presented in table 4 indicate a significant difference in pim performance at varied initial feed concentration and stirring speeds the tc accumulation factor reduced from 10 43 6 25 at the initial feed concentration of 5 mg l to 7 86 5 61 and 8 63 3 78 when the feed concentration was 10 and 15 mg l and its flux also correspondingly increased as the initial feed concentration increased from 0 69 to 2 08 and 5 53 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 respectively similarly there was a significant increase in the initial flux when the stirring speeds were increased from 500 rpm with a flux of 0 58 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 to 2 08 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 at the optimum speed of 700 rpm while the accumulation factor also decreased significantly from 11 17 1 04 to 7 86 5 61 respectively these results show that at a higher rate of stirring speeds and initial feed concentration the initial flux increases and the duration required to achieve an effective diffusion driven extraction process is reduced 94 95 according to tarhouchi et al 96 organic solute s carrier facilitated association dissociation mechanism increases with increased feed concentration due to the concentration gradient between the feed and receiving phases similarly the decrease in the accumulation factor and a corresponding increase in the initial flux at higher stirring speeds when the stirring speed was increased from 500 to 700 rpm agrees with the findings of kazemi et al 80 a decrease in the accumulation factor indicates a reduction in tc solute accumulation at increased stirring speed because solute accumulation in the membrane implies low transportability due to incomplete analyte transportation which can negatively affect the efficient reusability of pim due to membrane fouling 20 95 the current study shows a higher performance of the pvc based hdehp pim compared to the optimum 50 using npoe plasticised pvc aliquat 336 pim reported by garcia rodríguez et al 25 at initial tc feed concentration of 5 mg l although the optimum 77 transportation efficiency obtained in the current study is lower than the 100 obtained using npoe plasticised cta aliquat 336 pim nonetheless the significantly higher performance of the self plasticised pvc hdehp carrier 77 compared to the self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier nil used in their work indicates the need to select a compatible carrier type and concentration for a specific target solute for an efficient extraction process 27 40 furthermore the optimum initial flux of 0 69 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 obtained in the present study is significantly lower than the optimum 4 54 10 7 mol m 2 s 1 obtained in their study the lower value obtained in the current study is probably due to the higher stirring speed of 800 rpm and membrane surface area of 11 5 cm2 employed in their work compared to the 700 rpm and effective membrane area of 4 91 cm2 employed in the current study in addition the authors used lower feed and stripping solutions volumes 150 ml while 250 ml was used in the present study 25 according to alexander et al 97 calculating the initial flux of a pim using dimensionally dependent parameters limits meaningful comparison of pim s transport data due to different experimental conditions nonetheless this study has demonstrated significant differences in the analyte selection interaction mechanisms and transportation efficiency of the investigated self plasticised hdehp pim compared to the previously studied pvc aliquat 336 carrier pim 27 firstly the use of the cationic carrier aliquat 33 carrier by the previous researcher implied that the experiment was performed at higher ph 9 alkaline which is well known to be unsuitable for the stability of pvc a chloroethene organochloride due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting to a significant loss in its carrier and hence lower transportation efficiency 77 secondly the relatively lower amount of the aliquat 336 carrier used 31 in their investigation is insufficient to satisfactorily plasticised the resulting pim and to enhance its morphological structure for better transportation of low concentration of the tc 57 59 3 2 postulated transportation mechanism of tetracycline using hdehp pim the possible mechanism of organic compound transportation using polymer inclusion membranes depends on the prevailing conditions such as the carrier types and feed ph for example in a situation where the membrane active site function as a pseudo fixed charged site positive or negative and the organic solute are ionized there will be an ion exchange interaction between the organic solute and the carrier forming the carrier extracted species complex or ion pair at the feed solution pim interface and subsequently diffused across the membrane to be stripped at the receiving solution pim interface and the carrier 38 65 99 judging from the results obtained for the transportation of tc in the present study at various hdehp carrier concentrations using an acidic receiving phase with varied ionic strength varied initial feed concentration and stirring speeds phase suggests that interfacial electrostatic transportation mechanisms also occur in the transportation of ionized tc with hedehp alkyl phosphonic acids carrier the anionic or acidic carriers hdehp carrier formed an active pseudo fixed anionic charged site the occurrence increases with increasing carrier concentration in the membrane resulting in an increased transportation efficiency rate a phenomenon known as the percolation theory in another instance when the organic tc compounds are ionized it forms hydrogen bonds with the hdehp carrier leading to the formation of hydrogen bonded heteroconjugate ion with extracted species 66 95 hence tc was transported through the hdehp pim by hopping between the fixed molecules of the carrier fixed site jumping 52 58 in agreement with the latter postulation eiroa lledo et al 100 have also recently demonstrated that tc extraction using di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid carrier hdehp from a 3 m naclo4 ph 2 into a dodecane receiver involves one hdehp dimer participating in the extraction and transfer of one proton from the hdehp into the aqueous receiving phase which is similar to what is obtained for tetravalent metals extraction mechanism using hdehp carrier 100 therefore it can be inferred that the use of an acidic receiving phase hno3 and low feed solution ph 3 for the transportation of ionizable organic compounds such as tc depends on the ph driving force by the hdehp carrier mediated diffusion mechanism 101 similarly the investigation of the effect of initial feed concentration on the transportation efficiency of tc showed that transportation decreases with an increase in the initial feed concentration hence the mechanism of electrostatic interaction between the cationic tc analyte and the anionic active hdehp carrier site is further proven 20 admittedly judging from the limited scientific investigation involving the remediation of organic micropollutants by pim the interfacial transport mechanism of organic compounds using carrier embedded membranes is potentially more complex than that of metal ions transportation it is also significantly different from those in supported liquid membranes hence the postulated mechanisms require further study through a rigorous kinetic study and series of instrumentation characterization 65 102 4 conclusion self plasticised hdehp embedded pims were successfully fabricated and applied to effectively remediate a 5 mg l modeled tc wastewater solution the transportation process is expectedly ph dependent where the ionized tc solute extraction follows the cation exchange mechanism aided by electronic migration and passive mass diffusion the results of the chemical stability of the pim show it is more stable in an acidic medium than in an alkaline medium which makes it favorable for the dominant mechanism and a higher optimum of 77 transportation efficiency was obtained compared to the optimum 50 reported using the self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier pim in an alkaline medium this study demonstrates that using the hdehp pvc pim higher chemically stable pims with significantly higher removal of tc from imitated wastewater can be obtained compared to the aliquat carrier pvc pim hence future studies aim to strategically investigate the enhancement of the pim stability and performance targeting a complete tc transportation by several modifications with potential for reusability studies declaration of competing interest the

12545,the polymer inclusion membranes pims are an economical alternative to the several advanced wastewater treatments previously employed for tetracycline tc remediation this study investigates the potential of pim consisting of an anionic charged bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp carrier embedded in polyvinyl chloride pvc for aqueous tc microcontaminant remediation ft ir sem porometry water uptake and contact angle pim s properties were evaluated the optimum hdehp pim proved to be physically and chemically stable after prolonged transportation experiments with a mass loss ranging from 0 46 0 02 to 10 13 0 50 the extraction and transportation efficiency obtained at a low tc concentration of 5 mg l was 79 and 77 using the optimum pim containing 50 hdehp carrier and at optimum conditions the study shows that self plasticised pvc polymer embedded with hdehp carrier satisfactorily transports low residue tc better than the previously reported self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier furthermore the hdehp pim was highly selective and more stable in an acidic than in an alkaline media the study also shows that increasing the stirring speed enhances the transportation efficiency and duration with an accumulation factor of 11 17 1 04 and 7 86 5 61 at 500 and 700 rpm respectively hence significant transportation of low tc concentration using cost effective self plasticised hdehp pim is feasible however further investigation is required for improved performance reduced transportation duration and stability studies based on pim reusability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hdehp self plasticised pim stability carrier data availability this study s raw processed data can only be shared on request as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction tetracycline tc is a frequently used antibiotic drug for human or veterinary therapeutics and an additive in agricultural feeds 1 various pharmaceutical compounds as low as parts per trillion have recently been detected in soil and water due to the improved analytical sensitivity in the last decade 2 3 several articles have reported the presence of new compounds classified as emerging compounds in wastewater and other aquatic environments unfortunately most emerging organic pharmaceutical contaminants remain unregulated and their impact on human health is still poorly understood 3 4 tc residue has been identified as the most common antibiotic residue detected in the form of a parental drug a metabolized product or tc metal complex in the aquatic environment probably due to its high quality broad spectrum affordability and extensive therapeutic application 1 5 hence it is frequently detected in accumulation from domestic and hospital wastewater reservoirs or as a circulated pollutant in surface and groundwater constituting potential hazards to human health and ecosystems 1 3 tc residue is capable of causing severe environmental threats to humans and animals in the form of antibiotic resistance leading to the development of a new kind of disease 1 6 the antibiotic resistance of tc to microorganisms was revealed from a recent surveillance study in some parts of european indicating that 66 9 of e coli and 44 9 of klebsiella species were resistant to tc while on a global scale 8 7 and 24 3 resistance for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and streptococcus pneumonia respectively were identified 1 7 the finding of low concentrations of hormones and antibiotics ng l in drinking water and wastewaters and their subsequent accumulation in animals as revealed by several studies suggest a link between environmental exposures to hormones and deteriorating trends in human health including decreases in male sperm count an increase in testicular prostate ovarian and breast cancer and reproductive malfunctions 8 9 as reported by koyuncu et al 10 similarly kraemer et al 11 reported that as low as 1 μg ml of tc could cause dysbiosis and increase mortality in susceptible aquatic animals zebrafish embryos the several documented scientific reports on the severe environmental risk of residual organic emerging contaminants such as tc make it imperative to adequately remove them from drinking water unfortunately the remediation capacity of primary treatment techniques is ineffective for the satisfactory removal of residual antibiotics from wastewater in wwtp 12 there is therefore an ongoing effort to design efficient affordable and environmentally friendly advanced treatment techniques to remediate organic effluent 13 such advanced treatment technologies include adsorption membrane filtration advanced oxidation process reverse osmosis flocculation and coagulation 1 4 14 however most advanced treatment techniques are limited by technical and economic factors such as high energy high operational cost and an expensive large quantity of hazardous chemicals worst still some of the techniques have insufficient selectivity for practical commercial applications 15 16 hence a polymer material with excellent selectivity to contaminants of interest and high elution and reusability functions is being sought 12 recently polymer inclusion membranes pims a relatively emerging innovative liquid membrane have been identified as a highly efficient selective and attractive alternative to remediate industrial metals and pharmaceutical residues from water 16 18 39 however while the pim techniques have been applied to remediate several metallic contaminants until recently only a handful of researchers have explored the use of pim to remove pharmaceutical organic contaminants among these few are the removal of ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole antibiotics 19 20 ibuprofen 21 23 progesterone 22 tetracyclines tcs and sulfonamides sas 24 25 transportation of a 5 mg l mix feed solution of six frequently used antibiotics four sulfonamides sas and two tetracyclines tcs using pim was investigated by aida garcia rodríguez et al 24 25 in their work they reported that the cta based plasticised pim containing 26 aliquat 336 and 44 2 nitrophenyloctyl ether npoe as plasticisers had a 100 tc transportation efficiency compared to the 0 and 50 obtained for the self plasticised pvc pim containing 31 aliquat 336 and plasticised pvc pim containing 26 aliquat 336 44 npoe respectively furthermore they concluded that the cta aliquat 336 2 nitrophenyloctyl ether composite pim transported tc better than the additively plasticised and self plasticised pvc based pims several studies have shown that the physiochemical property and transport mechanisms of pim are influenced by the components used in its fabrication particularly the type of carrier embedded during its fabrication 26 55 hence the choice of appropriate carrier type plays a fundamental role in the selective separation of a particular analyte and the stability of the resulting membrane 27 28 although anionic cationic and neutral or solvating carriers have been extensively investigated as extracting media for different applications and on an industrial scale 27 the compatibility of pvc based pim embedded with different carriers has motivated growing interest in applying pims for the separation recovery of several organic and metallic chemical species 29 however the use of the pvc cationic aliqaut 336 carrier pim in an alkaline medium is prone to instability due to a dehalogenation reaction occurring within the polymer matrix and possible dehydrochlorination reactions between the poly chloroethene from pvc with a base in the presence of quaternary ammonium aliquat 336 carrier resulting in a non transparent darkened pim 30 this problem likely accounts for the reported nil tc transportation using the self plasticised pvc cationic aliquat 336 carrier pim 24 the challenges of low extraction efficiency and stability of pim are among the major challenges limiting its industrial application therefore the present study evaluates the efficiency and potential of using economically self plasticised pvc pim embedded with a varied amount of bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp as an anionic carrier hdehp pim to extract and transport low concentration of tc microcontaminant residue from imitated laboratory wastewater the use of hdehp pim for transporting aqueous tc to the best of our knowledge has not been reported furthermore the effect of carrier and receiving phase concentration stirring speed initial feed concentration and initial feed ph on the performance efficiency of the optimum pim was investigated in addition preliminary chemical stability of the fabricated pims in alkaline and acidic media and after prolonged transportation duration was also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate 97 hdehp sigma aldrich germany as a carrier polyvinylchloride pvc mw 43 000 as polymer tetrahydrofuran thf 99 9 sigma aldrich darmstadt germany as the solvent ultrapure tetracycline hydrochloride c22h24n2o8 hcl mw 480 90 g mol to prepare wastewater imitate 2 2 membrane preparation to prepare the dope solution a base polymer pvc and a varied amount of hdehp carrier were dissolved in thf table 2 under continuous magnetic stirring until a homogeneous solution was obtained the solution was then sonicated in an elmasonic s30h sonicator germany and poured on a cleaned smooth flat glass plate pre set at 30 μm thickness on elcometer 4340 united kingdom automatic film applicator knife the formed membrane was left on the glass plate at room temperature to allow the organic solvent to evaporate for 24 h finally the resulting partly dried membranes were peeled carefully from the glass plate and allowed further drying beyond 24 h before characterization and performance evaluation 2 3 membrane characterization in a preliminary investigation all the fabricated pvc hedpa embedded pim except pim f which is not only physically unstable but also appeared flaccid and cloudy were examined by fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy ftir sem surface morphology water uptake contact angle ca and chemical and physical stabilities the membrane thickness variation was measured using a digital screw micrometer further investigation using the porometry was employed to elucidate the changes in the morphological properties of the optimum pim 2 4 membrane surface morphology scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3000 tokyo japan was employed to obtain information about the membrane surface and cross section morphology the microstructure of the membrane initially gold plated using quorum sc7620 laughton east sussex usa was examined at 100 and 1500 magnification respectively 2 5 membrane s pore characteristics and thickness the membrane thickness micron was measured in triplicates with a screw micrometer with an accuracy of 0 01 mm 31 gas porometry gas absorption was employed to evaluate the average pore size and their distribution porosity of the pristine pims a and optimum c using the capillary flow porometer previously immersed in a porefil 16 dyne cm for 24 h the membranes were then subsequently placed in the membrane cell of the porometer and the wet up dry up mode of the membrane was determined 33 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ir spectra were recorded with the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo scientific nicolet 10 waltham ma usa to identify the interrelations among the pims composite components 32 scans were collected for each pim measurement over the 4000 500 cm 1 spectral range and the resulting spectra were analyzed using omnic software version 5 2a 2 7 membrane physical stability the physical stability of polymer inclusion membrane is a significant parameter in membrane characterization for any practical application ideally a good pim should be transparent and flexible such that there is no tearing or visually deformed when bent 34 hence most pim fabricators usually add a plasticising agent to support its physical structure 36 therefore the fabricated pims flexibility was assessed by carefully twisting a 4 4 size of each membrane and any tearing or visible distortion was observed 30 2 8 chemical stability the classical superiority and higher commerciality potentials of a polymer inclusion membrane over all the other liquid membranes in terms of its performance and chemical stability have been established 37 38 however the relative instability of pim during the long term separation process and certain strong aqueous media remained a drawback to its robust industrial application 19 therefore it is crucial to evaluate the chemical stability of fabricated pim in specific aquatic environments and during prolonged separation applications the chemical stability of fabricated pim in selected solutions of interest can be determined indirectly by weight loss which has been experimentally well correlated quantitatively to the leaching of the embedded carrier from the membrane microstructure 37 40 each 3 2 cm of the hdehp embedded pim was immersed in 50 ml of appropriate medium 1 m hno3 ph 1 and 0 05 m naoh ph 12 in a 100 ml vial tightly capped and shaken at 400 rpm in an orbital mixer protech model si 1000 at 28 0 1 c for 24 h the pims were later placed on a dry filter paper in a petri dish and allowed to dry in an oven at 40 c until a constant dry weight was obtained the percentage weight loss due to carrier loss in the membrane was calculated using eq 1 duplicate measurements were conducted for each membrane 1 mass loss wi wf wo 100 where wi is the initial weight of the pim and wf is the final pim s constant weight after drying 2 9 contact angle and water uptake the contact angle θ of the pims was determined to access their hydrophilicity the angle was measured using an image processing software equipped with a goniometer rame hart 250 fi usa and a sessile droplet of 4 5 ml deionized water at ambient temperature 25 1 c then a random average analyzed replicates values from 5 spots were taken as the pim s contact angle to minimize experimental errors water uptake was also conducted to assess the hydrophilicity of the fabricated pims a circular piece of each pre weight fabricated pims a e 30 mm was immersed in water and allowed to stand at room temperature 25 9 1 c for 24 h the soaked pims were removed using forceps and adhering surficial water was mopped up carefully the wet membrane was weighed and placed in a vacuum oven at 60 c until a constant dry weight was obtained 41 42 the percentage of water uptake was calculated using eq 11 the analysis was done in duplicates to minimize experimental errors the average values were reported as the percentage water uptake u 11 water

varied hno3 concentrations in the receiving phase solution was investigated by evaluating the rate of tc removal and transportation using a varied concentration of hno3 0 1 0 2 1 and 2 m 43 44 2 11 tetracycline transportation pim with a diffusing area of 2 5 cm diameter clamped between 250 ml capacity diffusion cell ml on teflon support was under study the receiving compartment was filled with hno3 44 45 the feed compartment was filled with a varied aqueous tc concentration 5 10 and 15 mg l each working solution was prepared daily by appropriately diluting previously refrigerated stock solutions with deionized water milli q plus system millipore 18 2 mω cm at 25 c each diffusion cell and phase was homogenized simultaneously on an identical magnetic stirrer at uniform stirring speeds the concentration of tc in both phases was determined by u vis spectrometry at 276 nm optimum absorbance wavelength after 24 h intervals 46 47 2 12 pim performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the understudy pims the tetracycline separability was determined by calculating its removal efficiency r transportation efficiency t initial flux j and accumulation factor calculated by

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir analysis was employed to identify the interactions among the components used in fabricating the pristine fig 1 a and hdehp embedded pims fig 1 b 49 50 the identified spectra of the pims and their corresponding assignments as presented in table 1 shows the absorbance peaks corresponding functional group and assignments of the pvc and hdehp carrier the saturated ch aliphatic bending ch peaks were identified at 1430 cm 1 scissors and 1330 cm 1 twisting while the peaks at 2970 2910 and 2850 cm 1 represented the ch stretching functional group 51 the modes at 1250 and 684 cm 1 represent the numerous ch modes near cl and the c cl gauche bond 52 the broad peak at 1600 cm 1 corresponds to the oh stretching of water 53 while the peak at 1060 cm 1 indicates the co stretching of primary alcohol finally the peak at 956 cm 1 represents ch2 rocking peaks and the 832 600 cm 1 depicts the cc stretching 49 the distinct peaks of the embedded bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphate hdehp carrier in pim c as indicated in blue colour in fig 1 b were identified at the weak peak of 2860 cm 1 indicating the csp2 h and the group csp3 h at 2930 cm 1 stretching while the phosphates functional group occurred at 1020 and 1230 cm 1 assigned to the po stretching and po respectively 19 49 3 1 1 sem morphologies the sem surface morphology of fabricated pims as presented in fig 2 a shows that pims a d has an apparent homogeneous symmetric dense microstructure indicating a uniform distribution and interfacial interaction of the hdehp embedded carrier in the pvc polymer matrix 56 however for pim e with increased hdehp carrier concentration 66 7 agglomerate particles were observed on the surface of the membrane the comparative cross section morphology of the optimum pim c and the pristine pim a are presented in fig 2 c with a distinct internal morphology the image shows that the pristine pim a is microscopically homogenous and dense while pim c also appeared microscopically dense but with heterogeneous micro channeling pores according to xu et al 57 at higher carrier concentrations above 40 the carrier is partially entangled within the polymer matrix while some of the carriers form a evidently porous microchannels structure that serves as an enhancement pathway through which the extracted hdehp tc complex could diffuse 57 59 3 1 2 contact angle and water uptake of hdehp pim the effect of the hdehp carrier concentration in the fabricated pim on its hydrophilicity property was investigated by assessing its contact angle and water uptake the results show that the contact angle fig 2 b decreased while the water uptake table 2 increased correspondingly as the amount of carrier increased this pattern indicates a progressive increase in hydrophilicity of the pims from its initial highly hydrophobic nature as indicated in the pristine pim a with the contact angle value of 84 14 0 06 θ and water uptake value of 5 39 0 41 to a more hydrophilic pim d with 70 42 0 05 θ and 37 92 1 02 for the contact angle and water uptake respectively therefore the lipophilic hdehp carrier successfully modified the pvc polymer to a relatively more hydrophilic pim however a slight increase in the contact angle for pim e was observed which is attributable to the slight surface roughness of the pim and apparent swelling of the polymer matrix at a high hdehp carrier in addition it has been reported that a small regular array of roughness on the membrane efficiently trapped air limiting the available space contact area between dropped water and the rough membrane surface 60 62 3 1 3 physical stability a good and acceptable polymer inclusion membrane should be visually homogeneous transparent flexible and free of droplets of extractant droplets on its surface 63 the physical assessment results as presented in table 2 show that the embedded hdehp carrier significantly plasticised the membranes and enhanced their physical stability compared to pure pvc pim the brittleness of the pure pvc membrane can be traced to the rigid three dimensional structure of the pvc base polymer 64 ionic quaternary ammonium carriers such as the bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid hdehp and aliquat 336 carriers can plasticise pims without an additional plasticiser the self plasticising carrier s ability has been related to physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity hydrogen bonding capacity and ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions in its liquid state at room temperature 63 65 66 maiphetlho et al 41 reported high flexibility of self plasticised pim containing 60 40 w t pvc hdehp carrier pims b e are physically stable but pim a is brittle to manual deformation while pim f appears cloudy flaccid and mechanically unstable table 2 hence pim f was discarded as unsuitable for further investigation while pim a compared with the physical stability improved pims b e with increased polymer chain mobility indicated by their flexibility and transparency was investigated for its potential for remediating aquatic tc 67 furthermore contrary to kazemi et al 68 we successfully fabricated physically stable pims embedded with 60 and 67 hdehp carriers which is higher than the 55 limit stated in their work this is made possible partly due to our study s non additional external plasticiser and membrane fabrication method our team is investigating the latter factor 3 1 4 membranes pim thickness and pore characteristics the results of the measured membrane thickness of pims a e as presented in table 3 indicate that the membrane thickness increases as the carrier concentration increases the increment varied from the original pre set thickness of 30 μm with the aid of casting knife film applicators by 16 7 for the pristine pim a without embedded carrier and as much as 293 3 to the pim e embedded with the highest hdehp carriers 66 7 it is well known that membrane thickness is inversely proportional to the membrane permeation rate and its flux across the membrane hence the slight reduction in tc transportation efficiency observed for pims d and e fig 4 even though both are embedded with higher carrier concentration 69 pim fabrication using the automatic casting thin film applicator has the advantage of pre setting the desired pim thickness however it has been reported that due to volatility of carrier during the evaporation of the thf solvent used in pim fabrication which results in bulked membranes believed to house a viscous liquid formed underneath when the thf solvent evaporates within the pim s polymer matrix it is opined that the expansion of the membrane structure bulking creates the liquid pathways within the membrane needed for the transportation of the anionic hdehp tc complex this phenomenon has been described as the formation of two separate domains in its microstructures 26 70 71 the seeming inhomogeneity of the pim c s cross section image and irregular micropores distribution porous structure is likely due to the added hdehp carrier 73 unarguably the limitation of the sem acquisitions may not confirm these possibilities sufficiently however this speculative structure termed liquid pores was also reported by gherasim et al 52 for a pvc pim embedded with 50 d2ehpa which the authors believed enhanced its sorption capacity and transport properties hence to further examine the morphological details of the optimum pim c in comparison to the pristine pim a the result of the porometry analysis as presented in table 3 show that the pore size and pim s porosity decreased significantly when the hdepa carrier is 50 from the initial 0 22 0 04 and 10 4 3 1 pristine pim a to 0 15 0 06 and 0 2 0 1 respectively the reduction in both the pores size and porosity of the optimum pim c due to the penetration of the hdehp carrier inside the support pores rather than being anchored on its surface can be related to the high selectivity and flexibility mechanical stability of the pim it has been reported that the selectivity of liquid membranes depends highly on both the pore size and its fixed charge density and hence the carrier facilitated transportation efficiency which is directly related to the selectivity of the membrane also increased with reduced pore size and porosity due to the donnan exclusion principle 74 76 alnajrani alsager 72 and sarkar et al 73 have equally described the possibility of this phenomenon 3 1 5 chemical stability studies based on the effect of hdehp concentration stirring speeds and acidic alkaline media ph the chemical stability of the hdehp pims at different carrier concentrations was investigated by measuring the mass loss of the pim after a prolonged period 216 h and the result obtained is presented in fig 3 a similarly the results of the investigation of the effect of stirring speed and media ph acidic and alkaline media on membrane stability are equally shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the prolonged transportation stability of the pims generally decreases with an increase in the amount of incorporated hdehp carrier as indicated by the increasing mass loss of the pims from 0 46 0 02 for the pim a with nil carrier content to 10 13 0 50 for pim e containing the 66 7 hdehp carrier as shown in fig 3 a the mass loss of pim has been attributed to the leaching of the carrier into the solution due to either formation of emulsion droplets or pressure differences within the membrane 74 75 the effect of stirring speed on the stability of the optimum pim c showed that there was a significant difference in the mass loss when the transportation was conducted at 500 rpm 3 70 0 4 compared to when the stirring speed was 700 rpm 7 60 0 5 as indicated in fig 3 b the lower stability of the pim at a higher stirring speed may be attributed to turbulence induced carrier leakage at the stirring speed of 700 rpm 38 76 the result of the chemical stability of the hdehp pims in a highly alkaline and acidic medium is presented in fig 3 c the result revealed that hdehp pim is more stable in the acidic medium with minimum mass loss 0 846 0 111 6 90 0 60 compared to the higher mass loss 11 01 1 30 40 42 0 89 in the alkaline medium the lower resistance of pvc polymer in an alkaline medium is due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting in the darkening of pims 77 78 3 1 6 hdehp pim s tetracycline extraction and transportation performance evaluation pim s productive and selectivity performance can be evaluated in terms of its molecule throughput in terms of flux and separation efficiency measured in terms of its analyte extraction and transportation at specified conditions 25 79 therefore to determine the optimal membrane carrier composition in the fabricated pims the effect of carrier concentration on the extraction and transportation of tc in an acidic receiving phase of the hdehp pims was assessed on their removal and transportation efficiency under varied process conditions the investigation was first preliminarily conducted with 10 mg l tc wastewater at initial feed ph 3 with 0 2 m hno3 as the receiving phase solution and at 500 rpm stirring speed to select the optimum pim based on hdehp carrier concentration 3 1 7 effect of carrier concentration and duration on transportation of tetracycline the transportation efficiency of pim is a critical determinative factor in assessing its performance because a suitable pim should not only extract a target solute but should effectively transport the same to the receiving phase with little or no accumulation 72 therefore the preliminary investigation used a prolonged experimental duration of 216 h to select the optimum pim carrier concentration and evaluate membrane stability for prolonged usage the effect of carrier concentration on the extraction and transportation of tc using the hdehp pim is presented in fig 4 similar to what is reported in the literature a higher experimental time and hdehp carrier concentration resulted in increased removal r and transportation t efficiencies due to the formation of more tc solute carrier complexes and increased diffusion coefficient of the tc carrier molecule s complex 25 57 69 however there was a slight decrease in the removal efficiency for pim e containing 66 7 hdehp carrier concentration probably due to the coalescence of the liquid micro domains formed at increased carrier concentration as indicated by a similar oddly slight decrease in the hydrophilicity of the pim e fig 2 b the pim containing 60 hdehp carrier pim d has the highest extraction efficiency 68 03 3 86 which is marginally higher than pim c 67 54 1 39 but the latter pim with 66 30 0 94 transported tc is significantly better than the 63 12 2 74 efficiency of the former on the other hand the relatively high amount of carrier in the embedded pim c 50 resulted in high transportation efficiencies and low accumulation factor probably due to its lower thickness 56 0 1 00 μm and sufficiently high carrier concentration because according to sellami et al 81 and nghiem et al 82 to ensure satisfactory transportation properties of pims it is necessary to use a high quantity of carrier 40 therefore the ability of self plasticised hdehp pim containing 50 hdehp in the present study to enhance the tc solute s transportation effectively justifies the position of kazemi et al 80 on the insignificant contributory role of commonly added plasticisers tbp npoe dbp and tehp in improving the performance flux of a pvc based pim containing 50 wt hdehp carrier furthermore a recent study by kazemi et al reported a high bi iii extraction efficiency using a 50 pvc 50 hdehp carrier pim 68 80 according to the authors the higher efficiency at 50 concentration is due to the extractant s increased plasticising effect resulting in decreased resistance to solute diffusion traditional pim passive facilitated transportation has been conducted beyond 40 h for metals 41 83 and more particularly for organic antibiotics pharmaceutical compounds for which it has been demonstrated that equilibrium is achieved beyond 24 h extraction and transportation using pim 19 20 25 to this end several solutions have been proffered to reduce the transportation duration including increasing the agitation speed temperature pim s surface area receiver solution ionic strength and application of electro membrane among others to enhance the efficiency and the rate of solute transportation 25 81 hence the effect of the concentration of the hno3 receiving phase and stirring speeds on the efficiency of tc transportation was investigated 3 1 8 effect of receiving phase solutions concentration on tetracycline transportation efficiency the ph and the ionic strength of the feed and receiving solutions are critical factors affecting the efficiency of carrier mediated absorption and transportation processes it is also useful in elucidating the type of interaction governing the sorption process of the analyte 25 27 86 87 98 the results of the effect of the varied hno3 receiving solutions 0 1 2 m for tc transportation is as presented in fig 5 similar to what was observed by parolo et al 84 and lu et al 87 transportation efficiency increased as the stripping solution s ionic strength increased it was observed that after 48 h transportation duration and when the ionic strength was 2 m 70 of tc was transported while only 44 was transported when the ionic strength was 0 1 m this observed trend indicates a higher tc removal and transportation capacity when the ionic strength of the hno3 receiving phase was increased to 2 m at low feed ph of 3 44 45 hence judging from this trend it can be inferred that the electrostatic interaction is the main driving force for the sorption of positively charged tc species acidic solute solution on the anionic carrier hdehp because according to lu et al 87 the high sorption affinity of the tc at low ph but higher ionic strength for the receiver solution could be due to the occurrence of electrostatic attraction which is ph dependent at different ionic strengths further investigations were conducted using 2 m hno3 as the optimum receiving solution phase 66 3 1 9 effect of stirring speeds on tetracycline transportation efficiency it has been previously reported that the extraction efficiency of pim generally increases with increasing stirring speed due to a substantial decrease in the thickness of the diffusion layer hence to explore the possibility of enhancing extraction and transportation the effect of stirring speeds from 500 to 800 rpm was investigated 80 the result showed an increased tc transportation performance efficiency as the stirring speed increased similarly a significant reduction in the transportation duration from 216 h was utilized at the preliminary stage to 45 h while its transportation efficiency increased from 70 at 500 rpm to 75 at the optimum speed of 700 rpm as presented in fig 6 this observation indicates that an increased stirring speed significantly enhanced the rate and efficiency of tc transportation due to mechanically facilitated mass transfer of the analyte and the active carrier complex 88 however a slight decrease 73 was observed when the stirring speed was increased to 800 rpm due perhaps due to the reduction in boundary layer thickness leading to possible turbulence induced carrier leakage as the stirring speed increases and a subsequent decrease in performance 38 76 80 indeed the appropriate stirring speed is a careful synergistic compromise that depends on the target solute membrane composition and several other critical factors governing facilitated transportation using pim 29 hence different studied stirring speeds have been employed from previous works of literature for example sellami et al 72 reported using 1000 rpm kazemi yaftian 75 and olasupo et al 20 reportedly studied at 200 650 rpm and 650 rpm respectively furthermore darvishi et al 81 applied 450 600 rpm cai et al 82 and benosmane et al 38 utilized 600 rpm ling mohd suah 83 and sellami et al 84 reported 500 rpm while aranda merino et al 85 and abdul halim et al 89 worked with a relatively lower stirring speed of 400 rpm and 150 350 rpm respectively hence subsequent investigations were carried out at the optimum stirring speed of 700 rpm using the optimum pim c 3 1 10 effect of initial tetracycline feed concentration the result for the transportation efficiency of the optimum pim c for tc is presented in fig 7 it is observed that an increase in the initial tc feed concentration leads to an increase in the removal efficiency from 79 at 5 mg l to 83 at 15 mg l however as the initial feed concentration increased its transportation efficiency decreased from 77 at 5 mg l to 75 at 10 and 74 at 15 mg l this observation shows that the slight decrease in transportation at higher concentrations 10 and 15 mg l could be due to the partial blockage of the membrane active sites by the tc solutes removed from the feed 83 19 20 the possibility of blockage of active sites can be substantiated by the 9 accumulation factor 1 35 mg tc as against the 10 accumulation factor 0 5 mg tc at a lower concentration of 5 mg l the result of the initial flux table 3 shows that electromigration and mass transfer of tc across the membrane was higher at 15 mg l 5 53 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 than at a lower concentration of 5 mg l 0 69 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 the electrostatic interaction between the cationic tc analyte and the anionic active hdehp carrier site seems to govern its transportation mechanism which enables faster transportation at a lower concentration olasupo et al 20 and gherasim et al 66 reported similar observations however aqueous tc is generally present at a very low concentration therefore just like other emerging pharmaceutical contaminants it had to await improvement in analytical instruments that could detect it at a micron level before its discovery as a pollutant in water 91 therefore the effect of initial feed ph was further investigated at an initial feed concentration of 5 mg l 3 1 11 effect of initial feed ph adjustment on tetracycline transportation efficiency the efficiency of antibiotic transportation using pim is feed ph dependent which is reportedly optimum at the alkaline solute solution for the cationic carrier aliquat 336 and acidic solute solution for the anionic carrier hdehp when these compounds exist in their anionic and cationic forms respectively 25 27 however tc is an amphiphilic molecule with multiple ionizable functional groups that can exist in solution as cations ph 3 32 anions ph 7 78 and or amphoteric ions 3 32 ph 7 78 otherwise known as zwitterionic forms furthermore the result of the chemical stability of the hdehp pims revealed that hdehp pim is more stable in the acidic medium with minimum mass loss 0 846 0 111 6 90 0 60 compared to the higher mass loss 11 01 1 30 40 42 0 89 in the alkaline medium fig 3 c the lower resistance of pvc polymer in an alkaline medium is due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting in the darkening of pims 77 78 advantageously since the extraction transportation of tc and pim stability using the cationic hdehp carrier exchanger is favored at an acidic ph all the experiments were conducted at low ph initial feed 3 3 by adjusting the ph of 5 mg l tc feed solutions using 0 1 m hcl as a buffer solution to 3 ph 1 5 the effect of the initial feed ph at 3 2 5 and 1 5 potentiometrically monitored on the efficiency of tc transportation is presented in fig 8 the result shows that there was only a marginal difference in the extraction transportation efficiency at ph 1 5 70 67 and 2 5 71 68 in contrast tc tetracycline extraction and transportation significantly increased to 79 77 at initial feed ph 3 in a similar study conducted by kolev et al 92 using a similar acidic carrier di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid an optimum ph 3 was also reported for the selective extraction and transportation of zn ii into an acidic hcl receiving phase however as according to the authors an hdehp carrier is a phosphoric acid extractant that releases h into the solution through cation exchange during the extraction process the evidence of the release of h into the solution was also observed at the end of the extraction in the current study which resulted in a drastic drop in the medium s acidity 3 1 12 effect of initial feed concentration and stirring speed on pim s initial flux and accumulation factor to study the influence of the feed concentration and stirring speed on the accumulation factor and initial tc flux performance of the optimum hdehp pim c the solute accumulated within the membrane and the initial flux after 45 and 5 h transportation durations respectively were investigated for comparison 75 the principle of membrane flux is hinged on the diffusion of a highly concentrated analyte in the feed phase to a lower concentration in the receiving phase as described by fick s first law of diffusion 93 the result as presented in table 4 indicate a significant difference in pim performance at varied initial feed concentration and stirring speeds the tc accumulation factor reduced from 10 43 6 25 at the initial feed concentration of 5 mg l to 7 86 5 61 and 8 63 3 78 when the feed concentration was 10 and 15 mg l and its flux also correspondingly increased as the initial feed concentration increased from 0 69 to 2 08 and 5 53 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 respectively similarly there was a significant increase in the initial flux when the stirring speeds were increased from 500 rpm with a flux of 0 58 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 to 2 08 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 at the optimum speed of 700 rpm while the accumulation factor also decreased significantly from 11 17 1 04 to 7 86 5 61 respectively these results show that at a higher rate of stirring speeds and initial feed concentration the initial flux increases and the duration required to achieve an effective diffusion driven extraction process is reduced 94 95 according to tarhouchi et al 96 organic solute s carrier facilitated association dissociation mechanism increases with increased feed concentration due to the concentration gradient between the feed and receiving phases similarly the decrease in the accumulation factor and a corresponding increase in the initial flux at higher stirring speeds when the stirring speed was increased from 500 to 700 rpm agrees with the findings of kazemi et al 80 a decrease in the accumulation factor indicates a reduction in tc solute accumulation at increased stirring speed because solute accumulation in the membrane implies low transportability due to incomplete analyte transportation which can negatively affect the efficient reusability of pim due to membrane fouling 20 95 the current study shows a higher performance of the pvc based hdehp pim compared to the optimum 50 using npoe plasticised pvc aliquat 336 pim reported by garcia rodríguez et al 25 at initial tc feed concentration of 5 mg l although the optimum 77 transportation efficiency obtained in the current study is lower than the 100 obtained using npoe plasticised cta aliquat 336 pim nonetheless the significantly higher performance of the self plasticised pvc hdehp carrier 77 compared to the self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier nil used in their work indicates the need to select a compatible carrier type and concentration for a specific target solute for an efficient extraction process 27 40 furthermore the optimum initial flux of 0 69 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 obtained in the present study is significantly lower than the optimum 4 54 10 7 mol m 2 s 1 obtained in their study the lower value obtained in the current study is probably due to the higher stirring speed of 800 rpm and membrane surface area of 11 5 cm2 employed in their work compared to the 700 rpm and effective membrane area of 4 91 cm2 employed in the current study in addition the authors used lower feed and stripping solutions volumes 150 ml while 250 ml was used in the present study 25 according to alexander et al 97 calculating the initial flux of a pim using dimensionally dependent parameters limits meaningful comparison of pim s transport data due to different experimental conditions nonetheless this study has demonstrated significant differences in the analyte selection interaction mechanisms and transportation efficiency of the investigated self plasticised hdehp pim compared to the previously studied pvc aliquat 336 carrier pim 27 firstly the use of the cationic carrier aliquat 33 carrier by the previous researcher implied that the experiment was performed at higher ph 9 alkaline which is well known to be unsuitable for the stability of pvc a chloroethene organochloride due to the problem of dehydrochlorination resulting to a significant loss in its carrier and hence lower transportation efficiency 77 secondly the relatively lower amount of the aliquat 336 carrier used 31 in their investigation is insufficient to satisfactorily plasticised the resulting pim and to enhance its morphological structure for better transportation of low concentration of the tc 57 59 3 2 postulated transportation mechanism of tetracycline using hdehp pim the possible mechanism of organic compound transportation using polymer inclusion membranes depends on the prevailing conditions such as the carrier types and feed ph for example in a situation where the membrane active site function as a pseudo fixed charged site positive or negative and the organic solute are ionized there will be an ion exchange interaction between the organic solute and the carrier forming the carrier extracted species complex or ion pair at the feed solution pim interface and subsequently diffused across the membrane to be stripped at the receiving solution pim interface and the carrier 38 65 99 judging from the results obtained for the transportation of tc in the present study at various hdehp carrier concentrations using an acidic receiving phase with varied ionic strength varied initial feed concentration and stirring speeds phase suggests that interfacial electrostatic transportation mechanisms also occur in the transportation of ionized tc with hedehp alkyl phosphonic acids carrier the anionic or acidic carriers hdehp carrier formed an active pseudo fixed anionic charged site the occurrence increases with increasing carrier concentration in the membrane resulting in an increased transportation efficiency rate a phenomenon known as the percolation theory in another instance when the organic tc compounds are ionized it forms hydrogen bonds with the hdehp carrier leading to the formation of hydrogen bonded heteroconjugate ion with extracted species 66 95 hence tc was transported through the hdehp pim by hopping between the fixed molecules of the carrier fixed site jumping 52 58 in agreement with the latter postulation eiroa lledo et al 100 have also recently demonstrated that tc extraction using di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid carrier hdehp from a 3 m naclo4 ph 2 into a dodecane receiver involves one hdehp dimer participating in the extraction and transfer of one proton from the hdehp into the aqueous receiving phase which is similar to what is obtained for tetravalent metals extraction mechanism using hdehp carrier 100 therefore it can be inferred that the use of an acidic receiving phase hno3 and low feed solution ph 3 for the transportation of ionizable organic compounds such as tc depends on the ph driving force by the hdehp carrier mediated diffusion mechanism 101 similarly the investigation of the effect of initial feed concentration on the transportation efficiency of tc showed that transportation decreases with an increase in the initial feed concentration hence the mechanism of electrostatic interaction between the cationic tc analyte and the anionic active hdehp carrier site is further proven 20 admittedly judging from the limited scientific investigation involving the remediation of organic micropollutants by pim the interfacial transport mechanism of organic compounds using carrier embedded membranes is potentially more complex than that of metal ions transportation it is also significantly different from those in supported liquid membranes hence the postulated mechanisms require further study through a rigorous kinetic study and series of instrumentation characterization 65 102 4 conclusion self plasticised hdehp embedded pims were successfully fabricated and applied to effectively remediate a 5 mg l modeled tc wastewater solution the transportation process is expectedly ph dependent where the ionized tc solute extraction follows the cation exchange mechanism aided by electronic migration and passive mass diffusion the results of the chemical stability of the pim show it is more stable in an acidic medium than in an alkaline medium which makes it favorable for the dominant mechanism and a higher optimum of 77 transportation efficiency was obtained compared to the optimum 50 reported using the self plasticised pvc aliquat 336 carrier pim in an alkaline medium this study demonstrates that using the hdehp pvc pim higher chemically stable pims with significantly higher removal of tc from imitated wastewater can be obtained compared to the aliquat carrier pvc pim hence future studies aim to strategically investigate the enhancement of the pim stability and performance targeting a complete tc transportation by several modifications with potential for reusability studies declaration of competing interest the

effectively removed ammonium and nitrate with 98 of ammonium and 45 of nitrate removed within 24 h moreover p mosselii 9 1 tolerated as high as 2500 mg l of ammonium along with the elimination of approximately 588 mg l of it within 24 h kegg analysis revealed that rather than nitrification p mosselii 9 1 removes ammonium via heterotrophic ammonium assimilation the presence of nirbd and nirk genes implicated reduction to ammonium and aerobic denitrification reduction to gaseous nitrogen as the pathways involved in no2 removal additionally p mosselii 9 1 can transform organic nitrogen to

mosselii 9 1 may be a promising biotreatment agent for wastewater containing high ammonium levels graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pseudomonas mosselii 9 1 ammonium assimilation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nitrogen metabolic pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nh4 and no3 are common inorganic pollutant in wastewater and biological nitrogen removal bnr is a low cost enhanced efficiency technology for wastewater treatment 1 the conventional biological nitrogen elimination procedure usually contains two sequential steps nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 basically these processes are carried out by a variety of functional microorganisms under aerobic or anoxic conditions 2 in recently years researchers have identified a group of novel bacteria that capable of conducting heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad simultaneously 3 nevertheless conventional biological nitrogen treatments rely on nitrification and denitrification processes have several disadvantages such as low efficiency of multiple step processes high energy cost and greenhouse gas emissions 4 rather than transformation and released into environment nitrogen can also be assimilated by cells since it is an essential element for microorganisms growth many studies have demonstrated that ammonium assimilation nh4 to biomass is an effective way to remove ammonium from wastewater and the biomass could be reused as potential source of microbial fertilizer feedstuffs or industrial raw material 5 recovered into n rich substance could be a sustainable solution for n removal in wastewater treatment and attracted more and more attentions in recently years several heterotrophic ammonium assimilation bacteria haab have been reported such as pseudomonas chloritidismutans k14 6 rhodococcus erythropolis strain y10 7 pseudomonas putida y9 8 and pseudomonas stutzeri ad 1 9 which showed high ammonium removal rates moreover no3 n can also be removed by microbes via nitrate reduction to ammonium reactions 10 which include dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium reaction dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium anra the dnra process indicates the sequential conversion of no3 into no2 and reduces to nh4 while the anra begins by reducing the no3 to nh4 and then it is utilized by the cells to be incorporated into biomolecules 11 gene studies have revealed that the key enzymes involved in the no2 to nh4 conversion are nrfa periplasm and nirbd cytoplasm 12 the nh4 generated from dnra can be subsequently oxidized to no3 by nitrifiers allowing the recycling of n substrates in environments dnra plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles by linking nitrogen oxidation and reduction processes since it can promote algal growth and subsequently improve primary production in oligotrophic oceans and it is considered to be more critical in the turnover of nitrate nitrite in estuarine ecosystems than previously thought 13 15 previous studies are most concentrated on the importance of dnra on nitrogen cycle of marine and estuarine ecosystems few studies have described dnra or anra in wastewater treatment li et al has isolated vibrio sp y1 5 which had excellent nh4 and no3 removal efficiency under aerobic condition n balance experiment revealed the pathway of nitrate removal was assimilatory nitrate reduction 11 sun et al isolated pseudomonas stutzeri t13 for wastewater treatment and it remove nh4 and no3 via ammonium assimilation and aerobic denitrification 16 these studies indicate ammonium assimilation and assimilatory nitrate reduction have potential application value for biological nitrogen removal at present increasing attention has been focused on isolating and identifying functional bacteria which can simultaneously remove nh4 and no3 from wastewater the metabolic pathway and mechanism of simultaneous removal of nh4 and no3 are not fully understood nor the influencing factors affecting the nitrogen removal efficiency of such bacteria understanding the influencing factors of its nitrogen removal process can provide a preliminary basis for subsequent applications in this study pseudomonas mosselii p mosselii 9 1 was isolated from shrimp ponds with high nh4 and no3 removal efficiency and could tolerate high nh4 concentrations a draft genome analysis of p mosselii 9 1 and kegg pathway indicated this bacterium removes no3 and nh4 mainly through assimilatory no3 reduction and ammonium assimilation process nitrogen removal performance and optimal conditions for nh4 and no3 removal were further investigated under aerobic conditions finally an analysis of p mosselii s toxicity against litopenaeus vannamei

mg l for ph tests initial ph values of 3 5 6 7 and 9 were obtained by adjusting media ph using naoh 1 mol l and hcl 1 mol l for temperature assays the culture temperatures were set at 10 15 20 25 or 30 c to assess the impact of salinity on bacterial growth we added nacl to the medium to obtain salinity levels of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 or 40 all media were autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min before using except for glucose media which autoclaved at 115 c for 15 min all single factor experiments were done in triplicate using 5 v v inoculum in 100 ml sterile medium am and dm in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks samples were collected from the am and dm at 12 h and 24 h of the culture respectively and the od600 as well as the concentration of nh4 and no3 were measured 2 6 toxicity test on shrimp toxicity of this strain was evaluated against l vannamei 10 shrimp length 4 cm were placed into each tank containing 20 l of seawater the activated p mosselii 9 1 was added to each tank to a final bacterial density of 107 cfu ml 1 a volume of seawater equal to the bacteria inoculation volume was added into three separate tanks as control toxicity test was done in triplicate the survival rate of the shrimp was evaluated after 7 days there was no water exchange throughout the experiment 2 7 analytical methods and calculations the growth rate of strain 9 1 was determined by determining od600 on a spectrophotometer nanophotometernp80 implen germany the ph value was measured using a mettlertoledos210 ph meter shanghai china nh4 no3 no2 and total nitrogen tn were measured using a cleverchemanna dechem tech gmbh germany nh4 no3 and no2 concentrations in the supernatant were measured after filtration through 0 22 μm pores with syringes the concentration of nh4 was determined following the indophenol blue method the concentration of no2 was determined using diazotization with sulfanilamide which reacts with n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a pink azo dye the concentration of no3 was measured using the cadmium reduction method at 540 nm the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method was utilized to estimate the tn in the culture system data were presented as mean sd one way anova and waller duncan post hoc test p 0 05 were used for statistical analyses on spss version 26 3 results and discussions 3 1 isolation and identification of strain 9 1 we isolated eight strains from enrichment cultures and examined their nitrogen removal capacity of these strain 9 1 which exhibited the highest nitrogen removal capacity was chosen for subsequent analyses strain 9 1 was gram negative and formed circular cream colored semitransparent colonies with smooth surfaces on the bug plate and could utilize several carbon sources see supplementary materials based on 16s rdna sequencing and phenotypic analysis using the biolog technique see supplementary materials strain 9 1 was identified as pseudomonas mosselii p mosselii the partial 16s rdna sequence was submitted to genbank accession number om758095 a phylogenetic tree of p mosselii 9 1 was constructed using the 16s rdna sequences fig 1 3 2 nitrogen removal performance and potential pathways of nitrogen utilization by p mosselii 9 1 strain 9 1 has a genome size of 5 580 199 bp and a gc content of 64 49 which is higher than the mean gc content of pseudomonas 60 75 the genome of p mosselii 9 1 contains 5063 coding genes 72 trna and 1 rrna of the coding genes 5036 99 47 were annotated in the nr family and 2872 56 73 in the kegg family the draft genome data were submitted to genbank accession number jakzgw010000000 ammonium removal performance is shown in fig 2a p mosselii 9 1 directly entered the logarithmic growth phase in the first 18 h of the culture then followed by a decline phase within the first 18 h od600 increased to 1 47 0 08 nh4 levels dramatically declined from 100 mg l to 3 73 3 68 mg l after 18 h up to 98 2 of nh4 was removed with an average removal rate of 5 27 mg l h which is significantly higher in comparison with the nitrifying bacteria previously reported such as pseudomonas stutzeri adp 19 3 44 mg l h 24 and vibrio diabolicus sf16 2 29 mg l h 25 nevertheless the functional genes of oxidizing ammonia to hydroxylamine ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine to nitrite hydroxylamine oxidase hao which involved nitrification were not found in the genome of p mosselii 9 1 indicating the removal of nh4 was not through nitrification on the contrary the glutamine synthetase gene glna k01915 glutamine synthetase gene gltb k01915 glutamate synthase large chain gene gltd k00265 and glutamate dehydrogenase gene gudb k15371 were recognized in this strain the ammonium removal performance joint with the kegg pathway analysis indicated that p mosselii 9 1 might eliminate ammonium through heterotrophic ammonium assimilation via the glutamine synthetase pathway gogat route nh4 2 oxoglutarate atp nadph glutamine adp pi nadp 26 rather than via traditional heterotrophic nitrification similar findings have been reported for paracoccus sp fdn 02 27 after 24 h the od600 decreased slightly while the nh4 concentration gradually increased the detectable nh4 3 26 0 77 mg l after the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth may be attributed to the excretion by dead cells 28 29 interestingly when sodium succinate was added at 48 h the cultures re entered a logarithmic growth phase suggesting that lack of carbon sources may inhibit nitrogen removal by p mosselii 9 1 and the removal of nh4 was closely related to bacterial growth and carbon source consumption the nitrate removal ability of p mosselii 9 1 in dm is shown in fig 2b at 0 24 h the od600 raised to 1 54 0 02 demonstrating a rapid increase in biomass meanwhile the nitrate concentration declined from 100 mg l to 55 28 1 73 mg l the average rate of no3 removal was 1 74 mg l h within 24 h incubation in the analysis of kegg metabolic pathways the functional nitrite reductase gene nirk k00368 and nirbd nirb k00362 nird k00363 were found in p mosselii 9 1 nirk is known to catalyze no2 to gaseous nitrogen through denitrification 2 while nirbd can directly catalyze no2 into nh4 during the dnra process 8 in the current research the no3 reduction pathway in p mosselii 9 1 is probably no3 no2 nh4 and a slight decrease of tn in the culture system when incubating this strain in a dm medium might be attributed to the release of gaseous nitrogen through denitrification fig 2b the presence of both denitrification and nitrate reduction to ammonium pathways for nitrite removal by strain 9 1 indicates that this strain can effectively remove nitrite thereby alleviating its toxicity which might be the reason that no accumulation of intermediate no2 was observed during both ammonium and nitrate removal previous studies declared that dnra usually occurs in anaerobic environments 30 since nrfa a periplasmic nitrite reductase promoters almost completely inhibited during aerobic condition 31 32 nevertheless recently study reported bacteria processes of nirbd a nadh dependent nitrite reductase in the cytoplasm can conduct nitrate reduction to ammonia under aerobic condition 8 the enzyme in the cytoplasm may be less sensitive to o2 and electron transport of aerobic dnra bacteria is different from that of anaerobic bacteria some studies also suggested that dnra can occur under aerobic conditions related to the oxidation of coupled ferrous ions and sulfides 33 in this study all the analyses were done in aerobic conditions our results in line with previous studies showing that dnra bacteria can function in the presence of oxygen additionally upon adding a carbon source at 48 h of the culture nitrate concentration declined modestly along with an increase in od600 although about 50 of the nitrate remained in the medium fig 2b furthermore the organic nitrogen ammonification functional genes urease gene ure and glutaminase gene glsa were found in strain 9 1 fig 3c indicating this strain may also utilize organic nitrogen such as urea or amino acids as nitrogen sources it s speculated that the suppressed nitrate reduction even after the carbon source addition was due to the competitional effect of ammonification depending on the biomass organic nitrogen in the culture system indeed previous findings indicated that denitrification competes with respiratory ammonification 34 hence cells may preferentially undergo ammonification by utilizing organic nitrogen from dead cells as a nitrogen source for growth this could also explain why the p mosselii 9 1 directly entered a decline phase after reaching a peak of od600 without entering a plateau phase during the growth process fig 2 to further determine the effect of ammonium on nitrate transformation by p mosselii 9 1 this strain was cultured in sndm which contained 100 mg l nh4 and 100 mg l no3 and the amount of carbon source was doubled to make the carbon to nitrogen ratio consistent with previous experiments in fig 2a and b the results demonstrated that p mosselii 9 1 preferentially utilized nh4 when no3 and nh4 coexist in the medium fig 2c which is in line with pseudomonas putida y 9 in previous research 8 nh4 concentration decreased dramatically from 100 mg l to 9 91 0 09 mg l within 12 h and to 4 88 0 05 mg l within 24 h while no3 levels decreased slightly this phenomenon indicated that the presence of nh4 in the medium inhibits no3 transformation both assimilation and dissimilation reduction pathways can remove no3 however only the assimilation pathway of no3 can be suppressed by nh4 35 the effect of ammonium on nitrate transformation by strain 9 1 suggested that the primary no3 reduction pathway is assimilatory no3 reduction however there was a slight decrease of no3 when nh4 concentration was low indicating the strain 9 1 may also perform a weak dissimilatory nitrate reduction the potential mechanism underlying nitrogen metabolism by p mosselii 9 1 is summarized in fig 3d extracellular nitrate nitrite and ammonium can be transported intracellularly by specific transporters intracellular nitrate can be converted to nitrite which may then be transformed to gaseous nitrogen via denitrification or to ammonium through the nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway current known nitrogen transforming reactions are often interpreted as separate processes in different nitrogen cycling microorganisms 36 therefore it is essential to identify novel nitrogen metabolic pathways and bacterium with multiple nitrogen metabolic pathways 37 in this study ammonium assimilation nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway denitrification and ammonification coexist in strain p mosselii 9 1 and this strain possesses two nitrite elimination pathways when grown under a high strength ammonium medium 2500 mg l about 24 79 of ammonium 588 33 87 mg l was removed by the p mosselii 9 1 within 24 h and the od600 of strain 9 1 increased to 1 36 0 05 data not shown this showed that strain 9 1 had favorable ammonium resistance li et al discovered that vibrio sp y1 5 tolerated up to 1600 mg l ammonium concentration and removed about 844 6 mg l after 48 h 11 high ammonium tolerance was observed in acinetobacter junii yb which is another nitrifying bacterium 1000 mg l with 10 44 mg l h as the rate of removal 38 high ammonium resistance of p mosselii 9 1 may be related to the ability of ammonium assimilation indicating that heterotrophic assimilation bacteria may be more appropriate for wastewater treatment containing high concentrations of ammonium than the nitrifying bacteria 3 3 impact of different factors on nitrogen removal and growth as illustrated in fig 4 the capacity of nitrogen removal and growth of strain 9 1 under varying carbon sources including sodium succinate ethanol sodium acetate sodium citrate and glucose c n ratio 10 12 15 18 and 20 initial ph 3 5 6 7 and 9 and culture temperature 10 15 20 25 and 30 c were investigated the single factor batch experiments were performed using the am and dm respectively with some modifications the initial nitrogen concentration is 100 mg l the numerical results obtained are shown in supplementary materials the carbon source which provides energy and electrons influences the growth and nitrogen removal ability of microorganisms the nitrogen removal by bacteria grown under organic acids conditions sodium succinate sodium acetate sodium citrate was significantly higher compared with that of bacteria grown under other carbon sources ethanol glucose p 0 05 moreover we observed that the nitrogen removal efficiency was the highest when sodium succinate was utilized as the source of carbon fig 4a and b this might be because sodium succinate is an intermediate product in the tricarboxylic acid cycle this simple and small molecule organic material can enter the metabolic process easily without altering it which has been reported in previous studies 10 24 39 in a summary sodium succinate was employed as the optimal carbon source for p mosselii 9 1 the ratio of c to n is an important factor influencing nitrogen removal efficiency 40 p mosselii 9 1 showed remarkable ammonium removal ability 97 at the c n ratios of 12 15 18 and 20 fig 4c and d the highest reduction of both ammonium and nitrate was observed at a c n ratio of 18 higher than that of other strains reported previously including pseudomonas stutzeri ad 1 c n 15 9 pseudomonas sp dm02 c n 8 41 pseudomonas chloritidismutans k14 c n 10 6 and alcaligenes faecalis strain no 4 c n 7 8 42 indicating this bacterium prefer to live in a carbon rich environment the high demand for organic carbon may be related to its rapid growth rate which implicated its potential application in wastewater with a large c n ratio such as livestock farm wastewater evidence from prior studies has shown that the process of eliminating biological nitrogen is affected by ph data presented in fig 4e and f demonstrated the impact of ph on cell growth and the efficiency of nitrogen removal by strain 9 1 when nh4 was used as a nitrogen source the percentage of nh4 removed was almost 100 under a ph of 6 7 and 9 which was significantly higher compared with other groups p 0 05 in comparison when no3 was utilized as the nitrogen source the optimal ph was 6 7 and 9 unfortunately the nitrogen removal performance was not tested for ph above 9 in this research these outcomes suggested that strain 9 1 functioned better in weakly acidic or alkaline solutions in a previous study bacterial strains msna 1 as well as msd4 showed good nitrogen removal under the ph range of 6 7 and 9 43 this may be ascribed to the observation that higher free ammonia content in a weakly alkaline environment promotes the corresponding enzyme activity 44 considering that majority of bacteria are temperature sensitive we investigated the impact of incubation temperature on nitrogen elimination and cell growth data shown in fig 4g and h demonstrated that ammonium removal rates under 20 to 30 c were higher than in other groups p 0 05 these outcomes showed that a temperature over 20 c is ideal for nitrogen removal in this strain similarly to some hn ad bacteria and aerobic denitrifiers which are mesophiles and nitrate removal is inhibited below 20 c 45 the impact of salinity on the growth of p mosselii 9 1 is demonstrated in supplementary materials notably strain 9 1 exhibited strong adaptability to a saline environment as evidenced by the good growth performance under 5 to 30 this suggested that strain 9 1 can be used for nitrogen removal from brackish water compared with pseudomonas putida np5 46 and acinetobacter sp tac 1 47 p mosselii 9 1 showed good adaptation to higher salinity making it an ideal bacterium for nitrogen removal from freshwater and seawater 3 4 safety test of strain 9 1 toward l vannamei considering that pseudomonas include several opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa which can cause disease and death in aquaculture ecosystems further studies should clarify whether strain 9 1 is safe for in situ aquaculture rearing water treatment in this study inoculation of p mosselii 9 1 resulted in survival percentages similar to control without significant differences p 0 05 with a 96 3 survival rate in the treatment group data not shown compared to a 100 in the control therefore the results demonstrated that p mosselii 9 1 was not toxic to l vannamei and can be used in aquaculture rearing water treatment 4 conclusion this study found that p mosselii 9 1 isolated from shrimp ponds effectively reduced nh4 and no3 while the nh4 and no3 were assimilated directly as nutrients into cells assessing the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway revealed that heterotrophic assimilation dnra pathway and denitrification coexist in this strain additionally this strain can resist high strength ammonium the efficient nitrogen reduction capacity and good adaptability of strain 9 1 make it a good candidate for eliminating nitrogen from actual wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare

effectively removed ammonium and nitrate with 98 of ammonium and 45 of nitrate removed within 24 h moreover p mosselii 9 1 tolerated as high as 2500 mg l of ammonium along with the elimination of approximately 588 mg l of it within 24 h kegg analysis revealed that rather than nitrification p mosselii 9 1 removes ammonium via heterotrophic ammonium assimilation the presence of nirbd and nirk genes implicated reduction to ammonium and aerobic denitrification reduction to gaseous nitrogen as the pathways involved in no2 removal additionally p mosselii 9 1 can transform organic nitrogen to nh3 through ammonification single factor analyses revealed a c n ratio of 18 a temperature of 20 c ph 6 9 and sodium succinate as a source of carbon favored the removal of ammonium and nitrate p mosselii 9 1 may be a promising biotreatment agent for wastewater containing high ammonium levels graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pseudomonas mosselii 9 1 ammonium assimilation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nitrogen metabolic pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nh4 and no3 are common inorganic pollutant in wastewater and biological nitrogen removal bnr is a low cost enhanced efficiency technology for wastewater treatment 1 the conventional biological nitrogen elimination procedure usually contains two sequential steps nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 basically these processes are carried out by a variety of functional microorganisms under aerobic or anoxic conditions 2 in recently years researchers have identified a group of novel bacteria that capable of conducting heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad simultaneously 3 nevertheless conventional biological nitrogen treatments rely on nitrification and denitrification processes have several disadvantages such as low efficiency of multiple step processes high energy cost and greenhouse gas emissions 4 rather than transformation and released into environment nitrogen can also be assimilated by cells since it is an essential element for microorganisms growth many studies have demonstrated that ammonium assimilation nh4 to biomass is an effective way to remove ammonium from wastewater and the biomass could be reused as potential source of microbial fertilizer feedstuffs or industrial raw material 5 recovered into n rich substance could be a sustainable solution for n removal in wastewater treatment and attracted more and more attentions in recently years several heterotrophic ammonium assimilation bacteria haab have been reported such as pseudomonas chloritidismutans k14 6 rhodococcus erythropolis strain y10 7 pseudomonas putida y9 8 and pseudomonas stutzeri ad 1 9 which showed high ammonium removal rates moreover no3 n can also be removed by microbes via nitrate reduction to ammonium reactions 10 which include dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium reaction dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium anra the dnra process indicates the sequential conversion of no3 into no2 and reduces to nh4 while the anra begins by reducing the no3 to nh4 and then it is utilized by the cells to be incorporated into biomolecules 11 gene studies have revealed that the key enzymes involved in the no2 to nh4 conversion are nrfa periplasm and nirbd cytoplasm 12 the nh4 generated from dnra can be subsequently oxidized to no3 by nitrifiers allowing the recycling of n substrates in environments dnra plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles by linking nitrogen oxidation and reduction processes since it can promote algal growth and subsequently improve primary production in oligotrophic oceans and it is considered to be more critical in the turnover of nitrate nitrite in estuarine ecosystems than previously thought 13 15 previous studies are most concentrated on the importance of dnra on nitrogen cycle of marine and estuarine ecosystems few studies have described dnra or anra in wastewater treatment li et al has isolated vibrio sp y1 5 which had excellent nh4 and no3 removal efficiency under aerobic condition n balance experiment revealed the pathway of nitrate removal was assimilatory nitrate reduction 11 sun et al isolated pseudomonas stutzeri t13 for wastewater treatment and it remove nh4 and no3 via ammonium assimilation and aerobic denitrification 16 these studies indicate ammonium assimilation and assimilatory nitrate reduction have potential application value for biological nitrogen removal at present increasing attention has been focused on isolating and identifying functional bacteria which can simultaneously remove nh4 and no3 from wastewater the metabolic pathway and mechanism of simultaneous removal of nh4 and no3 are not fully understood nor the influencing factors affecting the nitrogen removal efficiency of such bacteria understanding the influencing factors of its nitrogen removal process can provide a preliminary basis for subsequent applications in this study pseudomonas mosselii p mosselii 9 1 was isolated from shrimp ponds with high nh4 and no3 removal efficiency and could tolerate high nh4 concentrations a draft genome analysis of p mosselii 9 1 and kegg pathway indicated this bacterium removes no3 and nh4 mainly through assimilatory no3 reduction and ammonium assimilation process nitrogen removal performance and optimal conditions for nh4 and no3 removal were further investigated under aerobic conditions finally an analysis of p mosselii s toxicity against litopenaeus vannamei l vannamei was carried out this study provides a scientific basis for its potential application in bioremediation and biotreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture medium the media em used to

performance and potential pathways of nitrogen utilization by p mosselii 9 1 strain 9 1 has a genome size of 5 580 199 bp and a gc content of 64 49 which is higher than the mean gc content of pseudomonas 60 75 the genome of p mosselii 9 1 contains 5063 coding genes 72 trna and 1 rrna of the coding genes 5036 99 47 were annotated in the nr family and 2872 56 73 in the kegg family the draft genome data were submitted to genbank accession number jakzgw010000000 ammonium removal performance is shown in fig 2a p mosselii 9 1 directly entered the logarithmic growth phase in the first 18 h of the culture then followed by a decline phase within the first 18 h od600 increased to 1 47 0 08 nh4 levels dramatically declined from 100 mg l to 3 73 3 68 mg l after 18 h up to 98 2 of nh4 was removed with an average removal rate of 5 27 mg l h which is significantly higher in comparison with the nitrifying bacteria previously reported such as pseudomonas stutzeri adp 19 3 44 mg l h 24 and vibrio diabolicus sf16 2 29 mg l h 25 nevertheless the functional genes of oxidizing ammonia to hydroxylamine ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine to nitrite hydroxylamine oxidase hao which involved nitrification were not found in the genome of p mosselii 9 1 indicating the removal of nh4 was not through nitrification on the contrary the glutamine synthetase gene glna k01915 glutamine synthetase gene gltb k01915 glutamate synthase large chain gene gltd k00265 and glutamate dehydrogenase gene gudb k15371 were recognized in this strain the ammonium removal performance joint with the kegg pathway analysis indicated that p mosselii 9 1 might eliminate ammonium through heterotrophic ammonium assimilation via the glutamine synthetase pathway gogat route nh4 2 oxoglutarate atp nadph glutamine adp pi nadp 26 rather than via traditional heterotrophic nitrification similar findings have been reported for paracoccus sp fdn 02 27 after 24 h the od600 decreased slightly while the nh4 concentration gradually increased the detectable nh4 3 26 0 77 mg l after the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth may be attributed to the excretion by dead cells 28 29 interestingly when sodium succinate was added at 48 h the cultures re entered a logarithmic growth phase suggesting that lack of carbon sources may inhibit nitrogen removal by p mosselii 9 1 and the removal of nh4 was closely related to bacterial growth and carbon source consumption the nitrate removal ability of p mosselii 9 1 in dm is shown in fig 2b at 0 24 h the od600 raised to 1 54 0 02 demonstrating a rapid increase in biomass meanwhile the nitrate concentration declined from 100 mg l to 55 28 1 73 mg l the average rate of no3 removal was 1 74 mg l h within 24 h incubation in the analysis of kegg metabolic pathways the functional nitrite reductase gene nirk k00368 and nirbd nirb k00362 nird k00363 were found in p mosselii 9 1 nirk is known to catalyze no2 to gaseous nitrogen through denitrification 2 while nirbd can directly catalyze no2 into nh4 during the dnra process 8 in the current research the no3 reduction pathway in p mosselii 9 1 is probably no3 no2 nh4 and a slight decrease of tn in the culture system when incubating this strain in a dm medium might be attributed to the release of gaseous nitrogen through denitrification fig 2b the presence of both denitrification and nitrate reduction to ammonium pathways for nitrite removal by strain 9 1 indicates that this strain can effectively remove nitrite thereby alleviating its toxicity which might be the reason that no accumulation of intermediate no2 was observed during both ammonium and nitrate removal previous studies declared that dnra usually occurs in anaerobic environments 30 since nrfa a periplasmic nitrite reductase promoters almost completely inhibited during aerobic condition 31 32 nevertheless recently study reported bacteria processes of nirbd a nadh dependent nitrite reductase in the cytoplasm can conduct nitrate reduction to ammonia under aerobic condition 8 the enzyme in the cytoplasm may be less sensitive to o2 and electron transport of aerobic dnra bacteria is different from that of anaerobic bacteria some studies also suggested that dnra can occur under aerobic conditions related to the oxidation of coupled ferrous ions and sulfides 33 in this study all the analyses were done in aerobic conditions our results in line with previous studies showing that dnra bacteria can function in the presence of oxygen additionally upon adding a carbon source at 48 h of the culture nitrate concentration declined modestly along with an increase in od600 although about 50 of the nitrate remained in the medium fig 2b furthermore the organic nitrogen ammonification functional genes urease gene ure and glutaminase gene glsa were found in strain 9 1 fig 3c indicating this strain may also utilize organic nitrogen such as urea or amino acids as nitrogen sources it s speculated that the suppressed nitrate reduction even after the carbon source addition was due to the competitional effect of ammonification depending on the biomass organic nitrogen in the culture system indeed previous findings indicated that denitrification competes with respiratory ammonification 34 hence cells may preferentially undergo ammonification by utilizing organic nitrogen from dead cells as a nitrogen source for growth this could also explain why the p mosselii 9 1 directly entered a decline phase after reaching a peak of od600 without entering a plateau phase during the growth process fig 2 to further determine the effect of ammonium on nitrate transformation by p mosselii 9 1 this strain was cultured in sndm which contained 100 mg l nh4 and 100 mg l no3 and the amount of carbon source was doubled to make the carbon to nitrogen ratio consistent with previous experiments in fig 2a and b the results demonstrated that p mosselii 9 1 preferentially utilized nh4 when no3 and nh4 coexist in the medium fig 2c which is in line with pseudomonas putida y 9 in previous research 8 nh4 concentration decreased dramatically from 100 mg l to 9 91 0 09 mg l within 12 h and to 4 88 0 05 mg l within 24 h while no3 levels decreased slightly this phenomenon indicated that the presence of nh4 in the medium inhibits no3 transformation both assimilation and dissimilation reduction pathways can remove no3 however only the assimilation pathway of no3 can be suppressed by nh4 35 the effect of ammonium on nitrate transformation by strain 9 1 suggested that the primary no3 reduction pathway is assimilatory no3 reduction however there was a slight decrease of no3 when nh4 concentration was low indicating the strain 9 1 may also perform a weak dissimilatory nitrate reduction the potential mechanism underlying nitrogen metabolism by p mosselii 9 1 is summarized in fig 3d extracellular nitrate nitrite and ammonium can be transported intracellularly by specific transporters intracellular nitrate can be converted to nitrite which may then be transformed to gaseous nitrogen via denitrification or to ammonium through the nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway current known nitrogen transforming reactions are often interpreted as separate processes in different nitrogen cycling microorganisms 36 therefore it is essential to identify novel nitrogen metabolic pathways and bacterium with multiple nitrogen metabolic pathways 37 in this study ammonium assimilation nitrate reduction to ammonium pathway denitrification and ammonification coexist in strain p mosselii 9 1 and this strain possesses two nitrite elimination pathways when grown under a high strength ammonium medium 2500 mg l about 24 79 of ammonium 588 33 87 mg l was removed by the p mosselii 9 1 within 24 h and the od600 of strain 9 1 increased to 1 36 0 05 data not shown this showed that strain 9 1 had favorable ammonium resistance li et al discovered that vibrio sp y1 5 tolerated up to 1600 mg l ammonium concentration and removed about 844 6 mg l after 48 h 11 high ammonium tolerance was observed in acinetobacter junii yb which is another nitrifying bacterium 1000 mg l with 10 44 mg l h as the rate of removal 38 high ammonium resistance of p mosselii 9 1 may be related to the ability of ammonium assimilation indicating that heterotrophic assimilation bacteria may be more appropriate for wastewater treatment containing high concentrations of ammonium than the nitrifying bacteria 3 3 impact of different factors on nitrogen removal and growth as illustrated in fig 4 the capacity of nitrogen removal and growth of strain 9 1 under varying carbon sources including sodium succinate ethanol sodium acetate sodium citrate and glucose c n ratio 10 12 15 18 and 20 initial ph 3 5 6 7 and 9 and culture temperature 10 15 20 25 and 30 c were investigated the single factor batch experiments were performed using the am and dm respectively with some modifications the initial nitrogen concentration is 100 mg l the numerical results obtained are shown in supplementary materials the carbon source which provides energy and electrons influences the growth and nitrogen removal ability of microorganisms the nitrogen removal by bacteria grown under organic acids conditions sodium succinate sodium acetate sodium citrate was significantly higher compared with that of bacteria grown under other carbon sources ethanol glucose p 0 05 moreover we observed that the nitrogen removal efficiency was the highest when sodium succinate was utilized as the source of carbon fig 4a and b this might be because sodium succinate is an intermediate product in the tricarboxylic acid cycle this simple and small molecule organic material can enter the metabolic process easily without altering it which has been reported in previous studies 10 24 39 in a summary sodium succinate was employed as the optimal carbon source for p mosselii 9 1 the ratio of c to n is an important factor influencing nitrogen removal efficiency 40 p mosselii 9 1 showed remarkable ammonium removal ability 97 at the c n ratios of 12 15 18 and 20 fig 4c and d the highest reduction of both ammonium and nitrate was observed at a c n ratio of 18 higher than that of other strains reported previously including pseudomonas stutzeri ad 1 c n 15 9 pseudomonas sp dm02 c n 8 41 pseudomonas chloritidismutans k14 c n 10 6 and alcaligenes faecalis strain no 4 c n 7 8 42 indicating this bacterium prefer to live in a carbon rich environment the high demand for organic carbon may be related to its rapid growth rate which implicated its potential application in wastewater with a large c n ratio such as livestock farm wastewater evidence from prior studies has shown that the process of eliminating biological nitrogen is affected by ph data presented in fig 4e and f demonstrated the impact of ph on cell growth and the efficiency of nitrogen removal by strain 9 1 when nh4 was used as a nitrogen source the percentage of nh4 removed was almost 100 under a ph of 6 7 and 9 which was significantly higher compared with other groups p 0 05 in comparison when no3 was utilized as the nitrogen source the optimal ph was 6 7 and 9 unfortunately the nitrogen removal performance was not tested for ph above 9 in this research these outcomes suggested that strain 9 1 functioned better in weakly acidic or alkaline solutions in a previous study bacterial strains msna 1 as well as msd4 showed good nitrogen removal under the ph range of 6 7 and 9 43 this may be ascribed to the observation that higher free ammonia content in a weakly alkaline environment promotes the corresponding enzyme activity 44 considering that majority of bacteria are temperature sensitive we investigated the impact of incubation temperature on nitrogen elimination and cell growth data shown in fig 4g and h demonstrated that ammonium removal rates under 20 to 30 c were higher than in other groups p 0 05 these outcomes showed that a temperature over 20 c is ideal for nitrogen removal in this strain similarly to some hn ad bacteria and aerobic denitrifiers which are mesophiles and nitrate removal is inhibited below 20 c 45 the impact of salinity on the growth of p mosselii 9 1 is demonstrated in supplementary materials notably strain 9 1 exhibited strong adaptability to a saline environment as evidenced by the good growth performance under 5 to 30 this suggested that strain 9 1 can be used for nitrogen removal from brackish water compared with pseudomonas putida np5 46 and acinetobacter sp tac 1 47 p mosselii 9 1 showed good adaptation to higher salinity making it an ideal bacterium for nitrogen removal from freshwater and seawater 3 4 safety test of strain 9 1 toward l vannamei considering that pseudomonas include several opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa which can cause disease and death in aquaculture ecosystems further studies should clarify whether strain 9 1 is safe for in situ aquaculture rearing water treatment in this study inoculation of p mosselii 9 1 resulted in survival percentages similar to control without significant differences p 0 05 with a 96 3 survival rate in the treatment group data not shown compared to a 100 in the control therefore the results demonstrated that p mosselii 9 1 was not toxic to l vannamei and can be used in aquaculture rearing water treatment 4 conclusion this study found that p mosselii 9 1 isolated from shrimp ponds effectively reduced nh4 and no3 while the nh4 and no3 were assimilated directly as nutrients into cells assessing the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway revealed that heterotrophic assimilation dnra pathway and denitrification coexist in this strain additionally this strain can resist high strength ammonium the efficient nitrogen reduction capacity and good adaptability of strain 9 1 make it a good candidate for eliminating nitrogen from actual wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12547,a tertiary treatment of the effluent received from five tunisian wastewater treatment plants is implemented at gda sidi amor for reuse in an aquaponic system it includes a mbbr a constructed wetland sand and activated carbon filters and a combined nanofiltration and reverse osmosis desalination system the results show that the post treatment before desalination reduces the cod by 44 which is mostly refractory the orthophosphate by 33 and the ammonia by 95 6 the nf90 4040 removes 2 3 of the salts and micropollutants except for sodium chloride and nitrate which are respectively 57 45 39 the micropollutants benzotriazole and clarithromycin were removed by 17 and 8 respectively the optimum pressure for a conversion rate of around 80 is 4 7 bar for the cold period and 7 bar for the summer period depending on water salinity and membrane fouling after one year membrane permeability decreases after cleaning the conversion rate increases to 89 at 5 2 bars and the hydraulic permeability increases by 39 using the hybrid system nf ro at 10 bars for ro bw30 4040 the amount of brine was reduced by 65 and the permeate quality is improved after five months the total fish weight increases by 21 kg and the crops grow well keywords tertiary treatment nanofiltration membrane selectivity fouling aquaponic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in tunisia the agricultural sector is highly dependent on water resources since it accounts for 80 of the total water use in the country 1 however the per capita water availability is around 400 m3 per year and this value will decrease to 350 m3 in 2030 which is lower compared to the required universal threshold of 1000 m3 the reuse of non conventional water resources such as desalinated seawater and wastewater is beneficial to satisfy the growing water requirements and remediating water scarcity the other solution to preserve water is using an aquaponic system for crop cultivation aquaponic lets farmers use up to 80 less water than normal ground based farming 2 this system combines plants with fish production and as a consequence it has special micro and macro elements which should be available in water and optimal water quality is required for a healthy system 3 the source of water used in an aquaponic system can significantly affect the water quality a few research works 4 5 are interested in using treated wastewater in an aquaponic system a bliedung et al 4 implemented a hydroponic pilot plant with treated wastewater for lettuce production the water treatment steps comprise an activated sludge process an expanded granular sludge bed reactor ozonation biological activated carbon filtration and aquaponic a patil 5 used secondary treated sewage wastewater as a water resource the water treatment covers segregation grit removal settling extended aeration activated sludge process settling and chlorination before reusing tunisia has 122 wastewater treatment plants that produce 284 million m3 of tww annually of which 13 million m3 is reused for irrigation on 2734 ha of agricultural land 6 wastewater effluent is treated to secondary levels and the common treatment process is activated sludge processes 85 the quality of treated wastewater is mostly medium and needs tertiary treatment for this reason a bilateral project between tunisia and germany was set up in 2020 waterretune to improve the effluent quality the tertiary treatment process includes a nature based solution nbs an aerated mbbr and a nf desalination process for a cycle based aquaponic production the whole system is constructed supervised and the operations conditions are optimized 2 materials and methods 2 1 tertiary treatment of wastewater process

commun phragmitis and fed with a pulse system 127 each 28 min then the cw effluent is filtered by the sand and activated carbon filters due to the high salinity of tunisian wastewater compared to the value required for horticulture a desalination system is installed which is composed of two parallel nf 904040 membranes with an area of 7 6 m2 for each the brine of nanofiltration nf was treated by reverse osmosis bw 304040 through an area of 7 6 m2 too the permeate is sent to the aquaponic system from two storage tanks the tww reusing system contains two fish tanks 1m3 for each a settler 1 m3

fouling 0 1 sodium hydroxide solution was used for alkaline cleaning ph 11 12 and 0 2 hydrochloric acid solution with ph ranges from 2 to 3 was used for acid cleaning the time limit for these cleaning solution recirculation is 1 h the membrane soak time is 2 h after each cleaning step the membrane was rinsed to restore the initial water feed ph and conductivity 2 6 nf brine amount reduction by the hybrid system and permeate improvement quality a second stage ro bw30 4040 was used for brine treatment the ro product water was sent to the same tank of nf permeate and the blended permeate from nf and ro was used to feed the aquaponic system samples were taken from brine nf permeate ro and brine ro for analyses as well as operations conditions have been recorded 3 results and discussions 3 1 the efficiency of pretreatment of nf desalination system for water reuse as shown in table 1 a medium value of cod removal rate is obtained with the addition of mbbr and filtration process 44 26 64 sometimes the received water is not fresh due to the high residence time in the maturation ponds at the gda pilot site that s why the biodegradable fraction of cod has been treated the analysis of the biodegradability aptitude of nf feed water by lc ocd system table 2 proved that the water is biologically very well depleted therefore the water hardly differs from natural surface water the total doc can be addressed as refractory except the biopolymers which are still detectable as a by product of microbial activity even after this activity has ceased the removal rate of orthophosphate is 33 64 26 64 this amount can be considered acceptable because the process that has been used mbbr and cw works in aerobic conditions and the dephosphatation needs anaerobic conditions in the first step good nitrification is obtained by mbbr 95 6 of ammonia is removed and nitrogen is increased from 3 to 43 mg l therefore the nitrate can be utilized as a fertilizer for crops the obtained results respond to the restrictions of water reuse in an aquaponic system for cod the nanofiltration will improve the removal rate 3 2 salinity evolution of treated wastewater receives at gda sidi amor pilot unit during one year the range of the treated wastewater temperature is between 9 3 c and 32 1 c the water conductivity at temperature t varies between 2 69 and 4 8 ms cm fig 2 the conductivity at 20 c varies between 2 61 and 4 11 ms cm the higher temperature in the summer increases the water evaporation and the salts are more concentrated however in winter the treated wastewater is diluted by rainwater the wastewater reuse in the aquaponic system needs some restrictions for nitrogen compounds as well as for water salinity because the soilless cultivation of crops such as vegetables requires a low ec d kalaivanan et al 8 recommended an ec level between 1 5 and 2 5 ms cm for soilless culture they concluded that the higher ec would not allow nutrient absorption due to osmotic pressure and lower ec severely affects plant health and yield the higher water conductivities recorded at the inlet of the pilot unit at the gda site can affect the crop growth rates to reduce the negative impact of water salinity on crop yield growth nf desalination is applied 3 3 optimization of operation condition for nanofiltration desalination system of treated wastewater 3 3 1 effect of salinity temperature and pressure on nf product water conversion rate two periods have been studied cold autumn winter and spring and hot summer the selection has been based on feed water salinity and quality as well as temperature for the first period fig 3 a the medium feed flow rate was 244 l h the conversion rate increases from 29 at 2 bars to 80 at 4 77 bars the increase of conductivity from 2 66 to 3 55 ms cm and the decrease of temperature from 20 9 to 9 3 c decreased the conversion rate from 67 to 60 at 3 5 bars in the cold period for the second period fig 3 b the water salinity and temperature were higher than in the period from october 2021 to may 2022 15 of the conversion rate was obtained at 1 67 bars and 85 for 7 bars at 4 5 bars and a conductivity of 3 5 ms cm the conversion rate was 62 for the hot period and 77 for the cold period that means that the variability of conversion rate between the two periods was linked here primarily to the water feed quality essentially to organic matter not salinity and temperature the optimum pressure was 4 bars for the first period and 7 bars for the second for a conversion rate near 80 the variability of feed nf water quality was related to the higher temperature 30 c as well as the discontinuity of fed water because of the maintenance and renewal of the upstream treatment processes thus it s concluded that the nf is effective in getting a higher conversion rate at low pressure and less energy in contrast of the reverse osmosis current results were vindicated by other research work 9 that concluded that permeate flux increases when the temperature increases because the high temperature reduces the water viscosity and the level of concentration polarization however if there is fouling the flux will decline despite an increase in temperature feed characteristic significantly affects membrane performance which is related to chemical structure ph charge geometry and hydrophilicity of solute the possibility of nf membrane fouling in this study in the summer period can be related to the high colloidal transparent exopolymer particles ctep content table 2 3 3 2 effect of salinity temperature and pressure on nf membrane selectivity as shown in fig 3 c and d for the first period the retention rate of ec by nf 90 membrane varies between 60 and 69 for the ec 2 66 ms cm and a pressure range between 3 4 and 4 7 bar the increase of feed nf water ec to 3 5 ms cm at 9 3 c decreases the selectivity of the membrane from 69 to 58 at 4 7 bars in the second period for the same salinity 3 5 ms cm and a temperature of 29 5 c the ec retention rate was 50 at 4 7 bars and 55 at 7 bars these results are in line with the work of r yagnaseni and j h lienhard 10 who indicated that the increase in pore size net path length through the membrane selective layer and negative membrane charge due to high temperature the increase in ion diffusivity contributes significantly to the increase in permeate concentration 3 3 3 hydraulic permeability and flux permeate variability of nf 904040 for different operation conditions to minimize the interaction between temperature and salinity the conductivity at 20 c is used as illustrated in fig 4a for the cold period medium t 15 c the hydraulic permeability of nf 90 membrane fed by treated wastewater is between 2 91 and 1 96 l h m2 bar for the range of ec 20 c between 2 58 and 5 11 ms cm the increase of conductivity by 2 53 ms cm decreases the hydraulic permeability by 32 6 in the hot period 30 c the same parameter decreases from 2 27 to 1 86 l h m2 bar after a decrease of conductivity by 0 57 ms cm fig 4 b for the same salinity level the increase of temperature by 15 c decreases the permeability by 24 however the increase in temperature leads to an increase in the permeate flux because of the decrease in water viscosity the results confirm the hypothesis of membrane fouling in the summer period compared to the literature results generally authors calculated the pure water permeability of nf 90 membranes variables deduced values were recorded 6 98 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure between 5 and 25 bars 11 4 09 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure between 10 and 40 bars 12 7 31 l h m2 bar simulated by rosa software 13 and 4 6 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure 10 40 bars 14 to ensure the hydraulic permeability of nf by using treated wastewater a premachandra et al 15 collected three industrial wastewater samples from a treatment facility that receives wastewater from approximately 100 different clients from chemical food automotive and other industries the medium cod of the three samples are respectively 1000 mg l 2300 mg l and 2500 mg l the nf hydraulic permeability obtained after post exposure by wastewater was between 2 and 4 5 l m2 h bar for the first around 2 l m2 h bar for the second and between 1 5 and 2 for the third case in conclusion the permeability of membranes depends strong on the composition of water especially the organic load and the aptitude for fouling of the membrane the current results are in accordance with the experiment carried out with treated wastewater due to the fouling of the membrane its efficiency is decreased and an alkaline acid alkaline rinsing was done on october 28 2022 the average value of hydraulic permeability was 2 59 0 12 l h m2 bar after membrane cleaning fig 5 it increases by 39 compared to the last value obtained for the same conditions after membrane cleaning the maximum conversion rate fig 6 a is 89 1 11 at 6 53 bar 0 09 3 5ms cm for ec 20 c and a temperature of 27 1 c and the ec retention rate was 58 fig 6 b at 5 2 bar 3 3 4 quality of nf permeate and restrictions for water reuse in an aquaponic system 3 3 4 1 salt selectivity of nf90 4040 membrane the conductivities of nf permeate recorded at different periods during 2021 2022 fig 7 were under the required value for an aquaponic system 2 5 ms cm at 20 c 8 however a precaution should be taken into account for higher salinity like in the summer increasing pressure improves the permeate quality after membrane cleaning the permeate quality is improved and the permeate conductivity at 20 c decreases from 1 77 ms cm to 1 48 ms cm for an applied pressure of 5 2 bars and feed water ec 20 c of 3 5 ms cm as shown in table 3 the cod removal rate by nf 90 membrane was around 74 in the cold period and 52 in the hot period a premachandra et al 15 compared four nf membranes and three multi sourced industrial wastewater and they concluded that the best cod removal was attained by the nf90 membrane but they showed also that the compositional difference between samples significantly influenced the cod reduction rate the selectivity of the membrane regarding bivalent ions is 71 for sulfate and 68 for calcium and magnesium less membrane selectivity of nf 90 membrane was obtained for monovalent ions compared to bivalent ions 36 54 for sodium 51 61 for potassium 52 61 for chloride 62 for bicarbonate and 33 46 for nitrate m rajca et al 16 investigated the desalination of geothermal water by employing nanofiltration and they concluded that only 10 50 of single valent ions were removed and that the nf90 membrane was better than the nf270 for hardness removal s jafarinejad 17 reported that only 20 39 of chloride was removed by nf 90 fed by petroleum oil wastewater pretreated by a sand filter with an initial concentration of chloride in the range of 225 760 mg l however they showed that 95 98 of sulfate was retained due to the high molecular weight sieving separation mechanisms and charge effects m m emanjomeh et al 18 studied the interaction between ions and their effects on the removal rate of bivalent and monovalent ions and they concluded that a less removal rate at 4 bar was obtained for nitrate 44 it was in accordance with the current result they observed that the nitrate removal rate is significantly affected by the influent water quality if the sulfate content is high and the monovalent ions are low the removal rate of nitrate decreases and if the hardness of water is high and sulfate content is low the nitrate selectivity of nf90 increases the most harmful ions in the aquaponic system are sodium and chloride because they affect plant growth the sodium content in the permeate is 148 04 27 52 in the cold period and 301 3 31 9 in the hot period for the chloride content it is 216 30 99 44 mg l for the first period and 698 16 134 4 mg l for the second period the increase of these ions content was linked to the nf feed water quality variation function of the temperature and received water quality on the whole system according to i gjesteland 19 the toxicity of sodium content increased when it was higher than 100 mg l and it was severe for a concentration 230 mg l for chloride content in the range between 178 and 355 mg l with this type of water it s possible to cultivate only moderately sensitive crops and for the range between 355 and 710 mg l only salt tolerant crops can be planted in aquaponic systems in conclusion the water feed discontinuity of the current tertiary treatment process and the higher temperature had a bad effect on the performance of processes as well as the permeate water quality for the second period the nf permeate was diluted by ro permeate from the second stage of the hybrid system to decrease the ions content before its reuse in the aquaponic system 3 3 4 2 micropollutants selectivity of nf90 4040 membrane micropollutant removal rates have been investigated under a pressure of 5 2 bars a conversion rate of 80 and a ph of 7 5 table 4 higher selectivity is obtained for carbamazepine and metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac 69 70 and 74 respectively however the removal rates of benzotriazole and clarithromycin are lower 17 and 8 respectively s ebrahimzadeh et al 20 have studied the retention rate of micropollutants by ro espa3 and they have concluded that neutral and hydrophilic compound has a lower retention rate however the anionic micropollutant has a higher retention rate carbamazepine is known as neutral and hydrophobic but benzotriazole is neutral and hydrophilic and the removal rate obtained by ro was 15 6 for this last compound around the value obtained in this research work by nf 90 17 diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole are known as anionic for this reason they have the best retention rate k wu et al 21 carried out an experiment on photodegradation by microalgae to remove clarithromycin and benzotriazole and they obtained good results but they observed that the mixture of micropollutants had an adverse effect on its degradation r xu et al 22 investigated the removal efficiencies of the nf pilot scale to 49 micropollutants under different conditions and they concluded that the charge the molecular weight the water temperature and the conversion rate have an effect on their removal rates kp m licorna et al 23 evaluated the removal rate of five inflammatory substances drugs by nf 90 and a higher rejection rate was obtained over 88 at 20 bar and ph 5 they concluded that lower rejection rates were observed with hydrophilic compounds due to the adsorption diffusion mechanisms 3 3 5 hybrid system nf ro contribution to brine valorization and permeate quality improvement in the summer period 82 of the conversion rate is obtained at 7 bars with an average conductivity at 30 c of permeate 2 21 ms cm 0 33 fig 8 9 the value of produced water conductivity is around the limit value tolerated in the aquaponic system the chloride and sodium contents increase and they can have a toxic effect on the plants the nf desalination generates 1 m3 d of brine with an average conductivity of 6 67 ms cm for the same period to dilute the nf permeate and reduce the brine amount reverse osmosis is used as a second stage for nf brine treatment the conversion rate of ro at 10 bars was 75 6 7 with a conductivity of 0 91ms cm 0 21 and it is between 94 and 96 5 for the hybrid nf ro desalination system fig 8 9 the 4 5 brine generated by ro is reused for halophyte irrigation to minimize the environmental impact of the sewer discharge of the brine compared to the literature m a hafiz et al 24 simulated a hybrid nf fo ro process for the supply of irrigation water and they concluded that the addition of forward osmosis fo as an intermediate process in the second stage decreased the energy consumption by 27 and the permeate water quality response to the restrictions for food crops irrigation a garsallahah et al 25 compared an uf ro an uf nf and a nf ro hybrid systems for the treatment and reuse of biologically pretreated real textile wastewater and they observed that nf ro desalination system achieved high separation performances at 8 bars and 10 bars for nf and ro respectively however with the addition of uf at 3 bars the transmembrane pressure decreased by 2 bar for both nf and ro system and the conversion rate increased by 36 and 29 respectively after reusing nf permeate or the blend nf ro permeate for aquaponic feeding the total fish weight increases from 4 25 kg and 6 5 kg to 12 8 kg and 19 1 kg in tank one and tank two respectively during five months fig 10a and different crops are cultivated in the aquaponic system using with a considerable growth rate fig 10b 4 conclusion experimental results show the efficiency of nf to reduce the water salinity and organic matter to a suitable level for reuse in the aquaponic system with less consumption energy compared to reverse osmosis a high conversion rate of 89 at 6 5 bar is obtained for the high salinity recorded during the period 2021 2022 however a membrane cleaning is required in case of high temperature which increases the water salinity due to evaporation and has an effect on the membrane performance continuous feeding of the whole system was necessary to avoid the failure of pretreatment and membrane biofouling the hybrid desalination system nf ro reduces the amount of brine by 65 and improves the permeate quality by diluting the water salinity and toxic ions contents sodium and chloride nanofiltration facilitates the removal of 2 3 of organic micropollutants identified as neutral and hydrophobic anionic and cationic however a low removal rate is obtained by nf from neutral and hydrophilic pharmaceutical compounds the comparison of the current pretreatment of the desalination unit with coagulation flocculation and ultrafiltration is the perspective of this work economic

12547,a tertiary treatment of the effluent received from five tunisian wastewater treatment plants is implemented at gda sidi amor for reuse in an aquaponic system it includes a mbbr a constructed wetland sand and activated carbon filters and a combined nanofiltration and reverse osmosis desalination system the results show that the post treatment before desalination reduces the cod by 44 which is mostly refractory the orthophosphate by 33 and the ammonia by 95 6 the nf90 4040 removes 2 3 of the salts and micropollutants except for sodium chloride and nitrate which are respectively 57 45 39 the micropollutants benzotriazole and clarithromycin were removed by 17 and 8 respectively the optimum pressure for a conversion rate of around 80 is 4 7 bar for the cold period and 7 bar for the summer period depending on water salinity and membrane fouling after one year membrane permeability decreases after cleaning the conversion rate increases to 89 at 5 2 bars and the hydraulic permeability increases by 39 using the hybrid system nf ro at 10 bars for ro bw30 4040 the amount of brine was reduced by 65 and the permeate quality is improved after five months the total fish weight increases by 21 kg and the crops grow well keywords tertiary treatment nanofiltration membrane selectivity fouling aquaponic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in tunisia the agricultural sector is highly dependent on water resources since it accounts for 80 of the total water use in the country 1 however the per capita water availability is around 400 m3 per year and this value will decrease to 350 m3 in 2030 which is lower compared to the required universal threshold of 1000 m3 the reuse of non conventional water resources such as desalinated seawater and wastewater is beneficial to satisfy the growing water requirements and remediating water scarcity the other solution to preserve water is using an aquaponic system for crop cultivation aquaponic lets farmers use up to 80 less water than normal ground based farming 2 this system combines plants with fish production and as a consequence it has special micro and macro elements which should be available in water and optimal water quality is required for a healthy system 3 the source of water used in an aquaponic system can significantly affect the water quality a few research works 4 5 are interested in using treated wastewater in an aquaponic system a bliedung et al 4 implemented a hydroponic pilot plant with treated wastewater for lettuce production the water treatment steps comprise an activated sludge process an expanded granular sludge bed reactor ozonation biological activated carbon filtration and aquaponic a patil 5 used secondary treated sewage wastewater as a water resource the water treatment covers segregation grit removal settling extended aeration activated sludge process settling and chlorination before reusing tunisia has 122 wastewater treatment plants that produce 284 million m3 of tww annually of which 13 million m3 is reused for irrigation on 2734 ha of agricultural land 6 wastewater effluent is treated to secondary levels and the common treatment process is activated sludge processes 85 the quality of treated wastewater is mostly medium and needs tertiary treatment for this reason a bilateral project between tunisia and germany was set up in 2020 waterretune to improve the effluent quality the tertiary treatment process includes a nature based solution nbs an aerated mbbr and a nf desalination process for a cycle based aquaponic production the whole system is constructed supervised and the operations conditions are optimized 2 materials and methods 2 1 tertiary treatment of wastewater process implemented at gda sidi amor based on the experiments of different partners of the waterretune project in germany and tunisia fiw terra urbana certe and adj various tertiary treatment processes for secondary effluent are suggested before reusing in the aquaponic system as illustrated in fig 1 secondary effluent is received from five wastewater treatment plants that use activated sludge namely charguia choutrana 1 and 2 raoued and northern of tunis the design flow rate is 10 m3 d the tertiary wastewater treatment involves a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with a volume of 1 m3 and is filled with 40 of pearl euv materials density 0 92 0 98 g cm3 and real area 600 m2 m3 the second process is the vertical constructed wetland cw 22 m3 where two types of crops are grown juncus maritimus and commun phragmitis and fed with a pulse system 127 each 28 min then the cw effluent is filtered by the sand and activated carbon filters due to the high salinity of tunisian wastewater compared to the value required for horticulture a desalination system is installed which is composed of two parallel nf 904040 membranes with an area of 7 6 m2 for each the brine of nanofiltration nf was treated by reverse osmosis bw 304040 through an area of 7 6 m2 too the permeate is sent to the aquaponic system from two storage tanks the tww reusing system contains two fish tanks 1m3 for each a settler 1 m3 an mbbr and three systems for crops cultivation a deep well culture dwc with a volume of around 3 m3 four grow bed gb filled with baked clay and a nutrient film techniques nft 2 2 diagnosis and efficiency control of the tertiary treatment water process after the implementation of the whole system of tww tertiary treatment and aquaponic at gda sidi amor on october 26 2021 the system was

done according to the protocol described by j rodier et al 7 for micropollutants analysis a sample was taken by fiw on november 10 2022 using glass bottles and the analysis was carried out by the environmental analysis laboratory of the institute for urban water management of the rwth aachen university the benzotriazole carbamazepine clarithromycin diclofenac metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole

fouling 0 1 sodium hydroxide solution was used for alkaline cleaning ph 11 12 and 0 2 hydrochloric acid solution with ph ranges from 2 to 3 was used for acid cleaning the time limit for these cleaning solution recirculation is 1 h the membrane soak time is 2 h after each cleaning step the membrane was rinsed to restore the initial water feed ph and conductivity 2 6 nf brine amount reduction by the hybrid system and permeate improvement quality a second stage ro bw30 4040 was used for brine treatment the ro product water was sent to the same tank of nf permeate and the blended permeate from nf and ro was used to feed the aquaponic system samples were taken from brine nf permeate ro and brine ro for analyses as well as operations conditions have been recorded 3 results and discussions 3 1 the efficiency of pretreatment of nf desalination system for water reuse as shown in table 1 a medium value of cod removal rate is obtained with the addition of mbbr and filtration process 44 26 64 sometimes the received water is not fresh due to the high residence time in the maturation ponds at the gda pilot site that s why the biodegradable fraction of cod has been treated the analysis of the biodegradability aptitude of nf feed water by lc ocd system table 2 proved that the water is biologically very well depleted therefore the water hardly differs from natural surface water the total doc can be addressed as refractory except the biopolymers which are still detectable as a by product of microbial activity even after this activity has ceased the removal rate of orthophosphate is 33 64 26 64 this amount can be considered acceptable because the process that has been used mbbr and cw works in aerobic conditions and the dephosphatation needs anaerobic conditions in the first step good nitrification is obtained by mbbr 95 6 of ammonia is removed and nitrogen is increased from 3 to 43 mg l therefore the nitrate can be utilized as a fertilizer for crops the obtained results respond to the restrictions of water reuse in an aquaponic system for cod the nanofiltration will improve the removal rate 3 2 salinity evolution of treated wastewater receives at gda sidi amor pilot unit during one year the range of the treated wastewater temperature is between 9 3 c and 32 1 c the water conductivity at temperature t varies between 2 69 and 4 8 ms cm fig 2 the conductivity at 20 c varies between 2 61 and 4 11 ms cm the higher temperature in the summer increases the water evaporation and the salts are more concentrated however in winter the treated wastewater is diluted by rainwater the wastewater reuse in the aquaponic system needs some restrictions for nitrogen compounds as well as for water salinity because the soilless cultivation of crops such as vegetables requires a low ec d kalaivanan et al 8 recommended an ec level between 1 5 and 2 5 ms cm for soilless culture they concluded that the higher ec would not allow nutrient absorption due to osmotic pressure and lower ec severely affects plant health and yield the higher water conductivities recorded at the inlet of the pilot unit at the gda site can affect the crop growth rates to reduce the negative impact of water salinity on crop yield growth nf desalination is applied 3 3 optimization of operation condition for nanofiltration desalination system of treated wastewater 3 3 1 effect of salinity temperature and pressure on nf product water conversion rate two periods have been studied cold autumn winter and spring and hot summer the selection has been based on feed water salinity and quality as well as temperature for the first period fig 3 a the medium feed flow rate was 244 l h the conversion rate increases from 29 at 2 bars to 80 at 4 77 bars the increase of conductivity from 2 66 to 3 55 ms cm and the decrease of temperature from 20 9 to 9 3 c decreased the conversion rate from 67 to 60 at 3 5 bars in the cold period for the second period fig 3 b the water salinity and temperature were higher than in the period from october 2021 to may 2022 15 of the conversion rate was obtained at 1 67 bars and 85 for 7 bars at 4 5 bars and a conductivity of 3 5 ms cm the conversion rate was 62 for the hot period and 77 for the cold period that means that the variability of conversion rate between the two periods was linked here primarily to the water feed quality essentially to organic matter not salinity and temperature the optimum pressure was 4 bars for the first period and 7 bars for the second for a conversion rate near 80 the variability of feed nf water quality was related to the higher temperature 30 c as well as the discontinuity of fed water because of the maintenance and renewal of the upstream treatment processes thus it s concluded that the nf is effective in getting a higher conversion rate at low pressure and less energy in contrast of the reverse osmosis current results were vindicated by other research work 9 that concluded that permeate flux increases when the temperature increases because the high temperature reduces the water viscosity and the level of concentration polarization however if there is fouling the flux will decline despite an increase in temperature feed characteristic significantly affects membrane performance which is related to chemical structure ph charge geometry and hydrophilicity of solute the possibility of nf membrane fouling in this study in the summer period can be related to the high colloidal transparent exopolymer particles ctep content table 2 3 3 2 effect of salinity temperature and pressure on nf membrane selectivity as shown in fig 3 c and d for the first period the retention rate of ec by nf 90 membrane varies between 60 and 69 for the ec 2 66 ms cm and a pressure range between 3 4 and 4 7 bar the increase of feed nf water ec to 3 5 ms cm at 9 3 c decreases the selectivity of the membrane from 69 to 58 at 4 7 bars in the second period for the same salinity 3 5 ms cm and a temperature of 29 5 c the ec retention rate was 50 at 4 7 bars and 55 at 7 bars these results are in line with the work of r yagnaseni and j h lienhard 10 who indicated that the increase in pore size net path length through the membrane selective layer and negative membrane charge due to high temperature the increase in ion diffusivity contributes significantly to the increase in permeate concentration 3 3 3 hydraulic permeability and flux permeate variability of nf 904040 for different operation conditions to minimize the interaction between temperature and salinity the conductivity at 20 c is used as illustrated in fig 4a for the cold period medium t 15 c the hydraulic permeability of nf 90 membrane fed by treated wastewater is between 2 91 and 1 96 l h m2 bar for the range of ec 20 c between 2 58 and 5 11 ms cm the increase of conductivity by 2 53 ms cm decreases the hydraulic permeability by 32 6 in the hot period 30 c the same parameter decreases from 2 27 to 1 86 l h m2 bar after a decrease of conductivity by 0 57 ms cm fig 4 b for the same salinity level the increase of temperature by 15 c decreases the permeability by 24 however the increase in temperature leads to an increase in the permeate flux because of the decrease in water viscosity the results confirm the hypothesis of membrane fouling in the summer period compared to the literature results generally authors calculated the pure water permeability of nf 90 membranes variables deduced values were recorded 6 98 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure between 5 and 25 bars 11 4 09 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure between 10 and 40 bars 12 7 31 l h m2 bar simulated by rosa software 13 and 4 6 l h m2 bar for the range of pressure 10 40 bars 14 to ensure the hydraulic permeability of nf by using treated wastewater a premachandra et al 15 collected three industrial wastewater samples from a treatment facility that receives wastewater from approximately 100 different clients from chemical food automotive and other industries the medium cod of the three samples are respectively 1000 mg l 2300 mg l and 2500 mg l the nf hydraulic permeability obtained after post exposure by wastewater was between 2 and 4 5 l m2 h bar for the first around 2 l m2 h bar for the second and between 1 5 and 2 for the third case in conclusion the permeability of membranes depends strong on the composition of water especially the organic load and the aptitude for fouling of the membrane the current results are in accordance with the experiment carried out with treated wastewater due to the fouling of the membrane its efficiency is decreased and an alkaline acid alkaline rinsing was done on october 28 2022 the average value of hydraulic permeability was 2 59 0 12 l h m2 bar after membrane cleaning fig 5 it increases by 39 compared to the last value obtained for the same conditions after membrane cleaning the maximum conversion rate fig 6 a is 89 1 11 at 6 53 bar 0 09 3 5ms cm for ec 20 c and a temperature of 27 1 c and the ec retention rate was 58 fig 6 b at 5 2 bar 3 3 4 quality of nf permeate and restrictions for water reuse in an aquaponic system 3 3 4 1 salt selectivity of nf90 4040 membrane the conductivities of nf permeate recorded at different periods during 2021 2022 fig 7 were under the required value for an aquaponic system 2 5 ms cm at 20 c 8 however a precaution should be taken into account for higher salinity like in the summer increasing pressure improves the permeate quality after membrane cleaning the permeate quality is improved and the permeate conductivity at 20 c decreases from 1 77 ms cm to 1 48 ms cm for an applied pressure of 5 2 bars and feed water ec 20 c of 3 5 ms cm as shown in table 3 the cod removal rate by nf 90 membrane was around 74 in the cold period and 52 in the hot period a premachandra et al 15 compared four nf membranes and three multi sourced industrial wastewater and they concluded that the best cod removal was attained by the nf90 membrane but they showed also that the compositional difference between samples significantly influenced the cod reduction rate the selectivity of the membrane regarding bivalent ions is 71 for sulfate and 68 for calcium and magnesium less membrane selectivity of nf 90 membrane was obtained for monovalent ions compared to bivalent ions 36 54 for sodium 51 61 for potassium 52 61 for chloride 62 for bicarbonate and 33 46 for nitrate m rajca et al 16 investigated the desalination of geothermal water by employing nanofiltration and they concluded that only 10 50 of single valent ions were removed and that the nf90 membrane was better than the nf270 for hardness removal s jafarinejad 17 reported that only 20 39 of chloride was removed by nf 90 fed by petroleum oil wastewater pretreated by a sand filter with an initial concentration of chloride in the range of 225 760 mg l however they showed that 95 98 of sulfate was retained due to the high molecular weight sieving separation mechanisms and charge effects m m emanjomeh et al 18 studied the interaction between ions and their effects on the removal rate of bivalent and monovalent ions and they concluded that a less removal rate at 4 bar was obtained for nitrate 44 it was in accordance with the current result they observed that the nitrate removal rate is significantly affected by the influent water quality if the sulfate content is high and the monovalent ions are low the removal rate of nitrate decreases and if the hardness of water is high and sulfate content is low the nitrate selectivity of nf90 increases the most harmful ions in the aquaponic system are sodium and chloride because they affect plant growth the sodium content in the permeate is 148 04 27 52 in the cold period and 301 3 31 9 in the hot period for the chloride content it is 216 30 99 44 mg l for the first period and 698 16 134 4 mg l for the second period the increase of these ions content was linked to the nf feed water quality variation function of the temperature and received water quality on the whole system according to i gjesteland 19 the toxicity of sodium content increased when it was higher than 100 mg l and it was severe for a concentration 230 mg l for chloride content in the range between 178 and 355 mg l with this type of water it s possible to cultivate only moderately sensitive crops and for the range between 355 and 710 mg l only salt tolerant crops can be planted in aquaponic systems in conclusion the water feed discontinuity of the current tertiary treatment process and the higher temperature had a bad effect on the performance of processes as well as the permeate water quality for the second period the nf permeate was diluted by ro permeate from the second stage of the hybrid system to decrease the ions content before its reuse in the aquaponic system 3 3 4 2 micropollutants selectivity of nf90 4040 membrane micropollutant removal rates have been investigated under a pressure of 5 2 bars a conversion rate of 80 and a ph of 7 5 table 4 higher selectivity is obtained for carbamazepine and metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac 69 70 and 74 respectively however the removal rates of benzotriazole and clarithromycin are lower 17 and 8 respectively s ebrahimzadeh et al 20 have studied the retention rate of micropollutants by ro espa3 and they have concluded that neutral and hydrophilic compound has a lower retention rate however the anionic micropollutant has a higher retention rate carbamazepine is known as neutral and hydrophobic but benzotriazole is neutral and hydrophilic and the removal rate obtained by ro was 15 6 for this last compound around the value obtained in this research work by nf 90 17 diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole are known as anionic for this reason they have the best retention rate k wu et al 21 carried out an experiment on photodegradation by microalgae to remove clarithromycin and benzotriazole and they obtained good results but they observed that the mixture of micropollutants had an adverse effect on its degradation r xu et al 22 investigated the removal efficiencies of the nf pilot scale to 49 micropollutants under different conditions and they concluded that the charge the molecular weight the water temperature and the conversion rate have an effect on their removal rates kp m licorna et al 23 evaluated the removal rate of five inflammatory substances drugs by nf 90 and a higher rejection rate was obtained over 88 at 20 bar and ph 5 they concluded that lower rejection rates were observed with hydrophilic compounds due to the adsorption diffusion mechanisms 3 3 5 hybrid system nf ro contribution to brine valorization and permeate quality improvement in the summer period 82 of the conversion rate is obtained at 7 bars with an average conductivity at 30 c of permeate 2 21 ms cm 0 33 fig 8 9 the value of produced water conductivity is around the limit value tolerated in the aquaponic system the chloride and sodium contents increase and they can have a toxic effect on the plants the nf desalination generates 1 m3 d of brine with an average conductivity of 6 67 ms cm for the same period to dilute the nf permeate and reduce the brine amount reverse osmosis is used as a second stage for nf brine treatment the conversion rate of ro at 10 bars was 75 6 7 with a conductivity of 0 91ms cm 0 21 and it is between 94 and 96 5 for the hybrid nf ro desalination system fig 8 9 the 4 5 brine generated by ro is reused for halophyte irrigation to minimize the environmental impact of the sewer discharge of the brine compared to the literature m a hafiz et al 24 simulated a hybrid nf fo ro process for the supply of irrigation water and they concluded that the addition of forward osmosis fo as an intermediate process in the second stage decreased the energy consumption by 27 and the permeate water quality response to the restrictions for food crops irrigation a garsallahah et al 25 compared an uf ro an uf nf and a nf ro hybrid systems for the treatment and reuse of biologically pretreated real textile wastewater and they observed that nf ro desalination system achieved high separation performances at 8 bars and 10 bars for nf and ro respectively however with the addition of uf at 3 bars the transmembrane pressure decreased by 2 bar for both nf and ro system and the conversion rate increased by 36 and 29 respectively after reusing nf permeate or the blend nf ro permeate for aquaponic feeding the total fish weight increases from 4 25 kg and 6 5 kg to 12 8 kg and 19 1 kg in tank one and tank two respectively during five months fig 10a and different crops are cultivated in the aquaponic system using with a considerable growth rate fig 10b 4 conclusion experimental results show the efficiency of nf to reduce the water salinity and organic matter to a suitable level for reuse in the aquaponic system with less consumption energy compared to reverse osmosis a high conversion rate of 89 at 6 5 bar is obtained for the high salinity recorded during the period 2021 2022 however a membrane cleaning is required in case of high temperature which increases the water salinity due to evaporation and has an effect on the membrane performance continuous feeding of the whole system was necessary to avoid the failure of pretreatment and membrane biofouling the hybrid desalination system nf ro reduces the amount of brine by 65 and improves the permeate quality by diluting the water salinity and toxic ions contents sodium and chloride nanofiltration facilitates the removal of 2 3 of organic micropollutants identified as neutral and hydrophobic anionic and cationic however a low removal rate is obtained by nf from neutral and

12548,current knowledge on the physical chemical and biological mechanisms involved in the removal of biogenic taste and odour t o compounds by granular and biological activated carbon gac and bac respectively contactors in the context of drinking water treatment is critically reviewed it is determined that the removal mechanisms such as physiosorption in the micropore region kinetic parameters and influence of carbon characteristics on adsorption onto fresh gac have been well studied and understood however it was identified that the parameters that influence the development and performance of the biofilm in bac and how operational conditions and carbon characteristics affect these biological processes needs further research in this review microorganisms responsible for biological degradation were highlighted and sorted pore surface diffusion model was identified as effective at modelling the biofiltration process future studies should also focus on the adsorption and biofiltration of t o compounds other than geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib the isolation and characterisation of microorganisms capable of biodegrading t o compounds in active bac contactors and the identification of the biodegradation pathways and by products in large scale systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption biofiltration geosmin 2 methylisoborneol taste and odour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activity and climate change are driving factors increasing frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms and other events related to microbial activity in fresh water around the world posing a threat not only to human and environment health but also to water treatment efficiency and safety 22 39 115 182 the presence of these microorganisms can affect drinking water treatment in several ways such as the formation of disinfection by products 49 65 or the production of toxins and taste and odour t o compounds 64 182 although over a hundred biogenic t o metabolites have been identified in drinking water sources produced by many microorganisms including algae cyanobacteria and fungi 154 geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib are the most commonly regulated detected and studied because of their ubiquity and low odour threshold fig 1 these two compounds are associated with an unpleasant earthy musty taste and smell and can be detected by humans in doses as low as 10 ng l 1 and are often but not exclusively associated with algal or cyanobacterial blooms 64 while not known to be toxic to humans these t o compounds reduce aesthetic value in areas used for recreation influence customer perception of water quality and increase treatment costs of potable water 21 62 150 most conventional physico chemical water treatment processes including low pressure membranes are generally expected to provide limited removal of t o compounds and other extracellular algal metabolites table s1 33 in fact several studies have reported an increase in the concentration of these contaminants following conventional treatment attributed to mechanical and or chemical cell lysis and consequent release of intracellular material 33 99 126 ozonation has been shown to efficiently remove some t o compounds but it is not very effective for odourants such as mib and some aldehydes and ethers 17 42 53 74 170 177 one promising technology is the use of column contactors packed with granular activated carbon gac when these contactors are exposed to source water gac particles can support a microbial biofilm turning the system into a biofilter known as a biological activated carbon bac contactor 40 42 bac systems operate through a combination of adsorption and biofiltration and have been observed to be effective for the management of several micropollutants including emerging contaminants disinfection byproducts and t o compounds 55 62 129 133 158 183 many studies have compared the removal efficiencies of geosmin and mib by gac bac contactors under different experimental conditions such as water temperature ph and natural organic matter nom concentration as well as operational factors such as empty bed contact time ebct different treatment configuration and carbon types the impact of these parameters has been extensively reviewed 40 56 124 150 158 178 180 however discussion in the literature about the underlying physico chemical and biological mechanisms that drive the adsorption biodegradation and the consequent removal of biogenic t o compounds has been limited additionally few studies have analysed the factors impacting biofilm growth and its role in t o removal hence the present review critically assesses current knowledge on these mechanisms and on how this knowledge may be incorporated into modelling of t o removal by gac and bac contactors the present study will also discuss analytical techniques used to characterise activated carbon ac and biofilm structures and how they correlate with treatment efficiency of biogenic t o compounds by gac and bac contactors due to the availability of the literature most of the discussion will focus on geosmin and mib but a section on the biofiltration of additional t o compounds is included 2 granular and biological activated carbon fundamentals gac is a highly porous adsorbent material comprised of condensed polyaromatic sheets or basal planes 9 it is commonly used to remove micropollutants such as heavy metals 152 pharmaceuticals 73 175 herbicides 5 50 and organic dyes 173 from water as with most adsorbents gac adsorption efficiency has been shown to be directly proportional to the availability of adsorption sites which declines over time especially when exposed to nom which is ubiquitous in source water 46 74 110 145 hence for most applications gac requires frequent renewal or regeneration increasing operational costs however following an initial lag phase an active microbial biofilm can develop on the surface of operating gac contactors turning the system into bac fig 2 while the removal efficiency of t o compounds by non biologically active gac contactors may decline after a few months or even weeks 24 46 130 bac contactors have shown satisfactory removal efficiencies 60 97 of t o compounds even after multiple years of operation attesting to the resilience of this technology 38 123 138 164 the biofilm on the ac is a porous structure which allows waterborne substances to pass through the biofilm s waterfilled channels towards the gac surface 31 evidence shows that adsorption continues to occur and significantly contributes to the removal of t o compounds in bac contactors after multiple years of operation indicating a concurrent dual removal mechanism 31 34 62 123 164 179 the efficiency of the combination of adsorption and biodegradation is higher than expected for each standalone process and they can complement each other with the removal of different types of micropollutants or nom fractions 4 93 microorganisms in the biofilm can also contribute to the renewing of the gac by freeing adsorption sites a process known as bioregeneration 4 because of this combination of mechanisms bac contactors are a more robust solution for the removal of biogenic t o compounds than processes that rely exclusively on biological filtration such as slow sand filters compared to other biofilters bac contactors require shorter acclimation periods generally achieving higher removal rates and holding a higher amount of biomass 37 38 40 100 123 to fully understand and predict the performance of a bac unit adsorption biodegradation and the transition and overlap of these two phases needs to be investigated 3 adsorption of taste and odour compounds onto granular activated carbon the porous structure of gac and its usually electro positively charged hydrophobic surface combine to create a powerful adsorbent for organic matter and many micropollutants 139 145 the structure of gac consists of interconnected pores of varying sizes classified as micropores 2 0 nm mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm 32 70 157 typical activated carbon ac types used for water treatment have up to 90 of their surface area covered by micropores even though meso and macropores are also considered to be important as transport channels for contaminant removal 102 127 adsorption is affected by the physical and chemical interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate as well as the chemical composition of the background matrix 67 in the water treatment context contaminants adsorb onto gac by non specific dispersive interactions i e van de waals interactions and or by electrostatic i e coulombic interactions 80 104 geosmin and mib and many other t o compounds are non ionic and therefore their adsorption is likely to be controlled by the van der waals non specific dispersive interactions 80 the parameters with most influence on the adsorption of these non ionic t o compounds are expected to be morphological characteristics of the carbon e g surface area pore volume pore size distribution the elemental composition of the carbon e g oxygen content hydrophobicity and competing adsorption effects e g presence of nom and other micropollutants 95 96 106 107 several studies have investigated the adsorption of geosmin and mib using powdered activated carbon pac instead of gac due to its ease of use and the guarantee of an exclusive adsorption mode these findings are also relevant and are included in the following discussion 3 1 impact of morphological characteristics of granular activated carbon on adsorption of t o compounds adsorption efficiency is directly related to the relationship between adsorbate and pore size distribution 32 47 adsorption strength is highest when pore size is similar to the size of the adsorbate because this increases the contact area between adsorbent adsorbate and the overlap of the adsorption potential of opposing walls 80 107 mib and geosmin molecules largest dimension 1 0 nm are therefore expected to adsorb with greater strength to pores in the micropore range 2 0 nm or slightly larger 106 128 this theoretical expectation has been observed and reported in numerous studies table 1 these studies reported the positive relationship between adsorption of geosmin and mib and micropore volume both in the presence and absence of nom and both in terms of initial removal efficiency i e fresh gac and in the number of bed volumes to breakthrough i e adsorption exhaustion there is no consensus in the literature on which pore size yields the best positive relationship to mib and geosmin adsorption with reported ranges including 1 0 to 1 2 nm 109 110 0 7 to 2 0 nm 97 2 0 nm 176 0 5 to 6 3 nm 128 2 34 to 3 18 nm and 7 4 to 9 3 nm 51 in addition to factors such as different experimental conditions source waters and types of carbon used the difference in reported pore size range might be explained by the different methods employed to estimate the pore size distribution gac morphological characteristics can be assessed with the use of gas physisorption experiments 134 the adsorption and desorption of a gas under specific conditions can be analysed through several different models and techniques to yield information on surface area and to estimate adsorption capacity and pore size distribution 146 table 2 the brunauer emmett teller bet theory despite weaknesses in its theoretical foundations e g does not account for interactions between adjacent adsorption sites is one of the most used models to estimate the apparent specific surface area 1 40 157 freundlich and langmuir isotherm models have been frequently used to infer information on adsorption kinetics 160 models such as the barret joyner halenda bjh the dubinin radushkevich eq dr and the horvath kawazoe saito foley hksf have been used for determination of apparent micro and mesopore volumes 10 93 116 134 151 157 169 the technical report by thommes et al 157 suggests that the use of quenched solid density functional theory dft 36 105 and monte carlo molecular simulation 41 would allow more accurate and comprehensive pore structural analysis especially in the micropore range additionally thommes et al 157 recommend the use of argon at 87 k as an alternative to the commonly used nitrogen at 77 k due to interactions between the quadrupolar nature of the nitrogen and the surface chemistry of the adsorbent among other reasons 3 2 impact of elemental composition of granular activated carbon on adsorption of t o compounds the surface of ac contains atoms other than carbon which define the chemical characteristics of the material 9 80 oxygen is often the heteroatom of greatest importance for adsorption due to its abundance and demonstrated correlation to the hydrophilicity of ac 102 122 the adsorption of any pollutant can only take place once the water that initially filled the pores of the ac is displaced from potential adsorption sites 80 oxygen atoms on the ac surface allow the water molecules to form hydrogen bonds increasing the affinity of water for the ac surface 103 122 therefore theoretically the higher the hydrophilicity of the ac the lower the affinity for geosmin and mib due to their hydrophobic nature and the higher the energy barrier for the displacement of the adsorbed water 101 despite these theoretical expectations the impact of surface oxygen content and or hydrophilicity on adsorption of geosmin and mib has been the subject of divergent results in the literature reports of strong correlations between the adsorption of geosmin and mib onto ac and the oxygen content of the carbon surface can be found with some studies reporting surface oxygen content to be the parameter with the largest effect on the adsorption of these compounds 25 122 however many studies also reported statistically insignificant correlations between the adsorption of geosmin and mib and the abundance of ac surface oxygen or acidic groups and basic groups on the ac surface 68 95 97 176 no consistent differences in carbon type background matrix or methodology were observed in these studies the impact of surface chemistry on adsorption of t o compounds remains a topic for future studies 3 3 competitive adsorption between taste and odour compounds and natural organic matter the presence of nom has been reported to interfere with the adsorption of t o compounds and reduce the equilibrium capacity and the kinetics of adsorption according to two primary mechanisms pore blockage and direct adsorption site competition 110 119 fig 3 a decrease of up to one order of magnitude has been reported when comparing adsorption of geosmin and mib between single solute solutions and natural waters with nom concentrations of 2 0 12 0 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc 19 48 110 120 121 149 151 156 this effect has been observed for several different ebcts and raw water sources with an increase in the background dissolved organic matter concentration of the influent causing a decrease in the gac adsorption capacity for geosmin and mib under equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions 156 187 generally the dominant competitive mechanism depends on factors such as the concentrations and chemical similarities between the target contaminant and the background matrix compounds and 20 76 it has been reported that smaller fractions of nom molecular weight 500 600 da have the greatest impact on the direct competitive adsorption of geosmin and mib onto ac therefore direct site competition is likely the dominant competitive mechanism for the adsorption of t o compounds in natural waters as nom in this size fraction directly competes with these t o compounds for the adsorption sites in pores in the micropore range 48 58 107 110 151 156 187 no differences to competitive adsorption in raw and post flocculation water have been observed suggesting that flocculation mostly removes those nom fractions that have little influence on competitive adsorption 187 the reduction in adsorption efficiency of t o compounds due to competitive effects with nom can be mitigated by the use of carbons with a wide range of pore sizes 120 121 149 151 pelekani and snoeyink 120 suggest that carbons with a narrow range of pores in the micropore region are more susceptible to pore blockage when exposed to multi solute solutions and that in carbons with a wider range of pore distribution the competitive effect is reduced and the mechanism shifts more towards direct site competition because of the larger particle size more surface area would be inaccessible behind a blocked pore in a gac when compared to a pac particle so the effect of pore blockage on adsorption capacity on gac is theoretically greater when compared to pac 75 but no confirmation of this effect in the context of t o adsorption could be found in the literature 4 biofiltration of taste and odour compounds in biological activated carbon the surface of an ac granule is well suited for colonization by microorganisms because its rough surface and porous structure provides protection from shear forces its adsorptive properties enrich substrate nutrient and oxygen concentrations and a variety of functional groups on the ac surface can enhance cell attachment 15 78 82 118 166 167 in bac contactors a diverse community of microorganisms including bacteria protozoa and fungi feed on the adsorbed and entrapped organic matter t o compounds nutrients and other microorganisms 15 145 183 the availability of nutrients and energy sources depend on where in the treatment process the bac unit is located the microorganisms produce a protective matrix of excreted cellular compounds formed by polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids which further anchors the biofilm to the substrate 15 85 145 four key factors should be considered when studying biodegradation in a bac contactor the capacity of microorganisms to degrade the target compound the impact of the ac characteristics on biofilm development the effects of the developed biofilm on the removability of contaminants and the indicators of biofilm performance 4 1 biodegradation of taste and odour compounds multiple bacterial species have been shown to be capable of biodegrading geosmin and mib as primary and or secondary substrates table s2 bacterial species genera from a diverse range of phyla are shown to be capable of degrading these two compounds fig 4 suggesting that the metabolic pathways for their degradation are not taxonomically specific and bacteria capable of such process are likely to be present in most full scale treatment plants healthy biofilms the pathways for biodegradation of geosmin and mib are still not completely understood and may vary between different bacterial species mib can undergo a dehydration process and produce 2 methyl 2 bornene 1 methylcamphene and 2 methylenebornane which are odourless 11 35 141 144 155 181 other pathways for mib biodegradation such as the cleaving of the organic ring structures through reactions catalysed by monooxygenase enzymes are also proposed in the literature 61 114 saito et al 137 observed four major degradation products of geosmin and identified two of them as 1 4a dimethyl 2 3 4 4a 5 6 7 8 octahydronaphthalene and an enone disclosing a partial degradation pathway involving dehydration followed by allylic oxidation another possible pathway for geosmin biodegradation involves monooxygenase enzymes 61 in a recent study azaria et al 8 investigated the adsorption and biodegradation of geosmin and mib onto alginate based carries and by performing metagenomic analysis showed that the presence of geosmin and mib led to changes in the abundances of some genes involved in terpene degradation including many genes related to monooxygenase production biodegradation of geosmin and mib requires further research to correctly identify metabolic pathways as well as intermediate and final products investigation should also include the possibility of co metabolic processes for t o biodegradation as enhanced geosmin biodegradation in the presence of mib 171 and ethanol 137 has been observed a study by yuan et al 179 showed that inactivation of a bac biofilm has little impact on its capacity to remove geosmin and mib on carbons that have been in use for up to nine years the authors suggest that gac retains capacity to adsorb geosmin and mib for much longer than previously thought however it is unclear whether this capacity was retained because of specific characteristics of the carbon used low competitive adsorption pressure on the micropore size region due to water quality characteristics or the biofilm s ability to regenerate the carbon and free up adsorption sites biodegradation of geosmin and mib has been shown to be very slow taking up to 10 days to start occurring even in single solute solutions with known biodegraders table 3 57 61 69 71 144 181 the ability of bac filters to biologically degrade t o compounds is not being questioned as sand filters which have no capacity to adsorb geosmin and mib and theoretically operate in biodegradation only mode have been shown to successfully remove these compounds 61 it is hypothesized however that adsorption and or assimilation to the biofilm are the primary mechanism for immediate removal of t o compounds for most of the life cycle of bac contactors due to the fast kinetics of filtration and that is why temporary inactivation of the biofilm has low impact on removal efficiency biodegradation would work as a secondary mechanism regenerating the carbon and maintaining longevity confirmation of these hypotheses would require an analysis of long term t o removal in natural waters by gac contactors in which biofilm is completely impeded from growing from the start of the study to investigate how long the removal capacity is retained by adsorption only isotopic labelling of t o compounds would also further elucidate their fate during biofiltration and which mechanism is dominant even though biodegradation of geosmin and mib as primary or secondary carbon sources have been observed in laboratory experiments no studies have reported in situ monitoring of the by products of biodegradation or tracked labelled isotopes in active bac contactors isolation and extensive characterisation of microorganisms capable of biodegrading t o compounds in active bac contactors is another area that requires further research the use of emerging omics techniques including metagenomics transcriptomics and metabolomics could lead to a deeper understand of genes and processes involved in biodegradation reactions 4 2 impact of activated carbon characteristics on biofilm development and activity as discussed the removal of t o compounds by ac adsorption mainly occurs within micropores 2 0 nm however as bacteria are too large to enter pores in this size range the presence of meso and macropores and general surface roughness play an important role in the development and activity of the biofilm and the transport of contaminants to the inner pores 2 163 165 wang et al 165 reported that pores in the range of 2 5 μm are the most suitable for bacterial attachment based on the analysis of removal of different fractions of nom by gac and bac contactors and extensive genomic and metaproteomic analysis lu et al 93 suggested that the bacteria in the biofilm have a preference to utilize organic matter that is already adsorbed to the gac rather than in the aqueous solution and that the reactions between exoenzymes and organic matter occurs mainly within mesopores therefore bioregeneration is proposed to occur due to the concentration gradient formed between the ac and the bulk liquid which may extract contaminants from micropores and or due to extracellular enzyme activity 4 77 given the relatively large size of bacteria and enzymes it is likely that the extracellular portion of bioregeneration only occurs on material adsorbed within the macro and mesopore region 79 93 indeed the presence of small macropores between 0 2 and 10 μm has been shown to benefit the bioregeneration ability of some bac adsorption sites 93 since t o adsorb primarily on the micropore region we hypothesize that bioregeneration of these compounds is likely to be driven by the concentration gradient mechanism fig 5 the elemental composition of ac can also have an effect on microbial cell attachment and the subsequent formation and growth of the biofilm 82 hydrophobicity the presence of oxygen functional groups and metallic oxides has been reported to generally have a positive influence on cell attachment and biodegradation of micropollutants 82 131 132 bernstein 11 conducted an extensive study on surface chemistry of virgin fresh and fully biologically active gacs contactors and concluded that both ac morphology and elemental composition change with filter age with older gacs exhibiting a mineralized surface comprising of oxygen manganese aluminium calcium and silica older contactors had lower levels of surface carbon and bacterial colonies were scattered rather than uniformly distributed in the biofilm except for these few aforementioned studies research evaluating the impact of ac characteristics on biofilm development in the context of t o biofiltration is limited and remains an important area for future investigation surface roughness has also been reported to have a significant effect on cell attachment with smoother gacs having lower capacity to hold biomass 2 4 3 physico chemical properties as indicators of biofilm performance biofilms are generally non homogeneous both in distribution throughout the ac surface and within its depth 12 the structure of the biofilm controls many processes such as microbial activity mass transfer near and within biofilms and the rate of biofilm accumulation 13 186 common parameters used to characterise the biofilm structure and infer further information about its composition can be physical such as biofilm thickness and total dry weight and chemical such as organic carbon content and oxygen demand table 4 85 145 however these parameters vary depending on multiple factors determined by the type of microorganisms present in the biofilm and may overestimate active biomass since the measurements can also include inert mass exopolymers and adsorbed organic matter 85 biofilm activity increases with thickness up to a critical point named the active thickness above which the diffusion of nutrients becomes a limiting factor to microbial metabolism 66 83 85 the thickness of this active biofilm is highly variable depending on factors such as the substrate hydraulic conditions i e shear stress water quality e g dissolved oxygen concentration and the microorganisms present in the biofilm but in general bac operating conditions should be optimised for the growth of a stable active and thin biofilm e g thicknesses from 500 μm have been reported as thin and active biofilms 85 89 91 186 additionally biofilm thickness partially controls the mass transfer of substrate onto the ac particle surface which can affect adsorption during the bac phase and can heavily impact the microbial composition 89 153 analytical techniques can be used to assess the structure of biofilms similarly to the analysis of the ac s surface assessment of the biofilm surface can be carried out by scanning electron microscopy sem and or confocal scanning laser microscopy 85 sem can also be coupled with an x ray energy dispersive system to determine elemental composition of the cells and the biofilm 85 159 most parameters that describe the internal structure of the biofilm are hard to quantify directly and are calculated through analysis of micro photographs 13 174 heydorn et al 60 developed a software that uses three dimensional stacking of biofilm images to calculate parameters such as volume surface area coverage in the different layers thickness average and distribution roughness coefficient and surface to volume ratio the authors suggested that mean thickness and the roughness coefficient were important parameters to report when describing biofilm structure 59 60 beyenal et al 12 expanded on the previous software by integrating elements of 3d image stacking into their software package additionally frozen section techniques have been used to cut thin slices of the biofilm which enables accurate measurement of biofilm thickness and the direct study of the structure of the biofilm at different biofilm depths 91 186 substantial variations in microbial populations biofilm density porosity and microbial activity with biofilm depth were observed in one study by zhang and bishop 186 which demonstrated that biofilm thickness can strongly influence microbial characteristics and spatial distribution with thicker biofilms having a lower density of active bacteria and higher porosity in the bottom layers when compared to thinner biofilms however it is unclear whether these classical structural biofilm characterisation techniques such as thickness and structural parameters are applicable in the context of bac biofiltration evidence shows that the biofilm in bac contactors in the context of drinking water treatment is loosely attached rather than a fixed and uniform biofilm with well defined structure and thickness and that most of the doc assimilated by the biofilm can become suspended cells in the effluent 11 161 the application of characterisation techniques and analyses in the context of bac and t o compounds removal remains an interesting area of research which can elucidate the importance and role of biofilm structure in the biofiltration of micropollutants biological activity and biofilm performance can also be monitored through chemical analyses table 4 for example doederer et al 31 observed a decrease in dissolved organic nitrogen and an increase in nitrate levels from influent to effluent during the transition from adsorption to biodegradation phases in a gac contactor their results corroborate the theory proposed by lapara et al 84 which based on thermodynamic calculations of ammonia and nitrite oxidation and extensive genomic sequencing suggested that both ammonification of organic nitrogen and nitrification occur in bac biofilms 4 4 biochemical properties as indicators of biofilm performance biological activity and biofilm performance can also be estimated based on biological properties for example enzymatic activity and measurements of the concentrations of metabolic by products including proteins and lipids 85 186 the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate atp triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride enzymes have been used regularly to provide an overall indicator of biological activity in drinking water systems including bac contactors 85 91 92 98 161 162 yet no studies to date have correlated the concentrations of these enzymes to the removal efficiency of t o compounds another microbial indicator of the performance of bac contactors is the diversity and abundance of microbial species in the biofilm in particular the presence of protozoan populations has been reported to reduce clogging of the contactors by controlling the biomass growth and reducing bacterial density on the filter effluent due to predation 82 118 139 140 143 166 5 modelling removal of taste and odour compounds by activated carbon contactors because of their connection to seasonal harmful algal blooms most biogenic t o compounds are not perennial contaminants 108 142 even though efforts are being made to develop real time monitoring and early detection tools for t o compounds in environmental waters 30 86 87 117 136 the most widely used techniques still require sophisticated analytical instruments and skilled operators precluding quick reactive measurement sometimes water utilities are only aware of t o events after costumer complaints are received 16 90 108 therefore it is of great interest for water utilities and researchers to develop models or indicators for estimating the remaining capacity of gac and bac contactors to remove t o compounds in case of future t o events yuan et al 180 extensively reviews general modelling techniques for adsorption and biodegradation in gac in the following sections discussion will be focused on techniques that have been applied in the context of t o 5 1 challenges of taste and odour seasonality environmental pressures shape the microbial community in a biofilm and the microorganisms that are better adapted to the conditions within that biofilm thrive 85 following changes in water quality a lag phase in which the microbial community acclimates to the new conditions is often observed which may lead to lower removal efficiency of contaminants 100 185 zearley and summers 185 concluded that sand biofilters once acclimated to mib were able to retain their capacity to remove it after non exposure periods of up to five months they further observed that after nine months of non exposure the mib removal rates decreased significantly but removal capacity was regained after 20 days of exposure the sand biofilters used by zearley and summers 185 however were continuously operated during non exposure phases by being fed with influent water that was rich in organic matter highlighting the importance of maintaining an active and healthy biofilm throughout periods of non exposure to t o compounds common procedures that can be used to control biofilm growth and activity are the management of organic and nutrient loading water flow i e ebct water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen 112 139 140 145 since there are no widely accepted guidelines that define the optimal ranges for these procedures in the literature continuous monitoring of biofilm activity is required to optimise the biodegradation of t o compounds water utilities can also control biofilm growth and manage breakthrough of organic material coming off of the biofilm by using filter backwash by controlling the backwash rate duration and frequency which helps prevent clogging of the biofilters caused by uncontrolled biofilm growth 145 an additional technique explored by mcdowall et al 98 and yagi et al 172 is the seeding of biofilters sand filter and bac respectively with a consortium of bacteria known to degrade a particular t o compounds which successfully reduced the acclimation period and promoted prompt biodegradation of geosmin and mib even in biofilters with inactivated biofilm and in biofilters previously shown not to be efficient at removing geosmin further research is recommended on seeding of bac contactors especially in the case of contactors that are not continuously operated i e gac bac contactors which are operated seasonally or only in response to known t o events and after long periods of non exposure to these compounds to further develop an appropriate methodology for seeding the frequency and intensity of t o event and local needs or regulations for removal of other micropollutants should guide plants and operators on best practices for the choice between pac gac or bac pac is generally used in treatment plants with sporadic t o events and or in which retrofitting gac contactors is too costly or unfeasible the choice between renewing gac in the contactors or letting the biofilm develop should be guided by the cost of the carbon environmental consciousness the costs and risks to effluent water quality of controlling biofilm growth and the capacity of the biofilm in each location to retain removability of t o all of which are site and region specific the american water works association published two studies on the cost of gac in the past 3 52 but an up to date comprehensive cost analysis comparing gac bac and other alternatives for the management of t o and other micropollutants is missing 5 2 direct estimation of adsorption capacity of taste and odour compounds parameters that have been successfully used as direct indicators of adsorption efficiency of mib and geosmin by fresh gac contactors include iodine value and apparent specific surface area obtained using the brunauer emmet teller bet theory 32 43 113 the american society for testing and materials suggested that tetrafluoromethane isotherms and the resulting acetoxime or trace capacity number gives information about the number of high energy adsorption sites astm international wk64555 which lead smith et al 147 to assume it would better correlate to mib adsorption when compared to iodine number and bet surface area however their results showed no predictive ability for mib adsorption by tetrafluoromethane isotherms and good correlation between mib adsorption and iodine number and bet parameters direct estimation of adsorption efficiency remains useful for comparison between different fresh gacs but in real applications the exhaustion of adsorption sites and development of the biofilm will rapidly turn these estimations obsolete 5 3 scaled down experimental tests rapid small scale column tests rssct have been used to simulate full scale data and to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic parameters to feed process based models 28 125 in this test mass transfer calculations are used to scale down the operational parameters e g ebct particle size of full scale gac contractors to small laboratory scale columns diameters around 10 mm which can undergo higher hydraulic loading rates than full scale setups to rapidly simulate aging 29 even though rsscts have been successfully used to predict fresh gac performance the test often requires the carbon granules to be crushed to an appropriate size column diameter to particle size ratio greater than fifty limiting their use for pre loaded gac due to the opening of previously blocked pores and consequent overestimation of adsorption capacity 29 46 62 81 156 similar to rssct the short bed adsorber sba methodology proposed by weber and liu 168 uses bench scale columns and a sensitivity analysis of breakthrough curves to simultaneously determine film transfer coefficients and the effective surface diffusivity of gac contractors however in contrast to rssct no scaling down calculations and crushing of the gac were required and the tests were operated at the same filtration velocity as pilot scale contactors 46 81 similar limitations to rssct on the use of the sba methodology for pre loaded gac were reported by ho and newcombe 108 as the method does not take into account biological activity the use of larger laboratory scale columns for the estimation of removal of t o compounds by biologically active bac contactors has been advised e g increase column diameter to 25 mm and information on sieving storage and transport of the activated carbon prior to the experiments to better estimate remaining removal capacity of full and pilot scale contactors have been reported 62 88 111 5 4 process based and semi empirical modelling techniques site specific equilibrium mass transfer and kinetic parameters whether obtained through rssct sba isotherm batch adsorption experiments or any other method can be used to fit mathematical models that predict the remaining removal capacity of bac contactors 72 89 125 the most widely used mathematical models combine established hydrodynamic models for particle transport through a fixed bed filter with solute adsorption modelling usually consisting of a two step diffusion the liquid particle biofilm and the intraparticle 6 125 148 models usually differ based on the intraparticle diffusion mechanism employed common examples of these models include the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm and the pore surface diffusion model psdm 125 hsdm has been identified to be effective for predicting the removal of t o compounds by fresh gacs in lab scale experiments however it has been generally unable to accurately predict behaviours in pilot and full scale filters and fails to simulate the efficiency of pre loaded gac as biological activity is not incorporated into the model 24 26 27 62 63 67 source water turbidity has been reported as an additional factor that can interfere with the prediction capabilities of the hsdm 27 based on sensitivity analysis of the hsdm to external mass transfer and diffusion coefficients ho and newcombe 108 suggested that intraparticle surface diffusion likely controls the adsorption of mib for a pre loaded gac the psdm and some variations derived from it have been successfully employed to predict the removal of t o compounds by fresh and pre loaded gac contractors for example corwin and summers 28 used the psdm modified to replace the freundlich coefficient with a coefficient that represents the apparent capacity of a specific gac for a target compound the authors concluded that adsorption of mib onto gac as well as gradient driven desorption can be estimated by this modified psdm similar conclusions were reported by summers et al 156 who successfully used the psdm to predict mib breakthrough in laboratory and pilot scale gac contractors nie 111 used the psdm to model the remaining adsorptive capacity of pre loaded gac they performed a sensitivity analysis and concluded that adsorption kinetics as opposed to thermodynamics are likely to have a greater importance for scaling down modelling results from large to small scale contactors suggesting that the percentage removal of mib by adsorption even on pre loaded gac is independent of its initial concentration similarly yuan et al 178 observed when studying modelled removal of geosmin and mib by preloaded gac under different temperatures using the psdm that water temperature has more impact on removal kinetics than thermodynamics psdm and its modifications remain promising techniques for the modelling of removal of t o compounds by gac and bac contactors other attempts to model the removal of t o compounds by gac contactors include the use of empirical kinetic models to fit bench and full scale data isothermal and kinetic models have been used to predict the adsorptive capacity for geosmin and mib of fresh gac 24 94 the freundlich isotherm or modifications of it and a pseudo second order kinetic model have been used to describe the adsorption behaviour of these compounds 24 94 the biodegradation of mib geosmin and other micropollutants in batch experiments sand filters and bac contactors has been shown to be well described by a pseudo first order reaction with ebct and influent concentration as variables both under constant and intermittent loading regime and as a primary and secondary substrate 6 61 181 184 185 pseudo first order biodegradation kinetic constants values in the ranges of 0 064 d 1 and 0 075 d 1 for mib and geosmin respectively 61 and 0 14 min 1 for mib 185 have been reported in the literature 5 5 estimating the impact of competitive adsorption the modelling of the removal of t o compounds by gac contactors in full scale treatment plants has to account for the impact of the presence of other compounds such as nom on the removal mechanisms most modelling techniques that try to incorporate the effects of competitive adsorption use the equivalent background compound ebc model which approximates the complex water matrix as a single compound with equivalent competitive adsorption effects using the ebc approximation and a theory for multicomponent adsorption interpretation the ideal adsorbed solution theory researchers have showed that the percentage removal of t o compounds in natural waters is independent of their initial concentration 44 45 48 156 187 furthermore it has been shown that the same ebc approximation for nom is applicable to both geosmin and mib adsorption 44 187 and that the ebc approximation can also be used to predict performance in biologically active gac 111 hence the effects of nom and other compounds present in drinking water sources on the removal of t o compounds can be incorporated into other modelling techniques 5 6 surrogates for taste and odour as an alternative to circumvent the need for specialist analytical equipment and skilled operators to measure t o concentrations and to provide a rapid estimation of remaining mib removal capacity greenwald et al 51 proposed the use of an organic dye xylenol orange as a surrogate to estimate the adsorption of mib onto gac while the use of surrogates is a widely employed technique in other drinking water process such as membranes and the results by greenwald et al 51 were promising it is still unclear whether this organic dye is applicable for different water sources carbon types carbon ages i e bac and t o compounds as only mib adsorption was studied by the authors further studies on the use of this and other surrogates are recommended 5 7 beyond geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol available literature on the adsorption and biofiltration of t o compounds other than geosmin and mib is limited guo et al 53 monitored the removal efficiency by ozone and bac of eighteen recurring odourants in a drinking water treatment plant including geosmin and 2mib thioethers such as dimethyl disulphide dmds and aldehydes such as hexanal heptanal nonanal and decanal most detectable odourants were readily removed by both ozonation and bac contactors the aldehydes which saw an increase in concentration due to ozonation were also successfully removed by bac 53 in a similar study guo et al 54 demonstrated that odours classified as septic musty and chemical e g geosmin mib dmds indane etc could be removed by both conventional drinking water treatment with ozonation while odours classified as fishy or grassy e g aldehydes such as 2 4 decadienal decanal nonanal and β cyclocitral were only successfully removed after the bac step xia et al 170 observed complete removal of a complex odour matrix which included geosmin mib dmds bis 2 chloroisopropyl ether bcie when gac contactors were utilised in a drinking water treatment plant even though conventional drinking water treatment with pre and post ozonation was ineffective on the removal of mib and bcie to below odour threshold levels these limited results highlight the importance of further studies on the characterisation and quantification of odourants other than geosmin and mib in the context of drinking water supply additionally these also call attention to the high efficiency of gac and bac contactors to remove complex odour matrices when other technologies seem to be more sensitive to particularly recalcitrant compounds future studies should focus on transferring current knowledge on adsorption and biofiltration of geosmin and mib to these additional odourants such as kinetic and thermodynamical analysis of the adsorption biodegradation pathways and identification of responsible microorganisms and how or if their presence affect biofilm development 6 conclusions the present review highlights current knowledge on the adsorption and biofiltration of taste and odour t o compounds by granular and activated carbon gac and bac respectively contactors despite its widespread use for the removal of micropollutants many knowledge gaps remain the mechanisms kinetic parameters and carbon characteristics that influence the adsorption of t o compounds specifically 2 methylsioborneol mib and geosmin onto activated carbon both powdered and granular are widely studied and well understood future studies should focus on the transition from fresh gac to bac including how t o removal efficiency varies throughout the contractor lifecycle and how it responds to changes in the environment and operating conditions it is proposed that biodegradation works as a secondary mechanism regenerating the carbon and maintaining longevity of bac units and that adsorption plays a major role on the removal of t o compounds in bac contactors comprehensive risk and cost analysis comparing regenerating gac or letting the biofilm develop are also topics for future research and would be required to evaluate the optimal design for a given plant more robust modelling techniques for bac need to be developed with the aim of estimating the remaining removal capacity for future t o events further understanding of the microbiome within bac particularly relating to the interactions between different microorganisms is required to identify t o removal mechanisms and reconstruct biodegradation pathways further studies on the importance and role of biofilm parameters such as thickness biomass spatial distribution and general structure in the context of t o biofiltration is yet to be explored further studies on the adsorption and biodegradation of t o compounds other than geosmin and mib are required declaration of competing interest the authors

12548,current knowledge on the physical chemical and biological mechanisms involved in the removal of biogenic taste and odour t o compounds by granular and biological activated carbon gac and bac respectively contactors in the context of drinking water treatment is critically reviewed it is determined that the removal mechanisms such as physiosorption in the micropore region kinetic parameters and influence of carbon characteristics on adsorption onto fresh gac have been well studied and understood however it was identified that the parameters that influence the development and performance of the biofilm in bac and how operational conditions and carbon characteristics affect these biological processes needs further research in this review microorganisms responsible for biological degradation were highlighted and sorted pore surface diffusion model was identified as effective at modelling the biofiltration process future studies should also focus on the adsorption and biofiltration of t o compounds other than geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib the isolation and characterisation of microorganisms capable of biodegrading t o compounds in active bac contactors and the identification of the biodegradation pathways and by products in large scale systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption biofiltration geosmin 2 methylisoborneol taste and odour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activity and climate change are driving factors increasing frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms and other events related to microbial activity in fresh water around the world posing a threat not only to human and environment health but also to water treatment efficiency and safety 22 39 115 182 the presence of these microorganisms can affect drinking water treatment in several ways such as the formation of disinfection by products 49 65 or the production of toxins and taste and odour t o compounds 64 182 although over a hundred biogenic t o metabolites have been identified in drinking water sources produced by many microorganisms including algae cyanobacteria and fungi 154 geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib are the most commonly regulated detected and studied because of their ubiquity and low odour threshold fig 1 these two compounds are associated with an unpleasant earthy musty taste and smell and can be detected by humans in doses as low as 10 ng l 1 and are often but not exclusively associated with algal or cyanobacterial blooms 64 while not known to be toxic to humans these t o compounds reduce aesthetic value in areas used for recreation influence customer perception of water quality and increase treatment costs of potable water 21 62 150 most conventional physico chemical water treatment processes including low pressure membranes are generally expected to provide limited removal of t o compounds and other extracellular algal metabolites table s1 33 in fact several studies have reported an increase in the concentration of these contaminants following conventional treatment attributed to mechanical and or chemical cell lysis and consequent release of intracellular material 33 99 126 ozonation has been shown to efficiently remove some t o compounds but it is not very effective for odourants such as mib and some aldehydes and ethers 17 42 53 74 170 177 one promising technology is the use of column contactors packed with granular activated carbon gac when these contactors are exposed to source water gac particles can support a microbial biofilm turning the system into a biofilter known as a biological activated carbon bac contactor 40 42 bac systems operate through a combination of adsorption and biofiltration and have been observed to be effective for the management of several micropollutants including emerging contaminants disinfection byproducts and t o compounds 55 62 129 133 158 183 many studies have compared the removal efficiencies of geosmin and mib by gac bac contactors under different experimental conditions such as water temperature ph and natural organic matter nom concentration as well as operational factors such as empty bed contact time ebct different treatment configuration and carbon types the impact of these parameters has been extensively reviewed 40 56 124 150 158 178 180 however discussion in the literature about the underlying physico chemical and biological mechanisms that drive the adsorption biodegradation and the consequent removal of biogenic t o compounds has been limited additionally few studies have analysed the factors impacting biofilm growth and its role in t o removal hence the present review critically assesses current knowledge on these mechanisms and on how this knowledge may be incorporated into modelling of t o removal by gac and bac contactors the present study will also discuss analytical techniques used to characterise activated carbon ac and biofilm structures and how they correlate with treatment efficiency of biogenic t o compounds by gac and bac contactors due to the availability of the literature most of the discussion will focus on geosmin and mib but a section on the biofiltration of additional t o compounds is included 2 granular and biological activated carbon fundamentals gac is a highly porous adsorbent material comprised of condensed polyaromatic sheets or basal planes 9 it is commonly used to remove micropollutants such as heavy metals 152 pharmaceuticals 73 175 herbicides 5 50 and organic dyes 173 from water as with most adsorbents gac adsorption efficiency has been shown to be directly proportional to the availability of adsorption sites which declines over time especially when exposed to nom which is ubiquitous in source water 46 74 110 145 hence for most applications gac requires frequent renewal or regeneration increasing operational costs however following an initial lag phase an active microbial biofilm can develop on the surface of operating gac contactors turning the system into bac fig 2 while the removal efficiency of t o compounds by non biologically active gac contactors may decline after a few months or even weeks 24 46 130 bac contactors have shown satisfactory removal efficiencies 60 97 of t o compounds even after multiple years of operation attesting to the resilience of this technology 38 123 138 164 the biofilm on the ac is a porous structure which allows waterborne substances to pass through the biofilm s waterfilled channels towards the gac surface 31 evidence shows that adsorption continues to occur and significantly contributes to the removal of t o compounds in bac contactors after multiple years of operation indicating a concurrent dual removal mechanism 31 34 62 123 164 179 the efficiency of the combination of adsorption and biodegradation is higher than expected for each standalone process and they can complement each other with the removal of different types of micropollutants or nom fractions 4 93 microorganisms in the biofilm can also contribute to the renewing of the gac by freeing adsorption sites a process known as bioregeneration 4 because of this combination of mechanisms bac contactors are a more robust solution for the removal of biogenic t o compounds than processes that rely exclusively on biological filtration such as slow sand filters compared to other biofilters bac contactors require shorter acclimation periods generally achieving higher removal rates and holding a higher amount of biomass 37 38 40 100 123 to fully understand and predict the performance of a bac unit adsorption biodegradation and the transition and overlap of these two phases needs to be investigated 3 adsorption of taste and odour compounds onto granular activated carbon the porous structure of gac and its usually electro positively charged hydrophobic surface combine to create a powerful adsorbent for organic matter and many micropollutants 139 145 the structure of gac consists of interconnected pores of varying sizes classified as micropores 2 0 nm mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm 32 70 157 typical activated carbon ac types used for water treatment have up to 90 of their surface area covered by micropores even though meso and macropores are also considered to be important as transport channels for contaminant removal 102 127 adsorption is affected by the physical and chemical interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate as well as the chemical composition of the background matrix 67 in the water treatment context contaminants adsorb onto gac by non specific dispersive interactions i e van de waals interactions and or by electrostatic i e coulombic interactions 80 104 geosmin and mib and many other t o compounds are non ionic and therefore their adsorption is likely to be controlled by the van der waals non specific dispersive interactions 80 the parameters with most influence on the adsorption of these non ionic t o compounds are expected to be morphological characteristics of the carbon e g surface area pore volume pore size distribution the elemental composition of the carbon e g oxygen content hydrophobicity and competing adsorption effects e g presence of nom and other micropollutants 95 96 106 107 several studies have investigated the adsorption of geosmin and mib using powdered activated carbon pac instead of gac due to its ease of use and the guarantee of an exclusive adsorption mode these findings are also relevant and are included in the following discussion 3 1 impact of morphological characteristics of granular activated carbon on adsorption of t o compounds adsorption efficiency is directly related to the relationship between adsorbate and pore size distribution 32 47 adsorption strength is highest when pore size is similar to the size of the adsorbate because this increases the contact area between adsorbent adsorbate and the overlap of the adsorption potential of opposing walls 80 107 mib and geosmin molecules largest dimension 1 0 nm are therefore expected to adsorb with greater strength to pores in the micropore range 2 0 nm or slightly larger 106 128 this theoretical expectation has been observed and reported in numerous studies table 1 these studies reported the positive relationship between adsorption of geosmin and mib and micropore volume both in the presence and absence of nom and both in terms of initial removal efficiency i e fresh gac and in the number of bed volumes to breakthrough i e adsorption exhaustion there is no consensus in the literature on which pore size yields the best positive relationship to mib and geosmin adsorption with reported ranges including 1 0 to 1 2 nm 109 110 0 7 to 2 0 nm 97 2 0 nm 176 0 5 to 6 3 nm 128 2 34 to 3 18 nm and 7 4 to 9 3 nm 51 in addition to factors such as different experimental conditions source waters and types of carbon used the difference in reported pore size range might be explained by the different methods employed to estimate the pore size distribution gac morphological characteristics can be assessed with the use of gas physisorption experiments 134 the adsorption and desorption of a gas under specific conditions can be analysed through several different models and techniques to yield information on surface area and to estimate adsorption capacity and pore size distribution 146 table 2 the brunauer emmett teller bet theory despite weaknesses in its theoretical foundations e g does not account for interactions between adjacent adsorption sites is one of the most used models to estimate the apparent specific surface area 1 40 157 freundlich and langmuir isotherm models have been frequently used to infer information on adsorption kinetics 160 models such as the barret joyner halenda bjh the dubinin radushkevich eq dr and the horvath kawazoe saito foley hksf have been used for determination of apparent micro and mesopore volumes 10 93 116 134 151 157 169 the technical report by thommes et al 157 suggests that the use of quenched solid density functional theory dft 36 105 and monte carlo molecular simulation 41 would allow more accurate and comprehensive pore structural analysis especially in the micropore range additionally thommes et al 157 recommend the use of argon at 87 k as an alternative to the commonly used nitrogen at 77 k due to interactions between the quadrupolar nature of the nitrogen and the surface chemistry of the adsorbent among other reasons 3 2 impact of elemental composition of granular activated carbon on adsorption of t o compounds the surface of ac contains atoms other than carbon which define the chemical characteristics of the material 9 80 oxygen is often the heteroatom of greatest importance for adsorption due to its abundance and demonstrated correlation to the hydrophilicity of ac 102 122 the adsorption of any pollutant can only take place once the water that initially filled the pores of the ac is displaced from potential adsorption sites 80 oxygen atoms on the ac surface allow the water molecules to form hydrogen bonds increasing the affinity of water for the ac surface 103 122 therefore theoretically the higher the hydrophilicity of the ac the lower the affinity for geosmin and mib due to their hydrophobic nature and the higher the energy barrier for the displacement of the adsorbed water 101 despite these theoretical expectations the impact of surface oxygen content and or hydrophilicity on adsorption of geosmin and mib has been the subject of divergent results in the literature reports of strong correlations between the adsorption of geosmin and mib onto ac and the oxygen content of the carbon surface can be found with some studies reporting surface oxygen content to be the parameter with the largest effect on the adsorption of these compounds 25 122 however many studies also reported statistically insignificant correlations between the adsorption of geosmin and mib and the abundance of ac surface oxygen or acidic groups and basic groups on the ac surface 68 95 97 176 no consistent differences in carbon type background matrix or methodology were observed in these studies the impact of surface chemistry on adsorption of t o compounds remains a topic for future studies 3 3 competitive adsorption between taste and odour compounds and natural organic matter the presence of nom has been reported to interfere with the adsorption of t o compounds and reduce the equilibrium capacity and the kinetics of adsorption according to two primary mechanisms pore blockage and direct adsorption site competition 110 119 fig 3 a decrease of up to one order of magnitude has been reported when comparing adsorption of geosmin and mib between single solute solutions and natural waters with nom concentrations of 2 0 12 0 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc 19 48 110 120 121 149 151 156 this effect has been observed for several different ebcts and raw water sources with an increase in the background dissolved organic matter concentration of the influent causing a decrease in the gac adsorption capacity for geosmin and mib under equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions 156 187 generally the dominant competitive mechanism depends on factors such as the concentrations and chemical similarities between the target contaminant and the background matrix compounds and 20 76 it has been reported that smaller fractions of nom molecular weight 500 600 da have the greatest impact on the direct competitive adsorption of geosmin and mib onto ac therefore direct site competition is likely the dominant competitive mechanism for the adsorption of t o compounds in natural waters as nom in this size fraction directly competes with these t o compounds for the adsorption sites in pores in the micropore range 48 58 107 110 151 156 187 no differences to competitive adsorption in raw and post flocculation water have been observed suggesting that flocculation mostly removes those nom fractions that have little influence on competitive adsorption 187 the reduction in adsorption efficiency of t o compounds due to competitive effects with nom can be mitigated by the use of carbons with a wide range of pore sizes 120 121 149 151 pelekani and snoeyink 120 suggest that carbons with a narrow range of pores in the micropore region are more susceptible to pore blockage when exposed to multi solute solutions and that in carbons with a wider range of pore distribution the competitive effect is reduced and the mechanism shifts more towards direct site competition because of the larger particle size more surface area would be inaccessible behind a blocked pore in a gac when compared to a pac particle so the effect of pore blockage on adsorption capacity on gac is theoretically greater when compared to pac 75 but no confirmation of this effect in the context of t o adsorption could be found in the literature 4 biofiltration of taste and odour compounds in biological activated carbon the surface of an ac granule is well suited for colonization by microorganisms because its rough surface and porous structure provides protection from shear forces its adsorptive properties enrich substrate nutrient and oxygen concentrations and a variety of functional groups on the ac surface can enhance cell attachment 15 78 82 118 166 167 in bac contactors a diverse community of microorganisms including bacteria protozoa and fungi feed on the adsorbed and entrapped organic matter t o compounds nutrients and other microorganisms 15 145 183 the availability of nutrients and energy sources depend on where in the treatment process the bac unit is located the microorganisms produce a protective matrix of excreted cellular compounds formed by polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids which further anchors the biofilm to the substrate 15 85 145 four key factors should be considered when studying biodegradation in a bac contactor the capacity of microorganisms to degrade the target compound the impact of the ac characteristics on biofilm development the effects of the developed biofilm on the removability of contaminants and the indicators of biofilm performance 4 1 biodegradation of taste and odour compounds multiple bacterial species have been shown to be capable of biodegrading geosmin and mib as primary and or secondary substrates table s2 bacterial species genera from a diverse range of phyla are shown to be capable of degrading these two compounds fig 4 suggesting that the metabolic pathways for their degradation are not taxonomically specific and bacteria capable of such process are likely to be present in most full scale treatment plants healthy biofilms the pathways for biodegradation of geosmin and mib are still not completely understood and may vary between different bacterial species mib can undergo a dehydration process and produce 2 methyl 2 bornene 1 methylcamphene and 2 methylenebornane which are odourless 11 35 141 144 155 181 other pathways for mib biodegradation such as the cleaving of the organic ring structures through reactions catalysed by monooxygenase enzymes are also proposed in the literature 61 114 saito et al 137 observed four major degradation products of geosmin and identified two of them as 1 4a dimethyl 2 3 4 4a 5 6 7 8 octahydronaphthalene and an enone disclosing a partial degradation pathway involving dehydration followed by allylic oxidation another possible pathway for geosmin biodegradation involves monooxygenase enzymes 61 in a recent study azaria et al 8 investigated the adsorption and biodegradation of geosmin and mib onto alginate based carries and by performing metagenomic analysis showed that the presence of geosmin and mib led to changes in the abundances of some genes involved in terpene degradation including many genes related to monooxygenase production biodegradation of geosmin and mib requires further research to correctly identify metabolic pathways as well as intermediate and final products investigation should also include the possibility of co metabolic processes for t o biodegradation as enhanced geosmin biodegradation in the presence of mib 171 and ethanol 137 has been observed a study by yuan et al 179 showed that inactivation of a bac biofilm has little impact on its capacity to remove geosmin and mib on carbons that have been in use for up to nine years the authors suggest that gac retains capacity to adsorb geosmin and mib for much longer than previously thought however it is unclear whether this capacity was retained because of specific characteristics of the carbon used low competitive adsorption pressure on the micropore size region due to water quality characteristics or the biofilm s ability to regenerate the carbon and free up adsorption sites biodegradation of geosmin and mib has been shown to be very slow taking up to 10 days to start occurring even in single solute solutions with known biodegraders table 3 57 61 69 71 144 181 the ability of bac filters to biologically degrade t o compounds is not being questioned as sand filters which have no capacity to adsorb geosmin and mib and theoretically operate in biodegradation only mode have been shown to successfully remove these compounds 61 it is hypothesized however that adsorption and or assimilation to the biofilm are the primary mechanism for immediate removal of t o compounds for most of the life cycle of bac contactors due to the fast kinetics of filtration and that is why temporary inactivation of the biofilm has low impact on removal efficiency biodegradation would work as a secondary mechanism regenerating the carbon and maintaining longevity confirmation of these hypotheses would require an analysis of long term t o removal in natural waters by gac contactors in which biofilm is completely impeded from growing from the start of the study to investigate how long the removal capacity is retained by adsorption only isotopic labelling of t o compounds would also further elucidate their fate during biofiltration and which mechanism is dominant even though biodegradation of geosmin and mib as primary or secondary carbon sources have been observed in laboratory experiments no studies have reported in situ monitoring of the by products of biodegradation or tracked labelled isotopes in active bac contactors isolation and extensive characterisation of microorganisms capable of biodegrading t o compounds in active bac contactors is another area that requires further research the use of emerging omics techniques including metagenomics transcriptomics and metabolomics could lead to a deeper understand of genes and processes involved in biodegradation reactions 4 2 impact of activated carbon characteristics on biofilm development and activity as discussed the removal of t o compounds by ac adsorption mainly occurs within micropores 2 0 nm however as bacteria are too large to enter pores in this size range the presence of meso and macropores and general surface roughness play an important role in the development and activity of the biofilm and the transport of contaminants to the inner pores 2 163 165 wang et al 165 reported that pores in the range of 2 5 μm are the most suitable for bacterial attachment based on the analysis of removal of different fractions of nom by gac and bac contactors and extensive genomic and metaproteomic analysis lu et al 93 suggested that the bacteria in the biofilm have a preference to utilize organic matter that is already adsorbed to the gac rather than in the aqueous solution and that the reactions between exoenzymes and organic matter occurs mainly within mesopores therefore bioregeneration is proposed to occur due to the concentration gradient formed between the ac and the bulk liquid which may extract contaminants from micropores and or due to extracellular enzyme activity 4 77 given the relatively large size of bacteria and enzymes it is likely that the extracellular portion of bioregeneration only occurs on material adsorbed within the macro and mesopore region 79 93 indeed the presence of small macropores between 0 2 and 10 μm has been shown to benefit the bioregeneration ability of some bac adsorption sites 93 since t o adsorb primarily on the micropore region we hypothesize that bioregeneration of these compounds is likely to be driven by the concentration gradient mechanism fig 5 the elemental composition of ac can also have an effect on microbial cell attachment and the subsequent formation and growth of the biofilm 82 hydrophobicity the presence of oxygen functional groups and metallic oxides has been reported to generally have a positive influence on cell attachment and biodegradation of micropollutants 82 131 132 bernstein 11 conducted an extensive study on surface chemistry of virgin fresh and fully biologically active gacs contactors and concluded that both ac morphology and elemental composition change with filter age with older gacs exhibiting a mineralized surface comprising of oxygen manganese aluminium calcium and silica older contactors had lower levels of surface carbon and bacterial colonies were scattered rather than uniformly distributed in the biofilm except for these few aforementioned studies research evaluating the impact of ac characteristics on biofilm development in the context of t o biofiltration is limited and remains an important area for future investigation surface roughness has also been reported to have a significant effect on cell attachment with smoother gacs having lower capacity to hold biomass 2 4 3 physico chemical properties as indicators of biofilm performance biofilms are generally non homogeneous both in distribution throughout the ac surface and within its depth 12 the structure of the biofilm controls many processes such as microbial activity mass transfer near and within biofilms and the rate of biofilm accumulation 13 186 common parameters used to characterise the biofilm structure and infer further information about its composition can be physical such as biofilm thickness and total dry weight and chemical such as organic carbon content and oxygen demand table 4 85 145 however these parameters vary depending on multiple factors determined by the type of microorganisms present in the biofilm and may overestimate active biomass since the measurements can also include inert mass exopolymers and adsorbed organic matter 85 biofilm activity increases with thickness up to a critical point named the active thickness above which the diffusion of nutrients becomes a limiting factor to microbial metabolism 66 83 85 the thickness of this active biofilm is highly variable depending on factors such as the substrate hydraulic conditions i e shear stress water quality e g dissolved oxygen concentration and the microorganisms present in the biofilm but in general bac operating conditions should be optimised for the growth of a stable active and thin biofilm e g thicknesses from 500 μm have been reported as thin and active biofilms 85 89 91 186 additionally biofilm thickness partially controls the mass transfer of substrate onto the ac particle surface which can affect adsorption during the bac phase and can heavily impact the microbial composition 89 153 analytical techniques can be used to assess the structure of biofilms similarly to the analysis of the ac s surface assessment of the biofilm surface can be carried out by scanning electron microscopy sem and or confocal scanning laser microscopy 85 sem can also be coupled with an x ray energy dispersive system to determine elemental composition of the cells and the biofilm 85 159 most parameters that describe the internal structure of the biofilm are hard to quantify directly and are calculated through analysis of micro photographs 13 174 heydorn et al 60 developed a software that uses three dimensional stacking of biofilm images to calculate parameters such as volume surface area coverage in the different layers thickness average and distribution roughness coefficient and surface to volume ratio the authors suggested that mean thickness and the roughness coefficient were important parameters to report when describing biofilm structure 59 60 beyenal et al 12 expanded on the previous software by integrating elements of 3d image stacking into their software package additionally frozen section techniques have been used to cut thin slices of the biofilm which enables accurate measurement of biofilm thickness and the direct study of the structure of the biofilm at different biofilm depths 91 186 substantial variations in microbial populations biofilm density porosity and microbial activity with biofilm depth were observed in one study by zhang and bishop 186 which demonstrated that biofilm thickness can strongly influence microbial characteristics and spatial distribution with thicker biofilms having a lower density of active bacteria and higher porosity in the bottom layers when compared to thinner biofilms however it is unclear whether these classical structural biofilm characterisation techniques such as thickness and structural parameters are applicable in the context of bac biofiltration evidence shows that the biofilm in bac contactors in the context of drinking water treatment is loosely attached rather than a fixed and uniform biofilm with well defined structure and thickness and that most of the doc assimilated by the biofilm can become suspended cells in the effluent 11 161 the application of characterisation techniques and analyses in the context of bac and t o compounds removal remains an interesting area of research which can elucidate the importance and role of biofilm structure in the biofiltration of micropollutants biological activity and biofilm performance can also be monitored through chemical analyses table 4 for example doederer et al 31 observed a decrease in dissolved organic nitrogen and an increase in nitrate levels from influent to effluent during the transition from adsorption to biodegradation phases in a gac contactor their results corroborate the theory proposed by lapara et al 84 which based on thermodynamic calculations of ammonia and nitrite oxidation and extensive genomic sequencing suggested that both ammonification of organic nitrogen and nitrification occur in bac biofilms 4 4 biochemical properties as indicators of biofilm performance biological activity and biofilm performance can also be estimated based on biological properties for example enzymatic activity and measurements of the concentrations of metabolic by products including proteins and lipids 85 186 the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate atp triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride enzymes have been used regularly to provide an overall indicator of biological activity in drinking water systems including bac contactors 85 91 92 98 161 162 yet no studies to date have correlated the concentrations of these enzymes to the removal efficiency of t o compounds another microbial indicator of the performance of bac contactors is the diversity and abundance of microbial species in the biofilm in particular the presence of protozoan populations has been reported to reduce clogging of the contactors by controlling the biomass growth and reducing bacterial density on the filter effluent due to predation 82 118 139 140 143 166 5 modelling removal of taste and odour compounds by activated carbon contactors because of their connection to seasonal harmful algal blooms most biogenic t o compounds are not perennial contaminants 108 142 even though efforts are being made to develop real time monitoring and early detection tools for t o compounds in environmental waters 30 86 87 117 136 the most widely used techniques still require sophisticated analytical instruments and skilled operators precluding quick reactive measurement sometimes water utilities are only aware of t o events after costumer complaints are received 16 90 108 therefore it is of great interest for water utilities and researchers to develop models or indicators for estimating the remaining capacity of gac and bac contactors to remove t o compounds in case of future t o events yuan et al 180 extensively reviews general modelling techniques for adsorption and biodegradation in gac in the following sections discussion will be focused on techniques that have been applied in the context of t o 5 1 challenges of taste and odour seasonality environmental pressures shape the microbial community in a biofilm and the microorganisms that are better adapted to the conditions within that biofilm thrive 85 following changes in water quality a lag phase in which the microbial community acclimates to the new conditions is often observed which may lead to lower removal efficiency of contaminants 100 185 zearley and summers 185 concluded that sand biofilters once acclimated to mib were able to retain their capacity to remove it after non exposure periods of up to five months they further observed that after nine months of non exposure the mib removal rates decreased significantly but removal capacity was regained after 20 days of exposure the sand biofilters used by zearley and summers 185 however were continuously operated during non exposure phases by being fed with influent water that was rich in organic matter highlighting the importance of maintaining an active and healthy biofilm throughout periods of non exposure to t o compounds common procedures that can be used to control biofilm growth and activity are the management of organic and nutrient loading water flow i e ebct water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen 112 139 140 145 since there are no widely accepted guidelines that define the optimal ranges for these procedures in the literature continuous monitoring of biofilm activity is required to optimise the biodegradation of t o compounds water utilities can also control biofilm growth and manage breakthrough of organic material coming off of the biofilm by using filter backwash by controlling the backwash rate duration and frequency which helps prevent clogging of the biofilters caused by uncontrolled biofilm growth 145 an additional technique explored by mcdowall et al 98 and yagi et al 172 is the seeding of biofilters sand filter and bac respectively with a consortium of bacteria known to degrade a particular t o compounds which successfully reduced the acclimation period and promoted prompt biodegradation of geosmin and mib even in biofilters with inactivated biofilm and in biofilters previously shown not to be efficient at removing geosmin further research is recommended on seeding of bac contactors especially in the case of contactors that are not continuously operated i e gac bac contactors which are operated seasonally or only in response to known t o events and after long periods of non exposure to these compounds to further develop an appropriate methodology for seeding the frequency and intensity of t o event and local needs or regulations for removal of other micropollutants should guide plants and operators on best practices for the choice between pac gac or bac pac is generally used in treatment plants with sporadic t o events and or in which retrofitting gac contactors is too costly or unfeasible the choice between renewing gac in the contactors or letting the biofilm develop should be guided by the cost of the carbon environmental consciousness the costs and risks to effluent water quality of controlling biofilm growth and the capacity of the biofilm in each location to retain removability of t o all of which are site and region specific the american water works association published two studies on the cost of gac in the past 3 52 but an up to date comprehensive cost analysis comparing gac bac and other alternatives for the management of t o and other micropollutants is missing 5 2 direct estimation of adsorption capacity of taste and odour compounds parameters that have been successfully used as direct indicators of adsorption efficiency of mib and geosmin by fresh gac contactors include iodine value and apparent specific surface area obtained using the brunauer emmet teller bet theory 32 43 113 the american society for testing and materials suggested that tetrafluoromethane isotherms and the resulting acetoxime or trace capacity number gives information about the number of high energy adsorption sites astm international wk64555 which lead smith et al 147 to assume it would better correlate to mib adsorption when compared to iodine number and bet surface area however their results showed no predictive ability for mib adsorption by tetrafluoromethane isotherms and good correlation between mib adsorption and iodine number and bet parameters direct estimation of adsorption efficiency remains useful for comparison between different fresh gacs but in real applications the exhaustion of adsorption sites and development of the biofilm will rapidly turn these estimations obsolete 5 3 scaled down experimental tests rapid small scale column tests rssct have been used to simulate full scale data and to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic parameters to feed process based models 28 125 in this test mass transfer calculations are used to scale down the operational parameters e g ebct particle size of full scale gac contractors to small laboratory scale columns diameters around 10 mm which can undergo higher hydraulic loading rates than full scale setups to rapidly simulate aging 29 even though rsscts have been successfully used to predict fresh gac performance the test often requires the carbon granules to be crushed to an appropriate size column diameter to particle size ratio greater than fifty limiting their use for pre loaded gac due to the opening of previously blocked pores and consequent overestimation of adsorption capacity 29 46 62 81 156 similar to rssct the short bed adsorber sba methodology proposed by weber and liu 168 uses bench scale columns and a sensitivity analysis of breakthrough curves to simultaneously determine film transfer coefficients and the effective surface diffusivity of gac contractors however in contrast to rssct no scaling down calculations and crushing of the gac were required and the tests were operated at the same filtration velocity as pilot scale contactors 46 81 similar limitations to rssct on the use of the sba methodology for pre loaded gac were reported by ho and newcombe 108 as the method does not take into account biological activity the use of larger laboratory scale columns for the estimation of removal of t o compounds by biologically active bac contactors has been advised e g increase column diameter to 25 mm and information on sieving storage and transport of the activated carbon prior to the experiments to better estimate remaining removal capacity of full and pilot scale contactors have been reported 62 88 111 5 4 process based and semi empirical modelling techniques site specific equilibrium mass transfer and kinetic parameters whether obtained through rssct sba isotherm batch adsorption experiments or any other method can be used to fit mathematical models that predict the remaining removal capacity of bac contactors 72 89 125 the most widely used mathematical models combine established hydrodynamic models for particle transport through a fixed bed filter with solute adsorption modelling usually consisting of a two step diffusion the liquid particle biofilm and the intraparticle 6 125 148 models usually differ based on the intraparticle diffusion mechanism employed common examples of these models include the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm and the pore surface diffusion model psdm 125 hsdm has been identified to be effective for predicting the removal of t o compounds by fresh gacs in lab scale experiments however it has been generally unable to accurately predict behaviours in pilot and full scale filters and fails to simulate the efficiency of pre loaded gac as biological activity is not incorporated into the model 24 26 27 62 63 67 source water turbidity has been reported as an additional factor that can interfere with the prediction capabilities of the hsdm 27 based on sensitivity analysis of the hsdm to external mass transfer and diffusion coefficients ho and newcombe 108 suggested that intraparticle surface diffusion likely controls the adsorption of mib for a pre loaded gac the psdm and some variations derived from it have been successfully employed to predict the removal of t o compounds by fresh and pre loaded gac contractors for example corwin and summers 28 used the psdm modified to replace the freundlich coefficient with a coefficient that represents the apparent capacity of a specific gac for a target compound the authors concluded that adsorption of mib onto gac as well as gradient driven desorption can be estimated by this modified psdm similar conclusions were reported by summers et al 156 who successfully used the psdm to predict mib breakthrough in laboratory and pilot scale gac contractors nie 111 used the psdm to model the remaining adsorptive capacity of pre loaded gac they performed a sensitivity analysis and concluded that adsorption kinetics as opposed to thermodynamics are likely to have a greater importance for scaling down modelling results from large to small scale contactors suggesting that the percentage removal of mib by adsorption even on pre loaded gac is independent of its initial concentration similarly yuan et al 178 observed when studying modelled removal of geosmin and mib by preloaded gac under different temperatures using the psdm that water temperature has more impact on removal kinetics than thermodynamics psdm and its modifications remain promising techniques for the modelling of removal of t o compounds by gac and bac contactors other attempts to model the removal of t o compounds by gac contactors include the use of empirical kinetic models to fit bench and full scale data isothermal and kinetic models have been used to predict the adsorptive capacity for geosmin and mib of fresh gac 24 94 the freundlich isotherm or modifications of it and a pseudo second order kinetic model have been used to describe the adsorption behaviour of these compounds 24 94 the biodegradation of mib geosmin and other micropollutants in batch experiments sand filters and bac contactors has been shown to be well described by a pseudo first order reaction with ebct and influent concentration as variables both under constant and intermittent loading regime and as a primary and secondary substrate 6 61 181 184 185 pseudo first order biodegradation kinetic constants values in the ranges of 0 064 d 1 and 0 075 d 1 for mib and geosmin respectively 61 and 0 14 min 1 for mib 185 have been reported in the literature 5 5 estimating the impact of competitive adsorption the modelling of the removal of t o compounds by gac contactors in full scale treatment plants has to account for the impact of the presence of other compounds such as nom on the removal mechanisms most modelling techniques that try to incorporate the effects of competitive adsorption use the equivalent background compound ebc model which approximates the complex water matrix as a single compound with equivalent competitive adsorption effects using the ebc approximation and a theory for multicomponent adsorption interpretation the ideal adsorbed solution theory researchers have showed that the percentage removal of t o compounds in natural waters is independent of their initial concentration 44 45 48 156 187 furthermore it has been shown that the same ebc approximation for nom is applicable to both geosmin and mib adsorption 44 187 and that the ebc approximation can also be used to predict performance in biologically active gac 111 hence the effects of nom and other compounds present in drinking water sources on the removal of t o compounds can be incorporated into other modelling techniques 5 6 surrogates for taste and odour as an alternative to circumvent the need for specialist analytical equipment and skilled operators to measure t o concentrations and to provide a rapid estimation of remaining mib removal capacity greenwald et al 51 proposed the use of an organic dye xylenol orange as a surrogate to estimate the adsorption of mib onto gac while the use of surrogates is a widely employed technique in other drinking water process such as membranes and the results by greenwald et al 51 were promising it is still unclear whether this organic dye is applicable for different water sources carbon types carbon ages i e bac and t o compounds as only mib adsorption was studied by the authors further studies on the use of this and other surrogates are recommended 5 7 beyond geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol available literature on the adsorption and biofiltration of t o compounds other than geosmin and mib is limited guo et al 53 monitored the removal efficiency by ozone and bac of eighteen recurring odourants in a drinking water treatment plant including geosmin and 2mib thioethers such as dimethyl disulphide dmds and aldehydes such as hexanal heptanal nonanal and decanal most detectable odourants were readily removed by both ozonation and bac contactors the aldehydes which saw an increase in concentration due to ozonation were also successfully removed by bac 53 in a similar study guo et al 54 demonstrated that odours classified as septic musty and chemical e g geosmin mib dmds indane etc could be removed by both conventional drinking water treatment with ozonation while odours classified as fishy or grassy e g aldehydes such as 2 4 decadienal decanal nonanal and β cyclocitral were only successfully removed after the bac step xia et al 170 observed complete removal of a complex odour matrix which included geosmin mib dmds bis 2 chloroisopropyl ether bcie when gac contactors were utilised in a drinking water treatment plant even though conventional drinking water treatment with pre and post ozonation was ineffective on the removal of mib and bcie to below odour threshold levels these limited results highlight the importance of further studies on the characterisation and quantification of odourants other than geosmin and mib in the context of drinking water supply additionally these also call attention to the high efficiency of gac and bac contactors to remove complex odour matrices when other technologies seem to be more sensitive to particularly recalcitrant compounds future studies should focus on transferring current knowledge on adsorption and biofiltration of geosmin and mib to these additional odourants such as kinetic and thermodynamical analysis of the adsorption biodegradation pathways and identification of responsible microorganisms and how or if their presence affect biofilm development 6 conclusions the present review highlights current knowledge on the adsorption and biofiltration of taste and odour t o compounds by granular and activated carbon gac and bac respectively contactors despite its widespread use for the removal of micropollutants many knowledge gaps remain the mechanisms kinetic parameters and carbon characteristics that influence the adsorption of t o compounds specifically 2 methylsioborneol mib and geosmin onto activated carbon both powdered and granular are widely studied and well understood future studies should focus on the transition from fresh gac to bac including how t o removal efficiency varies throughout the contractor lifecycle and how it responds to changes in the environment and operating conditions it is proposed that biodegradation works as a secondary mechanism regenerating the carbon and maintaining longevity of bac units and that adsorption plays a major role on the removal of t o compounds in bac contactors comprehensive risk and cost analysis comparing regenerating gac or letting the biofilm develop are also topics for future research and would be required to evaluate the optimal design for a given plant more robust modelling techniques for bac need to be developed with the aim of estimating the remaining removal capacity for future t o events further understanding of the microbiome within bac particularly relating to the interactions between different microorganisms is required to identify t o removal mechanisms and reconstruct biodegradation pathways further studies on the importance and role of biofilm parameters such as thickness biomass spatial distribution and general structure in the context of t o biofiltration is yet to be explored further studies on the adsorption and biodegradation of t o compounds other than geosmin and mib are required declaration of competing interest the authors

12549,in this study the decomposition efficiency and oxidation rate of organic pollutants were improved using a combination of a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma system and fe3o4 fenton catalyst a representative advanced oxidation process aop the combined plasma fenton system showed 99 degradation of 200 mg l 1 dyes within 35 min while other aop systems achieved lesser degradation of the same concentration of dyes in 40 min no degradation in the fe3o4 fenton system and 25 in the ozone o3 system additionally 92 of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin tc cip 10 mg l 1 was effectively degraded in the plasma fenton system within 5 min in contrast to the fe3o4 fenton system the rapid degradation of organic compounds was attributed to various oxidant species including o3 h2o2 and oh from the reaction between the plasma electrode and fenton catalyst by analyzing chemically active species and interfacial reactions of the multiple hole dbd underwater plasma fenton system we improved the accessibility of aop element technology and proposed a research foundation for the decomposition reaction thereby providing a theoretical basis for developing this technology keywords multiple hole dbd advanced oxidation process aop plasma based aop plasma fenton data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip a class of antibiotics are widely used mainly to treat infections and are veterinary medicines and growth promoters 1 2 it enters directly into soil and water due to the deposition of manure from livestock 3 antibiotics are recently attracting attention as persistent pharmaceuticals in soil because of their slow decomposition and when released into soil or water bacteria to antibiotics develop resistance and pose a potential threat to humans and animals 4 in addition representative reactive dyes rhodamine b rho b reactive black 5 rb5 mainly used in the textile industry have a profound effect on aquatic organisms and humans for example it can cause increased heart rate shock vomiting and cyanosis 5 there are physical chemical and biochemical methods to remove these contaminants 6 the physical method uses ultraviolet and ultrasonic waves 7 and the biochemical method uses enzymes and bacteria 8 but enzymes and microorganisms cannot decompose dyes alone biological methods have limitations in decomposing organisms with large molecular weights chemical methods include fenton as an advanced oxidation process aop using peroxide oxidation h2o2 the advanced oxidation process aop is a method for the removal of new esoteric contaminants from various environmental media 9 for decades numerous organic compounds have been produced due to increasing human activities resulting in a large amount of industrial wastewater that is hardly purified by traditional wastewater treatment processes 10 moreover emerging pollutants have impeded wastewater purification through traditional wastewater treatment processes 11 12 aops can oxidize recalcitrant pollutants using strong reactive oxidant species ros which are produced by energy sources light ultrasonic plasma γ ray etc and chemical additives catalysts ozone h2o2 persulfate etc the underwater plasma process has received attention as a new aop method owing to its numerous advantages such as the simple configuration no chemical requirement and efficient water treatment by transferring plasma energy through water underwater plasma generates various ros oh h o o2 h2o2 and o3 and ultraviolet uv rays which oxidize pollutants and can be utilized in secondary aops such as h2o2 uv h2o2 uv o3 and o3 uv 13 16 the generated h2o2 reacts with uv light to generate oh 17 when plasma is discharged o3 is rapidly decomposed into oh and o2 in water according to the following reaction eqs 1 6 and secondary by products are not generated the chemical reactions involved in indirect oxidation with ozone are expressed in eqs 1 6 18 however the oxidative degradation of pollutants can be inhibited by the self decomposition of the generated oxidants therefore the underwater plasma process can be improved if the generated oxidant is effectively utilized 1 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 2 o 3 ho 2 ho 2 o 3 3 ho 2 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 5 o 3 h ho 3 6 ho 3 oh o 2 meanwhile the fenton reaction a representative aop can convert stable oxidants h2o2 and persulfate to more reactive forms oh and so4 in the fenton reaction oh radicals oh with a strong oxidizing capacity completely decompose organic substances into harmless compounds such as co2 h2o and inorganic salts 19 the iron catalysts used in the fenton oxidation process include fe2 or fe3 salts iron oxides such as iron iii oxide fe2o3 or iron ii iii oxide fe3o4 and zero valent iron fe0 the mechanism of oh generation in the fenton oxidation reaction is shown in eq 7 20 7 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh in the absence of organic matter in water oh reacts with iron ions or

not required 23 the fenton oxidation process is widely applied to the treatment of water pollutants that cannot be biodegraded easily although fenton oxidation is an excellent method for decomposing organic contaminants it requires a large amount of chemical input for steady operation h2o2 a source of oh is consumed by the reaction and the continuous addition of iron salt is required to avoid the decrease in reaction activity several studies investigating alternative processes such as the sono fenton electro fenton and photo fenton processes have attempted to overcome the limitations of the fenton reaction each of the studies used external energy sources light electricity and ultrasound to assist in the generation of oxidants and increase the reaction rate involved in the rate determining steps 24 25 recently these methods have been continuously studied to improve their efficiency however more studies are required to solve the challenges of economic feasibility and utility in this study we constructed a hybrid water treatment system for the multiple hole dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and heterogeneous fenton reaction and examined its oxidative degradation performance the plasma fenton process efficiently produced oxidant species using low electrical power and showed excellent effects on the decomposition of organic pollutants dyes and antibiotics by adding only iron oxide to confirm the ability of the plasma system in generating oxidants the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 were measured additionally by varying the gas flow the optimal operating conditions were identified applied electric power and fe3o4 amount based on the optimized conditions the properties of the dyes and antibiotics treated using the multiple hole dbd were investigated 2

outer diameter of 14 mm an inner diameter of 10 mm a length of 250 mm and several holes 0 2 mm in diameter to facilitate the circulation of water gas flowed through the external dielectric and the steel in the high voltage electrode cooled the heat generated by the plasma when the gas passed through it multiple holes which were created for water circulation increased the contact area between the plasma and water when water was dispersed preliminary tests for the generation of reactive oxidants were conducted with varying airflow rates and electrical power to determine the optimal

2 shows the results of ozone and h2o2 generation according to the injected air flow rate the concentrations of ozone and h2o2 were measured by changing the air flow rate at an applied power of 100 w fig 2 a shows the time dependent concentration of o3 produced from the multiple hole dbd passing through water the average concentrations were 1238 954 and 705 mg l 1 at flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 respectively for 30 min the concentration of ozone was maximized at 20 l min 1 because the contact time between the air and the plasma generator increased with decreasing airflow rate fig 2 b shows the concentration of h2o2 generated in the dbd plasma system as a function of time the concentrations of h2o2 in 30 min were 4 4 3 17 and 2 84 mg l 1 at gas flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 as the flow rate increased the h2o2 concentration decreased and the h2o2 concentration changed linearly with the flow rate h2o2 generated from water is hardly affected by temperature because it decomposes at temperatures of approximately 100 280 c 27 in this study the decomposition of water was mostly achieved by plasma columns in contact with the water surface plasma columns are affected by the electric fields and gas densities according to en 1 where e is the electric field and n is the gas density plasma plumes are strongly generated under low gas density conditions and affect the decomposition of water 26 the amount of h2o2 measured with increasing gas flow rate is shown in fig 2 b therefore the optimal flow rate was determined to be 20 l min 1 according to the o3 and h2o2 concentrations 3 2 effect of electric power in the dbd plasma and fenton combined system a dbd plasma system was combined with the fenton reaction to increase the utilization efficiency of reactive oxidants to investigate the effect of the applied power on the decomposition of the dye solution power was applied at 60 w 80 w and 100 w and analyzed representative reactive dyes rho b and rb5 were selected to confirm the decomposition efficiency of the applied power in the dbd plasma system the dye concentration was determined to be 100 mg l 1 while controlling the experimental parameters the results for rho b in distilled water dw are shown in fig 3 a b the decomposition efficiency of rho b increased proportionally with applied power the decomposition efficiency was compared after 5 min of reaction and when the reaction was completed after 30 min the pseudo first order rate constants k for rho b degradation in 30 min were calculated according to the applied power and were approximately 5 39 5 82 and 5 92 h 1 at 60 80 and 100 w respectively the degradation of rb5 fig 3 c d showed a similar trend to that of rho b all the applied power values had a potential to treat almost 100 of rb5 within 30 min and the degradation rate constant k showed slight differences 6 8 7 12 and 7 21 h 1 at 60 80 and 100 w respectively in other words there was no significant difference in the decomposition efficiency of the dye compounds with respect to the applied power 3 3 dye degradation as a function of the air flow rate in the operation test of the plasma reactor the airflow rate affected the generation of h2o2 and o3 the plasma density decreased with increasing air flow rate 1 67 1 29 and 1 09 w l at air flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 respectively 28 consequently the concentrations of h2o2 and o3 showed the highest values at an air flow rate of 20 l min 1 fig 2 the air bubble may block the surface of the plasma electrode which explains the decrease in the generation of plasma with increasing airflow rate fig 4 shows the dye degradation as a function of the air flow rate in the case of 100 mg l 1 of rb5 solution fig 4 when the gas flow rate was 20 l min 1 100 of the rb5 solution was rapidly decomposed within 30 min after 30 min the decomposition efficiencies were approximately 93 4 and 79 at gas flow rates of 30 l min 1 and 40 l min 1 respectively the decomposition efficiency gradually decreased with increasing gas flow rates 3 4 optimization of dye concentration to date the operating parameters of the plasma reactor have been determined in this section the oxidation of dyes was conducted in the presence and absence of a metal catalyst the appropriate dye concentration was determined by varying the dye concentration during decomposition using multiple hole dbd plasma rho b and rb5 were used as the target dye compounds in this experiment the oxidation results are shown in fig 5 with varying concentrations of dye compounds from 10 to 200 mg l 1 sampling was performed every 1 min and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer when the concentrations of rho b and rb5 were 10 mg l 1 they decomposed within 3 min and when they were 20 mg l 1 they rapidly decomposed within 5 min when their concentrations were 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 they mostly decomposed within 10 20 and 30 min respectively rho b and rb5 were decomposed by oh radicals and o3 which are strong oxidizing agents in the dbd plasma system this result indicated that the degradation by plasma decreased with increasing dye concentrations 29 in particular it was observed that the degradation performance was not affected in the concentration range that could be degraded by the dbd system but was significantly affected at concentrations above the limiting concentration namely the penetration of dbd into the solution with a high dye concentration decreases and the oh radicals also gradually decreased therefore sufficient oh radicals must be generated to effectively decompose pollutants using a dbd plasma system controlling the optimal concentration range is necessary to ensure that the occurrence is not affected in this study the limit dye concentration was continuously fixed at 200 mg l 1 for consistency 3 5 effect of the amount of fe3o4 catalyst the characterization and morphology of the commercial fe3o4 are shown in fig s1 the effect on dye decomposition was investigated by increasing the amount of fe3o4 catalyst to 0 1 and 2 g l 1 while keeping the power and gas flow rate constant 100 w 20 l min 1 decomposition tests of rho b and rb5 dyes in dw were performed to investigate the catalytic reactivity of the fe3o4 catalyst and the results for rho b are shown in fig 6 a b which shows that the degradation efficiencies after the completion of the catalytic reaction for 0 30 min increased slightly from 98 9 to 99 5 when the amount of fe3o4 catalyst increased by 1 g l 1 the degradation rate k is related to the degradation efficiency the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 similarly in the case of the rb5 dye fig 6 c d when the amount of catalyst fe3o4 was increased from 0 to 1 g l 1 and measured at 5 min intervals up to 30 min the decomposition efficiency increased from 95 to 97 4 however if an excessive amount of the catalyst is injected oh radicals may be lost the removal efficiency may decrease and the removal cost may increase as the amount of fe3o4 catalyst injected was increased to 1 g l 1 the removal effect improved however the injection of more catalyst did not significantly affect the decomposition efficiency rather it decreased the removal rate therefore in this study the amount of fe3o4 catalyst was determined to be 1 g l 1 to achieve maximum dye removal efficiency 3 6 degradation of tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip degradation of tc and cip was conducted using a plasma system and the change in concentration was monitored by uv vis spectroscopy fig 7 in this experiment the decomposition efficiency was evaluated by adding fe3o4 fenton catalyst for the decomposition of tc a drug only the dbd plasma system showed a degradation efficiency of 89 7 and a degradation rate constant k of 2 27 h 1 notably the dbd plasma system with the fe3o4 catalyst showed almost complete removal 96 efficiency within 5 min and a higher degradation rate constant k 4 22 h 1 even when the target organic compound was changed from tc to cip the degradation efficiency and rate constant showed similar trends fe3o4 enhanced the cip degradation efficiency and degradation rate in the dbd plasma system when the fe3o4 catalyst was added cip showed a degradation efficiency of approximately 92 after the reaction additionally transformation products in the decomposition process can be identified by lc ms and based on these results we observed the mechanism by which tc and cip were degraded for the analysis we evaluated the tc and cip solutions before and after 5 min of digestion via lc ms monitoring in positive mode fig s2 the degradation signal was confirmed using tc and cip which are antibiotics the decomposition pathway of the tc solution occurs when various reactive oxidizing agents with short lifetimes oh h o and o2 and long lifetimes h2o2 and o3 are generated the interaction between the oxidants increased the persistence of the oxidant reactivity for tc this can further enhance the interaction between the active radicals and tc molecules 30 lc ms monitoring revealed a specific peak distinguishable from tc in the decomposition product forming an intermediate product generated in the dbd plasma system the peaks identified in the degradation pathway of tc are by products with mass to charge ratios m z of 445 443 444 446 and 448 by measuring tc molecules through protonation in the lc ms mode a value corresponding to 445 m z was obtained this degradation pathway is consistent with the results of the uv vis data and indicates gradual degradation of tc over time the results indicate that the degradation was caused by various active species when the peak of tc at 445 m z was confirmed using lc ms monitoring tc was completely decomposed after 5 min of the reaction piperazine rings and quinolones were identified as the byproducts of the cip digestion pathway using lc ms these by products are produced by the radical breakdown of the cip hydroxyl group 31 32 therefore a mechanism of the catalytic degradation of cip was proposed as shown in fig s2 the peak of the quantized cip with an m z value of 332 2 in the mass spectrum was obtained using the dbd plasma system 3 7 main oxidants for the degradation of organic pollutants in the degradation of organic pollutants the superior oxidation capability of the developed plasma system was proven which could be attributed to the large amount of generated o3 and the derived reactive oxidant as described the plasma system first activates oxygen near the electrode by transferring the discharged electrons and the activated oxygen is then transformed into various ros including o3 as shown in fig 2 the concentration of o3 was approximately 280 times higher than that of h2o2 which demonstrates that o3 was easily derived from the activated oxygen and would be the main source for the oxidation of organic compounds however the generated o3 was insufficient to demonstrate the rapid degradation of concentrated organic pollutants fig s3 shows the degradation of target organic dyes using only o3 the concentration of the organic dyes was 200 mg l 1 which was the same as that in the experimental condition of the plasma system we confirmed that the single injection of o3 oxidized a lower amount of organic dyes compared to the plasma system achieving approximately 20 of dye degradation in 40 min although o3 is a relatively strong oxidant e o3 o2 2 07 vnhe the rate constants of o3 for the oxidation of organic compounds are relatively lower than those of other reactive oxidants such as oh k o3 10 2 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 108 1010 m 1 s 1 33 34 therefore the plasma system used in this study is considered to use a high concentration of o3 by transforming it into more reactive oxidants such as oh through the generated uv light and h2o2 additionally the plasma water treatment system showed a synergistic effect on drug degradation in the presence of fe3o4 particles fig 7 when 1 g l 1 of fe3o4 was added to the plasma system the degradation rates of tc and cip were higher as mentioned a high concentration of o3 was dissolved in the proposed plasma system and fe3o4 was expected to play a role in transforming the concentrated o3 to oh as reported in previous studies 35 36 in eqs 20 22 fe ions that combined with ozone decomposed into oh radicals through oxidation reduction reaction and finally decomposed into harmless water 37 38 20 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 21 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh 22 feo 2 fe 2 2h 2fe 3 h 2 o 3 8 cytotoxicity assay analysis the biocompatibility of the antibiotic degradation solution in plasma system devices evaluated by cytotoxicity experiment against hek 293 cell line through cck 8 assay the cell viability test data was obtained after incubation of the cells with the antibiotic degradation solution for 24 h fig 8 as a result in the presence of tetracycline cell viability was about 75 and cell viability when decomposed through a plasma system was about 92 or more confirming that there was almost non cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study a dbd plasma system was constructed to degrade dyes and drugs and we devised a way to improve their degradation efficiency using the fe3o4 fenton catalyst in the process of selecting the operating conditions we found that more organic dyes were degraded when the amount of injected air flow was less owing to the decreased generation of plasma by the covered air bubble on the electrode surface conversely the increase in the electrical power input was relatively less effective for the degradation of dyes in this study additionally an optimal amount of fe3o4 was significant to improve the degradation efficiency of organic compounds because an excessive amount of fe3o4 disrupted the water purification by blocking the plasma transmittance the constructed plasma fenton system was effective in degrading various types of organic compounds through chemical species with strong oxidizing power such as o3 uv and oh radicals generated from the plasma in particular the water treatment system showed rapid oxidation of organic pollutants without h2o2 addition and ph adjustment although the system used the fenton reaction which is applicable for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants the plasma fenton system has the potential for application in practical water treatment processes owing to its high efficiency in pollutant removal which cannot be achieved by traditional biological and physical water treatment processes credit authorship

12549,in this study the decomposition efficiency and oxidation rate of organic pollutants were improved using a combination of a dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma system and fe3o4 fenton catalyst a representative advanced oxidation process aop the combined plasma fenton system showed 99 degradation of 200 mg l 1 dyes within 35 min while other aop systems achieved lesser degradation of the same concentration of dyes in 40 min no degradation in the fe3o4 fenton system and 25 in the ozone o3 system additionally 92 of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin tc cip 10 mg l 1 was effectively degraded in the plasma fenton system within 5 min in contrast to the fe3o4 fenton system the rapid degradation of organic compounds was attributed to various oxidant species including o3 h2o2 and oh from the reaction between the plasma electrode and fenton catalyst by analyzing chemically active species and interfacial reactions of the multiple hole dbd underwater plasma fenton system we improved the accessibility of aop element technology and proposed a research foundation for the decomposition reaction thereby providing a theoretical basis for developing this technology keywords multiple hole dbd advanced oxidation process aop plasma based aop plasma fenton data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip a class of antibiotics are widely used mainly to treat infections and are veterinary medicines and growth promoters 1 2 it enters directly into soil and water due to the deposition of manure from livestock 3 antibiotics are recently attracting attention as persistent pharmaceuticals in soil because of their slow decomposition and when released into soil or water bacteria to antibiotics develop resistance and pose a potential threat to humans and animals 4 in addition representative reactive dyes rhodamine b rho b reactive black 5 rb5 mainly used in the textile industry have a profound effect on aquatic organisms and humans for example it can cause increased heart rate shock vomiting and cyanosis 5 there are physical chemical and biochemical methods to remove these contaminants 6 the physical method uses ultraviolet and ultrasonic waves 7 and the biochemical method uses enzymes and bacteria 8 but enzymes and microorganisms cannot decompose dyes alone biological methods have limitations in decomposing organisms with large molecular weights chemical methods include fenton as an advanced oxidation process aop using peroxide oxidation h2o2 the advanced oxidation process aop is a method for the removal of new esoteric contaminants from various environmental media 9 for decades numerous organic compounds have been produced due to increasing human activities resulting in a large amount of industrial wastewater that is hardly purified by traditional wastewater treatment processes 10 moreover emerging pollutants have impeded wastewater purification through traditional wastewater treatment processes 11 12 aops can oxidize recalcitrant pollutants using strong reactive oxidant species ros which are produced by energy sources light ultrasonic plasma γ ray etc and chemical additives catalysts ozone h2o2 persulfate etc the underwater plasma process has received attention as a new aop method owing to its numerous advantages such as the simple configuration no chemical requirement and efficient water treatment by transferring plasma energy through water underwater plasma generates various ros oh h o o2 h2o2 and o3 and ultraviolet uv rays which oxidize pollutants and can be utilized in secondary aops such as h2o2 uv h2o2 uv o3 and o3 uv 13 16 the generated h2o2 reacts with uv light to generate oh 17 when plasma is discharged o3 is rapidly decomposed into oh and o2 in water according to the following reaction eqs 1 6 and secondary by products are not generated the chemical reactions involved in indirect oxidation with ozone are expressed in eqs 1 6 18 however the oxidative degradation of pollutants can be inhibited by the self decomposition of the generated oxidants therefore the underwater plasma process can be improved if the generated oxidant is effectively utilized 1 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 2 o 3 ho 2 ho 2 o 3 3 ho 2 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 5 o 3 h ho 3 6 ho 3 oh o 2 meanwhile the fenton reaction a representative aop can convert stable

such as co2 h2o and inorganic salts 19 the iron catalysts used in the fenton oxidation process include fe2 or fe3 salts iron oxides such as iron iii oxide fe2o3 or iron ii iii oxide fe3o4 and zero valent iron fe0 the mechanism of oh generation in the fenton oxidation reaction is shown in eq 7 20 7 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh in the absence of organic matter in water oh reacts with iron ions or

r fe 2 12 r oh r oh as the fenton reaction oxidizes the organic pollutants to inorganic matter no harmful by products are created and post treatment processes such as adsorption or agglomeration are not required 23 the fenton oxidation process is widely applied to the treatment of water pollutants that cannot be biodegraded easily although fenton oxidation is an excellent method for decomposing organic contaminants it requires a large amount of chemical input for steady operation h2o2 a source of oh is consumed by the reaction and the continuous addition of iron salt is required to avoid the decrease in reaction activity several studies investigating alternative processes such as the sono fenton electro fenton and photo fenton processes have attempted to overcome the limitations of the fenton reaction each of the studies used external energy sources light electricity and ultrasound to assist in the generation of oxidants and increase the reaction rate involved in the rate determining steps 24 25 recently these methods have been continuously studied to improve their efficiency however more studies are required to solve the challenges of economic feasibility and utility in this study we constructed a hybrid water treatment system for the multiple hole dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and heterogeneous fenton reaction and examined its oxidative degradation performance the plasma fenton process efficiently produced oxidant species using low electrical power and showed excellent effects on the decomposition of organic pollutants dyes and antibiotics by adding only iron oxide to confirm the ability of the plasma system in generating oxidants the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 were measured additionally by varying the gas flow the optimal operating conditions were identified applied electric power and fe3o4 amount based on the optimized conditions the properties of the dyes and antibiotics treated using the multiple hole dbd were investigated 2

reactive black 5 rb5 tetracycline tc ciprofloxacin cip a stock solution of the target organic contaminant was prepared using 18 2 mω cm of deionized water each stock solution was prepared before the performance evaluations of the developed aop system 2 2 an underwater multiple hole dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma system catalytic aop experiments were performed in a multiple hole dbd plasma system designed as described in previous studies for electrode configuration and effects 13 fig 1 a shows the detailed configuration of the multiple hole dbd plasma system used in this study a cuboid water vessel equipped with a plasma generator contained the reaction solution for water treatment the high alternating current ac voltage power supply mhdbd 150 used for plasma generation comprised a rectification circuit switching circuit and step up transformer the applied power was controlled by adjusting the frequency of the switching circuit with a maximum output voltage of 15 kv fig 1 b shows the configuration of the plasma generator asymmetric electrode in this system the device was designed to be switched off at lower voltages owing to the asymmetric and strong electric fields this plasma generator consisted of a ground electrode and a high voltage electrode the inner dielectric was made of alumina and the outer dielectric was made of quartz the quartz tube had an outer diameter of 14 mm an inner diameter of 10 mm a length of 250 mm and several holes 0 2 mm in diameter to facilitate the circulation of water gas flowed through the external dielectric and the steel in the high voltage electrode cooled the heat generated by the plasma when the gas passed through it multiple holes which were created for water circulation increased the contact area between the plasma and water when water was dispersed preliminary tests for the generation of reactive oxidants were conducted with varying airflow rates and electrical power to determine the optimal operational parameters in this test the dbd plasma for water treatment was optimally generated at an applied power and airflow of 100 w and 20 l min 1 respectively and the operational frequency was approximately 22 khz 2 3 characterization to analyze the physical chemical and morphological properties of commercial fe3o4 the crystalline phases of the samples were investigated through x ray

shimadzu japan in the 300 800 nm region for rb5 and rho b and the 250 450 nm region for tc and cip the concentrations of the degraded rb5 and rho b solutions were estimated from the absorbance peak intensities at 598 and 555 nm respectively the reductions in tc and cip concentrations in the medium were measured using uv vis spectroscopy at λ max values of 357 and 275 nm respectively the changes in the rb5 rho b tc and cip concentrations ln c0 c kt where k is the apparent reaction rate constant and c0 and c are the initial and reaction concentrations of the different reagents at various reaction times respectively were also investigated subsequently we quantified the remaining concentrations of rb5 rho b tc and cip in the aqueous solution products under different reaction conditions by measuring the absorption intensity at the μmax of rb5 rho b tc and cip according to a calibration curve the decomposition rate was determined as follows 14 14 decomposition rate 1 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 represents the initial concentrations of rb5 rho b and tc cip and ct mg l 1 represents the respective concentrations after removal liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry lc ms ultimate 3000

the significance between the groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of the operation parameters in dbd plasma as mentioned above the optimal generation of reactive oxidants was conducted by varying the airflow rate and electrical power in this preliminary step among the various active species o3 h2o2 no2 etc generated during dbd ozone is generated by eqs 15 17 through three body reactions 15 ozone is generated when oxygen molecules accept electrons and split into oxygen atoms when oxygen atoms are created ozone is formed through a rapid three body reaction with m n2 in this experiment and oxygen molecules 16 ozone is a powerful reactive oxidizing agent that can directly oxidize organic pollutants e o3 o2 2 07 vnhe and generate other strong reactive oxidants e g oh o2 26 therefore it is important to check the concentration of the generated ozone to evaluate the performance of the dbd plasma 15 o 2 e 2o e 16 n 2 o 2 n 2 2o 17 o 2 o m o 3 m 18 3 o 3 oh h 2 ho 4 o 2 fig 2 shows the results of ozone and h2o2 generation according to the injected air flow rate the concentrations of ozone and h2o2 were measured by changing the air flow rate at an applied power of 100 w fig 2 a shows the time dependent concentration of o3 produced from the multiple hole dbd passing through water the average concentrations were 1238 954 and 705 mg l 1 at flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 respectively for 30 min the concentration of ozone was maximized at 20 l min 1 because the contact time between the air and the plasma generator increased with decreasing airflow rate fig 2 b shows the concentration of h2o2 generated in the dbd plasma system as a function of time the concentrations of h2o2 in 30 min were 4 4 3 17 and 2 84 mg l 1 at gas flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 as the flow rate increased the h2o2 concentration decreased and the h2o2 concentration changed linearly with the flow rate h2o2 generated from water is hardly affected by temperature because it decomposes at temperatures of approximately 100 280 c 27 in this study the decomposition of water was mostly achieved by plasma columns in contact with the water surface plasma columns are affected by the electric fields and gas densities according to en 1 where e is the electric field and n is the gas density plasma plumes are strongly generated under low gas density conditions and affect the decomposition of water 26 the amount of h2o2 measured with increasing gas flow rate is shown in fig 2 b therefore the optimal flow rate was determined to be 20 l min 1 according to the o3 and h2o2 concentrations 3 2 effect of electric power in the dbd plasma and fenton combined system a dbd plasma system was combined with the fenton reaction to increase the utilization efficiency of reactive oxidants to investigate the effect of the applied power on the decomposition of the dye solution power was applied at 60 w 80 w and 100 w and analyzed representative reactive dyes rho b and rb5 were selected to confirm the decomposition efficiency of the applied power in the dbd plasma system the dye concentration was determined to be 100 mg l 1 while controlling the experimental parameters the results for rho b in distilled water dw are shown in fig 3 a b the decomposition efficiency of rho b increased proportionally with applied power the decomposition efficiency was compared after 5 min of reaction and when the reaction was completed after 30 min the pseudo first order rate constants k for rho b degradation in 30 min were calculated according to the applied power and were approximately 5 39 5 82 and 5 92 h 1 at 60 80 and 100 w respectively the degradation of rb5 fig 3 c d showed a similar trend to that of rho b all the applied power values had a potential to treat almost 100 of rb5 within 30 min and the degradation rate constant k showed slight differences 6 8 7 12 and 7 21 h 1 at 60 80 and 100 w respectively in other words there was no significant difference in the decomposition efficiency of the dye compounds with respect to the applied power 3 3 dye degradation as a function of the air flow rate in the operation test of the plasma reactor the airflow rate affected the generation of h2o2 and o3 the plasma density decreased with increasing air flow rate 1 67 1 29 and 1 09 w l at air flow rates of 20 30 and 40 l min 1 respectively 28 consequently the concentrations of h2o2 and o3 showed the highest values at an air flow rate of 20 l min 1 fig 2 the air bubble may block the surface of the plasma electrode which explains the decrease in the generation of plasma with increasing airflow rate fig 4 shows the dye degradation as a function of the air flow rate in the case of 100 mg l 1 of rb5 solution fig 4 when the gas flow rate was 20 l min 1 100 of the rb5 solution was rapidly decomposed within 30 min after 30 min the decomposition efficiencies were approximately 93 4 and 79 at gas flow rates of 30 l min 1 and 40 l min 1 respectively the decomposition efficiency gradually decreased with increasing gas flow rates 3 4 optimization of dye concentration to date the operating parameters of the plasma reactor have been determined in this section the oxidation of dyes was conducted in the presence and absence of a metal catalyst the appropriate dye concentration was determined by varying the dye concentration during decomposition using multiple hole dbd plasma rho b and rb5 were used as the target dye compounds in this experiment the oxidation results are shown in fig 5 with varying concentrations of dye compounds from 10 to 200 mg l 1 sampling was performed every 1 min and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer when the concentrations of rho b and rb5 were 10 mg l 1 they decomposed within 3 min and when they were 20 mg l 1 they rapidly decomposed within 5 min when their concentrations were 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 they mostly decomposed within 10 20 and 30 min respectively rho b and rb5 were decomposed by oh radicals and o3 which are strong oxidizing agents in the dbd plasma system this result indicated that the degradation by plasma decreased with increasing dye concentrations 29 in particular it was observed that the degradation performance was not affected in the concentration range that could be degraded by the dbd system but was significantly affected at concentrations above the limiting concentration namely the penetration of dbd into the solution with a high dye concentration decreases and the oh radicals also gradually decreased therefore sufficient oh radicals must be generated to effectively decompose pollutants using a dbd plasma system controlling the optimal concentration range is necessary to ensure that the occurrence is not affected in this study the limit dye concentration was continuously fixed at 200 mg l 1 for consistency 3 5 effect of the amount of fe3o4 catalyst the characterization and morphology of the commercial fe3o4 are shown in fig s1 the effect on dye decomposition was investigated by increasing the amount of fe3o4 catalyst to 0 1 and 2 g l 1 while keeping the power and gas flow rate constant 100 w 20 l min 1 decomposition tests of rho b and rb5 dyes in dw were performed to investigate the catalytic reactivity of the fe3o4 catalyst and the results for rho b are shown in fig 6 a b which shows that the degradation efficiencies after the completion of the catalytic reaction for 0 30 min increased slightly from 98 9 to 99 5 when the amount of fe3o4 catalyst increased by 1 g l 1 the degradation rate k is related to the degradation efficiency the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 similarly in the case of the rb5 dye fig 6 c d when the amount of catalyst fe3o4 was increased from 0 to 1 g l 1 and measured at 5 min intervals up to 30 min the decomposition efficiency increased from 95 to 97 4 however if an excessive amount of the catalyst is injected oh radicals may be lost the removal efficiency may decrease and the removal cost may increase as the amount of fe3o4 catalyst injected was increased to 1 g l 1 the removal effect improved however the injection of more catalyst did not significantly affect the decomposition efficiency rather it decreased the removal rate therefore in this study the amount of fe3o4 catalyst was determined to be 1 g l 1 to achieve maximum dye removal efficiency 3 6 degradation of tetracycline tc and ciprofloxacin cip degradation of tc and cip was conducted using a plasma system and the change in concentration was monitored by uv vis spectroscopy fig 7 in this experiment the decomposition efficiency was evaluated by adding fe3o4 fenton catalyst for the decomposition of tc a drug only the dbd plasma system showed a degradation efficiency of 89 7 and a degradation rate constant k of 2 27 h 1 notably the dbd plasma system with the fe3o4 catalyst showed almost complete removal 96 efficiency within 5 min and a higher degradation rate constant k 4 22 h 1 even when the target organic compound was changed from tc to cip the degradation efficiency and rate constant showed similar trends fe3o4 enhanced the cip degradation efficiency and degradation rate in the dbd plasma system when the fe3o4 catalyst was added cip showed a degradation efficiency of approximately 92 after the reaction additionally transformation products in the decomposition process can be identified by lc ms and based on these results we observed the mechanism by which tc and cip were degraded for the analysis we evaluated the tc and cip solutions before and after 5 min of digestion via lc ms monitoring in positive mode fig s2 the degradation signal was confirmed using tc and cip which are antibiotics the decomposition pathway of the tc solution occurs when various reactive oxidizing agents with short lifetimes oh h o and o2 and long lifetimes h2o2 and o3 are generated the interaction between the oxidants increased the persistence of the oxidant reactivity for tc this can further enhance the interaction between the active radicals and tc molecules 30 lc ms monitoring revealed a specific peak distinguishable from tc in the decomposition product forming an intermediate product generated in the dbd plasma system the peaks identified in the degradation pathway of tc are by products with mass to charge ratios m z of 445 443 444 446 and 448 by measuring tc molecules through protonation in the lc ms mode a value corresponding to 445 m z was obtained this degradation pathway is consistent with the results of the uv vis data and indicates gradual degradation of tc over time the results indicate that the degradation was caused by various active species when the peak of tc at 445 m z was confirmed using lc ms monitoring tc was completely decomposed after 5 min of the reaction piperazine rings and quinolones were identified as the byproducts of the cip digestion pathway using lc ms these by products are produced by the radical breakdown of the cip hydroxyl group 31 32 therefore a mechanism of the catalytic degradation of cip was proposed as shown in fig s2 the peak of the quantized cip with an m z value of 332 2 in the mass spectrum was obtained using the dbd plasma system 3 7 main oxidants for the degradation of organic pollutants in the degradation of organic pollutants the superior oxidation capability of the developed plasma system was proven which could be attributed to the large amount of generated o3 and the derived reactive oxidant as described the plasma system first activates oxygen near the electrode by transferring the discharged electrons and the activated oxygen is then transformed into various ros including o3 as shown in fig 2 the concentration of o3 was approximately 280 times higher than that of h2o2 which demonstrates that o3 was easily derived from the activated oxygen and would be the main source for the oxidation of organic compounds however the generated o3 was insufficient to demonstrate the rapid degradation of concentrated organic pollutants fig s3 shows the degradation of target organic dyes using only o3 the concentration of the organic dyes was 200 mg l 1 which was the same as that in the experimental condition of the plasma system we confirmed that the single injection of o3 oxidized a lower amount of organic dyes compared to the plasma system achieving approximately 20 of dye degradation in 40 min although o3 is a relatively strong oxidant e o3 o2 2 07 vnhe the rate constants of o3 for the oxidation of organic compounds are relatively lower than those of other reactive oxidants such as oh k o3 10 2 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 108 1010 m 1 s 1 33 34 therefore the plasma system used in this study is considered to use a high concentration of o3 by transforming it into more reactive oxidants such as oh through the generated uv light and h2o2 additionally the plasma water treatment system showed a synergistic effect on drug degradation in the presence of fe3o4 particles fig 7 when 1 g l 1 of fe3o4 was added to the plasma system the degradation rates of tc and cip were higher as mentioned a high concentration of o3 was dissolved in the proposed plasma system and fe3o4 was expected to play a role in transforming the concentrated o3 to oh as reported in previous studies 35 36 in eqs 20 22 fe ions that combined with ozone decomposed into oh radicals through oxidation reduction reaction and finally decomposed into harmless water 37 38 20 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 21 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh 22 feo 2 fe 2 2h 2fe 3 h 2 o 3 8 cytotoxicity assay analysis the biocompatibility of the antibiotic degradation solution in plasma system devices evaluated by cytotoxicity experiment against hek 293 cell line through cck 8 assay the cell viability test data was obtained after incubation of the cells with the antibiotic degradation solution for 24 h fig 8 as a result in the presence of tetracycline cell viability was about 75 and cell viability when decomposed through a plasma system was about 92 or more confirming that there was almost non cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study a dbd plasma system was constructed to degrade dyes and drugs and we devised a way to improve their degradation efficiency using the fe3o4 fenton catalyst in the process of selecting the operating conditions we found that more organic dyes were degraded when the amount of injected air flow was less owing to the decreased generation of plasma by the covered air bubble on the electrode surface conversely the increase in the electrical power input was relatively less effective for the degradation of dyes in this study additionally an optimal amount of fe3o4 was significant to improve the degradation efficiency of organic compounds because an excessive amount of fe3o4 disrupted the water purification by blocking the plasma transmittance the constructed plasma fenton system was effective in degrading various types of organic compounds through chemical species with strong oxidizing power such as o3 uv and oh radicals generated from the plasma in particular the water treatment system showed rapid oxidation of organic pollutants without h2o2 addition and ph adjustment although the system used the fenton reaction which is applicable for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants the plasma fenton system has the potential for application in practical water treatment processes owing to its high efficiency in pollutant removal which cannot be achieved by traditional biological and physical water treatment processes credit authorship
