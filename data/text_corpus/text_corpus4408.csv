22040,the welding deformation considerably plays a vital role in the production accuracy and efficiency of marine structures in this study welding deformation due to three outside corner joints with angles of 60 70 and 140 used in an aluminum catamaran hull is evaluated by considering the length and welding speed parameters the deformation is predicted via two numerical procedures based on finite element computations thermal elastic plastic tep analysis is applied on local 3d solid models for each of the three outside corner joints to calculate inherent strain for global shell model of an aluminum catamaran to obtain deformation elastically based on inherent deformation theory validations of numerical results were performed by using metallographic observations and welding distortion for more accuracy the softening effect was investigated by vickers microhardness test the results from both tep and fe elastic analyses indicate reasonably good agreement with experimental results besides in the global shell model of the catamaran out of plane welding deformation will occur significantly near the maximum angle of outside corner joint 140 degree where the maximum welding distortion is obtained along with the welding speed parameter has considerable influence on decreasing distortion which results in reducing time consuming and cost in the catamaran production stage keywords aluminum 5083 h111 sheet welding outside corner joint inherent strain method out of plane deformation welding speed 1 introduction fusion welding process is used to join metals productively in a variety of manufacturing industries including shipbuilding whereabouts not only has arc welding process employed to assemble thin plates of steel maritime structures but also it is used noticeably in modern aluminum high speed catamarans high speed catamarans have been developed by using lightweight marine grade aluminum alloy hull to improve high speed sea transportation particularly for offshore applications in addition reaching low wave making resistance and high transverse stability features of high speed catamaran have been a significant challenge by generating sufficient hull form which is related to how the manufacture process of hull is done yun and bliault 2012 yun et al 2019 aluminum 5083 is one of the most important aluminum marine grades which are commonly replaced by steels in construction of high speed vessel s hulls to substantially reduce fuel consumption and promote efficiency gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and gas metal arc welding gmaw are two kinds of arc welding processes which are commonly used to weld aluminum alloys liu et al 2012 compared gas tungsten arc welding with gas metal arc welding process in terms of weldments mechanical properties of aluminum 5083 they showed gtaw causes more strength and ductility in weldments without existing any microstructure defect compared with gmaw meanwhile using a mobile concentrated heat source in these types of welding process it results in non uniform expansion and contraction and hence distortion after cooling cycle in other words the stress comes from thermal contraction and solidification shrinkage of weld metal results in distortion that can be divided into in plane shrinkages and out of plane deformations like angular distortion and buckling distortion induced by local concentrating heat of welding process affects ultimate strength and manufacturing accuracy of structures substantially considering high coefficient of thermal expansion in aluminum alloy which is about twice of that in a similar steel structure a greater distortion has been expected in aluminum welding process mathers 2002 the worst problem of welding distortion is decreasing performance and dimensional accuracy in welded structures resulting in an increased time and cost in the manufacturing and repairing processes tsai et al 1999 generally categorized variables into two cases named design related and process related variables that affect welding distortion some significant design related factors consist of plate thickness details of weld joint and material properties the important process related variables comprise welding speed heat input and sequence of welding process therefore welding induced distortion in design of hull shape needs to be considered in such a way that changes with geometry of the weld zone welding sequence constraints and welding input parameters therefore proper design and careful selection of these parameters play a significant role in control of distortion by developing computational methods finite element analysis fea has been employed to predict quantitatively the influence of different parameters on deformation due to welding process in particular out of plane deformation like buckling occurred commonly in thin walled welded structures guo et al 2016 ueda et al 2012 at the beginning thermal elastic plastic method tep was used by ueda and yamakawa 1971 to evaluate welding process goldak j et al 1984 modeled mathematically a welding heat source with a double ellipsoid based on gaussian distribution of power density in that model temperature distribution contours were used to verify theoretical model pardo and weckman 1989 discussed the prediction of the weld pool and reinforcement dimensions of gas metal arc welding process using a finite element model they performed a gaussian distribution of heat flux with a consideration of mass convection due to heat source of arc and melted filler metal respectively brown and song 1992 studied two 2d and three dimensional 3d models on large structures regarding fixturing impact factor it was found that prediction of welding distortion was gained necessarily by using 3d models vanli and michaleris 2001 investigated welding induced buckling of fillet welded joints using tep fe analysis they evaluated how welding parameters such as welding sequence heat input mechanical constrains and size can affect the buckling behavior their anticipation was reasonable agreement in comparison with the experimental results camilleri et al 2005 evaluated a method to develop computational efficiency of generic fem based to predict distortion they proposed an uncoupled thermal and structural treatment on the full transient thermo elasto plastic analysis they concluded that total out of plane deformations were not provided by using a 2d analysis wang and murakawa 2011 studied welding induced distortion in thin plate structures by means of thermal elastic plastic fea the results revealed that buckling distortion is the serious problem in thin welded structure and can be estimated by considering large deformation theory fu et al 2014 investigated the problems of welding like residual stress and distortion of the t joints under various mechanical constraints the results of fem and experimental method showed that mechanical boundary conditions significantly influenced out of plane displacement transverse shrinkage and angular distortion thermal elastic plastic fe analysis is widely accepted to analyze welding problems for many types of welded joints and simple small size welded structures whereas for actual size of welded structures computation process time and cost consumption are substantially large in order to address these issues the prediction of welding deformation for large complicated structures has been computed elastically using inherent strain deformation theory deng et al 2007 conducted numerical simulation to evaluate distortion of welding in large thin structures via combination of thermal elastic plastic method and elastic fe method based on the inherent strain deformation theory in the first stage tep fe was employed for two typical welded joints then the influence of welding parameters for instance heat input welding process welding sequence and plate thickness on welding induced buckling in thin large structures were investigated in an elastic analysis through the use of inherent deformation of the welded joints obtained from tep fe results wang et al 2013 predicted out of plane welding deformation in a large ship panel structure using inherent deformation method in an elastic analysis in the tep analysis an uncoupled thermal mechanical analysis was used which ignores minor mechanical influence on the thermal behavior which was found useful to utilize in this paper they illustrated that both buckling and bending distortions occurred near the edge and internal region respectively their proposed line heating method results in decreasing welding induced buckling and bending distortion however it was not able to remove out of plane deformation completely moreover wang et al 2014 kept their studies on welding buckling evaluation of thin plates structures with regard to initial deflection by employing fe elastic analysis considering inherent deformation components computed from tep fea results they concluded that inherent longitudinal and transverse shrinkages have a key role in the magnitude of buckling for thin plate stiffened with fillet welded joints the acceptable accuracy of fe elastic results for large complicated structures was proved for this reason in the current study the aluminum autonomous catamaran hull is analyzed with fe elastic method on the other hand welding induced deformation of thin sheets has been investigated by huang et al 2016 they used inherent strain deformation approach to anticipate laser welding deformation of thin stainless steel sheets in an elastic fe analysis they evaluated different size of stainless steel sheets by considering welding speed parameter numerically and experimentally in the beginning they applied a 3d transient tep fea using local solid model for different welding conditions the verification of the thermal analysis was obtained appropriate compared with experimental measurements in this case they used penetration criteria of laser welding on the thin sheets in the present work this method has been employed to validate thermal numerical process of tep analysis on local models of outside corner joints with an angle of 70 then an elastic fea based on inherent strain deformation theory was performed in a shell element model which was found useful in their results a more out of plane welding deformation was observed for longer plates and less deformation was obtained for higher welding speed meanwhile wang et al 2017 investigated three other practical methods to decrease welding deformation of butt and fillet welded joints of large structures they used fe elastic analysis based on inherent deformations which were obtained from tep fe analysis they found tack welding technique as a constraint can mitigate welding distortion clearly according to this the outside corner joints of the catamaran hull were prepared via tack welded beads before welding process they also concluded that in plane shrinkage has the most influence on size accuracy of thick plate production in addition to this recently it was discerned a key factor in production of out of plane welding deformation by wang et al 2018 when they investigated welding out of plane deformation by employing elastic fe analysis based on deformation theory on shell models of lightweight ship panel structures they carried out inherent deformations from the tep fea results which had a good agreement comparing with experimental welding distortion results with regard to this the two tep and fe analyses results are validated with welding distortion of two outside corner joints with an angle of 70 and catamaran hull respectively although much research has been completed in this field far too little consideration has been paid to evaluate other different types of welding joint particularly for the outside corner joints that are used to manufacture autonomous catamaran vehicle however it is investigated in this paper via experimental and numerical methods tep and fe elastic analyses in both three dimensional local and global models the objective of the present study is to evaluate the distortion behavior of welding outside corner joints in order to increase construction efficiency in production of an aluminum autonomous surface vehicle asv to meet the optimum performance the configuration of the aluminum autonomous surface vehicle which has two demihulls is shown in fig 1 a b as depicted in fig 1 c three kinds of outside corner joints of different angles are employed along the length of each aluminum 5083 h111 demihull of the autonomous surface vehicle the vehicle is proposed for inspections in the field of offshore structures named zayandeh rud autonomous surface vehicle zrasv honaryar 2017 after zayandeh rud autonomous underwater vehicle zrauv in honor of zayandeh rud river honaryar and ghiasi 2018 deadrise angle is one of the most important design factors in the catamaran planing vehicles that can influence significantly the vehicle performance when it changes in the hull length direction as shown in fig 1 c for zrasv the deadrise angle has been designed equal to 20 and must be kept as constant in the hull length direction to promote operational efficiency of zrasv therefore considering the three outside corner joints which are particularly used in zrasv the significance of welding induced distortion is dominated in the production stages of zrasv in this study the welding process has been investigated by both numerical and experimental methods in the experimental method two outside corner joints of 5083 aluminum alloy sheets of angle of 70 with difference in lengths have been welded under actual conditions by gas tungsten arc welding process then a numerical simulation of the welding process is employed in two stages first a three dimensional elastic plastic thermal analysis based on finite element method is performed on small models of aluminum outside corner joints and then from the obtained results fe elastic analysis is applied via inherent strain deformation theory to zrasv hull in a global shell element model to investigate the treatment of produced distortion due to tig welding process at outside corner joints used in zrasv with respect to angle length and welding speed parameters of the joint in tep fe analysis considering a minor effect of the mechanical process on the thermal process an uncoupled thermal structural analysis is performed concerning heat transfer and elastic plastic deformation problems in mechanical apdl environment of ansys finite element software ansys 2012 the whole fe thermal and structural analysis are performed respectively and temperature dependent material properties of the base metal and filler metal used are considered at first temperature history is carried out using transient thermal analysis in which a moving heat source is made according to the experimental results and the results of numerical method are verified with metallographic observations of fusion penetration criteria for the base metal then calculated temperature distribution is used as thermal load in the following structural analysis the induced welding distortion results from numerical analysis are compared with experimental data and appropriately agree with the experiments 2 experimental study in this study the numerical analysis tep fe analysis is verified with two specimens of outside corner joints with an angle of 70 fig 2 schematically shows the two specimens conducted as experimental test samples which were chosen from an aluminum 5083 h111 sheet with 2 mm thickness t used in the production of zrasv demihulls both specimens have the same breadth b meanwhile to evaluate effect of dimensions on distortion behavior due to welding the different lengths l were employed to obtain proper weld quality and efficient oxide removal an alternative current ac balanced wave of gas tungsten arc welding is employed this type of welding process is used to assemble thinner aluminum joints less than 6 mm in thickness approximately mathers 2002 the welding parameters of welding process on the specimens presented in this paper are summarized in table 1 in the current study the filler metal 5356 which can produce the best ductility is selected mathers 2002 the chemical composition of the base metal aluminum 5083 h111 and filler metal 5356 are tabulated in table 2 fig 3 demonstrates how the specimens welding process were performed as shown in fig 3 a the sheets were initially joined at angle of 70 with three tack welded beads which have the same distance to each other then the specimen was constrained with a metal clamp at the one of the end points of the joint eventually the gas tungsten arc welding was manually employed from the other free side of the joint the welded specimens are shown in fig 3 b 3 mathematical model and tep fe analysis the welding process of specimens was simulated based on finite element method fem with indirect coupled field nonlinear thermal structural analysis in the mechanical apdl environment of ansys software as shown in fig 4 to enhance the accuracy of results the model was developed in three dimensional mode solid 278 nonlinear thermal brick element which has eight nodes with a single degree of releasing temperature at each node was employed for thermal analysis it is noted that smaller mesh size was considered in the regions near the weld zone because of the high temperature gradient for structural analysis eight node solid 45 element with three degrees of freedom at each node was used in both analyses the model has the same mesh and a total of 84960 elements were arranged along with the number of divisions of 60 in the weld line was chosen because of using filler metal in the welding process the element birth and death strategy was employed in fact this method activates the killed filler elements in each step where the moving heat source reached to them the killed elements were defined by a highly low factor to their stiffness coefficient according to fig 5 to obtain accuracy in results temperature dependent physical and mechanical properties of the base and filler metals were utilized as the input data in the software environment in fig 5 k ρ c e σ and α denote thermal conductivity density specific heat young s modulus yield stress and thermal expansion respectively although nearly the same material properties exist for each series of aluminum alloy some mechanical properties may not be equal such as yield stress it is noted that the poisson s ratio was taken as 0 33 throughout temperature history farajkhah and liu 2016 3 1 thermal analysis model in the fe model the temperature history at each node was calculated during welding time based on principal of energy conservation since it is supposed that the model can be considered as a finite volume with a surface s the heat conduction equation can be written as following 1 x k t x y k t y z k t z q ρ c t t where k is the thermal conductivity ρ q c t and t represent density internal heat source rate specific heat capacity welding time and current temperature respectively the coordinates of x y and z denote transverse direction normal direction to the weld line and welding direction respectively the initial temperature was equal to the room temperature before the welding process t 0 while during welding energy dissipation due to radiation heat transfer was ignored but convection conduction boundary conditions were considered for regions which are not affected directly by welding arc as given in eq 2 2 k t n h t t a where n represents the normal direction to the surface boundary t a shows the ambient temperature and h denotes convection heat transfer coefficient which was assumed as 15 w m 2 k for the surfaces in contact with surrounding air goyal et al 2009 long et al 2009 oosthuizen and naylor 1999 teng et al 2003 generally there are two different methods for modeling the heat source distribution of the welding process finding out temperature in the weld pool is the first method and the second one is more commonly used that determines the heat input and thermal flux applying by the welding arc on the joint surface finding an equation for thermal flux is one of the most important steps which has been studied extensively in this study moving gaussian heat flux distribution which is geometrically like the electric arc of tungsten inert gas tig welding was used as shown in fig 6 therefore for the regions affected by welding arc the moving gaussian heat flux is imposed by eq 3 3 q z x t 3 q π r 2 exp 3 r 2 z v t 2 x 2 where v is the welding speed r denotes the gaussian distribution variable that is the effective radius of area which 95 of heat source energy is entered and q is the quantity of the heat input defined as eq 4 4 q η v i where v and i denote the voltage and current of the heat source respectively and η is welding efficiency in this study η was presumed to be 0 35 and r was deemed as 1 5 mm saedi 1983 3 2 mechanical analysis in order to determine distortion due to welding structural analysis was calculated with regard to thermo elastic plastic fundamental principles according to isotropic strain hardening regulation along with the von mises criterion mentioned belytschko et al 2000 to investigate the softening effect as shown in fig 7 the vickers micro hardness test was measured from centerline of the weld to the base metal the results show that the lowest value is obtained from the heat affected zone haz this may due to bigger grain structures observed in this area compared to other zones because the base metal hardness values have slight differences with haz the softening issue is neglected in the mechanical model therefore for predicting welding deformations at each step of the welding the transient temperature distribution history was calculated from thermal analysis model and employed into structural analysis as body force vector b i given in eq 5 here σ i j represents the stress tensor based on the cauchy law the governing stress strain relationships are shown in eqs 6 and 7 5 σ i j j b i 0 6 d σ d d ε c t h d t 7 d d e d p where d σ d ε and d t are stress strain and temperature increments respectively d e is the elastic stiffness matrix and d p represents plastic stiffness matrix and c t h is thermal stiffness matrix as depicted in fig 8 a the first thermal loads step of the welding process is presented at the origin of coordinate system purple elements which were activated in each step demonstrate the molten filler droplets on the base metal as shown in fig 8 b the boundary conditions were taken into consideration by restraining the longitudinal edge for displacement in the transverse direction and one node was restricted in all directions at the end point side where the welding is finished 4 fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation method according to the fact that tep fea features are led to increase in calculation time when evaluating welding deformation of large complex structures fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation that is more practical than former method by considering computation time factor ueda et al 2012 is used to predict zrasv s welding deformation 4 1 the theory of inherent strain deformation the inherent strain produced due to complex thermal mechanical behavior of the welding process is dependent particularly on welding heat input type of welded joint materials welding speed and plate thickness generally the total inherent strain ε t can be divided into five components as shown in eqs 8 and 9 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2017 8 ε t ε e ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r 9 ε ε t ε e ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r where ε e denotes elastic strain and ε is inherent strain which mainly has led to welding deformation and residual stresses as a summation of ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r that are namely plastic strain creep strain thermal strain and phase transformation strain respectively for simplicity the creep and phase transformation due to minor values were ignored besides after welding process when temperature turns back to ambient temperature thermal strain amount approximately equals to zero therefore as shown in eq 9 the inherent strain value is equal to plastic strain amount in all directions it would be awkward to predict welding deformation in fe elastic analysis by employing inherent strain amounts directly for each node to save computation time the inherent deformation is implemented with considering some assumptions in which inherent deformation is obtained as averaged integration value of inherent strain for each cross section perpendicular to the welding line as well as inherent strain distribution in the two end parts of the welding line where inherent strain distribution is not uniform was ignored in general there are four components of inherent deformation and they are transverse shrinkage longitudinal shrinkage longitudinal bending and transverse bending caused by longitudinal and transverse inherent strains for a welded thin plate the amount of inherent deformation components is calculated by integrating longitudinal inherent strain ε z and transverse inherent strain ε x over the transverse section normal to the weld line as follows murakawa et al 2010 wang et al 2018 10 δ z 1 h ε z d x d y 11 δ x 1 h ε x d x d y 12 θ z 1 i ε z y h 2 d x d y 13 θ x 1 i ε x y h 2 d x d y 14 i i x x i y y 2 i x x i y y 2 cos 2 α h h 2 1 24 h h 2 1 24 cos 2 α α 180 α 2 where δ z δ x θ z and θ x are inherent longitudinal shrinkage inherent transverse shrinkage inherent longitudinal bending and inherent transverse bending respectively i is defined as the moment of inertia of unit sheet according to eq 14 using system coordinates relations shown in fig 8 c in which α indicates the angle between x and x axes along with h that denotes the thickness of the sheet 4 2 description of fe elastic analysis on zrasv elastic fe analysis based on inherent strain deformation theory was applied to investigate welding deformation of zrasv to reach this goal inherent strain distribution first must be calculated generally inherent strain can be obtained using either experimental method or tep fe analysis ueda et al 2012 in the present study tep fe analysis was used to compute inherent strain distribution fig 9 illustrates the distribution of inherent plastic strain on the middle transverse section obtained from tep fe analysis for specimen 2 this distribution indicates inherent strain zone situated near the weld line and this zone approximately is shown in fig 10 a for specific materials the type of welded joint and heat input inherent strain is gained for each point by the peak temperature meets that point during welidng process accompany with restraint created by surronding material meanwhile it remains almost unchanged for each transverse cross section along the welding line except for the two parts near the two ends of the weld this is due to the fact that moving thermal source has a quasistatic behavior through the welding process except for two ends of welding line this behavior is established because of uniform temperature distribution produced by moving heat source in case of the welded joint is sufficiently long ueda et al 2012 by ignoring the two ends effect the obtained longitudinal and transverse inherent strain distributions were integrated separately as shown in eqs 10 13 for each transverse section normal to the welding line then the obtained amounts for each inherent deformation components were averaged to obtain a constant value for each inherent deformation component in fact using inherent deformation in the elastic fe analysis can simplify the complication of applying longitudinal and transverse inherent strain distributions directly to shell model of large welded structures huang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2014 2013 the welding distortion of zrasv was predicted by applying fe elastic method based on inherent strain deformation theory and by considering large deformation theory wang et al 2013 in a global shell model in the fe elastic analysis all of the inherent deformation components have been employed as mechanical loads displacements huang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 in a curved plate case used by jang et al 2007 because the outside corner joints used in zrasv are not straight and due to complex shape of zrasv hull local coordinate system was used to apply mechanical loads beforehand inherent deformation components were obtained from computed inherent strain distribution of tep fe analysis for each local model of outside corner joints with angle of 60 70 and 140 used in zrasv firstly the fe elastic was employed for a model of specimen 2 the model was built with a 3d mesh by a four node shell 181 element with three degrees of freedom at each node as illustrated in fig 10 a after the numerical model was verified by comparing with experimental distortion results gained from specimen 2 it is applied to the shell 181 element global model of zrasv as depicted in fig 10 c by considering welding sequence shown in fig 19 a the same boundary conditions were performed as considered during zrasv welding process in experimental test as shown in fig 10 b therefore the outside corner joints were restricted in one direction perpendicular to the welding line furthermore one node at the middle part of zrasv was constrained in all directions to prevent rigid body motion 5 results and discussion the methodology and the process of the work are illustrated schematically in fig 11 the results predicted in tep fe method were validated in comparison with results obtained from experimental observations in this research welding deformation behavior was then investigated with regard to effect of angle and length parameters of the outside corner joint afterwards the fe elastic analysis was applied to zrasv global model after it was validated by comparing the distortion results obtained from specimen 2 shell model against the experimental results finally in order to lower the changes in amount of deadrise angle in the length of hull direction a proper welding speed of 230 mm min has been performed in production of zrasv by identifying the joint which has more critical deformation than other joints used in zrasv demihull 5 1 validation of the tep fe analysis model for thermal analysis the penetration criterion of the molten metal in the specimens considered by metallographic observations as illustrated in fig 12 a was estimated to be 0 74 mm meanwhile the average amount of the penetration was obtained roughly about 0 688 mm from numerical analysis as shown in fig 12 b in this figure the red zone was reached to the melting point of about 570 c ο mutombo and toit 2011 while the maximum error was obtained of about 7 02 fig 12 c shows the temperature contours on the specimen 1 when the moving heat source is in the middle of the weld line as shown in fig 13 the results of numerical structural analysis are validated by considering the observations of deformation after actual welding process on the two specimens the results indicate that angular distortions occurred for both experimental and numerical methods also shown in fig 13 the angular distortion of two normal cross sections with respect to the weld line has the longest distance to each other between welding start point z 0 and welding end point z 170 mm for specimen 1 l 170 mm and z 220 mm for specimen 2 l 220 mm the results obtained from angular distortion are in good agreement with the experimental method 5 2 the effects of angle and length of the joint on welding induced distortion figs 14 and 15 show the comparison of the predicted distortion due to welding for different angles of outside corner joint in the first and end of the welded parts the results were obtained under welding conditions in table 1 for specimen 1 l b 1 because a constant weld metal volume was employed for the whole of the joints as shown in fig 14 the maximum deflection in all x y and z directions increases when the angle of the joint increases as illustrated in fig 15 this incremental deflection has been detected with angular distortion observation in other words with the increase of the joint angle angular distortion has increased and the maximum angular distortion occurred for the 140 degree joint fig 15 also illustrates the angular distortion behavior changes with the increase of the angle of the outside corner joint as shown in figs 14 and 15 the angle effect on angular distortion was illustrated clearly by choosing two angles in the range of 0 90 as acute angles 60 and 70 two angles between 90 and 180 as obtuse angles 120 and 140 and of 90 angle itself after understanding the behavior of angular distortion occurred in different angles of the outside corner joint regarding zrasv hull joints the effect of the joint length on welding distortion is investigated just for three outside corner joints with angles of 60 70 and 140 which were included in the purpose of the present paper in addition the welding condition is the same as in table 1 for specimen 2 l b 1 and a constant weld metal volume is also considered for all the three outside corner joints as shown in fig 16 a for each of the three angle joints the maximum deflection is higher than the results as shown in fig 14 it indicates that the resistance of the sample on deflection reduces with increasing in length of the joint in other words stiffness has decreased when length of the sample becomes larger comparisons of figs 15 and 16 for the joints with an angle of 60 and 70 show the joint with longer length l b 1 has different directional angular distortion than the shorter ones l b 1 moreover the fig 16 b reveals that obtained angular distortion for an angle of 60 and 70 joints not only is lower than the results gained in short sample ones l b 1 as shown in fig 15 but also the angular changes of the joints between first and end of welded parts are lower than short sample ones and approximately have the same value to each other this conclusion also has reached in fig 11 a in which the angular distortion of the two specimens with joint angle of 70 was compared with each other experimentally in which the angular distortion changes for longer specimen between two end parts start and finishing parts of the weld are lower than short specimen this may be a reason for producing a nonlinear deflection along the weld line in longer samples of 60 and 70 degree joints as shown in fig 17 a b meanwhile the angular distortion of longer and shorter samples for an angle of 140 degree joint is almost the same and the angular changes between the two first and end welded parts for longer sample are as small as shorter one as mentioned in figs 15 and 16 it can be a reason of nonlinear deflection obtained along weld line for both long and short samples with angle of 140 degree joint as depicted in fig 17 c according to fig 17 the maximum nonlinear deflection which causes buckling distortion in the sample with an angle of 140 degree joint is significantly higher compared with the joints with an angle of 60 and 70 also in fig 17 a b the buckling distortion observed at the joint with angle of 70 is slightly greater than joint with angle of 60 5 3 fe elastic analysis on zrasv and its validation fig 18 illustrates the validation of the fe elastic analysis that was done by using inherent deformation data presented in table 3 these data obtained for all three welded joints of zrasv based on inherent strain deformation theory via the distribution of inherent plastic strains was calculated from tep fea and employed according to the welding conditions used for specimen 2 as shown in fig 18 c the deflection model of specimen 2 is used to the summation of displacement in the x and y directions fig 18 a b the numerical method was then verified by a comparison with experimental results obtained from specimen 2 depicted in fig 13 the results show reasonable agreement by the maximum error of approximately 13 which can be acceptable with regard to assumption considered in this paper as well as minor buckling occurred in the center part of the weld line as illustrated in fig 17 b can be the reasons for this error 5 4 influence of welding speed on zrasv demihull distortion based on obtained results from angular distortion and bucking distortion due to welding of outside corner joints with an angle of 60 70 and 140 the joint with an angle of 140 has the greatest angular distortion and buckling than other two joints therefore in this part the influence of welding speed on zrasv demihull model has been investigated approximately with a double amount more than pervious welding speed 113 4 mm min for the 140 degree joint as presented in table 4 inherent deformation components were calculated for 140 under the same welding conditions for specimen 2 just with the higher welding speed 230 mm min as well as the pervious data in table 3 were employed for the 60 and 70 degree joints fig 19 a illustrates how welding sequence is performed in production of zrasv demihull the start points of welding process for each joint are considered particularly to dominate a steady state of heat transfer in the aluminum hull welding induced distortion in the elastic fe analysis of zrasv model under two welding speed conditions 113 4 mm min and 230 mm min is demonstrated in fig 19 b there was a steady out of plane deformation along welding line near the 140 degree welded joint where the maximum distortion is occurred the reason why deformation calculated was placed nearest to 140 joint can be a result from having greatest deformation for the 140 degree joint than the other joints from tep fe analysis for low welding speed 113 4 mm min the maximum displacement reached roughly about 14 mm in z direction meanwhile for high welding speed 230 mm min the maximum displacement of elastic analysis improved and reached approximately 8 mm that is less than the amount carried out with low welding speed condition even more importantly as shown in fig 19 d the aft part of the zrasv affects significantly the efficiency of its performance and hence it can result in buckling and angular distortion due to welding process and it can cause significant change on the amount of deadrise angle followed by negative influence on zrasv operation as mentioned before as can be seen this negative influence is declined remarkably in the high welding speed fig 20 illustrates the welding induced distortion in the elastic fe analysis of zrasv compared with the experimental results of welding the demihull of zrasv at the same welding conditions based on the obtained results zrasv has been welded by employing high welding speed for the 140 degree joints to reduce welding deformation as shown in fig 20 a this figure clearly shows the maximum deflection occurred near the 140 degree joint experimentally and numerically to confirm this issue two lines are chosen near this area to obtain displacement in the hull length direction that are illustrated in fig 20 b a glance at the fig 20 c reveals a nonlinear distribution for displacement for both two lines in which the accuracy of computational displacement in comparison with experimental observation is well proved besides results of elastic fe analysis are in good agreement with the experimental data as demonstrated in fig 20 d by comparing the two different welding speed conditions in fig 20 c and aft part cross section shown in fig 20 d for higher speed deadrise angle is changed considerably less than the lower speed possibly leading to an improvement of zrasv performance efficiently 6 summary and conclusions in this paper welding induced out of plane deformation in an aluminum autonomous catamaran vehicle was investigated both experimentally and numerically by employing an efficient fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation theory in this study inherent deformation components from three typical kinds of outside corner joints were carried out from the results of tep fe analysis this analysis was performed on the local model joints and validated by the obtained experimental results from welding distortion considering the fact that aluminum outside corner joints had been investigated less than other types of joints in this research all efforts were done to find a novel method in order to predict accurately welding deformation of a large aluminum structure that has diversity outside corner welded joints the most important results are as following 1 the error rate obtained from comparison of the thermal analysis results between simulation and experimental methods is approximately 7 which indicates a high accuracy and acceptability of thermal numerical method meanwhile there is a reasonable acceptance for angular distortion in simulating the welding process compared with experimental results which indicates the convenience of tep fea results for calculating inherent deformation components 2 according to tep fea results in all outside corner joints angular distortion was observed meanwhile by increasing the angle of joint angular distortion is enhanced and the maximum angular distortion occurred in the joint with an angle of 140 degree besides considering l b ratio it was found when the length of the outside corner joints increases l b 1 the angular changes between two first and end welded parts will decrease meanwhile the nonlinear displacement caused buckling appeared along weld line 3 the welding induced deformation results of fe elastic analysis on zrasv shell model comparing with welding experimentally on zrasv hull were in good agreement this shows that fe elastic can be an efficient and effective way for predicting out of plane deformation of large aluminum welded structures accurately also the results show that inherent transverse shrinkage has a considerable influence on production of out of plane welding deformation on the outside corner welded joints 4 the obtained results of both tep and fe elastic analysis show the joint with the angle of 140 is the most critical joint which has both maximum angular distortion and buckling distortion in both longer l b 1 and shorter l b 1 samples among other joints used in zrasv hull 5 welding speed parameter was investigated by using fe elastic analysis on zrasv shell model it was concluded that by doubling in welding speed from 113 4 mm min to 230 mm min out of plane deformation reduced substantially in which the maximum displacement decreased to about 8 mm from 14 mm employing higher welding speed especially for the joint with higher distortion 140 joint caused less changes in deadrise angle of zrasv furthermore reducing amount of nonlinear displacement in the hull length direction occurred at higher welding speed not only do these results thrive performance and quality of zrasv but also it can stop the time consuming and cost of removing distortion after welding process credit authorship contribution

22040,the welding deformation considerably plays a vital role in the production accuracy and efficiency of marine structures in this study welding deformation due to three outside corner joints with angles of 60 70 and 140 used in an aluminum catamaran hull is evaluated by considering the length and welding speed parameters the deformation is predicted via two numerical procedures based on finite element computations thermal elastic plastic tep analysis is applied on local 3d solid models for each of the three outside corner joints to calculate inherent strain for global shell model of an aluminum catamaran to obtain deformation elastically based on inherent deformation theory validations of numerical results were performed by using metallographic observations and welding distortion for more accuracy the softening effect was investigated by vickers microhardness test the results from both tep and fe elastic analyses indicate reasonably good agreement with experimental results besides in the global shell model of the catamaran out of plane welding deformation will occur significantly near the maximum angle of outside corner joint 140 degree where the maximum welding distortion is obtained along with the welding speed parameter has considerable influence on decreasing distortion which results in reducing time consuming and cost in the catamaran production stage keywords aluminum 5083 h111 sheet welding outside corner joint inherent strain method out of plane deformation welding speed 1 introduction fusion welding process is used to join metals productively in a variety of manufacturing industries including shipbuilding whereabouts not only has arc welding process employed to assemble thin plates of steel maritime structures but also it is used noticeably in modern aluminum high speed catamarans high speed catamarans have been developed by using lightweight marine grade aluminum alloy hull to improve high speed sea transportation particularly for offshore applications in addition reaching low wave making resistance and high transverse stability features of high speed catamaran have been a significant challenge by generating sufficient hull form which is related to how the manufacture process of hull is done yun and bliault 2012 yun et al 2019 aluminum 5083 is one of the most important aluminum marine grades which are commonly replaced by steels in construction of high speed vessel s hulls to substantially reduce fuel consumption and promote efficiency gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and gas metal arc welding gmaw are two kinds of arc welding processes which are commonly used to weld aluminum alloys liu et al 2012 compared gas tungsten arc welding with gas metal arc welding process in terms of weldments mechanical properties of aluminum 5083 they showed gtaw causes more strength and ductility in weldments without existing any microstructure defect compared with gmaw meanwhile using a mobile concentrated heat source in these types of welding process it results in non uniform expansion and contraction and hence distortion after cooling cycle in other words the stress comes from thermal contraction and solidification shrinkage of weld metal results in distortion that can be divided into in plane shrinkages and out of plane deformations like angular distortion and buckling distortion induced by local concentrating heat of welding process affects ultimate strength and manufacturing accuracy of structures substantially considering high coefficient of thermal expansion in aluminum alloy which is about twice of that in a similar steel structure a greater distortion has been expected in aluminum welding process mathers 2002 the worst problem of welding distortion is decreasing performance and dimensional accuracy in welded structures resulting in an increased time and cost in the manufacturing and repairing processes tsai et al 1999 generally categorized variables into two cases named design related and process related variables that affect welding distortion some significant design related factors consist of plate thickness details of weld joint and material properties the important process related variables comprise welding speed heat input and sequence of welding process therefore welding induced distortion in design of hull shape needs to be considered in such a way that changes with geometry of the weld zone welding sequence constraints and welding input parameters therefore proper design and careful selection of these parameters play a significant role in control of distortion by developing computational methods finite element analysis fea has been employed to predict quantitatively the influence of different parameters on deformation due to welding process in particular out of plane deformation like buckling occurred commonly in thin walled welded structures guo et al 2016 ueda et al 2012 at the beginning thermal elastic plastic method tep was used by ueda and yamakawa 1971 to evaluate welding process goldak j et al 1984 modeled mathematically a welding heat source with a double ellipsoid based on gaussian distribution of power density in that model temperature distribution contours were used to verify theoretical model pardo and weckman 1989 discussed the prediction of the weld pool and reinforcement dimensions of gas metal arc welding process using a finite element model they performed a gaussian distribution of heat flux with a consideration of mass convection due to heat source of arc and melted filler metal respectively brown and song 1992 studied two 2d and three dimensional 3d models on large structures regarding fixturing impact factor it was found that prediction of welding distortion was gained necessarily by using 3d models vanli and michaleris 2001 investigated welding induced buckling of fillet welded joints using tep fe analysis they evaluated how welding parameters such as welding sequence heat input mechanical constrains and size can affect the buckling behavior their anticipation was reasonable agreement in comparison with the experimental results camilleri et al 2005 evaluated a method to develop computational efficiency of generic fem based to predict distortion they proposed an uncoupled thermal and structural treatment on the full transient thermo elasto plastic analysis they concluded that total out of plane deformations were not provided by using a 2d analysis wang and murakawa 2011 studied welding induced distortion in thin plate structures by means of thermal elastic plastic fea the results revealed that buckling distortion is the serious problem in thin welded structure and can be estimated by considering large deformation theory fu et al 2014 investigated the problems of welding like residual stress and distortion of the t joints under various mechanical constraints the results of fem and experimental method showed that mechanical boundary conditions significantly influenced out of plane displacement transverse shrinkage and angular distortion thermal elastic plastic fe analysis is widely accepted to analyze welding problems for many types of welded joints and simple small size welded structures whereas for actual size of welded structures computation process time and cost consumption are substantially large in order to address these issues the prediction of welding deformation for large complicated structures has been computed elastically using inherent strain deformation theory deng et al 2007 conducted numerical simulation to evaluate distortion of welding in large thin structures via combination of thermal elastic plastic method and elastic fe method based on the inherent strain deformation theory in the first stage tep fe was employed for two typical welded joints then the influence of welding parameters for instance heat input welding process welding sequence and plate thickness on welding induced buckling in thin large structures were investigated in an elastic analysis through the use of inherent deformation of the welded joints obtained from tep fe results wang et al 2013 predicted out of plane welding deformation in a large ship panel structure using inherent deformation method in an elastic analysis in the tep analysis an uncoupled thermal mechanical analysis was used which ignores minor mechanical influence on the thermal behavior which was found useful to utilize in this paper they illustrated that both buckling and bending distortions occurred near the edge and internal region respectively their proposed line heating method results in decreasing welding induced buckling and bending distortion however it was not able to remove out of plane deformation completely moreover wang et al 2014 kept their studies on welding buckling evaluation of thin plates structures with regard to initial deflection by employing fe elastic analysis considering inherent deformation components computed from tep fea results they concluded that inherent longitudinal and transverse shrinkages have a key role in the magnitude of buckling for thin plate stiffened with fillet welded joints the acceptable accuracy of fe elastic results for large complicated structures was proved for this reason in the current study the aluminum autonomous catamaran hull is analyzed with fe elastic method on the other hand welding induced deformation of thin sheets has been investigated by huang et al 2016 they used inherent strain deformation approach to anticipate laser welding deformation of thin stainless steel sheets in an elastic fe analysis they evaluated different size of stainless steel sheets by considering welding speed parameter numerically and experimentally in the beginning they applied a 3d transient tep fea using local solid model for different welding conditions the verification of the thermal analysis was obtained appropriate compared with experimental measurements in this case they used penetration criteria of laser welding on the thin sheets in the present work this method has been employed to validate thermal numerical process of tep analysis on local models of outside corner joints with an angle of 70 then an elastic fea based on inherent strain deformation theory was performed in a shell element model which was found useful in their results a more out of plane welding deformation was observed for longer plates and less deformation was obtained for higher welding speed meanwhile wang et al 2017 investigated three other practical methods to decrease welding deformation of butt and fillet welded joints of large structures they used fe elastic analysis based on inherent deformations which were obtained from tep fe analysis they found tack welding technique as a constraint can mitigate welding distortion clearly according to this the outside corner joints of the catamaran hull were prepared via tack welded beads before welding process they also concluded that in plane shrinkage has the most influence on size accuracy of thick plate production in addition to this recently it was discerned a key factor in production of out of plane welding deformation by wang et al 2018 when they investigated welding out of plane deformation by employing elastic fe analysis based on deformation theory on shell models of lightweight ship panel structures they carried out inherent deformations from the tep fea results which had a good agreement comparing with experimental welding distortion results with regard to this the two tep and fe analyses results are validated with welding distortion of two outside corner joints with an angle of 70 and catamaran hull respectively although much research has been completed in this field far too little consideration has been paid to evaluate other different types of welding joint particularly for the outside corner joints that are used to manufacture autonomous catamaran vehicle however it is investigated in this paper via experimental and numerical methods tep and fe elastic analyses in both three dimensional local and global models the objective of the present study is to evaluate the distortion behavior of welding outside corner joints in order to increase construction efficiency in production of an aluminum autonomous surface vehicle asv to meet the optimum performance the configuration of the aluminum autonomous surface vehicle which has two demihulls is shown in fig 1 a b as depicted in fig 1 c three kinds of outside corner joints of different angles are employed along the length of each aluminum 5083 h111 demihull of the autonomous surface vehicle the vehicle is proposed for inspections in the field of offshore structures named zayandeh rud autonomous surface vehicle zrasv honaryar 2017 after zayandeh rud autonomous underwater vehicle zrauv in honor of zayandeh rud river honaryar and ghiasi 2018 deadrise angle is one of the most important design factors in the catamaran planing vehicles that can influence significantly the vehicle performance when it changes in the hull length direction as shown in fig 1 c for zrasv the deadrise angle has been designed equal to 20 and must be kept as constant in the hull length direction to promote operational efficiency of zrasv therefore considering the three outside corner joints which are particularly used in zrasv the significance of welding induced distortion is dominated in the production stages of zrasv in this study the welding process has been investigated by both numerical and experimental methods in the experimental method two outside corner joints of 5083 aluminum alloy sheets of angle of 70 with difference in lengths have been welded under actual conditions by gas tungsten arc welding process then a numerical simulation of the welding process is employed in two stages first a three dimensional elastic plastic thermal analysis based on finite element method is performed on small models of aluminum outside corner joints and then from the obtained results fe elastic analysis is applied via inherent strain deformation theory to zrasv hull in a global shell element model to investigate the treatment of produced distortion due to tig welding process at outside corner joints used in zrasv with respect to angle length and welding speed parameters of the joint in tep fe analysis considering a minor effect of the mechanical process on the thermal process an uncoupled thermal structural analysis is performed concerning heat transfer and elastic plastic deformation problems in mechanical apdl environment of ansys finite element software ansys 2012 the whole fe thermal and structural analysis are performed respectively and temperature dependent material properties of the base metal and filler metal used are considered at first temperature history is carried out using transient thermal analysis in which a moving heat source is made according to the experimental results and the results of numerical method are verified with metallographic observations of fusion penetration criteria for the base metal then calculated temperature distribution is used as thermal load in the following structural analysis the induced welding distortion results from numerical analysis are compared with experimental data and appropriately agree with the experiments 2 experimental study in this study the numerical analysis tep fe analysis is verified with two specimens of outside corner joints with an angle of 70 fig 2 schematically shows the two specimens conducted as experimental test samples which were chosen from an aluminum 5083 h111 sheet with 2 mm thickness t used in the production of zrasv demihulls both specimens have the same breadth b meanwhile to evaluate effect of dimensions on distortion behavior due to welding the different lengths l were employed to obtain proper weld quality and efficient oxide removal an alternative current ac balanced wave of gas tungsten arc welding is employed this type of welding process is used to assemble thinner aluminum joints less than 6 mm in thickness approximately mathers 2002 the welding parameters of welding process on the specimens presented in this paper are summarized in table 1 in the current study the filler metal 5356 which can produce the best ductility is selected mathers 2002 the chemical composition of the base metal aluminum 5083 h111 and filler metal 5356 are tabulated in table 2 fig 3 demonstrates how the specimens welding process were performed as shown in fig 3 a the sheets were initially joined at angle of 70 with three tack welded beads which have the same distance to each other then the specimen was constrained with a metal clamp at the one of the end points of the joint eventually the gas tungsten arc welding was manually employed from the other free side of the joint the welded specimens are shown in fig 3 b 3 mathematical model and tep fe analysis the welding process of specimens was simulated based on finite element method fem with indirect coupled field nonlinear thermal structural analysis in the mechanical apdl environment of ansys software as shown in fig 4 to enhance the accuracy of results the model was developed in three dimensional mode solid 278 nonlinear thermal brick element which has eight nodes with a single degree of releasing temperature at each node was employed for thermal analysis it is noted that smaller mesh size was considered in the regions near the weld zone because of the high temperature gradient for structural analysis eight node solid 45 element with three degrees of freedom at each node was used in both analyses the model has the same mesh and a total of 84960 elements were arranged along with the number of divisions of 60 in the weld line was chosen because of using filler metal in the welding process the element birth and death strategy was employed in fact this method activates the killed filler elements in each step where the moving heat source reached to them the killed elements were defined by a highly low factor to their stiffness coefficient according to fig 5 to obtain accuracy in results temperature dependent physical and mechanical properties of the base and filler metals were utilized as the input data in the software environment in fig 5 k ρ c e σ and α denote thermal conductivity density specific heat young s modulus yield stress and thermal expansion respectively although nearly the same material properties exist for each series of aluminum alloy some mechanical properties may not be equal such as yield stress it is noted that the poisson s ratio was taken as 0 33 throughout temperature history farajkhah and liu 2016 3 1 thermal analysis model in the fe model the temperature history at each node was calculated during welding time based on principal of energy conservation since it is supposed that the model can be considered as a finite volume with a surface s the heat conduction equation can be written as following 1 x k t x y k t y z k t z q ρ c t t where k is the thermal conductivity ρ q c t and t represent density internal heat source rate specific heat capacity welding time and current temperature respectively the coordinates of x y and z denote transverse direction normal direction to the weld line and welding direction respectively the initial temperature was equal to the room temperature before the welding process t 0 while during welding energy dissipation due to radiation heat transfer was ignored but convection conduction boundary conditions were considered for regions which are not affected directly by welding arc as given in eq 2 2 k t n h t t a where n represents the normal direction to the surface boundary t a shows the ambient temperature and h denotes convection heat transfer coefficient which was assumed as 15 w m 2 k for the surfaces in contact with surrounding air goyal et al 2009 long et al 2009 oosthuizen and naylor 1999 teng et al 2003 generally there are two different methods for modeling the heat source distribution of the welding process finding out temperature in the weld pool is the first method and the second one is more commonly used that determines the heat input and thermal flux applying by the welding arc on the joint surface finding an equation for thermal flux is one of the most important steps which has been studied extensively in this study moving gaussian heat flux distribution which is geometrically like the electric arc of tungsten inert gas tig welding was used as shown in fig 6 therefore for the regions affected by welding arc the moving gaussian heat flux is imposed by eq 3 3 q z x t 3 q π r 2 exp 3 r 2 z v t 2 x 2 where v is the welding speed r denotes the gaussian distribution variable that is the effective radius of area which 95 of heat source energy is entered and q is the quantity of the heat input defined as eq 4 4 q η v i where v and i denote the voltage and current of the heat source respectively and η is welding efficiency in this study η was presumed to be 0 35 and r was deemed as 1 5 mm saedi 1983 3 2 mechanical analysis in order to determine distortion due to welding structural analysis was calculated with regard to thermo elastic plastic fundamental principles according to isotropic strain hardening regulation along with the von mises criterion mentioned belytschko et al 2000 to investigate the softening effect as shown in fig 7 the vickers micro hardness test was measured from centerline of the weld to the base metal the results show that the lowest value is obtained from the heat affected zone haz this may due to bigger grain structures observed in this area compared to other zones because the base metal hardness values have slight differences with haz the softening issue is neglected in the mechanical model therefore for predicting welding deformations at each step of the welding the transient temperature distribution history was calculated from thermal analysis model and employed into structural analysis as body force vector b i given in eq 5 here σ i j represents the stress tensor based on the cauchy law the governing stress strain relationships are shown in eqs 6 and 7 5 σ i j j b i 0 6 d σ d d ε c t h d t 7 d d e d p where d σ d ε and d t are stress strain and temperature increments respectively d e is the elastic stiffness matrix and d p represents plastic stiffness matrix and c t h is thermal stiffness matrix as depicted in fig 8 a the first thermal loads step of the welding process is presented at the origin of coordinate system purple elements which were activated in each step demonstrate the molten filler droplets on the base metal as shown in fig 8 b the boundary conditions were taken into consideration by restraining the longitudinal edge for displacement in the transverse direction and one node was restricted in all directions at the end point side where the welding is finished 4 fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation method according to the fact that tep fea features are led to increase in calculation time when evaluating welding deformation of large complex structures fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation that is more practical than former method by considering computation time factor ueda et al 2012 is used to predict zrasv s welding deformation 4 1 the theory of inherent strain deformation the inherent strain produced due to complex thermal mechanical behavior of the welding process is dependent particularly on welding heat input type of welded joint materials welding speed and plate thickness generally the total inherent strain ε t can be divided into five components as shown in eqs 8 and 9 huang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2017 8 ε t ε e ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r 9 ε ε t ε e ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r where ε e denotes elastic strain and ε is inherent strain which mainly has led to welding deformation and residual stresses as a summation of ε p ε c r ε t h ε t r that are namely plastic strain creep strain thermal strain and phase transformation strain respectively for simplicity the creep and phase transformation due to minor values were ignored besides after welding process when temperature turns back to ambient temperature thermal strain amount approximately equals to zero therefore as shown in eq 9 the inherent strain value is equal to plastic strain amount in all directions it would be awkward to predict welding deformation in fe elastic analysis by employing inherent strain amounts directly for each node to save computation time the inherent deformation is implemented with considering some assumptions in which inherent deformation is obtained as averaged integration value of inherent strain for each cross section perpendicular to the welding line as well as inherent strain distribution in the two end parts of the welding line where inherent strain distribution is not uniform was ignored in general there are four components of inherent deformation and they are transverse shrinkage longitudinal shrinkage longitudinal bending and transverse bending caused by longitudinal and transverse inherent strains for a welded thin plate the amount of inherent deformation components is calculated by integrating longitudinal inherent strain ε z and transverse inherent strain ε x over the transverse section normal to the weld line as follows murakawa et al 2010 wang et al 2018 10 δ z 1 h ε z d x d y 11 δ x 1 h ε x d x d y 12 θ z 1 i ε z y h 2 d x d y 13 θ x 1 i ε x y h 2 d x d y 14 i i x x i y y 2 i x x i y y 2 cos 2 α h h 2 1 24 h h 2 1 24 cos 2 α α 180 α 2 where δ z δ x θ z and θ x are inherent longitudinal shrinkage inherent transverse shrinkage inherent longitudinal bending and inherent transverse bending respectively i is defined as the moment of inertia of unit sheet according to eq 14 using system coordinates relations shown in fig 8 c in which α indicates the angle between x and x axes along with h that denotes the thickness of the sheet 4 2 description of fe elastic analysis on zrasv elastic fe analysis based on inherent strain deformation theory was applied to investigate welding deformation of zrasv to reach this goal inherent strain distribution first must be calculated generally inherent strain can be obtained using either experimental method or tep fe analysis ueda et al 2012 in the present study tep fe analysis was used to compute inherent strain distribution fig 9 illustrates the distribution of inherent plastic strain on the middle transverse section obtained from tep fe analysis for specimen 2 this distribution indicates inherent strain zone situated near the weld line and this zone approximately is shown in fig 10 a for specific materials the type of welded joint and heat input inherent strain is gained for each point by the peak temperature meets that point during welidng process accompany with restraint created by surronding material meanwhile it remains almost unchanged for each transverse cross section along the welding line except for the two parts near the two ends of the weld this is due to the fact that moving thermal source has a quasistatic behavior through the welding process except for two ends of welding line this behavior is established because of uniform temperature distribution produced by moving heat source in case of the welded joint is sufficiently long ueda et al 2012 by ignoring the two ends effect the obtained longitudinal and transverse inherent strain distributions were integrated separately as shown in eqs 10 13 for each transverse section normal to the welding line then the obtained amounts for each inherent deformation components were averaged to obtain a constant value for each inherent deformation component in fact using inherent deformation in the elastic fe analysis can simplify the complication of applying longitudinal and transverse inherent strain distributions directly to shell model of large welded structures huang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 2014 2013 the welding distortion of zrasv was predicted by applying fe elastic method based on inherent strain deformation theory and by considering large deformation theory wang et al 2013 in a global shell model in the fe elastic analysis all of the inherent deformation components have been employed as mechanical loads displacements huang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 in a curved plate case used by jang et al 2007 because the outside corner joints used in zrasv are not straight and due to complex shape of zrasv hull local coordinate system was used to apply mechanical loads beforehand inherent deformation components were obtained from computed inherent strain distribution of tep fe analysis for each local model of outside corner joints with angle of 60 70 and 140 used in zrasv firstly the fe elastic was employed for a model of specimen 2 the model was built with a 3d mesh by a four node shell 181 element with three degrees of freedom at each node as illustrated in fig 10 a after the numerical model was verified by comparing with experimental distortion results gained from specimen 2 it is applied to the shell 181 element global model of zrasv as depicted in fig 10 c by considering welding sequence shown in fig 19 a the same boundary conditions were performed as considered during zrasv welding process in experimental test as shown in fig 10 b therefore the outside corner joints were restricted in one direction perpendicular to the welding line furthermore one node at the middle part of zrasv was constrained in all directions to prevent rigid body motion 5 results and discussion the methodology and the process of the work are illustrated schematically in fig 11 the results predicted in tep fe method were validated in comparison with results obtained from experimental observations in this research welding deformation behavior was then investigated with regard to effect of angle and length parameters of the outside corner joint afterwards the fe elastic analysis was applied to zrasv global model after it was validated by comparing the distortion results obtained from specimen 2 shell model against the experimental results finally in order to lower the changes in amount of deadrise angle in the length of hull direction a proper welding speed of 230 mm min has been performed in production of zrasv by identifying the joint which has more critical deformation than other joints used in zrasv demihull 5 1 validation of the tep fe analysis model for thermal analysis the penetration criterion of the molten metal in the specimens considered by metallographic observations as illustrated in fig 12 a was estimated to be 0 74 mm meanwhile the average amount of the penetration was obtained roughly about 0 688 mm from numerical analysis as shown in fig 12 b in this figure the red zone was reached to the melting point of about 570 c ο mutombo and toit 2011 while the maximum error was obtained of about 7 02 fig 12 c shows the temperature contours on the specimen 1 when the moving heat source is in the middle of the weld line as shown in fig 13 the results of numerical structural analysis are validated by considering the observations of deformation after actual welding process on the two specimens the results indicate that angular distortions occurred for both experimental and numerical methods also shown in fig 13 the angular distortion of two normal cross sections with respect to the weld line has the longest distance to each other between welding start point z 0 and welding end point z 170 mm for specimen 1 l 170 mm and z 220 mm for specimen 2 l 220 mm the results obtained from angular distortion are in good agreement with the experimental method 5 2 the effects of angle and length of the joint on welding induced distortion figs 14 and 15 show the comparison of the predicted distortion due to welding for different angles of outside corner joint in the first and end of the welded parts the results were obtained under welding conditions in table 1 for specimen 1 l b 1 because a constant weld metal volume was employed for the whole of the joints as shown in fig 14 the maximum deflection in all x y and z directions increases when the angle of the joint increases as illustrated in fig 15 this incremental deflection has been detected with angular distortion observation in other words with the increase of the joint angle angular distortion has increased and the maximum angular distortion occurred for the 140 degree joint fig 15 also illustrates the angular distortion behavior changes with the increase of the angle of the outside corner joint as shown in figs 14 and 15 the angle effect on angular distortion was illustrated clearly by choosing two angles in the range of 0 90 as acute angles 60 and 70 two angles between 90 and 180 as obtuse angles 120 and 140 and of 90 angle itself after understanding the behavior of angular distortion occurred in different angles of the outside corner joint regarding zrasv hull joints the effect of the joint length on welding distortion is investigated just for three outside corner joints with angles of 60 70 and 140 which were included in the purpose of the present paper in addition the welding condition is the same as in table 1 for specimen 2 l b 1 and a constant weld metal volume is also considered for all the three outside corner joints as shown in fig 16 a for each of the three angle joints the maximum deflection is higher than the results as shown in fig 14 it indicates that the resistance of the sample on deflection reduces with increasing in length of the joint in other words stiffness has decreased when length of the sample becomes larger comparisons of figs 15 and 16 for the joints with an angle of 60 and 70 show the joint with longer length l b 1 has different directional angular distortion than the shorter ones l b 1 moreover the fig 16 b reveals that obtained angular distortion for an angle of 60 and 70 joints not only is lower than the results gained in short sample ones l b 1 as shown in fig 15 but also the angular changes of the joints between first and end of welded parts are lower than short sample ones and approximately have the same value to each other this conclusion also has reached in fig 11 a in which the angular distortion of the two specimens with joint angle of 70 was compared with each other experimentally in which the angular distortion changes for longer specimen between two end parts start and finishing parts of the weld are lower than short specimen this may be a reason for producing a nonlinear deflection along the weld line in longer samples of 60 and 70 degree joints as shown in fig 17 a b meanwhile the angular distortion of longer and shorter samples for an angle of 140 degree joint is almost the same and the angular changes between the two first and end welded parts for longer sample are as small as shorter one as mentioned in figs 15 and 16 it can be a reason of nonlinear deflection obtained along weld line for both long and short samples with angle of 140 degree joint as depicted in fig 17 c according to fig 17 the maximum nonlinear deflection which causes buckling distortion in the sample with an angle of 140 degree joint is significantly higher compared with the joints with an angle of 60 and 70 also in fig 17 a b the buckling distortion observed at the joint with angle of 70 is slightly greater than joint with angle of 60 5 3 fe elastic analysis on zrasv and its validation fig 18 illustrates the validation of the fe elastic analysis that was done by using inherent deformation data presented in table 3 these data obtained for all three welded joints of zrasv based on inherent strain deformation theory via the distribution of inherent plastic strains was calculated from tep fea and employed according to the welding conditions used for specimen 2 as shown in fig 18 c the deflection model of specimen 2 is used to the summation of displacement in the x and y directions fig 18 a b the numerical method was then verified by a comparison with experimental results obtained from specimen 2 depicted in fig 13 the results show reasonable agreement by the maximum error of approximately 13 which can be acceptable with regard to assumption considered in this paper as well as minor buckling occurred in the center part of the weld line as illustrated in fig 17 b can be the reasons for this error 5 4 influence of welding speed on zrasv demihull distortion based on obtained results from angular distortion and bucking distortion due to welding of outside corner joints with an angle of 60 70 and 140 the joint with an angle of 140 has the greatest angular distortion and buckling than other two joints therefore in this part the influence of welding speed on zrasv demihull model has been investigated approximately with a double amount more than pervious welding speed 113 4 mm min for the 140 degree joint as presented in table 4 inherent deformation components were calculated for 140 under the same welding conditions for specimen 2 just with the higher welding speed 230 mm min as well as the pervious data in table 3 were employed for the 60 and 70 degree joints fig 19 a illustrates how welding sequence is performed in production of zrasv demihull the start points of welding process for each joint are considered particularly to dominate a steady state of heat transfer in the aluminum hull welding induced distortion in the elastic fe analysis of zrasv model under two welding speed conditions 113 4 mm min and 230 mm min is demonstrated in fig 19 b there was a steady out of plane deformation along welding line near the 140 degree welded joint where the maximum distortion is occurred the reason why deformation calculated was placed nearest to 140 joint can be a result from having greatest deformation for the 140 degree joint than the other joints from tep fe analysis for low welding speed 113 4 mm min the maximum displacement reached roughly about 14 mm in z direction meanwhile for high welding speed 230 mm min the maximum displacement of elastic analysis improved and reached approximately 8 mm that is less than the amount carried out with low welding speed condition even more importantly as shown in fig 19 d the aft part of the zrasv affects significantly the efficiency of its performance and hence it can result in buckling and angular distortion due to welding process and it can cause significant change on the amount of deadrise angle followed by negative influence on zrasv operation as mentioned before as can be seen this negative influence is declined remarkably in the high welding speed fig 20 illustrates the welding induced distortion in the elastic fe analysis of zrasv compared with the experimental results of welding the demihull of zrasv at the same welding conditions based on the obtained results zrasv has been welded by employing high welding speed for the 140 degree joints to reduce welding deformation as shown in fig 20 a this figure clearly shows the maximum deflection occurred near the 140 degree joint experimentally and numerically to confirm this issue two lines are chosen near this area to obtain displacement in the hull length direction that are illustrated in fig 20 b a glance at the fig 20 c reveals a nonlinear distribution for displacement for both two lines in which the accuracy of computational displacement in comparison with experimental observation is well proved besides results of elastic fe analysis are in good agreement with the experimental data as demonstrated in fig 20 d by comparing the two different welding speed conditions in fig 20 c and aft part cross section shown in fig 20 d for higher speed deadrise angle is changed considerably less than the lower speed possibly leading to an improvement of zrasv performance efficiently 6 summary and conclusions in this paper welding induced out of plane deformation in an aluminum autonomous catamaran vehicle was investigated both experimentally and numerically by employing an efficient fe elastic analysis based on inherent strain deformation theory in this study inherent deformation components from three typical kinds of outside corner joints were carried out from the results of tep fe analysis this analysis was performed on the local model joints and validated by the obtained experimental results from welding distortion considering the fact that aluminum outside corner joints had been investigated less than other types of joints in this research all efforts were done to find a novel method in order to predict accurately welding deformation of a large aluminum structure that has diversity outside corner welded joints the most important results are as following 1 the error rate obtained from comparison of the thermal analysis results between simulation and experimental methods is approximately 7 which indicates a high accuracy and acceptability of thermal numerical method meanwhile there is a reasonable acceptance for angular distortion in simulating the welding process compared with experimental results which indicates the convenience of tep fea results for calculating inherent deformation components 2 according to tep fea results in all outside corner joints angular distortion was observed meanwhile by increasing the angle of joint angular distortion is enhanced and the maximum angular distortion occurred in the joint with an angle of 140 degree besides considering l b ratio it was found when the length of the outside corner joints increases l b 1 the angular changes between two first and end welded parts will decrease meanwhile the nonlinear displacement caused buckling appeared along weld line 3 the welding induced deformation results of fe elastic analysis on zrasv shell model comparing with welding experimentally on zrasv hull were in good agreement this shows that fe elastic can be an efficient and effective way for predicting out of plane deformation of large aluminum welded structures accurately also the results show that inherent transverse shrinkage has a considerable influence on production of out of plane welding deformation on the outside corner welded joints 4 the obtained results of both tep and fe elastic analysis show the joint with the angle of 140 is the most critical joint which has both maximum angular distortion and buckling distortion in both longer l b 1 and shorter l b 1 samples among other joints used in zrasv hull 5 welding speed parameter was investigated by using fe elastic analysis on zrasv shell model it was concluded that by doubling in welding speed from 113 4 mm min to 230 mm min out of plane deformation reduced substantially in which the maximum displacement decreased to about 8 mm from 14 mm employing higher welding speed especially for the joint with higher distortion 140 joint caused less changes in deadrise angle of zrasv furthermore reducing amount of nonlinear displacement in the hull length direction occurred at higher welding speed not only do these results thrive performance and quality of zrasv but also it can stop the time consuming and cost of removing distortion after welding process credit authorship contribution

depth 1 introduction the offshore industry has to deal with increased renewable energy demand and the development of large jacket structures to support offshore wind turbines failure of a jacket can lead to high costs for repair and maintenance thus the stability of a jacket is an important concern and needs to be analysed for the local scour and well as global scour around the jacket structure there is limited knowledge about the scouring process around jacket structures which is mainly gained through the field investigations and physical modelling van dijk 1980 dahlberg 1983 studied scour around the gravity platforms and jacket structures the observations showed that significant scour occurs mainly in areas with active sand waves rudolph et al 2004 investigated scour around jacket structures in the southern north sea they demonstrated scour around structures exposed to the waves and current for a long duration it was suggested that the mean scour development can be reproduced with the empirical formula by nakagawa and suzuki 1976 bolle et al 2012 discussed scour around a jacket structure at the c power wind farm at flemish coast to design protection measures in a recent study stahlmann 2013 investigated scour around a tripod structure through laboratory experiments in his study the global and local scour and the effect of incident wave direction on scour around a tripod structure have been investigated these studies are found to be a challenging and time consuming process as field measurements or complex laboratory experiments are involved alternatively the maximum scour around a jacket can be calculated using empirical formulae from sumer et al 1992 the formulae calculate the scour depth around the vertical piles without accounting for the complexity of the structure the calculation of the maximum scour depth around jacket structures using empirical formulae might result in unrealistic scour depths as the scour process around a jacket cannot be represented thoroughly as one scour hole to overcome this problem cfd modelling of the scouring process around jacket structures can be a potential alternative way to analyse the scour problems more accurately many researchers have studied local scour around the simple structures with cfd modelling approach mostly these structures are vertical piles ahmad et al 2015 horizontal piles ahmad et al 2019b abutments bihs and olsen 2011 seawalls ahmad et al 2018a 2019a and a group of vertical piles ahmad et al 2018b olsen and kjellesvig 1998 investigated the scour around a circular cylinder exposed to a steady current the study was performed by solving the navier stokes equations coupled with sediment transport algorithms a clear water scour was simulated until an equilibrium state achieved tseng et al 2000 studied the scour around both circular and square cylinders exposed to a steady current the large eddy simulation les approach was used to investigate the vortex shedding and sediment transport roulund et al 2005 investigated the scour around a vertical pile exposed to a steady current they investigated the influence of the boundary layer thickness reynolds number bed roughness and the scour processes baykal et al 2015 investigated the flow and consequently the local scour around a vertical cylinder they discussed the vortex shedding and sediment transport process it was concluded that the equilibrium scour depth is reduced by 50 when the suspended load is not considered baykal et al 2017 investigated the scour around a vertical pile exposed to wave it was found that the local scour and backfilling are governed by the lee wake flow the equilibrium depth of the scour holes was seen to be the same for both the scour and the backfilling for a given keulegan carpenter number however in these studies the free surface was not resolved liu and garcia 2008 employed a three dimensional numerical model to simulate the local scour around a vertical pile with free water surface capturing afzal et al 2015 and ahmad et al 2015 investigated the scour around a large pile under a steady current and scour under a wave with a free surface it was found that the scour depth and deposition increase with the keulegan carpenter kc 2 π a d number scour below the pipelines horizontal pile has been investigated by liang and cheng 2005 fuhrman et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and larsen et al 2016 in these studies scour beneath the submarine pipelines exposed to a steady current alone wave alone and wave plus current the backfilling processes and temporal variation of the scour were also discussed however the studies were found limited to 2d modelling of local scour with no free surface capturing ahmad et al 2019b presented a 2d numerical modelling of pipeline scour under a steady current waves and the combined action of waves and current including the unsteady free surface the results demonstrated the flow field below the pipeline the scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process for different conditions of flow bihs and olsen 2011 discussed local scour around an abutment exposed to a steady current it was found that the reduction of the bed shear stress on a sloping bed improves the calculation of the local scour ahmad et al 2018a 2019a presented modelling of scour due to wave impact on a vertical seawall it was found that the seawall scour is governed by the breaking wave impact on the seawall and the development of the standing wave due to the reflected wave energy from the seawall leads to further sediment transport seawards these studies provide investigations scour around simple structures in case of a complex assembly of piles ong et al 2013 developed a mathematical model for the local scour around the vertical piles placed in different arrangement exposed to the long crested and short crested nonlinear random waves plus a current a stochastic method was provided to obtain the maximum equilibrium scour depth around the group of vertical piles ahmad et al 2018b investigated wave induced scour around a side by side arrangement of piles with free surface capturing the study examined the local scour around piles in a long and truncated domain the study further elaborated on the factors affecting the local scour around the multiple piles such as the kc number and gap between the piles in a recent study stahlmann and schlurmann 2012 investigated scour around a tripod structure the study discussed the wave field characteristics scour evolution and the temporal variation of scour depth around a tripod structure although existing research provides a large amount of knowledge about local scour around the simple structures and a tripod further study of scour around a jacket structure which is a complex assembly of the vertical horizontal and diagonal piles has yet to be undertaken the primary objective of this study is to model the scour around a jacket structure with the free surface featuring the model is employed to simulate scour for a real case scenario of scour around a jacket structure at c power wind farm thornton bank at the belgian coast bolle et al 2012 grid and time step size convergence studies are performed to ensure the quality of the simulated hydrodynamics in the numerical wave tank nwt the numerical model is then successively validated for scour around a vertical cylinder exposed to waves for different kc numbers the successfully validated model is then applied to simulate scour around a jacket structure in order to model a realistic scenario the wave input and sediment bed properties are taken from the c power wind farm according to the available field data waves of height 4 5 m were observed under storm conditions in january 2012 and resulted in a large amount of scouring around the jacket bolle et al 2012 this scenario is studied using two simulations the first simulation discusses the scour calculations for a wave of height h 4 5 m which represents the wave conditions observed during the storm at the site as the scour depth increases with the kc number another simulation is run for the scouring process under a steady current which corresponds to kc for this case the undisturbed depth averaged inflow velocity is considered to be u 0 60 m s the results discuss the complex hydrodynamics the maximum scour depth deposition and the temporal variation of the scour process around the jacket structure 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the open source cfd model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 is used for the numerical modelling of wave hydrodynamics and the local scouring process the model solves the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations involving the solution of the continuity and the momentum equations to calculate the flow and pressure field the continuity and momentum equations are shown below 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j g i where u i is the fluid velocity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration and u i u j is representing the reynolds stresses the rans equations are closed by replacing the reynolds stresses with the boussinesq approximation as 3 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j 4 ν t k ω where ν t is the eddy viscosity k is the turbulent kinetic energy density ω is the specific turbulent dissipation rate the kronecker delta δ i j 1 for i j otherwise δ i j 0 the k ω model wilcox 1994 is used to calculate the eddy viscosity ν t by solving for the partial differential equations for the turbulent kinetic energy density k and the specific turbulent dissipation rate ω the equations for k and ω are defined as 5 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j p k β k k ω 6 ω t u j ω x j x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j ω k α p k β ω 2 where p k is the turbulent production rate which is described as follows 7 p k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i the remaining coefficients in eq 4 are taken as follows α 5 9 β k 9 100 β 3 40 σ ω 2 and σ k 2 the overproduction of the turbulence in a highly strained flow outside the boundary layer durbin 2009 is managed as follows 8 ν t min k ω 2 3 k s where s is the mean strain rate 9 s i j 1 2 u j x i u i x j in the vicinity of the walls the turbulence parameters are calculated using the wall laws as 10 u 1 κ l n 30 y k s where u is the dimensionless wall velocity κ 0 4 is the von karman constant y is the water depth and k s is the equivalent sand roughness it is assumed that the turbulent production is equal to the turbulent kinetic energy density dissipation near the wall wilcox 1994 the value of the specific turbulent dissipation for a distance δ y p from the wall to the centre of the bed cell is given as 11 ω w a l l c μ 3 4 k w 1 2 u w δ y p where c μ 0 09 is the model coefficient the turbulent kinetic energy k at the wall is treated by integrating the source terms of eq 5 over the bed cell 12 p k ϵ w a l l ρ τ w u w δ y p ρ c μ 3 4 k w 3 2 u w δ y p the value for the wall shear stress τ w and the dimensionless wall velocity u w is obtained from rough wall law away from the wall the value of the eddy viscosity is estimated by the formulation in eqs 5 9 the rans models are seen to be unstable in the potential flow region leading to an unphysical turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity larsen and fuhrman 2018 jacobsen et al 2012 additionally high velocity gradients around the free surface generate overproduction of turbulence that causes an artificial damping of the free surface in this paper the method suggested by naot and rodi 1982 is used to manage the overproduction of the turbulence at the free surface details of the method can be found in kamath et al 2019 2 2 numerical wave tank and free surface model the waves are generated in a 3d nwt the inlet of the nwt is specified with the dirichlet type inlet boundary condition where the incident wave velocity is prescribed based on the chosen wave theory the waves are absorbed with the active wave absorption method awa higuera et al 2013 at the outlet where the reflected waves from the outlet are cancelled using the negative value of the corrected velocity u c which is described as follows 13 u c g h η r where u c is the corrected velocity h is the still water depth g is the gravitational acceleration and η r is the reflected wave amplitude which is defined as 14 η r η m η g where η m is the measured free surface elevation η g is the generated free surface the method is considered to be a good choice to manage both the wave generation and the absorption in a relatively short numerical wave tank ahmad et al 2018b the bottom of the nwt is considered as a no slip wall and the top of the nwt is considered to be a symmetry plane on the surface of the structure a no slip wall boundary condition is imposed the sediment bed is treated with a rough wall function where a logarithmic wall function is applied in order to account for the bed roughness the free surface is captured using the level set method osher and sethian 1988 this method uses a continuous signed distance function ϕ x t to represent the interface between two immiscible fluids the interface is computed under the velocity field u j the level set function is zero on the interface the positive distance from the interface is phase 1 and the negative distance from the interface is calculated to be phase 2 this is defined as follows 15 ϕ x t 0 i f x i s i n p h a s e 1 0 i f x i s a t t h e i n t e r f a c e 0 i f x i s i n p h a s e 2 the propagation of the level set function ϕ x t is calculated solving the convection equation as follows 16 ϕ t u j ϕ x j 0 the convective velocity u j is calculated from the solution of the rans equations and transforms the level set function in space and time as the free surface evolves the level set function ϕ x t loses its signed distance property therefore the level set function ϕ x t is reinitialised after each time step peng et al 1999 2 3 morphological model the modelling of the local scouring process is based on the calculation of the bed shear stress due to the velocity field from the hydrodynamic model the logarithmic wall function is applied to calculate the bed shear stress as follows 17 τ ρ u 2 where u is the shear velocity and is defined as 18 u u 1 κ l n 30 2 z k s here u is the water velocity at a height z above the bed κ 0 4 is the von karman constant k s 3 d 50 is the equivalent sand roughness and d 50 is the median grain size the initiation of the sediment transport takes place when the simulated bed shear stress τ exceeds the critical bed shear stress τ c the sediment mobility is calculated in terms of the bed load and the suspended load the calculation of the bed load is made with van rijn s van rijn 1984a formula as follows 19 q b d 50 1 5 s 1 g 0 053 t 2 1 d 0 3 here t τ τ c r τ c r is the transport stage parameter d d 50 s 1 g ν 2 1 3 is the particle parameter τ c r is the modified shields critical bed shear stress s ρ s ρ is the specific density ρ s is the sediment density and ρ is the water density the modified critical bed shear stress is calculated using the formulation suggested by dey 2003 the effect of the sloping bed is accounted for by considering the longitudinal bed slope θ the transverse bed slope α the angle of repose of the sediment φ and the drag and lift forces yielding the expression for the critical bed shear stress modification factor r the modified critical bed shear stress τ c r is then calculated from τ 0 obtained from the standard shields diagram shields 1936 20 τ c r r τ 0 and τ 0 θ c s 1 ρ g d 50 where θ c is the critical shields parameter the critical bed shear stress τ 0 is calculated based on θ c 0 05 different angles of repose are considered for the uphill and downhill slopes in the sandslide algorithm following the observations from the experiments by lysne 1969 where the calculated angle of repose on slopes in the direction of flow was found to be much higher than the angle of internal friction this effect was seen to be higher for steeper slopes the suspended sediment load is calculated using a convection diffusion equation the numerical treatment for this transport equation is performed in a similar fashion as for the momentum equations 21 c t u j c x j w s c z x j γ c x j here c is the suspended load concentration γ is the sediment mixing coefficient and w s is the fall velocity of the sediment particles which is calculated based on the stokes law the value of γ is assumed to be equal to the eddy viscosity hunt 1954 the solution of this equation is determined by setting as boundary conditions zero vertical sediment flux at the free surface and the bottom suspended load concentration c b as calculated from van rijn 1984b formula 22 c b 0 015 d 50 a t 1 5 d 0 3 where a is the reference level for the suspended load in the present model the reference level is assumed to be equal to the equivalent roughness height as k s 3 d 50 the sediment concentration close to the bed is interpolated using the rouse 1937 equation 23 c z c b h z z a h a z here z is the distance from the centre of the grid point nearest to the bed olsen 2003 and z is the rouse number given by z w s κ u the excess sediment slides down when the bed slope exceeds the angle of repose φ this process is accounted for using a sand slide algorithm burkow and griebel 2016 implemented in the morphological model a correction of 2 is applied when the bed slope exceeds the angle of repose φ roulund et al 2005 the shape of scour holes are seen to be asymmetrical sumer et al 2002a as the downhill bed slope is expected to be larger than the uphill bed slope the angle of repose for the downhill slope is assumed to be φ 45 and for the uphill bed slope φ 35 lysne 1969 bihs 2011 ahmad et al 2018b the change in bed elevation is calculated with exner s formula see eq 24 the formula ensures the conservation of the sediment mass where the spatial variation in the bed load is conserved with the temporal change in the vertical bed elevation the morphological evolution occurs as a nonlinear propagation of the bed level deformation in the direction of the sediment transport the transient change in bed level is defined as follows 24 z b t 1 1 n q b x x q b y y e d 0 here z is the bed level q b x is the bed load in the x direction q b y is the bed load in y direction n 0 40 is the sediment porosity the term e d defines the net flux of sediment across the interface between the bed load and suspended load and is calculated as suggested by wu et al 2000 the changes in bed elevation are modelled with the level set method which is an implicit representation of the sediment bed as the zero level set the driving factor is f z b t which moves the interface in the vertical direction to represent the erosion and the deposition 2 4 numerical schemes and solver the model approximates spatial derivatives using higher order finite difference methods a uniform cartesian grid is used throughout the domain where dx dy dz the convective terms of the rans equations are discretised with the fifth order accurate conservative weighted essential non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 the convective terms of the turbulence model and the level set function are discretised with the hamilton jacobi formulation of the weno scheme jiang and peng 2000 a third order tvd runge kutta time scheme shu and osher 1988 is used for time treatment of the rans equations and the level set function the hydrodynamic time step for the transient flow field is determined using adaptive time stepping in order to maintain optimal efficiency and stability and is obtained based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number the pressure is treated with the projection method chorin 1968 the bicgstab van der vorst 1992 solver from the high performance solver package hypre with the semi coarsening multi grid preconditioner pfmg ashby and falgout 1996 is implemented to solve the poisson equation for the pressure the complex solid boundary of the structure and bed are defined with an immersed boundary method with the local directional ghost cell approach berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 3 numerical setup the first setup used for the validation of the numerical model is based on the benchmark experimental investigation by sumer et al 1992 the experiments were carried out in a 28 m long and 4 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume the investigations involved several tests with different pile diameters and wave conditions the simulations are performed in an nwt of length 8 8 m and width 2 0 m with a large pile of diameter d 0 20 m the pile is placed at the centre of the nwt for all simulations the water depth is h 0 40 m the bottom of the nwt z 0 30 m is filled with sand of the median grain size d 50 0 18 mm the density of the sediment is ρ s 2700 kg m 3 the critical shields parameter which defines the initiation of motion of sediment particles is considered to be θ c 0 05 the simulations are performed for five different kc numbers which define the orbital motion of the water particles relative to the width of the pile sumer and fredsøe 1997 the experiments conducted in the wave flume by sumer et al 1992 did not investigate the scour under a steady current for the large vertical pile and therefore the experiment by link 2006 is used the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 20 m the still water depth is h 0 30 m the steady current velocity is u 0 30 m s the median grain size is d 50 0 97 mm the other properties are the same as used in the previous simulations the details of the simulations performed are listed in table 1 4 model validation 4 1 grid and time step size convergence study at first the grid size and time step convergence tests are performed in an nwt without structure the purpose of the tests is to determine the minimum grid size required to maintain the quality of the generated waves during propagation along the wave flume as shown in fig 1 a b fifth order cnoidal waves are chosen based on the incident wave characteristics one wave gauge is located at the centre of the tank x d 0 where the pile is to be fixed the numerical tests are run by considering the steepest wave of steepness k h 0 15 where k 2 π λ is the wave number λ 8 8 m is the wavelength and h 0 25 m is wave height analysed in the experiment sumer et al 1992 four different grid sizes d x d y d z 0 04 m 0 03 m 0 02 m and 0 01 m are tested for all grid sizes the cfl number is kept at 0 25 the results show the accuracy of the simulated waves through comparison with wave theory fig 2 a d show the simulated wave surface elevations for different grid sizes it is found that the wave accuracy increases with a decrease in grid size d x the quality of the wave is considered to be satisfactory for a grid size d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 25 in order to further improve the quality of the propagated waves tests are performed for the time step size the calculation of the transient flow hydrodynamics is based on an adaptive time stepping where the time step size is attributed to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number therefore instead of testing a fixed time step size different cfl numbers i e cfl 0 40 0 30 0 20 and 0 10 are tested the grid size of d x 0 01 m is maintained for all following simulations fig 3 a d shows a comparison between the simulated free surface elevations and the wave theory for different cfl numbers the wave quality is observed to increase with a decrease in cfl numbers it can be seen that the wave crests and wave troughs are slightly overestimated for cfl 0 10 this is due to the propagation of relatively a high h 0 21 m and steep wave k h 0 15 in the shallow water the quality of the wave is considered to be reasonably good for a grid size d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 10 and the solution is considered to be converged however the quality of a wave with a low wave steepness k h 0 08 can be found in ahmad et al 2018b results show a good match of the propagating waves with the wave theory for d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 10 4 2 scour around the pile exposed to waves this section describes the simulation of the local scouring process under the presence of a dynamic free surface the scour results for the case with kc 12 are discussed in detail the results of the remaining tests show a similar temporal variation of the maximum scour depth and scour hole pattern after t s 60 min and therefore the results are presented only for the change in scour depth s d against the kc number the simulations are run for different kc values using the partial decoupling approach this implies that the bed evolves with the change in hydrodynamics at each time step however instead of using a common time step size for the hydrodynamic and morphological models an increased time step for the morphological model is employed the increment of the morphological time step corresponding to the hydrodynamic time step is defined as the decoupling factor d f δ t s δ t here δ t s is the time step for the morphological model and δ t is the time step for the hydrodynamic model the decoupling factor df 1 0 refers to a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphological models the decoupling factor for the scour around monopile simulations is d f 6 6 as in ahmad et al 2018b the partial decoupling approach is implemented as the simulated flow is coupled with the bed load and suspended load which is linked to the exner s equation at each hydrodynamic time step the bed evolution is calculated using the morphological time step t s and represented with the level set function ϕ x t the level set function changes the signed distance property with the bed evolution hence the function is reinitialised at each hydrodynamic time step the process is repeated with the change in hydrodynamics until an equilibrium scour state is maintained this approach helps in reducing the computational cost significantly fig 4 a shows the free surface velocity of the incoming wave the maximum wave orbital velocity is u m 0 53 m s the incident wave height is h 0 21 m the wave period is t 4 5 s and the keulegan carpenter number is calculated to be kc u m t d 12 the flow around the pile depicts a stage where the pile is exposed to the wave crest action fig 4 b shows a zoomed in view of the near bed velocity contour in the vicinity of the pile the plane is located at z d 1 0 above the bed fig 4 c h are the sequence of the wave incident on the pile the maximum velocities beside the pile are seen to be u 0 90 m s however the downstream side of the pile shows relatively lower velocities u 0 20 m s thus an increase in the velocities at the sides of the pile compared to the maximum incident velocities contributes to a higher bed shear stress around the pile and results in higher sediment transport from this region the lower velocities at the downstream side develop a relatively lower bed shear stress and consequently lower sediment transport fig 5 a d show the sequence of the scour development around the pile the maximum scour around the pile is found to be s d 0 14 and the deposition at the downstream side are s d 0 12 the magnitude of the deposition is comparable to the scour depth this is attributed to the wave induced local scour where sediments are not transported away from the region as in the case of a steady current fig 5 e shows the temporal variation of the local scouring process it is seen that the major part of the maximum scour takes place within the first 20 min the fluctuations in the scour depth pattern represent the scouring and refilling with the wave crests and troughs fig 5 f shows the change in maximum scour depth s d around the pile depending on the kc number it is found that s d increases with the kc number the scour depth is found to be four times higher at kc 12 compared to kc 6 81 due to the higher wave activity around the pile the results show a good agreement with the experimental observations sumer et al 1992 which confirms the accuracy of the model regarding the simulation of scour around a vertical pile exposed to wave action 4 3 scour around the pile exposed to a steady current fig 6 a b present the scour around the pile under a steady current in this case the incident flow velocity is u 0 30 m s the velocity on either side of the pile is seen to be u 0 35 m s due to the flow contraction however the velocity in the shadow region is seen to be lower with the velocity u 0 10 m s the converging streamlines in the shadow region indicate the presence of the wake vortices which is considered to be the main cause of scour at the downstream side of the pile sumer and fredsøe 1990 fig 6 c f depict the development of the scour depth at different time intervals it is found that the scouring process is initiated from the sides of the pile and propagates around the pile with time the scour at the sides and front of the pile is seen higher compared to the scour at the downstream side this indicates that a high flow activity on the upstream side of the pile and the higher velocity beside the pile leads to the formation of horseshoe vortices at the upstream side which govern the maximum scour chiew and melville 1987 sumer et al 2002b baykal et al 2015 fig 6 g shows the final stage of the scour around the pile after 20 h the scour depth and extent is presented in top view the maximum scour depth around the pile is seen to be s d 0 70 the scour around the pile depicts almost a circular profile with scour extents x d y d range 1 8 to 1 8 the scour profile shows a satisfactory match with the experiment link 2006 as shown with the black dots the scour at the upstream side of the pile is in good agreement with the experiment however the scour depth at the downstream side of the pile is slightly underpredicted and is followed by the deposition fig 6 h shows the temporal variation of the process for simulation it is seen that almost half of the maximum scour i e s d 0 35 is achieved within a few minutes once the scour hole is formed the maximum scour depth stagnates as the sediment slides into the scour hole from the outer regions this results in an increase of the scour hole width when the scour hole becomes wide enough there is a decrease in the flow velocities and bed shear stress in the scour hole consequently the scour depth rate decreases with the scour hole development it is found that scour depth during the initial and final stage of the scouring process shows a good match the intermediate scour depth is relatively lower compared to the experiment this is more likely due to the mesh resolution around the pile in addition the boundary layer and the individual vortex shedding mechanism is not resolved with this approach these processes represent important flow features close to the solid boundary and consequently the local scour the restriction on the complete representation of these processes can contribute to the differences seen between the numerical results and the measurements eventually the simulated scour topography the maximum scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process depict an adequate agreement with the experiment link 2006 the numerical results demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the local scour around a pile under waves and a steady current conditions 5 scour around a jacket structure the validated numerical model for the scour around a monopile under waves and current is used to simulate the scour around a jacket structure the wave conditions and sediment properties are taken from the c power wind farm thornton bank which is located 30 km from the belgian coast bolle et al 2012 the jacket is comprised of four vertical piles connected with the diagonal bracings the diameter of the vertical piles is d 2 0 m and the gap between the individual foundations is g d 10 the still water depth on the site ranges between 12 m to 30 m in the present study the highest still water depth of h 30 0 m is considered the bed material is sand of the median grain size d 50 0 30 mm and the density of the sediment is ρ s 2700 kg m 3 the angle of repose for the downhill slope is φ 45 and for the uphill bed slope φ 35 following lysne 1969 and bihs and olsen 2011 where the direction of flow results in different angles of repose the critical shields parameter for the bed material is θ c 0 05 bolle et al 2010 according to the hydrodynamic measurements from the site the waves of wave height range 3 5 4 5 m were observed under storm conditions in january 2012 and the average scour depth is seen to be s d 0 85 to 1 35 which is considered to be a developed scour depth as per dnv gl guidelines dnv 2014 this case is simulated by considering a typical condition of a storm of wave height h 4 5 m still water depth h 30 wave period t 23 0 s and kc 2 π a d 7 0 the morphological calculation of 60 min is obtained with df 6 8 the simulation is run until the morphological calculations of 60 min is achieved for kc the jacket platform is exposed to a steady current flow velocity with u 0 60 m s the details of the prototype are listed in table 1 5 1 scour around a jacket structure exposed to waves in this section results of the scour around the jacket exposed to waves are discussed the simulation is run for t 60 min the results describe the flow velocities at the free surface changes in the velocities close to the bed and the resulting local scour the diameter of an individual pile of the jacket structure is d 2 0 m and the gap between the piles is g 10 d it requires a minimum l x 22 d g 32 d 64 0 m long l y 10 d g 20 d 40 0 m wide and l z h minimum cover above the still water depth 30 m 10 m 40 m high nwt for the wave generations and propagation as shown in fig 7 a b the size of the nwt is based on truncated length of the nwt tank required for wave propagation in the nwt ahmad et al 2018b the width is assumed to be sufficiently wide to maintain an undisturbed flow around the jacket platform breuer et al 2000 the numerical modelling of such large numerical nwt needs large computational resources therefore a coarse grid size of d x 0 20 is used to run the simulations for scour around the jacket platform the selection of the grid size d x is based on the number grid cells around the pile i e d d x 10 this criterion has already been tested for scour around the piles in a side by side arrangement by ahmad et al 2018b to ensure the quality of the wave propagation the wave is generated and propagated in the nwt without a jacket platform fig 8 shows the computed free surface elevations it can be seen that the simulated wave elevations show a good match with the wave theory this confirms the accuracy of the wave generation and the propagation in the large nwt with d x 0 20 m hence the model is implemented to simulate the local scour by introducing a jacket platform in the nwt in the following simulations the focus is on the change in wave hydrodynamics and the resulting scour around a jacket platform exposed to wave and steady current fig 9 a shows the free surface when the wave crest is incident on the jacket the velocities around the vertical piles vary between u 4 0 to 5 0 m s the velocities in the shadow region of the vertical piles and outside the jacket are seen to range from u 0 to 2 0 m s fig 9 b shows the free surface velocity under wave trough the free surface elevation is lowered to 27 5 m and velocities around the jacket vary between 1 6 and 1 0 m s fig 9 c shows the velocity contour on a plane 0 10 m above the bed when the wave crest is incident on the jacket the velocities outside the jacket range between 1 0 and 1 5 m s however the velocities around the vertical piles and under the lateral bracings of the jacket seem to vary between 1 5 to 3 5 m s which are almost two times higher compared to the velocities in the outside region of the jacket the increase in the velocities around the jacket is due to the flow contraction around the vertical piles and the formation of a flow jet between the lateral bracing and the bed the velocities inside the jacket seem almost similar to the velocities seen outside the jacket fig 9 d shows the velocities during wave trough it is seen that the flow hydrodynamics are similar to the ones seen during wave crest action but in the opposite direction the velocities around the vertical piles and below the bracings range from 1 0 to 1 5 m s the velocities at on the downstream side of piles are higher compared to the upstream side of the jacket fig 9 e shows the scour when the waves are incident on the jacket it is seen that the higher velocities around the vertical piles and the bracing leads to a higher scour depth around the jacket however the inside region of the jacket structure is subjected to relatively lower velocities consequently the eroded sediment from the front piles are deposited inside the jacket fig 9 f shows scour around the jacket structure during the wave trough a large scour at the rear side of the jacket is evident this is due to the high velocities seen around the vertical piles and below the bracings during the wave trough it can be seen that deposition inside the jacket is further increased overall the higher velocities around the vertical piles and under the lateral bracings indicate flow contractions and formations of jet flow this change in flow hydrodynamics leads to the local scour around at the vertical piles and lateral bracings and the deposition inside the jacket fig 10 a d demonstrate the scour evolution at t s 15 30 45 and 60 min it is seen that the scour is initiated at the vertical cylinders of the jacket and is increasing over time the magnitude of maximum scour depth is s d 0 80 and the deposition is s d 0 50 the scour depth at the front piles of the jacket is lower compared to the rear piles this is due to the continuous process of intensive scouring at the front piles during wave crest and re filling of deposited sediment during the wave trough however at the rear piles of the jacket the sediments removed during the wave crest are transported away in the direction of the wave propagation therefore there is almost no re filling occurs during the wave trough consequently a high scour depth can be observed at the rear piles of the jacket the simulated scour pattern around the jacket is well supported by the experiments conducted for scour around a tripod structure by stahlmann 2013 where a higher scour at the rear side of the tripod is measured fig 10 e shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour at the front and rear piles the spikes in the graph represent the change in the maximum scour depth with wave crests and troughs it is seen that the interaction of the wave crest with the jacket leads to a high scour depth at the front pile the scour depth during a wave peak is almost s d 0 30 however during the wave trough a significantly higher backfilling of the scour hole is evident this results in a decrease in the scour depth around the vertical piles the maximum scour depth at the front pile after 60 min is seen to be s d 0 40 at the rear pile the scour depth seems to be increasing with a faster rate and without a significant backfilling this leads to a deeper scour hole at the rear piles the maximum scour depth at the front pile after 60 min is s d 0 50 fig 10 f shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour depth around the jacket it can be seen that the maximum scour depth grows rapidly in the beginning and slows down as it approaches an equilibrium state after t s 60 min the magnitude of the maximum scour depth is s d 0 80 which is under the bracing attached with rear piles of the jacket the simulated scour depth s d agrees with field observations bolle et al 2012 of average of the maximum scour depths s d 0 85 1 35 observed after one storm 5 2 scour around a jacket structure exposed to a steady current as the scour depth increases with the kc number another simulation is run for the scour around the jacket structure exposed to a steady current which corresponds to kc the incident flow velocity is u 0 60 m s which represents a typical flow condition in the field bolle et al 2012 the simulation is run for t s 60 min the results for the scour under a steady current reveal the complex hydrodynamics the maximum scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process around the jacket structure fig 11 a b show the free surface flow around the jacket and velocities on a plane 0 10 m above the bed the velocities around the jacket range from 0 60 to 1 0 m s an increase in the velocities on either sides of the piles and below the lateral bracings due to flow contraction and the formation of jet flow can be noticed the region on the downstream side of the piles shows a converging flow with the velocities in the range of u 0 to 0 20 m s the results clearly show higher velocities around the vertical piles this results in higher scour around the vertical piles at the front and rear piles however no significant scour is observed below the bracings as shown in fig 11 c f the magnitude of maximum scour depth is seen to be s d 0 70 in comparison to the deposition observed in the case of the oscillatory fluid motion of the waves the eroded sediments are washed away by the steady flow and a reduced deposition is observed in the shadow region of piles at the jacket fig 12 a shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour observed at the front and rear piles as the front piles are directly exposed to the steady flow it leads to a higher scour the scour depth at the front piles is seen to be s d 0 70 the scour depth at the rear piles is seen to be s d 0 50 there is insignificant re filling of the scour hole as seen in case of waves the scour at both the front and rear piles reveal a rapid and continuous scour growth over time the maximum scour depth around the jacket is seen to be s d 0 70 which is at front piles the results demonstrate that an equilibrium scour depth is not yet achieved fig 12 b shows the variation of the maximum scour depth s d with increasing kc number the simulated scour depth for all scenarios is compared with sumer et al 1992 formula sumer et al 1992 the result shows that the scour depth calculated for a monopile shows a close match however for a jacket the maximum scour simulated around the jacket for kc 7 0 is almost 10 times higher compared to the scour depth for a monopile the observation suggests a careful consideration for the estimation of maximum scour depth around jacket structure using the empirical formulae developed for a monopile 6 conclusions in this paper numerical modelling of local scour with free surface capturing around a jacket structure is presented the open source cfd model reef3d is used to simulate the flow hydrodynamics by solving the rans equations with the k ω turbulence model the free surface is captured with the level set method the simulated flow hydrodynamics are coupled with the sediment transport algorithms to simulate the local scour the sediment transport algorithms account for the effect of the sloping bed for the calculation of the critical bed shear stress in order to obtain a more realistic prediction of the scour hole a sand slide algorithm is incorporated to correct the bed slope when it exceeds the angle of repose the changes in the bed level are based on exner s formula a series of simulations are conducted for local scour around a vertical pile exposed to waves for different kc numbers finally the validated model is used to simulate scour around the jacket structure based on the analysis of the simulated results the following conclusions can be drawn in the case of wave induced scour around a pile the scour depth is seen to be increasing four times with kc in the range 6 kc 12 an equilibrium scour depth is achieved the scour profile is seen to be asymmetric where the maximum scour is observed at the upstream side of the pile the change in the maximum scour depth with kc showed a satisfactory match with the experimental data from sumer et al 1992 in the case of scour around the pile exposed to a steady current the maximum scour depth is found to be s d 0 70 the scour topography temporal variation of the process and the maximum scour show a good match with experimental data from link 2006 the results demonstrate the accuracy of the model in simulating scour under waves and current the validated model for scour around a monopile under waves and current is applied to simulate scour around a jacket structure the changes in the velocity profile due to wave action and a steady current are discussed finally the development of the resulting scour profiles and the temporal variation of the process are presented the maximum scour depth is calculated to be s d 0 70 in the case of the jacket exposed to a steady current the maximum scour depth is found to be s d 0 80 the results support the field observation of the averaged scour depth ranges between s d 0 85 1 35 bolle et al 2010 2012 overall the simulated results demonstrate a good agreement with the experimental results for scour around the jacket structure under waves and a steady current the current study helps to better understand the hydrodynamics and the associated scour problems around the

22041,this paper presents a numerical investigation of local scour with dynamic free surface capturing around a jacket structure the hydrodynamics and resulting scour are calculated using the open

depth 1 introduction the offshore industry has to deal with increased renewable energy demand and the development of large jacket structures to support offshore wind turbines failure of a jacket can lead to high costs for repair and maintenance thus the stability of a jacket is an important concern and needs to be analysed for the local scour and well as global scour around the jacket structure there is limited knowledge about the scouring process around jacket structures which is mainly gained through the field investigations and physical modelling van dijk 1980 dahlberg 1983 studied scour around the gravity platforms and jacket structures the observations showed that significant scour occurs mainly in areas with active sand waves rudolph et al 2004 investigated scour around jacket structures in the southern north sea they demonstrated scour around structures exposed to the waves and current for a long duration it was suggested that the mean scour development can be reproduced with the empirical formula by nakagawa and suzuki 1976 bolle et al 2012 discussed scour around a jacket structure at the c power wind farm at flemish coast to design protection measures in a recent study stahlmann 2013 investigated scour around a tripod structure through laboratory experiments in his study the global and local scour and the effect of incident wave direction on scour around a tripod structure have been investigated these studies are found to be a challenging and time consuming process as field measurements or complex laboratory experiments are involved alternatively the maximum scour around a jacket can be calculated using empirical formulae from sumer et al 1992 the formulae calculate the scour depth around the vertical piles without accounting for the complexity of the structure the calculation of the maximum scour depth around jacket structures using empirical formulae might result in unrealistic scour depths as the scour process around a jacket cannot be represented thoroughly as one scour hole to overcome this problem cfd modelling of the scouring process around jacket structures can be a potential alternative way to analyse the scour problems more accurately many researchers have studied local scour around the simple structures with cfd modelling approach mostly these structures are vertical piles ahmad et al 2015 horizontal piles ahmad et al 2019b abutments bihs and olsen 2011 seawalls ahmad et al 2018a 2019a and a group of vertical piles ahmad et al 2018b olsen and kjellesvig 1998 investigated the scour around a circular cylinder exposed to a steady current the study was performed by solving the navier stokes equations coupled with sediment transport algorithms a clear water scour was simulated until an equilibrium state achieved tseng et al 2000 studied the scour around both circular and square cylinders exposed to a steady current the large eddy simulation les approach was used to investigate the vortex shedding and sediment transport roulund et al 2005 investigated the scour around a vertical pile exposed to a steady current they investigated the influence of the boundary layer thickness reynolds number bed roughness and the scour processes baykal et al 2015 investigated the flow and consequently the local scour around a vertical cylinder they discussed the vortex shedding and sediment transport process it was concluded that the equilibrium scour depth is reduced by 50 when the suspended load is not considered baykal et al 2017 investigated the scour around a vertical pile exposed to wave it was found that the local scour and backfilling are governed by the lee wake flow the equilibrium depth of the scour holes was seen to be the same for both the scour and the backfilling for a given keulegan carpenter number however in these studies the free surface was not resolved liu and garcia 2008 employed a three dimensional numerical model to simulate the local scour around a vertical pile with free water surface capturing afzal et al 2015 and ahmad et al 2015 investigated the scour around a large pile under a steady current and scour under a wave with a free surface it was found that the scour depth and deposition increase with the keulegan carpenter kc 2 π a d number scour below the pipelines horizontal pile has been investigated by liang and cheng 2005 fuhrman et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and larsen et al 2016 in these studies scour beneath the submarine pipelines exposed to a steady current alone wave alone and wave plus current the backfilling processes and temporal variation of the scour were also discussed however the studies were found limited to 2d modelling of local scour with no free surface capturing ahmad et al 2019b presented a 2d numerical modelling of pipeline scour under a steady current waves and the combined action of waves and current including the unsteady free surface the results demonstrated the flow field below the pipeline the scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process for different conditions of flow bihs and olsen 2011 discussed local scour around an abutment exposed to a steady current it was found that the reduction of the bed shear stress on a sloping bed improves the calculation of the local scour ahmad et al 2018a 2019a presented modelling of scour due to wave impact on a vertical seawall it was found that the seawall scour is governed by the breaking wave impact on the seawall and the development of the standing wave due to the reflected wave energy from the seawall leads to further sediment transport seawards these studies provide investigations scour around simple structures in case of a complex assembly of piles ong et al 2013 developed a mathematical model for the local scour around the vertical piles placed in different arrangement exposed to the long crested and short crested nonlinear random waves plus a current a stochastic method was provided to obtain the maximum equilibrium scour depth around the group of vertical piles ahmad et al 2018b investigated wave induced scour around a side by side arrangement of piles with free surface capturing the study examined the local scour around piles in a long and truncated domain the study further elaborated on the factors affecting the local scour around the multiple piles such as the kc number and gap between the piles in a recent study stahlmann and schlurmann 2012 investigated scour around a tripod structure the study discussed the wave field characteristics scour evolution and the temporal variation of scour depth around a tripod structure although existing research provides a large amount of knowledge about local scour around the simple structures and a tripod further study of scour around a jacket structure which is a complex assembly of the vertical horizontal and diagonal piles has yet to be undertaken the primary objective of this study is to model the scour around a jacket structure with the free surface featuring the model is employed to simulate scour for a real case scenario of scour around a jacket structure at c power wind farm thornton bank at the belgian coast bolle et al 2012 grid and time step size convergence studies are performed to ensure the quality of the simulated hydrodynamics in the numerical wave tank nwt the numerical model is then successively validated for scour around a vertical cylinder exposed to waves for different kc numbers the successfully validated model is then applied to simulate scour around a jacket structure in order to model a realistic scenario the wave input and sediment bed properties are taken from the c power wind farm according to the available field data waves of height 4 5 m were observed under storm conditions in january 2012 and resulted in a large amount of scouring around the jacket bolle et al 2012 this scenario is studied using two simulations the first simulation discusses the scour calculations for a wave of height h 4 5 m which represents the wave conditions observed during the storm at the site as the scour depth increases with the kc number another simulation is run for the scouring process under a steady current which corresponds to kc for this case the undisturbed depth averaged inflow velocity is considered to be u 0 60 m s the results discuss the complex hydrodynamics the maximum scour depth deposition and the temporal variation of the scour process around the jacket structure 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model the open source cfd model reef3d bihs et al 2016 bihs and kamath 2017 is used for the numerical modelling of wave hydrodynamics and the local scouring process the model solves the incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations involving the solution of the continuity and the momentum equations to calculate the flow and pressure field the continuity and momentum equations are shown below 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j g i where u i is the fluid velocity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity g is the gravitational acceleration and u i u j is representing the reynolds stresses the rans equations are closed by replacing the reynolds stresses with the boussinesq approximation as 3 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j 4 ν t k ω where ν t is the eddy viscosity k is the turbulent kinetic energy density ω is the specific turbulent dissipation rate the kronecker delta δ i j 1 for i j otherwise δ i j 0 the k ω model wilcox 1994 is used to calculate the eddy viscosity ν t by solving for the partial differential equations for the turbulent kinetic energy density k and the specific turbulent dissipation rate ω the equations for k and ω are defined as 5 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j p k β k k ω 6 ω t u j ω x j x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j ω k α p k β ω 2 where p k is the turbulent production rate which is described as follows 7 p k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i the remaining coefficients in eq 4 are taken as follows α 5 9 β k 9 100 β 3 40 σ ω 2 and σ k 2 the overproduction of the turbulence in a highly strained flow outside the boundary layer durbin 2009 is managed as follows 8 ν t min k ω 2 3 k s where s is the mean strain rate 9 s i j 1 2 u j x i u i x j in the vicinity of the walls the turbulence parameters are calculated using the wall laws as 10 u 1 κ l n 30 y k s where u is the dimensionless wall velocity κ 0 4 is the von karman constant y is the water depth and k s is the equivalent sand roughness it is assumed that the turbulent production is equal to the turbulent kinetic energy density dissipation near the wall wilcox 1994 the value of the specific turbulent dissipation for a distance δ y p from the wall to the centre of the bed cell is given as 11 ω w a l l c μ 3 4 k w 1 2 u w δ y p where c μ 0 09 is the model coefficient the turbulent kinetic energy k at the wall is treated by integrating the source terms of eq 5 over the bed cell 12 p k ϵ w a l l ρ τ w u w δ y p ρ c μ 3 4 k w 3 2 u w δ y p the value for the wall shear stress τ w and the dimensionless wall velocity u w is obtained from rough wall law away from the wall the value of the eddy viscosity is estimated by the formulation in eqs 5 9 the rans models are seen to be unstable in the potential flow region leading to an unphysical turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity larsen and fuhrman 2018 jacobsen et al 2012 additionally high velocity gradients around the free surface generate overproduction of turbulence that causes an artificial damping of the free surface in this paper the method suggested by naot and rodi 1982 is used to manage the overproduction of the turbulence at the free surface details of the method can be found in kamath et al 2019 2 2 numerical wave tank and free surface model the waves are generated in a 3d nwt the inlet of the nwt is specified with the dirichlet type inlet boundary condition where the incident wave velocity is prescribed based on the chosen wave theory the waves are absorbed with the active wave absorption method awa higuera et al 2013 at the outlet where the reflected waves from the outlet are cancelled using the negative value of the corrected velocity u c which is described as follows 13 u c g h η r where u c is the corrected velocity h is the still water depth g is the gravitational acceleration and η r is the reflected wave amplitude which is defined as 14 η r η m η g where η m is the measured free surface elevation η g is the generated free surface the method is considered to be a good choice to manage both the wave generation and the absorption in a relatively short numerical wave tank ahmad et al 2018b the bottom of the nwt is considered as a no slip wall and the top of the nwt is considered to be a symmetry plane on the surface of the structure a no slip wall boundary condition is imposed the sediment bed is treated with a rough wall function where a logarithmic wall function is applied in order to account for the bed roughness the free surface is captured using the level set method osher and sethian 1988 this method uses a continuous signed distance function ϕ x t to represent the interface between two immiscible fluids the interface is computed under the velocity field u j the level set function is zero on the interface the positive distance from the interface is phase 1 and the negative distance from the interface is calculated to be phase 2 this is defined as follows 15 ϕ x t 0 i f x i s i n p h a s e 1 0 i f x i s a t t h e i n t e r f a c e 0 i f x i s i n p h a s e 2 the propagation of the level set function ϕ x t is calculated solving the convection equation as follows 16 ϕ t u j ϕ x j 0 the convective velocity u j is calculated from the solution of the rans equations and transforms the level set function in space and time as the free surface evolves the level set function ϕ x t loses its signed distance property therefore the level set function ϕ x t is reinitialised after each time step peng et al 1999 2 3 morphological model the modelling of the local scouring process is based on the calculation of the bed shear stress due to the velocity field from the hydrodynamic model the logarithmic wall function is applied to calculate the bed shear stress as follows 17 τ ρ u 2 where u is the shear velocity and is defined as 18 u u 1 κ l n 30 2 z k s here u is the water velocity at a height z above the bed κ 0 4 is the von karman constant k s 3 d 50 is the equivalent sand roughness and d 50 is the median grain size the initiation of the sediment transport takes place when the simulated bed shear stress τ exceeds the critical bed shear stress τ c the sediment mobility is calculated in terms of the bed load and the suspended load the calculation of the bed load is made with van rijn s van rijn 1984a formula as follows 19 q b d 50 1 5 s 1 g 0 053 t 2 1 d 0 3 here t τ τ c r τ c r is the transport stage parameter d d 50 s 1 g ν 2 1 3 is the particle parameter τ c r is the modified shields critical bed shear stress s ρ s ρ is the specific density ρ s is the sediment density and ρ is the water density the modified critical bed shear stress is calculated using the formulation suggested by dey 2003 the effect of the sloping bed is accounted for by considering the longitudinal bed slope θ the transverse bed slope α the angle of repose of the sediment φ and the drag and lift forces yielding the expression for the critical bed shear stress modification factor r the modified critical bed shear stress τ c r is then calculated from τ 0 obtained from the standard shields diagram shields 1936 20 τ c r r τ 0 and τ 0 θ c s 1 ρ g d 50 where θ c is the critical shields parameter the critical bed shear stress τ 0 is calculated based on θ c 0 05 different angles of repose are considered for the uphill and downhill slopes in the sandslide algorithm following the observations from the experiments by lysne 1969 where the calculated angle of repose on slopes in the direction of flow was found to be much higher than the angle of internal friction this effect was seen to be higher for steeper slopes the suspended sediment load is calculated using a convection diffusion equation the numerical treatment for this transport equation is performed in a similar fashion as for the momentum equations 21 c t u j c x j w s c z x j γ c x j here c is the suspended load concentration γ is the sediment mixing coefficient and w s is the fall velocity of the sediment particles which is calculated based on the stokes law the value of γ is assumed to be equal to the eddy viscosity hunt 1954 the solution of this equation is determined by setting as boundary conditions zero vertical sediment flux at the free surface and the bottom suspended load concentration c b as calculated from van rijn 1984b formula 22 c b 0 015 d 50 a t 1 5 d 0 3 where a is the reference level for the suspended load in the present model the reference level is assumed to be equal to the equivalent roughness height as k s 3 d 50 the sediment concentration close to the bed is interpolated using the rouse 1937 equation 23 c z c b h z z a h a z here z is the distance from the centre of the grid point nearest to the bed olsen 2003 and z is the rouse number given by z w s κ u the excess sediment slides down when the bed slope exceeds the angle of repose φ this process is accounted for using a sand slide algorithm burkow and griebel 2016 implemented in the morphological model a correction of 2 is applied when the bed slope exceeds the angle of repose φ roulund et al 2005 the shape of scour holes are seen to be asymmetrical sumer et al 2002a as the downhill bed slope is expected to be larger than the uphill bed slope the angle of repose for the downhill slope is assumed to be φ 45 and for the uphill bed slope φ 35 lysne 1969 bihs 2011 ahmad et al 2018b the change in bed elevation is calculated with exner s formula see eq 24 the formula ensures the conservation of the sediment mass where the spatial variation in the bed load is conserved with the temporal change in the vertical bed elevation the morphological evolution occurs as a nonlinear propagation of the bed level deformation in the direction of the sediment transport the transient change in bed level is defined as follows 24 z b t 1 1 n q b x x q b y y e d 0 here z is the bed level q b x is the bed load in the x direction q b y is the bed load in y direction n 0 40 is the sediment porosity the term e d defines the net flux of sediment across the interface between the bed load and suspended load and is calculated as suggested by wu et al 2000 the changes in bed elevation are modelled with the level set method which is an implicit representation of the sediment bed as the zero level set the driving factor is f z b t which moves the interface in the vertical direction to represent the erosion and the deposition 2 4 numerical schemes and solver the model approximates spatial derivatives using higher order finite difference methods a uniform cartesian grid is used throughout the domain where dx dy dz the convective terms of the rans equations are discretised with the fifth order accurate conservative weighted essential non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 the convective terms of the turbulence model and the level set function are discretised with the hamilton jacobi formulation of the weno scheme jiang and peng 2000 a third order tvd runge kutta time scheme shu and osher 1988 is used for time treatment of the rans equations and the level set function the hydrodynamic time step for the transient flow field is determined using adaptive time stepping in order to maintain optimal efficiency and stability and is obtained based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number the pressure is treated with the projection method chorin 1968 the bicgstab van der vorst 1992 solver from the high performance solver package hypre with the semi coarsening multi grid preconditioner pfmg ashby and falgout 1996 is implemented to solve the poisson equation for the pressure the complex solid boundary of the structure and bed are defined with an immersed boundary method with the local directional ghost cell approach berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 3 numerical setup the first setup used for the validation of the numerical model is based on the benchmark experimental investigation by sumer et al 1992 the experiments were carried out in a 28 m long and 4 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume the investigations involved several tests with different pile diameters and wave conditions the simulations are performed in an nwt of length 8 8 m and width 2 0 m with a large pile of diameter d 0 20 m the pile is placed at the centre of the nwt for all simulations the water depth is h 0 40 m the bottom of the nwt z 0 30 m is filled with sand of the median grain size d 50 0 18 mm the density of the sediment is ρ s 2700 kg m 3 the critical shields parameter which defines the initiation of motion of sediment particles is considered to be θ c 0 05 the simulations are performed for five different kc numbers which define the orbital motion of the water particles relative to the width of the pile sumer and fredsøe 1997 the experiments conducted in the wave flume by sumer et al 1992 did not investigate the scour under a steady current for the large vertical pile and therefore the experiment by link 2006 is used the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 20 m the still water depth is h 0 30 m the steady current velocity is u 0 30 m s the median grain size is d 50 0 97 mm the other properties are the same as used in the previous simulations the details of the simulations performed are listed in table 1 4 model validation 4 1 grid and time step size convergence study at first the grid size and time step convergence tests are performed in an nwt without structure the purpose of the tests is to determine the minimum grid size required to maintain the quality of the generated waves during propagation along the wave flume as shown in fig 1 a b fifth order cnoidal waves are chosen based on the incident wave characteristics one wave gauge is located at the centre of the tank x d 0 where the pile is to be fixed the numerical tests are run by considering the steepest wave of steepness k h 0 15 where k 2 π λ is the wave number λ 8 8 m is the wavelength and h 0 25 m is wave height analysed in the experiment sumer et al 1992 four different grid sizes d x d y d z 0 04 m 0 03 m 0 02 m and 0 01 m are tested for all grid sizes the cfl number is kept at 0 25 the results show the accuracy of the simulated waves through comparison with wave theory fig 2 a d show the simulated wave surface elevations for different grid sizes it is found that the wave accuracy increases with a decrease in grid size d x the quality of the wave is considered to be satisfactory for a grid size d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 25 in order to further improve the quality of the propagated waves tests are performed for the time step size the calculation of the transient flow hydrodynamics is based on an adaptive time stepping where the time step size is attributed to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number therefore instead of testing a fixed time step size different cfl numbers i e cfl 0 40 0 30 0 20 and 0 10 are tested the grid size of d x 0 01 m is maintained for all following simulations fig 3 a d shows a comparison between the simulated free surface elevations and the wave theory for different cfl numbers the wave quality is observed to increase with a decrease in cfl numbers it can be seen that the wave crests and wave troughs are slightly overestimated for cfl 0 10 this is due to the propagation of relatively a high h 0 21 m and steep wave k h 0 15 in the shallow water the quality of the wave is considered to be reasonably good for a grid size d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 10 and the solution is considered to be converged however the quality of a wave with a low wave steepness k h 0 08 can be found in ahmad et al 2018b results show a good match of the propagating waves with the wave theory for d x 0 01 m and cfl 0 10 4 2 scour around the pile exposed to waves this section describes the simulation of the local scouring process under the presence of a dynamic free surface the scour results for the case with kc 12 are discussed in detail the results of the remaining tests show a similar temporal variation of the maximum scour depth and scour hole pattern after t s 60 min and therefore the results are presented only for the change in scour depth s d against the kc number the simulations are run for different kc values using the partial decoupling approach this implies that the bed evolves with the change in hydrodynamics at each time step however instead of using a common time step size for the hydrodynamic and morphological models an increased time step for the morphological model is employed the increment of the morphological time step corresponding to the hydrodynamic time step is defined as the decoupling factor d f δ t s δ t here δ t s is the time step for the morphological model and δ t is the time step for the hydrodynamic model the decoupling factor df 1 0 refers to a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphological models the decoupling factor for the scour around monopile simulations is d f 6 6 as in ahmad et al 2018b the partial decoupling approach is implemented as the simulated flow is coupled with the bed load and suspended load which is linked to the exner s equation at each hydrodynamic time step the bed evolution is calculated using the morphological time step t s and represented with the level set function ϕ x t the level set function changes the signed distance property with the bed evolution hence the function is reinitialised at each hydrodynamic time step the process is repeated with the change in hydrodynamics until an equilibrium scour state is maintained this approach helps in reducing the computational cost significantly fig 4 a shows the free surface velocity of the incoming wave the maximum wave orbital velocity is u m 0 53 m s the incident wave height is h 0 21 m the wave period is t 4 5 s and the keulegan carpenter number is calculated to be kc u m t d 12 the flow around the pile depicts a stage where the pile is exposed to the wave crest action fig 4 b shows a zoomed in view of the near bed velocity contour in the vicinity of the pile the plane is located at z d 1 0 above the bed fig 4 c h are the sequence of the wave incident on the pile the maximum velocities beside the pile are seen to be u 0 90 m s however the downstream side of the pile shows relatively lower velocities u 0 20 m s thus an increase in the velocities at the sides of the pile compared to the maximum incident velocities contributes to a higher bed shear stress around the pile and results in higher sediment transport from this region the lower velocities at the downstream side develop a relatively lower bed shear stress and consequently lower sediment transport fig 5 a d show the sequence of the scour development around the pile the maximum scour around the pile is found to be s d 0 14 and the deposition at the downstream side are s d 0 12 the magnitude of the deposition is comparable to the scour depth this is attributed to the wave induced local scour where sediments are not transported away from the region as in the case of a steady current fig 5 e shows the temporal variation of the local scouring process it is seen that the major part of the maximum scour takes place within the first 20 min the fluctuations in the scour depth pattern represent the scouring and refilling with the wave crests and troughs fig 5 f shows the change in maximum scour depth s d around the pile depending on the kc number it is found that s d increases with the kc number the scour depth is found to be four times higher at kc 12 compared to kc 6 81 due to the higher wave activity around the pile the results show a good agreement with the experimental observations sumer et al 1992 which confirms the accuracy of the model regarding the simulation of scour around a vertical pile exposed to wave action 4 3 scour around the pile exposed to a steady current fig 6 a b present the scour around the pile under a steady current in this case the incident flow velocity is u 0 30 m s the velocity on either side of the pile is seen to be u 0 35 m s due to the flow contraction however the velocity in the shadow region is seen to be lower with the velocity u 0 10 m s the converging streamlines in the shadow region indicate the presence of the wake vortices which is considered to be the main cause of scour at the downstream side of the pile sumer and fredsøe 1990 fig 6 c f depict the development of the scour depth at different time intervals it is found that the scouring process is initiated from the sides of the pile and propagates around the pile with time the scour at the sides and front of the pile is seen higher compared to the scour at the downstream side this indicates that a high flow activity on the upstream side of the pile and the higher velocity beside the pile leads to the formation of horseshoe vortices at the upstream side which govern the maximum scour chiew and melville 1987 sumer et al 2002b baykal et al 2015 fig 6 g shows the final stage of the scour around the pile after 20 h the scour depth and extent is presented in top view the maximum scour depth around the pile is seen to be s d 0 70 the scour around the pile depicts almost a circular profile with scour extents x d y d range 1 8 to 1 8 the scour profile shows a satisfactory match with the experiment link 2006 as shown with the black dots the scour at the upstream side of the pile is in good agreement with the experiment however the scour depth at the downstream side of the pile is slightly underpredicted and is followed by the deposition fig 6 h shows the temporal variation of the process for simulation it is seen that almost half of the maximum scour i e s d 0 35 is achieved within a few minutes once the scour hole is formed the maximum scour depth stagnates as the sediment slides into the scour hole from the outer regions this results in an increase of the scour hole width when the scour hole becomes wide enough there is a decrease in the flow velocities and bed shear stress in the scour hole consequently the scour depth rate decreases with the scour hole development it is found that scour depth during the initial and final stage of the scouring process shows a good match the intermediate scour depth is relatively lower compared to the experiment this is more likely due to the mesh resolution around the pile in addition the boundary layer and the individual vortex shedding mechanism is not resolved with this approach these processes represent important flow features close to the solid boundary and consequently the local scour the restriction on the complete representation of these processes can contribute to the differences seen between the numerical results and the measurements eventually the simulated scour topography the maximum scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process depict an adequate agreement with the experiment link 2006 the numerical results demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the local scour around a pile under waves and a steady current conditions 5 scour around a jacket structure the validated numerical model for the scour around a monopile under waves and current is used to simulate the scour around a jacket structure the wave conditions and sediment properties are taken from the c power wind farm thornton bank which is located 30 km from the belgian coast bolle et al 2012 the jacket is comprised of four vertical piles connected with the diagonal bracings the diameter of the vertical piles is d 2 0 m and the gap between the individual foundations is g d 10 the still water depth on the site ranges between 12 m to 30 m in the present study the highest still water depth of h 30 0 m is considered the bed material is sand of the median grain size d 50 0 30 mm and the density of the sediment is ρ s 2700 kg m 3 the angle of repose for the downhill slope is φ 45 and for the uphill bed slope φ 35 following lysne 1969 and bihs and olsen 2011 where the direction of flow results in different angles of repose the critical shields parameter for the bed material is θ c 0 05 bolle et al 2010 according to the hydrodynamic measurements from the site the waves of wave height range 3 5 4 5 m were observed under storm conditions in january 2012 and the average scour depth is seen to be s d 0 85 to 1 35 which is considered to be a developed scour depth as per dnv gl guidelines dnv 2014 this case is simulated by considering a typical condition of a storm of wave height h 4 5 m still water depth h 30 wave period t 23 0 s and kc 2 π a d 7 0 the morphological calculation of 60 min is obtained with df 6 8 the simulation is run until the morphological calculations of 60 min is achieved for kc the jacket platform is exposed to a steady current flow velocity with u 0 60 m s the details of the prototype are listed in table 1 5 1 scour around a jacket structure exposed to waves in this section results of the scour around the jacket exposed to waves are discussed the simulation is run for t 60 min the results describe the flow velocities at the free surface changes in the velocities close to the bed and the resulting local scour the diameter of an individual pile of the jacket structure is d 2 0 m and the gap between the piles is g 10 d it requires a minimum l x 22 d g 32 d 64 0 m long l y 10 d g 20 d 40 0 m wide and l z h minimum cover above the still water depth 30 m 10 m 40 m high nwt for the wave generations and propagation as shown in fig 7 a b the size of the nwt is based on truncated length of the nwt tank required for wave propagation in the nwt ahmad et al 2018b the width is assumed to be sufficiently wide to maintain an undisturbed flow around the jacket platform breuer et al 2000 the numerical modelling of such large numerical nwt needs large computational resources therefore a coarse grid size of d x 0 20 is used to run the simulations for scour around the jacket platform the selection of the grid size d x is based on the number grid cells around the pile i e d d x 10 this criterion has already been tested for scour around the piles in a side by side arrangement by ahmad et al 2018b to ensure the quality of the wave propagation the wave is generated and propagated in the nwt without a jacket platform fig 8 shows the computed free surface elevations it can be seen that the simulated wave elevations show a good match with the wave theory this confirms the accuracy of the wave generation and the propagation in the large nwt with d x 0 20 m hence the model is implemented to simulate the local scour by introducing a jacket platform in the nwt in the following simulations the focus is on the change in wave hydrodynamics and the resulting scour around a jacket platform exposed to wave and steady current fig 9 a shows the free surface when the wave crest is incident on the jacket the velocities around the vertical piles vary between u 4 0 to 5 0 m s the velocities in the shadow region of the vertical piles and outside the jacket are seen to range from u 0 to 2 0 m s fig 9 b shows the free surface velocity under wave trough the free surface elevation is lowered to 27 5 m and velocities around the jacket vary between 1 6 and 1 0 m s fig 9 c shows the velocity contour on a plane 0 10 m above the bed when the wave crest is incident on the jacket the velocities outside the jacket range between 1 0 and 1 5 m s however the velocities around the vertical piles and under the lateral bracings of the jacket seem to vary between 1 5 to 3 5 m s which are almost two times higher compared to the velocities in the outside region of the jacket the increase in the velocities around the jacket is due to the flow contraction around the vertical piles and the formation of a flow jet between the lateral bracing and the bed the velocities inside the jacket seem almost similar to the velocities seen outside the jacket fig 9 d shows the velocities during wave trough it is seen that the flow hydrodynamics are similar to the ones seen during wave crest action but in the opposite direction the velocities around the vertical piles and below the bracings range from 1 0 to 1 5 m s the velocities at on the downstream side of piles are higher compared to the upstream side of the jacket fig 9 e shows the scour when the waves are incident on the jacket it is seen that the higher velocities around the vertical piles and the bracing leads to a higher scour depth around the jacket however the inside region of the jacket structure is subjected to relatively lower velocities consequently the eroded sediment from the front piles are deposited inside the jacket fig 9 f shows scour around the jacket structure during the wave trough a large scour at the rear side of the jacket is evident this is due to the high velocities seen around the vertical piles and below the bracings during the wave trough it can be seen that deposition inside the jacket is further increased overall the higher velocities around the vertical piles and under the lateral bracings indicate flow contractions and formations of jet flow this change in flow hydrodynamics leads to the local scour around at the vertical piles and lateral bracings and the deposition inside the jacket fig 10 a d demonstrate the scour evolution at t s 15 30 45 and 60 min it is seen that the scour is initiated at the vertical cylinders of the jacket and is increasing over time the magnitude of maximum scour depth is s d 0 80 and the deposition is s d 0 50 the scour depth at the front piles of the jacket is lower compared to the rear piles this is due to the continuous process of intensive scouring at the front piles during wave crest and re filling of deposited sediment during the wave trough however at the rear piles of the jacket the sediments removed during the wave crest are transported away in the direction of the wave propagation therefore there is almost no re filling occurs during the wave trough consequently a high scour depth can be observed at the rear piles of the jacket the simulated scour pattern around the jacket is well supported by the experiments conducted for scour around a tripod structure by stahlmann 2013 where a higher scour at the rear side of the tripod is measured fig 10 e shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour at the front and rear piles the spikes in the graph represent the change in the maximum scour depth with wave crests and troughs it is seen that the interaction of the wave crest with the jacket leads to a high scour depth at the front pile the scour depth during a wave peak is almost s d 0 30 however during the wave trough a significantly higher backfilling of the scour hole is evident this results in a decrease in the scour depth around the vertical piles the maximum scour depth at the front pile after 60 min is seen to be s d 0 40 at the rear pile the scour depth seems to be increasing with a faster rate and without a significant backfilling this leads to a deeper scour hole at the rear piles the maximum scour depth at the front pile after 60 min is s d 0 50 fig 10 f shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour depth around the jacket it can be seen that the maximum scour depth grows rapidly in the beginning and slows down as it approaches an equilibrium state after t s 60 min the magnitude of the maximum scour depth is s d 0 80 which is under the bracing attached with rear piles of the jacket the simulated scour depth s d agrees with field observations bolle et al 2012 of average of the maximum scour depths s d 0 85 1 35 observed after one storm 5 2 scour around a jacket structure exposed to a steady current as the scour depth increases with the kc number another simulation is run for the scour around the jacket structure exposed to a steady current which corresponds to kc the incident flow velocity is u 0 60 m s which represents a typical flow condition in the field bolle et al 2012 the simulation is run for t s 60 min the results for the scour under a steady current reveal the complex hydrodynamics the maximum scour depth and the temporal variation of the scouring process around the jacket structure fig 11 a b show the free surface flow around the jacket and velocities on a plane 0 10 m above the bed the velocities around the jacket range from 0 60 to 1 0 m s an increase in the velocities on either sides of the piles and below the lateral bracings due to flow contraction and the formation of jet flow can be noticed the region on the downstream side of the piles shows a converging flow with the velocities in the range of u 0 to 0 20 m s the results clearly show higher velocities around the vertical piles this results in higher scour around the vertical piles at the front and rear piles however no significant scour is observed below the bracings as shown in fig 11 c f the magnitude of maximum scour depth is seen to be s d 0 70 in comparison to the deposition observed in the case of the oscillatory fluid motion of the waves the eroded sediments are washed away by the steady flow and a reduced deposition is observed in the shadow region of piles at the jacket fig 12 a shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour observed at the front and rear piles as the front piles are directly exposed to the steady flow it leads to a higher scour the scour depth at the front piles is seen to be s d 0 70 the scour depth at the rear piles is seen to be s d 0 50 there is insignificant re filling of the scour hole as seen in case of waves the scour at both the front and rear piles reveal a rapid and continuous scour growth over time the maximum scour depth around the jacket is seen to be s d 0 70 which is at front piles the results demonstrate that an equilibrium scour depth is not yet achieved fig 12 b shows the variation of the maximum scour depth s d with increasing kc number the simulated scour depth for all scenarios is compared with sumer et al 1992 formula sumer et al 1992 the result shows that the scour depth calculated for a monopile shows a close match however for a jacket the maximum scour simulated around the jacket for kc 7 0 is almost 10 times higher compared to the scour depth for a monopile the observation suggests a careful consideration for the estimation of maximum scour depth around jacket structure using the empirical formulae developed for a monopile 6 conclusions in this paper numerical modelling of local scour with free surface capturing around a jacket structure is presented the open source cfd model reef3d is used to simulate the flow hydrodynamics by solving the rans equations with the k ω turbulence model the free surface is captured with the level set method the simulated flow hydrodynamics are coupled with the sediment transport algorithms to simulate the local scour the sediment transport algorithms account for the effect of the sloping bed for the calculation of the critical bed shear stress in order to obtain a more realistic prediction of the scour hole a sand slide algorithm is incorporated to correct the bed slope when it exceeds the angle of repose the changes in the bed level are based on exner s formula a series of simulations are conducted for local scour around a vertical pile exposed to waves for different kc numbers finally the validated model is used to simulate scour around the jacket structure based on the analysis of the simulated results the following conclusions can be drawn in the case of wave induced scour around a pile the scour depth is seen to be increasing four times with kc in the range 6 kc 12 an equilibrium scour depth is achieved the scour profile is seen to be asymmetric where the maximum scour is observed at the upstream side of the pile the change in the maximum scour depth with kc showed a satisfactory match with the experimental data from sumer et al 1992 in the case of scour around the pile exposed to a steady current the maximum scour depth is found to be s d 0 70 the scour topography temporal variation of the process and the maximum scour show a good match with experimental data from link 2006 the results demonstrate the accuracy of the model in simulating scour under waves and current the validated model for scour around a monopile under waves and current is applied to simulate scour around a jacket structure the changes in the velocity profile due to wave action and a steady current are discussed finally the development of the resulting scour profiles and the temporal variation of the process are presented the maximum scour depth is calculated to be s d 0 70 in the case of the jacket exposed to a steady current the maximum scour depth is found to be s d 0 80 the results support the field observation of the averaged scour depth ranges between s d 0 85 1 35 bolle et al 2010 2012 overall the simulated results demonstrate a good agreement with the experimental results for scour around the jacket structure under waves and a steady current the current study helps to better understand the hydrodynamics and the associated scour problems around the

22042,a numerical method which is based on taylor expansion boundary element method tebem and linear matching condition for perforated plate for simulating the hydrodynamic performance of perforated floating bodies is proposed the accuracy of this method is verified by experimental results to refine the simulation results the influence of inertia on the perforated structure is considered three types of perforated floating breakwaters are proposed and analyzed the hydrodynamic performances of these three perforated breakwaters are compared with that of box type floating breakwater the numerical results show that installing perforated structures at proper locations can reduce the wave force and motion response while improving the wave elimination ability of floating breakwaters keywords perforated floating breakwater potential flow theory frequency domain analysis taylor expansion boundary element method tebem mean drift force 1 introduction 1 1 perforated structures perforated structures are widely used in marine engineering examples of these structures include fish cages anti roll bulkheads and damping plates of spar platforms perforated structures are capable of significantly reducing wave loads because the eddies generated by these structures dissipate the wave energy the hydrodynamics of perforated structures has been the subject of study of many researchers chwang 1983 regarded the perforated plate as a uniform multi void medium and used darcy s law to describe the relationship between the fluid velocity and pressure loss chwang also proposed a dimensionless parameter g p referred to as the perforated parameter to express the influence of the perforated plate however darcy s law becomes invalid as reynolds number increases yu 1995 then proposed a matching condition for the perforated plate based on the navier stokes equation of multi void medium proposed by sollitt and cross 1972 yu changed the perforated parameter g p from a real number to a complex number the matching condition proposed by yu can be applied to the problem with high reynolds number liu et al 2006 on the other hand proposed that the phase difference between horizontal and vertical wave forces can significantly reduce the maximum vertical wave force of a jarlan type breakwater liu 2007 then studied the reflection coefficient of jarlan type perforated wall breakwaters meanwhile chen et al 2004 examined the interaction between wave and perforated plate via the dual boundary element method the transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and energy loss coefficient were analyzed molin 2011 proposed a quadratic matching condition for perforated plates in a quadratic matching condition the pressure loss is proportional to the square of the normal velocity thus iterative computation is required an and faltinsen 2013 analyzed the heave hydrodynamic coefficient of a perforated square plate via the matched eigenfunction expansion method the numerical results coincide well with experimental data if the damping caused by flow separation at the plate margin is considered li et al 2013 conducted forced heave experiments on perforated plates for keulegan carpenter kc numbers between 0 2 and 1 0 whereas tian et al 2017 conducted forced heave experiments on perforated plates for kc numbers between 0 15 and 3 15 molin and remy 2013 2015 on the other hand analyzed the hydrodynamics of tuned liquid dampers tld via experiments and numerical simulation the results show that when the open ratio is kept constant the influence of inertia will increase with the increase in single hole area in addition by comparing their results with experimental results obtained by faltinsen et al 2011 molin and remy proposed that the shape of the hole had little effect on the hydrodynamic performance of perforated bodies dokken et al 2017 studied the wave force of a perforated hemi sphere and compared the numerical results obtained using linear and quadratic matching conditions because linear matching conditions are employed in this study quadratic matching conditions are not reported on in this paper 1 2 perforated floating breakwaters breakwater also plays an important role in marine engineering compared with submerged breakwater floating breakwater has the advantage of lower cost lower requirements for seabed topography and less impact on the environment thus it draws the attention of many researchers drimer et al 1992 studied the hydrodynamics of a floating breakwater in two dimensions the results show that floating breakwaters have relatively good wave elimination ability in medium water depth lee and cho 2002 on the other hand analyzed the hydrodynamics of a moored floating breakwater the numerical results show that mooring tensions are significantly influenced by the mean drift force especially in the seaward side when the dimensionless wave number k 0 b 1 2 where k 0 is the incident wave number and b is the width of the breakwater floating breakwater also has many disadvantages for instance its wave elimination ability is poor especially in long waves and it is easily damaged and is thus not suitable for rough seas therefore many new structure types have been designed to improve the performance of floating breakwaters he et al 2012 used a model experiment to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of floating breakwaters with installed pneumatic chambers the results show that the pneumatic chambers can increase wave energy dissipation and reduce the wave transmission coefficient of a floating breakwater perforated floating breakwater is a new type of breakwater which has an installed perforated wave dissipating structure that takes advantage of the ability of perforated structures to increase the dissipation of wave energy zhao et al 2011a conducted hydrodynamic experiments on a perforated cylinder and proposed an empirical formula to determine the perforated parameter g p the numerical and experimental results also show that the wave exciting forces of a perforated cylinder are smaller than those of a solid cylinder zhao et al 2011b then derived the hydrodynamic expressions of perforated structures the numerical results reveal that the mean drift forces of a perforated cylinder are significantly reduced compared with those of a solid cylinder when dimensionless wave number k 0 r 0 8 where r is the radius of the cylinder when this result is combined with the conclusion proposed by lee and cho 2002 the mooring tensions of floating bodies can be reduced through the installation of perforated structures meanwhile wang and sun 2010 analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of a porous floating breakwater via model experiments the results reveal that porous breakwater has a lower mooring force compared with that of solid breakwater cho 2016 used the matched eigenfunction expansion method to study the hydrodynamic performance of a floating rectangular breakwater with a perforated side plate the numerical results reveal that installing properly perforated plates can be effective for improving the performance of floating breakwater ji et al 2018a and ji et al 2018b conducted hydrodynamic experiments on several perforated floating breakwaters and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of perforated floating breakwaters fang et al 2018 on the other hand proposed a four layer submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater and analyzed its hydrodynamic performance via model experiments the results show that the four layer breakwater performs well in a wide range of wavelengths meanwhile ji et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater the experimental results reveal that the suspension of nets underneath the breakwater can improve wave elimination ability and reduce motion response nets can be seen as a flexible perforated structure with a large open ratio 1 3 objectives and outline of this paper the main purpose of this paper is to propose a new numerical method for analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of perforated floating breakwaters compared with box type floating breakwaters perforated floating breakwaters usually have more complex structures thus it is difficult to calculate the wave force especially the mean drift force of a perforated floating breakwater in this paper the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is introduced to improve the accuracy of the numerical results for perforated floating breakwaters with sharp corners once the numerical model is established the proper structure of a floating perforated breakwater can be obtained via numerical results the main content of this paper is as follows in section 2 the numerical model of the interaction between waves and perforated bodies is introduced in section 3 a numerical method based on the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem for simulating the hydrodynamics of perforated floating bodies is proposed in section 4 the numerical method is applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of a perforated cylinder and the numerical results are compared with experimental results three types of perforated floating breakwaters are then proposed and analyzed the wave elimination abilities of these three perforated breakwaters are compared with that of a box type floating breakwater the numerical results will demonstrate the superiority of floating perforated breakwaters 2 numerical model of perforated bodies the hydrodynamic model of a perforated structure is examined in this section the structure consists of a floating body and perforated plates as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system is used to describe this problem the o xy plane is placed on the undisturbed free surface the z axis goes through the center of gravity with the positive z axis pointing upwards as shown in fig 1 the fluid domain is divided into two regions i e the external domain e and internal domain i the quantities of these two domains are distinguished by the superscripts e and i respectively when the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational the motion of the fluid in these two domains can be described by the velocity potential in frequency domain as follows 1 φ e i x y z t re φ e i x y z e i ω t where φ e i φ 0 φ p e i φ e i is the spatial velocity potential φ 0 is the spatial incident potential and φ p e i is the spatial disturbed potential ω is the wave frequency re refers to the real component of the complex variable the incident wave is assumed to be a regular wave and the amplitude of incident wave and motion of float is denoted by ο ε where ε is the wave steepness by the superposition principle the disturbed potential is the summation of radiation potentials φ j e i j 1 6 and diffraction potential φ 7 e i 2 φ p e i j 1 6 v j φ j e i φ 7 e i where v j refers to the 6 dof motion velocity of perforated structures in the external and internal fluid domains radiation potentials and diffraction potential φ j e i j 1 7 satisfy laplace s equation 3 2 φ j e i 0 on the free surface the linear free surface condition is satisfied 4 φ j e i z ω 2 g φ j e i 0 o n z 0 where g denotes acceleration due to gravity the water bottom condition for infinite water depth case can be written as 5 φ j e 0 w h e n z the far field radiation conditions for φ j e j 1 7 are 6 lim ρ ρ φ j e ρ i k 0 φ j e 0 where k 0 is the wave number of the incident wave and k 0 ω 2 g in infinite water depth condition the body boundary condition which is based on the linear matching condition of perforated plates can be written as 7 φ j e n φ j i n n j i g p k 0 φ j e φ j i where g p is the dimensionless perforated parameter which is always determined via empirical formula for a solid boundary g p 0 n denotes a unit normal vector which points outside the domain for the external domain e and points inside the domain for the internal domain i the components of the normal vector are n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r n where r refers to the position vector starting from the rotation center n 7 φ 0 n g p is calculated using the formula proposed by yu 1995 8 g p τ k 0 f i s δ where τ is the open ratio which equals the ratio of the perforated area to the total area of the perforated plate f is the equivalent linearized damping coefficient s 1 1 τ c m τ is the inertia coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient of porous medium particles and δ is the thickness of the perforated plate in this study the equivalent linearized damping coefficient f is determined using the empirical formula proposed by zhao et al 2011a 9 f λ d f δ 1 1 06 τ 17 80 ε 143 2 τ λ δ where λ is the wave length ε k 0 a is the wave steepness and d f 17 80 ε 143 2 τ 1 1 06 τ is the influence parameter of the equivalent linearized damping coefficient according to zhao et al 2011a the formula is valid under the conditions 0 τ 0 6 and 0 ε 0 09 eqs 3 7 form the boundary value problem of perforated floating bodies once the disturbed potentials and 6 dof motion displacement have been solved the added mass and wave damping of the perforated floating body can be obtained via the following equations 10 μ j j ρ s h e re φ j e n j d s q ρ s h i re φ j i n j d s q λ j j ρ ω s h e im φ j e n j d s q ρ ω s h i im φ j i n j d s q where μ j j and λ j j denote the added mass and wave damping in the j th direction respectively caused by j th direction motion of floating body s h e represents the mean wetted surface of the external boundary which consists of s p e r f o r a t e d and s s o l i d e s h i refers to the mean wetted surface of the internal boundary which consists of s p e r f o r a t e d and s s o l i d i shown in fig 1 furthermore the first order force and mean drift force acting on the floating body can be obtained using the pressure integral on the wetted surface which can be expressed as follows 11 f 1 i ω ρ s h e φ e n d s i ω ρ s h i φ i n d s 12 f 2 f e 2 f i 2 1 2 η r f 1 ρ g a w p η 3 η 5 x f k 13 f c 2 ρ g 4 w l c ζ 3 χ 3 ζ 3 χ 3 n d l 1 n 3 2 ρ 4 s h c φ φ n d s i ω ρ 2 s h

wave elevation a wp x f r and wl represent the waterplane area horizontal coordinate of the waterplane centroid position vector of the fluid particle and waterline respectively t re η t e i ω t where η t η 1 η 2 η 3 is the translational displacement ω re η r e i ω t where η r η 4 η 5 η 6 is the rotational displacement x re χ e i ω t where χ χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 η t η r r is the total displacement c e i represent the values of external domain e and internal domain i respectively according to the momentum conservation theorem the mean drift force can be obtained using the following equation 14 f x 2 ρ g 1 2 π k 0 0 2 π k θ k θ cos β cos θ ρ k 0 2 im s p φ e φ i φ n d s cos β ρ 1 2 k 0 i m s p g p φ e φ i φ e x φ i x d s where s p represents the mean wetted surface of the perforated boundary s p e r f o r a t e d whereas k θ denotes the kochin function 15 k θ ω υ 2 g s h e φ p e n φ p e n exp k 0 z i k 0 x cos θ i k 0 y sin θ d s furthermore the potential in the far field can be obtained using 16 φ p e g k θ i ω 2 π υ r exp i k 0 r π 4 k 0 z where υ ω 2 g and thus the expression of k 0 is same with that of υ under infinite water depth condition 3 taylor expansion boundary element method the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is used to solve the boundary value problem in this study tebem was proposed by duan 2012 to deal with the singularity of the tangential induced velocity on a non smooth boundary xu 2009 the main principle of tebem is illustrated in this section tebem is based on the framework of the source and dipole mixed distribution method hence the boundary integral equation based on the green third formula can be written as 17 κ 2 π φ e i p s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 where κ 1 in the external domain i e the terms with superscript e whereas κ 1 in the internal domain i e the terms with superscripts i n q indicates taking the derivative with respect to n q the green function g is as follows 18 g p q 1 r 1 r 2 υ 0 e k 0 z ζ k 0 υ j 0 k 0 r d k 0 i 2 π υ e υ z ζ j 0 υ r where q ξ η ζ and p x y z are the source point and field point respectively r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 represents the distance between source point and field point r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 represents the distance between field point and image point where q ξ η ζ is about the free surface of the source point meanwhile r x ξ 2 y η 2 represents the horizontal distance between field point and source point and j 0 is a bessel function of the first kind for three dimensional hydrodynamic problems the boundary surface is dispersed into small quadrilateral or triangular elements and in each panel the average values of the nodes are taken as the center hence the discrete form of boundary integral eq 17 can be written as 19 κ 2 π φ e i p j 1 n e i δ s φ e i g n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g d s q 0 where n e n i refer to the total element numbers on the external and internal domain boundaries respectively the corresponding dipole strength at the centroid of each element is expressed as φ q 0 it is apparently different for the constant panel method where the dipole strength on each panel in tebem is expressed through the taylor expansion and reserves the first order derivatives which are presented as eq 20 ξ and η are the local coordinates of the source point in an element q as shown in fig 2 20 φ q φ q 0 ξ φ ξ q 0 η φ η q 0 when eq 20 is substituted into the discretization boundary integral eq 19 the new boundary integral equation for tebem can be obtained 21 κ 2 π φ e i p j 1 n e i φ e i δ s g n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i ξ δ s ξ g n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i η δ s η g n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g d s q 0 to supply the integral equations for tebem the first order derivatives of potential at the field point of eq 19 are determined along two mutually orthogonal tangential directions denoted as x and y respectively as shown in fig 2 22 κ 2 π φ x e i p x s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q x s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 23 κ 2 π φ y e i p y s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q y s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 the same discretization method is applied on the boundary surface the taylor expansion eq 20 is also used for eqs 22 and 23 resulting in the following equations 24 κ 2 π φ x e i p j 1 n e i φ e i δ s g x n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i ξ δ s ξ g x n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i η δ s η g x n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g x d s

equations are constructed through eqs 21 24 and 25 where the dipole strength and its first order derivatives are the unknowns and the source strength is the known for a given element i the boundary integral equation can be written as 26 m 1 3 j 1 n e i a m i j k u m e i j j 1 n e i b k i j φ n e i j 0 where k 1 2 3 and m 1 2 3 n e and n i are the element numbers of external domain s h e and internal domain s h i respectively information on all the influence coefficients involved in tebem can be found in duan et al 2015a and duan et al 2015b a m i j d i j d 1 i j d 2 i j a m i j k a m i j

analysis of inertial influence with a cylinder with open ratio τ 0 14 taken as an example the influence of inertia coefficient on the calculation results is studied three values of s are used to obtain the numerical results 1 s 3 089 at c m 0 34 and τ 0 14 2 s 1 which indicates ignoring the influence of the added mass of porous medium particles and 3 s 0 which indicates ignoring the influence of inertia zhao et al 2011a conducted a hydrodynamic experimental research on a partly perforated cylinder as shown in fig 3 the model cylinder has a radius of 0 15 m and a draft of 0 30 m the cylinder is evenly perforated at the sidewall and its bottom surfaces are solid fig 4 illustrates the heave exciting force whereas figs 5 and 6 visualize that heave added mass and damping coefficient respectively under different inertia coefficients s according to the numerical results involving the influence of inertia coefficient s can improve the accuracy of the numerical results consequently unless when specified otherwise c m is set as 0 34 in subsequent calculations in this section 4 1 2 wave exciting force for perforated cylinder the experimental and numerical results for surge exciting force heave exciting force and pitch exciting moment are shown in figs 7 9 respectively good agreement can be obtained between experimental and numerical results for wave exciting forces the wave exciting forces are also observed to decrease with the increase in open ratio τ for the heave exciting force numerical results for solid and perforated cylinders exhibit large differences at the low frequency domain because the pressure difference between the two sides of the bottom plate of the perforated cylinder is relatively small when the frequency is low 4 1 3 hydrodynamic coefficients for perforated cylinder the experimental and numerical results for added mass and damping coefficient in heave are shown in fig 10 the tebem method can be observed to predict the hydrodynamic coefficient with sufficient accuracy from a practical perspective the numerical results are relatively smaller than the experimental values the reason may be the flow separation at the cylinder bottom or an error in the value of g p furthermore the hydrodynamic coefficient of the perforated cylinder is larger than that of solid cylinder especially for the damping coefficient which is helpful for restraining the motion of a floating body 4 2 perforated floating breakwater 4 2 1 computational models and grids the hydrodynamic performances of three perforated floating breakwaters are calculated in this section for the sake of comparison the performance of a box type floating breakwater is also calculated the cross sections of the box type floating breakwater and three perforated floating breakwaters are shown in fig 11 dotted lines denote the cross sections of the perforated structures the box type floating breakwater is a cuboid with a length of 80 m width of 20 m and draft of 10 m the other new type breakwaters have the same displacement of box type breakwater in the first new type breakwater which is referred to as type a the perforated wave dissipating structure is installed on the wave ward side type a is similar to a jarlan type breakwater which can significantly reduce the amplitude of reflection wave and has been widely used in port engineering liu 2007 in the second new type breakwater the perforated wave dissipating structure is installed on the bottom of the floating body to increase the wave resistant area which can improve the wave elimination ability of the breakwater sheng and sun 2001 this new type is referred to as type b type c is similar to type b except the perforated wave dissipating structure is moved closer to the water surface where the fluid particles have a higher velocity the distance between free surface and the top side of the perforated structure is δd 2 m the principal dimensions of these three breakwaters are outlined in the table 1 before the calculation is started the convergence of all grids should be checked the mean drift force of type c calculated using different grids is shown in fig 12 grid 1 divides the submerged body of type c into 2 200 elements whereas grid 2 and grid 3 divide the body into 3 200 and 8 800 elements respectively as shown in fig 12 the difference between the numerical results obtained using grid 2 and grid 3 is small indicating that grid 2 is good enough grid 2 for type c is shown in fig 13 the submerged solid bodies and perforated plates are represented by green elements and purple elements respectively the element size is 2 m in the horizontal direction and 1 m in the vertical direction the grids of other breakwaters have also been checked the numerical convergence test processes for those other breakwaters will not be presented here 4 2 2 hydrodynamic coefficients for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway heave and roll hydrodynamic coefficients are shown in figs 14 16 in general the added masses and damping coefficients of these three breakwaters are larger than those of the box type however the heave damping coefficient of type c is smaller than that of the box type when k 0 b 2 2 fig 15 furthermore the roll added mass of type a become negative when k 0 b 0 3 apparently the roll radiation moment promotes the rolling motion of type a when k 0 b 0 3 which is unusual zhao et al 2017 also obtained a negative added mass when they analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of a horizontally submerged porous plate the reason for this abnormal phenomenon may be the improper value of the dimensionless perforated parameter g p further study is therefore required 4 2 3 wave exciting force for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway exciting force heave exciting force and roll exciting moment are shown in figs 17 19 it can be seen in fig 17 a that the sway exciting force and roll exciting moment of type a significantly increase in the high frequency phase the numerical results for type a in the higher frequency phase are shown in fig 17 b which reveals that the sway exciting force and roll exciting moment of type a have more than one peak value this may be caused by the resonance of waves in the internal free surface because the internal free surface of type a resembles a moon pool which is relatively closed the wave contours of the internal free surface of type a which are presented in fig 27 prove the conjecture see section 4 2 6 of this paper for more details fig 17 a shows that the sway exciting force of type b is larger than that of a box type this can be attributed to the larger wave resistant area of type b for the same reason the sway exciting force of type c is larger than that of the box type when k 0 b 1 the sway exciting forces of type a and type c are smaller than that of the box type in a wide frequency range indicating that these two types of breakwaters can significantly reduce the sway exciting force with property dimensions on the other hand the perforated structures apparently can hardly reduce the wave force in long waves fig 18 shows that in general the heave exciting forces of these three types breakwaters are smaller than that of box type however the heave exciting force of type c is larger than that of box type when k 0 b 4 5 because type c has a horizontal structure near the free surface fig 19 shows that the roll exciting moments of these three types breakwaters are generally larger than that of box type because the installation of perforated structures increases the arm of force 4 2 4 motion response for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway heave and roll motion are shown in figs 20 22 it should be noted that added viscous damping which equals 8 of the critical damping is considered in the heave and roll motion calculations the numerical results which are presented in figs 20 22 demonstrate that the motion responses of type b and type c are smaller than that of box type in the large frequency range the common range is 1 k 0 b 4 indicating that these two breakwaters can significantly reduce the motion response the heave and roll response amplitude operators rao of type a are not discussed here because of the error for roll added mass on the other hand the sway rao result is not influenced by the roll added mass because of the symmetry of type a according to fig 20 the sway rao of type a is smaller than that of box type when k 0 b 0 5 4 2 5 mean drift force for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway mean drift force in fixed condition and free floating condition are shown in fig 23 fig 23 a reveals that the mean drift forces of type a and type c in fixed condition are smaller than that of box type in the large frequency range k 0 b 1 2 for type a and k 0 b 1 for type c the mean drift force of type b is also larger than that of box type because while the installation of a bottom perforated structure increases the force bearing area it has little effect on wave energy dissipation the perforated structure of type c on the other hand is installed near the free surface thus it can dissipate wave energy significantly fig 23 b visualizes the mean drift forces in free floating condition the conclusion is similar to that for the fixed condition type a is not discussed here 4 2 6 wave amplitude for different breakwaters the wave amplitudes in fixed condition and free floating condition are determined in this section fig 24 illustrates the wave amplitude near breakwaters in fixed condition when ω 0 9 rad s in the calculated domain 600 m long and 200 m wide the maximum dimensionless wave amplitudes for box type type a type b and type c are 2 42 1 33 2 31 and 1 97 respectively the wave contour is simulated by 4 961 points the interval between these points is 5 m and thus the actual maximum dimensionless wave amplitudes of these breakwaters are likely to be larger type a is observed to have a remarkable effect in eliminating reflection waves whereas type c can reduce both reflection and transmission wave amplitudes the numerical results for wave amplitude from positions 3 to 10 have similar tendencies take position 3 for example fig 26 shows the results for the wave amplitude at position 3 the location of 3 is shown in fig 25 fig 24 shows that type a can significantly reduce the amplitude of reflection wave which is similar to the ability of the jarlan type breakwater liu 2007 the wave elimination ability of type b is similar to that of the box type whereas the wave elimination ability of type c is better than that of the box type fig 26 a shows that the wave amplitudes for type a and b in fixed condition at position 3 are slightly smaller than that of box type the wave amplitude for type c is also smaller than that of box type especially when 1 k 0 b 3 5 fig 26 b illustrates the wave amplitude in free floating condition at position 3 the wave amplitudes for type b and type c are close to that of box type however when 1 2 k 0 b 2 2 the wave amplitude of box type is smaller type a is not discussed here because the installation of perforated structure increases the roll response which will increase the wave amplitude induced by the motion breakwater the roll response can be reduced through the installation of damping plates to verify the conjecture proposed in section 4 2 2 the wave contours for the internal free surface of type a are calculated the numerical results are presented in fig 27 as shown in fig 27 when ω 1 85 rad s i e dimensionless wave number k 0 b 6 98 where the second peak occurred the maximum dimensionless wave amplitude is significantly larger than that for the other cases the numerical results demonstrate that wave resonance causes the second peak of the wave exciting force of type a 5 conclusion a numerical method based on tebem for perforated floating bodies is proposed in this paper the perforated cylinder experiment conducted by zhao is simulated and the numerical results are compared with experimental results good agreement between the two sets of results is achieved after being verified the numerical method is applied to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of perforated floating breakwaters these conclusions can be obtained 1 the accuracy of the numerical method based on first order tebem is verified based on the findings of previous studies duan 2012 duan et al 2015a 2015b the accuracy of mean drift force obtained via the new method can be trusted although there is no direct evidence supporting this conclusion 2 the results demonstrate that the inertia coefficient of a perforated structure has an effect on the numerical results for added mass meanwhile it has little effect on the wave exciting force and damping coefficient in the case of the calculations for the perforated cylinder experiment done for this paper properly increasing the value of inertia coefficient can refine the simulation results for added mass 3 among the three types of perforated floating breakwaters examined in this study type c behaves the best in type c a perforated wave elimination chamber is installed in the vertical direction near the free surface which can significantly improve the performance of the floating breakwater compared with a box type breakwater type c can reduce wave force including mean drift force and motion response while improving wave elimination ability in the range of 1 k 0 b 3 5 the range may vary with the relative height and installed position of the perforated chamber on the other hand type a can reduce wave force except mean drift force and eliminate reflection waves significantly however the numerical result for its roll added mass has a negative value the reason for this abnormal phenomenon or error may be the improper value of the dimensionless perforated parameter g p further study is therefore required credit authorship contribution statement w

keywords perforated floating breakwater potential flow theory frequency domain analysis taylor expansion boundary element method tebem mean drift force 1 introduction 1 1 perforated structures perforated structures are widely used in marine engineering examples of these structures include fish cages anti roll bulkheads and damping plates of spar platforms perforated structures are capable of significantly reducing wave loads because the eddies generated by these structures dissipate the wave energy the hydrodynamics of perforated structures has been the subject of study of many researchers chwang 1983 regarded the perforated plate as a uniform multi void medium and used darcy s law to describe the relationship between the fluid velocity and pressure loss chwang also proposed a dimensionless parameter g p referred to as the perforated parameter to express the influence of the perforated plate however darcy s law becomes invalid as reynolds number increases yu 1995 then proposed a matching condition for the perforated plate based on the navier stokes equation of multi void medium proposed by sollitt and cross 1972 yu changed the perforated parameter g p from a real number to a complex number the matching condition proposed by yu can be applied to the problem with high reynolds number liu et al 2006 on the other hand proposed that the phase difference between horizontal and vertical wave forces can significantly reduce the maximum vertical wave force of a jarlan type breakwater liu 2007 then studied the reflection coefficient of jarlan type perforated wall breakwaters meanwhile chen et al 2004 examined the interaction between wave and perforated plate via the dual boundary element method the transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and energy loss coefficient were analyzed molin 2011 proposed a quadratic matching condition for perforated plates in a quadratic matching condition the pressure loss is proportional to the square of the normal velocity thus iterative computation is required an and faltinsen 2013 analyzed the heave hydrodynamic coefficient of a perforated square plate via the matched eigenfunction expansion method the numerical results coincide well with experimental data if the damping caused by flow separation at the plate margin is considered li et al 2013 conducted forced heave experiments on perforated plates for keulegan carpenter kc numbers between 0 2 and 1 0 whereas tian et al 2017 conducted forced heave experiments on perforated plates for kc numbers between 0 15 and 3 15 molin and remy 2013 2015 on the other hand analyzed the hydrodynamics of tuned liquid dampers tld via experiments and numerical simulation the results show that when the open ratio is kept constant the influence of inertia will increase with the increase in single hole area in addition by comparing their results with experimental results obtained by faltinsen et al 2011 molin and remy proposed that the shape of the hole had little effect on the hydrodynamic performance of perforated bodies dokken et al 2017 studied the wave force of a perforated hemi sphere and compared the numerical results obtained using linear and quadratic matching conditions because linear matching conditions are employed in this study quadratic matching conditions are not reported on in this paper 1 2 perforated floating breakwaters breakwater also plays an important role in marine engineering compared with submerged breakwater floating breakwater has the advantage of lower cost lower requirements for seabed topography and less impact on the environment thus it draws the attention of many researchers drimer et al 1992 studied the hydrodynamics of a floating breakwater in two dimensions the results show that floating breakwaters have relatively good wave elimination ability in medium water depth lee and cho 2002 on the other hand analyzed the hydrodynamics of a moored floating breakwater the numerical results show that mooring tensions are significantly influenced by the mean drift force especially in the seaward side when the dimensionless wave number k 0 b 1 2 where k 0 is the incident wave number and b is the width of the breakwater floating breakwater also has many disadvantages for instance its wave elimination ability is poor especially in long waves and it is easily damaged and is thus not suitable for rough seas therefore many new structure types have been designed to improve the performance of floating breakwaters he et al 2012 used a model experiment to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of floating breakwaters with installed pneumatic chambers the results show that the pneumatic chambers can increase wave energy dissipation and reduce the wave transmission coefficient of a floating breakwater perforated floating breakwater is a new type of breakwater which has an installed perforated wave dissipating structure that takes advantage of the ability of perforated structures to increase the dissipation of wave energy zhao et al 2011a conducted hydrodynamic experiments on a perforated cylinder and proposed an empirical formula to determine the perforated parameter g p the numerical and experimental results also show that the wave exciting forces of a perforated cylinder are smaller than those of a solid cylinder zhao et al 2011b then derived the hydrodynamic expressions of perforated structures the numerical results reveal that the mean drift forces of a perforated cylinder are significantly reduced compared with those of a solid cylinder when dimensionless wave number k 0 r 0 8 where r is the radius of the cylinder when this result is combined with the conclusion proposed by lee and cho 2002 the mooring tensions of floating bodies can be reduced through the installation of perforated structures meanwhile wang and sun 2010 analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of a porous floating breakwater via model experiments the results reveal that porous breakwater has a lower mooring force compared with that of solid breakwater cho 2016 used the matched eigenfunction expansion method to study the hydrodynamic performance of a floating rectangular breakwater with a perforated side plate the numerical results reveal that installing properly perforated plates can be effective for improving the performance of floating breakwater ji et al 2018a and ji et al 2018b conducted hydrodynamic experiments on several perforated floating breakwaters and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of perforated floating breakwaters fang et al 2018 on the other hand proposed a four layer submerged horizontal perforated plate breakwater and analyzed its hydrodynamic performance via model experiments the results show that the four layer breakwater performs well in a wide range of wavelengths meanwhile ji et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater the experimental results reveal that the suspension of nets underneath the breakwater can improve wave elimination ability and reduce motion response nets can be seen as a flexible perforated structure with a large open ratio 1 3 objectives and outline of this paper the main purpose of this paper is to propose a new numerical method for analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of perforated floating breakwaters compared with box type floating breakwaters perforated floating breakwaters usually have more complex structures thus it is difficult to calculate the wave force especially the mean drift force of a perforated floating breakwater in this paper the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is introduced to improve the accuracy of the numerical results for perforated floating breakwaters with sharp corners once the numerical model is established the proper structure of a floating perforated breakwater can be obtained via numerical results the main content of this paper is as follows in section 2 the numerical model of the interaction between waves and perforated bodies is introduced in section 3 a numerical method based on the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem for simulating the hydrodynamics of perforated floating bodies is proposed in section 4 the numerical method is applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of a perforated cylinder and the numerical results are compared with experimental results three types of perforated floating breakwaters are then proposed and analyzed the wave elimination abilities of these three perforated breakwaters are compared with that of a box type floating breakwater the numerical results will demonstrate the superiority of floating perforated breakwaters 2 numerical model of perforated bodies the hydrodynamic model of a perforated structure is examined in this section the structure consists of a floating body and perforated plates as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system is used to describe this problem the o xy plane is placed on the undisturbed free surface the z axis goes through the center of gravity with the positive z axis pointing upwards as shown in fig 1 the fluid domain is divided into two regions i e the external domain e and internal domain i the quantities of these two domains are distinguished by the superscripts e and i respectively when the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational the motion of the fluid in these two domains can be described by the velocity potential in frequency domain as follows 1 φ e i x y z t re φ e i x y z e i ω t where φ e i φ 0 φ p e i φ e i is the spatial velocity potential φ 0 is the spatial incident potential and φ p e i is the spatial disturbed potential ω is the wave frequency re refers to the real component of the complex variable the incident wave is assumed to be a regular wave and the amplitude of incident wave and motion of float is denoted by ο ε where ε is the wave steepness by the superposition principle the disturbed potential is the summation of radiation potentials φ j e i j 1 6 and diffraction potential φ 7 e i 2 φ p e i j 1 6 v j φ j e i φ 7 e i where v j refers to the 6 dof motion velocity of perforated structures in the external and internal fluid domains radiation potentials and diffraction potential φ j e i j 1 7 satisfy laplace s equation 3 2 φ j e i 0 on the free surface the linear free surface condition is satisfied 4 φ j e i z ω 2 g φ j e i 0 o n z 0 where g denotes acceleration due to gravity the water bottom condition for infinite water depth case can be written as 5 φ j e 0 w h e n z the far field radiation conditions for φ j e j 1 7 are 6 lim ρ ρ φ j e ρ i k 0 φ j e 0 where k 0 is the wave number of the incident wave and k 0 ω 2 g in infinite water depth condition the body boundary condition which is based on the linear matching condition of perforated plates can be written as 7 φ j e n φ j i n n j i g p k 0 φ j e φ j i where g p is the dimensionless perforated parameter which is always determined via empirical formula for a solid boundary g p 0 n denotes a unit normal vector which points outside the domain for the external domain e and points inside the domain for the internal domain i the components of the normal vector are n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r n where r refers to the position vector starting from the rotation center n 7 φ 0 n g p is calculated using the formula proposed by yu 1995 8 g p τ k 0 f i s δ where τ is the open ratio which equals the ratio of the perforated area to the total area of the perforated plate f is the equivalent linearized damping coefficient s 1 1 τ c m τ is the inertia coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient of porous medium particles and δ is the thickness of the perforated plate in this study the equivalent linearized damping coefficient f is determined using the empirical formula proposed by zhao et al 2011a 9 f λ d f δ 1 1 06 τ 17 80 ε 143 2 τ λ δ where λ is the wave length ε k 0 a is the wave steepness and d f 17 80 ε 143 2 τ 1 1 06 τ is the influence parameter of the equivalent linearized damping coefficient according to zhao et al 2011a the formula is valid under the conditions 0 τ 0 6 and 0 ε 0 09 eqs 3 7 form the boundary value problem of perforated floating bodies once the disturbed potentials and 6 dof motion displacement have been solved the added mass and wave damping of the perforated floating body can be obtained via the following equations 10 μ j j ρ s h e re φ j e n j d s q ρ s h i re φ j i n j d s q λ j j ρ ω s h e im φ j e n j d s q ρ ω s h i im φ j i n j d s q where μ j j and λ j j denote the added mass and wave damping in the j th direction respectively caused by j th direction motion of floating body s h e represents the mean wetted surface of the external boundary which consists of s p e r f o r a t e d and s s o l i d e s h i refers to the mean wetted surface of the internal boundary which consists of s p e r f o r a t e d and s s o l i d i shown in fig 1 furthermore the first order force and mean drift force acting on the floating body can be obtained using the pressure integral on the wetted surface which can be expressed as follows 11 f 1 i ω ρ s h e φ e n d s i ω ρ s h i φ i n d s 12 f 2 f e 2 f i 2 1 2 η r f 1 ρ g a w p η 3 η 5 x f k 13 f c 2 ρ g 4 w l c ζ 3 χ 3 ζ 3 χ 3 n d l 1 n 3 2 ρ 4 s h c φ φ n d s i ω ρ 2 s h

wave elevation a wp x f r and wl represent the waterplane area horizontal coordinate of the waterplane centroid position vector of the fluid particle and waterline respectively t re η t e i ω t where η t η 1 η 2 η 3 is the translational displacement ω re η r e i ω t where η r η 4 η 5 η 6 is the rotational displacement x re χ e i ω t where χ χ 1 χ 2 χ 3 η t η r r is the total displacement c e i represent the values of external domain e and internal domain i respectively according to the momentum conservation theorem the mean drift force can be obtained using the following equation 14 f x 2 ρ g 1 2 π k 0 0 2 π k θ k θ cos β cos θ ρ k 0 2 im s p φ e φ i φ n d s cos β ρ 1 2 k 0 i m s p g p φ e φ i φ e x φ i x d s where s p represents the mean wetted surface of the perforated boundary s p e r f o r a t e d whereas k θ denotes the kochin function 15 k θ ω υ 2 g s h e φ p e n φ p e n exp k 0 z i k 0 x cos θ i k 0 y sin θ d s furthermore the potential in the far field can be obtained using 16 φ p e g k θ i ω 2 π υ r exp i k 0 r π 4 k 0 z where υ ω 2 g and thus the expression of k 0 is same with that of υ under infinite water depth condition 3 taylor expansion boundary element method the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem is used to solve the boundary value problem in this study tebem was proposed by duan 2012 to deal with the singularity of the tangential induced velocity on a non smooth boundary xu 2009 the main principle of tebem is illustrated in this section tebem is based on the framework of the source and dipole mixed distribution method hence the boundary integral equation based on the green third formula can be written as 17 κ 2 π φ e i p s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 where κ 1 in the external domain i e the terms with superscript e whereas κ 1 in the internal domain i e the terms with superscripts i n q indicates taking the derivative with respect to n q the green function g is as follows 18 g p q 1 r 1 r 2 υ 0 e k 0 z ζ k 0 υ j 0 k 0 r d k 0 i 2 π υ e υ z ζ j 0 υ r where q ξ η ζ and p x y z are the source point and field point respectively r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 represents the distance between source point and field point r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 represents the distance between field point and image point where q ξ η ζ is about the free surface of the source point meanwhile r x ξ 2 y η 2 represents the horizontal distance between field point and source point and j 0 is a bessel function of the first kind for three dimensional hydrodynamic problems the boundary surface is dispersed into small quadrilateral or triangular elements and in each panel the average values of the nodes are taken as the center hence the discrete form of boundary integral eq 17 can be written as 19 κ 2 π φ e i p j 1 n e i δ s φ e i g n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g d s q 0 where n e n i refer to the total element numbers on the external and internal domain boundaries respectively the corresponding dipole strength at the centroid of each element is expressed as φ q 0 it is apparently different for the constant panel method where the dipole strength on each panel in tebem is expressed through the taylor expansion and reserves the first order derivatives which are presented as eq 20 ξ and η are the local coordinates of the source point in an element q as shown in fig 2 20 φ q φ q 0 ξ φ ξ q 0 η φ η q 0 when eq 20 is substituted into the discretization boundary integral eq 19 the new boundary integral equation for tebem can be obtained 21 κ 2 π φ e i p j 1 n e i φ e i δ s g n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i ξ δ s ξ g n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i η δ s η g n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g d s q 0 to supply the integral equations for tebem the first order derivatives of potential at the field point of eq 19 are determined along two mutually orthogonal tangential directions denoted as x and y respectively as shown in fig 2 22 κ 2 π φ x e i p x s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q x s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 23 κ 2 π φ y e i p y s h e i ε φ e i g n q d s q y s h e i φ n q e i g d s q 0 the same discretization method is applied on the boundary surface the taylor expansion eq 20 is also used for eqs 22 and 23 resulting in the following equations 24 κ 2 π φ x e i p j 1 n e i φ e i δ s g x n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i ξ δ s ξ g x n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i η δ s η g x n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g x d s q 0 25 κ 2 π φ y e i p j 1 n e i φ e i δ s g y n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i ξ δ s ξ g y n q d s q j 1 n e i φ e i η δ s η g y n q d s q j 1 n e i δ s φ n q e i g y d s q 0 finally the linear algebraic equations are constructed through eqs 21 24 and 25 where the dipole strength and its first order derivatives are the unknowns and the source strength is the known for a given element i the boundary integral equation can be written as 26 m 1 3 j 1 n e i a m i j k u m e i j j 1 n e i b k i j φ n e i j 0 where k 1 2 3 and m 1 2 3 n e and n i are the element numbers of external domain s h e and internal domain s h i respectively information on all the influence coefficients involved in tebem can be found in duan et al 2015a and duan et al 2015b a m i j d i j d 1 i j d 2 i j a m i j k a m i j

analysis of inertial influence with a cylinder with open ratio τ 0 14 taken as an example the influence of inertia coefficient on the calculation results is studied three values of s are used to obtain the numerical results 1 s 3 089 at c m 0 34 and τ 0 14 2 s 1 which indicates ignoring the influence of the added mass of porous medium particles and 3 s 0 which indicates ignoring the influence of inertia zhao et al 2011a conducted a hydrodynamic experimental research on a partly perforated cylinder as shown in fig 3 the model cylinder has a radius of 0 15 m and a draft of 0 30 m the cylinder is evenly perforated at the sidewall and its bottom surfaces are solid fig 4 illustrates the heave exciting force whereas figs 5 and 6 visualize that heave added mass and damping coefficient respectively under different inertia coefficients s according to the numerical results involving the influence of inertia coefficient s can improve the accuracy of the numerical results consequently unless when specified otherwise c m is set as 0 34 in subsequent calculations in this section 4 1 2 wave exciting force for perforated cylinder the experimental and numerical results for surge exciting force heave exciting force and pitch exciting moment are shown in figs 7 9 respectively good agreement can be obtained between experimental and numerical results for wave exciting forces the wave exciting forces are also observed to decrease with the increase in open ratio τ for the heave exciting force numerical results for solid and perforated cylinders exhibit large differences at the low frequency domain because the pressure difference between the two sides of the bottom plate of the perforated cylinder is relatively small when the frequency is low 4 1 3 hydrodynamic coefficients for perforated cylinder the experimental and numerical results for added mass and damping coefficient in heave are shown in fig 10 the tebem method can be observed to predict the hydrodynamic coefficient with sufficient accuracy from a practical perspective the numerical results are relatively smaller than the experimental values the reason may be the flow separation at the cylinder bottom or an error in the value of g p furthermore the hydrodynamic coefficient of the perforated cylinder is larger than that of solid cylinder especially for the damping coefficient which is helpful for restraining the motion of a floating body 4 2 perforated floating breakwater 4 2 1 computational models and grids the hydrodynamic performances of three perforated floating breakwaters are calculated in this section for the sake of comparison the performance of a box type floating breakwater is also calculated the cross sections of the box type floating breakwater and three perforated floating breakwaters are shown in fig 11 dotted lines denote the cross sections of the perforated structures the box type floating breakwater is a cuboid with a length of 80 m width of 20 m and draft of 10 m the other new type breakwaters have the same displacement of box type breakwater in the first new type breakwater which is referred to as type a the perforated wave dissipating structure is installed on the wave ward side type a is similar to a jarlan type breakwater which can significantly reduce the amplitude of reflection wave and has been widely used in port engineering liu 2007 in the second new type breakwater the perforated wave dissipating structure is installed on the bottom of the floating body to increase the wave resistant area which can improve the wave elimination ability of the breakwater sheng and sun 2001 this new type is referred to as type b type c is similar to type b except the perforated wave dissipating structure is moved closer to the water surface where the fluid particles have a higher velocity the distance between free surface and the top side of the perforated structure is δd 2 m the principal dimensions of these three breakwaters are outlined in the table 1 before the calculation is started the convergence of all grids should be checked the mean drift force of type c calculated using different grids is shown in fig 12 grid 1 divides the submerged body of type c into 2 200 elements whereas grid 2 and grid 3 divide the body into 3 200 and 8 800 elements respectively as shown in fig 12 the difference between the numerical results obtained using grid 2 and grid 3 is small indicating that grid 2 is good enough grid 2 for type c is shown in fig 13 the submerged solid bodies and perforated plates are represented by green elements and purple elements respectively the element size is 2 m in the horizontal direction and 1 m in the vertical direction the grids of other breakwaters have also been checked the numerical convergence test processes for those other breakwaters will not be presented here 4 2 2 hydrodynamic coefficients for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway heave and roll hydrodynamic coefficients are shown in figs 14 16 in general the added masses and damping coefficients of these three breakwaters are larger than those of the box type however the heave damping coefficient of type c is smaller than that of the box type when k 0 b 2 2 fig 15 furthermore the roll added mass of type a become negative when k 0 b 0 3 apparently the roll radiation moment promotes the rolling motion of type a when k 0 b 0 3 which is unusual zhao et al 2017 also obtained a negative added mass when they analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of a horizontally submerged porous plate the reason for this abnormal phenomenon may be the improper value of the dimensionless perforated parameter g p further study is therefore required 4 2 3 wave exciting force for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway exciting force heave exciting force and roll exciting moment are shown in figs 17 19 it can be seen in fig 17 a that the sway exciting force and roll exciting moment of type a significantly increase in the high frequency phase the numerical results for type a in the higher frequency phase are shown in fig 17 b which reveals that the sway exciting force and roll exciting moment of type a have more than one peak value this may be caused by the resonance of waves in the internal free surface because the internal free surface of type a resembles a moon pool which is relatively closed the wave contours of the internal free surface of type a which are presented in fig 27 prove the conjecture see section 4 2 6 of this paper for more details fig 17 a shows that the sway exciting force of type b is larger than that of a box type this can be attributed to the larger wave resistant area of type b for the same reason the sway exciting force of type c is larger than that of the box type when k 0 b 1 the sway exciting forces of type a and type c are smaller than that of the box type in a wide frequency range indicating that these two types of breakwaters can significantly reduce the sway exciting force with property dimensions on the other hand the perforated structures apparently can hardly reduce the wave force in long waves fig 18 shows that in general the heave exciting forces of these three types breakwaters are smaller than that of box type however the heave exciting force of type c is larger than that of box type when k 0 b 4 5 because type c has a horizontal structure near the free surface fig 19 shows that the roll exciting moments of these three types breakwaters are generally larger than that of box type because the installation of perforated structures increases the arm of force 4 2 4 motion response for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway heave and roll motion are shown in figs 20 22 it should be noted that added viscous damping which equals 8 of the critical damping is considered in the heave and roll motion calculations the numerical results which are presented in figs 20 22 demonstrate that the motion responses of type b and type c are smaller than that of box type in the large frequency range the common range is 1 k 0 b 4 indicating that these two breakwaters can significantly reduce the motion response the heave and roll response amplitude operators rao of type a are not discussed here because of the error for roll added mass on the other hand the sway rao result is not influenced by the roll added mass because of the symmetry of type a according to fig 20 the sway rao of type a is smaller than that of box type when k 0 b 0 5 4 2 5 mean drift force for different breakwaters the numerical results for sway mean drift force in fixed condition and free floating condition are shown in fig 23 fig 23 a reveals that the mean drift forces of type a and type c in fixed condition are smaller than that of box type in the large frequency range k 0 b 1 2 for type a and k 0 b 1 for type c the mean drift force of type b is also larger than that of box type because while the installation of a bottom perforated structure increases the force bearing area it has little effect on wave energy dissipation the perforated structure of type c on the other hand is installed near the free surface thus it can dissipate wave energy significantly fig 23 b visualizes the mean drift forces in free floating condition the conclusion is similar to that for the fixed condition type a is not discussed here 4 2 6 wave amplitude for different breakwaters the wave amplitudes in fixed condition and free floating condition are determined in this section fig 24 illustrates the wave amplitude near breakwaters in fixed condition when ω 0 9 rad s in the calculated domain 600 m long and 200 m wide the maximum dimensionless wave amplitudes for box type type a type b and type c are 2 42 1 33 2 31 and 1 97 respectively the wave contour is simulated by 4 961 points the interval between these points is 5 m and thus the actual maximum dimensionless wave amplitudes of these breakwaters are likely to be larger type a is observed to have a remarkable effect in eliminating reflection waves whereas type c can reduce both reflection and transmission wave amplitudes the numerical results for wave amplitude from positions 3 to 10 have similar tendencies take position 3 for example fig 26 shows the results for the wave amplitude at position 3 the location of 3 is shown in fig 25 fig 24 shows that type a can significantly reduce the amplitude of reflection wave which is similar to the ability of the jarlan type breakwater liu 2007 the wave elimination ability of type b is similar to that of the box type whereas the wave elimination ability of type c is better than that of the box type fig 26 a shows that the wave amplitudes for type a and b in fixed condition at position 3 are slightly smaller than that of box type the wave amplitude for type c is also smaller than that of box type especially when 1 k 0 b 3 5 fig 26 b illustrates the wave amplitude in free floating condition at position 3 the wave amplitudes for type b and type c are close to that of box type however when 1 2 k 0 b 2 2 the wave amplitude of box type is smaller type a is not discussed here because the installation of perforated structure increases the roll response which will increase the wave amplitude induced by the motion breakwater the roll response can be reduced through the installation of damping plates to verify the conjecture proposed in section 4 2 2 the wave contours for the internal free surface of type a are calculated the numerical results are presented in fig 27 as shown in fig 27 when ω 1 85 rad s i e dimensionless wave number k 0 b 6 98 where the second peak occurred the maximum dimensionless wave amplitude is significantly larger than that for the other cases the numerical results demonstrate that wave resonance causes the second peak of the wave exciting force of type a 5 conclusion a numerical method based on tebem for perforated floating bodies is proposed in this paper the perforated cylinder experiment conducted by zhao is simulated and the numerical results are compared with experimental results good agreement between the two sets of results is achieved after being verified the numerical method is applied to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of perforated floating breakwaters these conclusions can be obtained 1 the accuracy of the numerical method based on first order tebem is verified based on the findings of previous studies duan 2012 duan et al 2015a 2015b the accuracy of mean drift force obtained via the new method can be trusted although there is no direct evidence supporting this conclusion 2 the results demonstrate that the inertia coefficient of a perforated structure has an effect on the numerical results for added mass meanwhile it has little effect on the wave exciting force and damping coefficient in the case of the calculations for the perforated cylinder experiment done for this paper properly increasing the value of inertia coefficient can refine the simulation results for added mass 3 among the three types of perforated floating breakwaters examined in this study type c behaves the best in type c a perforated wave elimination chamber is installed in the vertical direction near the free surface which can significantly improve the performance of the floating breakwater compared with a box type breakwater type c can reduce wave force including mean drift force and motion response while improving wave elimination ability in the range of 1 k 0 b 3 5 the range may vary with the relative height and installed position of the perforated chamber on the other hand type a can reduce wave force except mean drift force and eliminate reflection waves significantly however the numerical result for its roll added mass has a negative value the reason for this abnormal phenomenon or error may be the improper value of the dimensionless perforated parameter g p further study is therefore required credit authorship contribution statement w

22043,characteristics of creatures that have been evolved over long time in nature provide numerous inspirations to mankind for solving engineering problems inspired by biological principles the development of bio inspired surfaces for reducing the frictional resistance in fluid such as the micro groove surface of shark skin the self cleaning and antifouling surface of lotus leaf has attracted even more attention over the last couple of years based on the development of biomimetic drag reduction technology in recent decades the present paper explains the morphology in brief and reviews the development of mainly three types of biomimetic surfaces including non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface the drag reduction effect and mechanism are discussed as well to understand the biomimetic drag reduction technology comprehensively moreover the manufacturing methods are briefly summarized in the end the existing issues and future research priorities are proposed this paper may provide a better comprehension of the current research status of bio inspired drag reduction techniques keywords bio inspired surface biomimetic drag reduction non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface water jet surface 1 introduction in the 21st century the energy crisis has become a tricky problem all over the world the surface friction resistance causes a lot of energy consuming by various transportations the surface friction resistance of conventional aircraft and ship is about 50 of the total resistance while the proportion of submarine can up to 70 koeltzsch et al 2002 and in the long distance pipeline transportation process the power of pump station is almost all used to overcome the surface friction for underwater robots energy is also a major factor limiting its working scope and time since 1970 researches of bio inspired drag reduction have already been the focus of energy conservation moore and lowson 1995 nature provides many inspirations for the advancement of mankind science and technology bhushan 2009 for example fast swimming sharks own the special micro groove skin to reduce friction the surface of lotus leaf demonstrates the superhydrophobic effect gecko feet possesses the supper adhesion function that can climb up the smoothest surface organisms spent millions of years on getting the spectacular skills we can not only copy these functions or duplicate the biological structures but need to discover the general principles and then use these characteristics reasonably according to the actual situation it has been widely accepted that the smoother the surface the less friction it produces however researchers discovered that shark skin has a micro groove structure which can greatly reduce friction under certain turbulent conditions as early as 1982 in addition as the phenomenon of other biological morphology on different scales was discovered the traditional view of smooth surface for drag reduction was doubted new biomimetic approaches on drag reducing were increasingly accepted so far there are lots of achievements on biomimetic drag reduction and they can be roughly divided into 3 categories including non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface in this paper three types of bio inspired drag reduction technologies are reviewed in section 2 to 4 in these sections the morphology is explained in brief and the drag reduction effect and mechanisms are discussed additionally their manufacture methods are presented in section 5 the existing issues and the promising routes from biomimetic drag reduction surfaces in the next are proposed this review may provide a better comprehension of the current research status of bio inspired drag reduction techniques 2 non smooth surface 2 1 morphology the studies on non smooth surface are mainly inspired by scale structures of shark skin to reduce sailing resistance which could apply to the underwater surface shark skin as shown in fig 1 is generally composed of many small tooth like scales which called denticles wen et al 2014 the denticles have intricate shapes and the size of the denticles are basically located in hundreds of cubic microns luo et al 2016 the shape of denticles shows different characteristics in different parts of shark individuals and different species bechert et al 2000 miyazaki et al 2018 which could adapt to the flow fields of different body parts and different marine environments it may be the result of natural selection and is helpful to develop the advantageous flowing field around the body initially shark skin was simplified into regular grooves with triangular or rectangular cross sections and hydrodynamic studies were performed on these riblets bechert et al 1997 bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 bixler and bhushan 2013a dean and bhushan 2010 el samni et al 2005 walsh 1983 with the continuous advancement of scanning microscopy models of real shark denticles have been built and studied both experimentally and computationally han et al 2008 luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b 2 2 drag reduction effect and mechanisms of non smooth surface the study of non smooth surface drag reduction technology has been started for years and numerous achievements have been obtained in the 1970s it was found that the surface with tiny trenches riblets flowing down the flow could effectively reduce the wall frictional resistance and the grooves with a certain degree of triangular v shaped are the optimal drag reduction trench geometry bushnell and hefner 1990 the parameters of the riblets were optimized which laid the foundation for the development of biomimetic drag reduction technology walsh 1983 since then a large number of biomimetic non smooth surface drag reduction studies have emerged and most researches concentrate on the riblet imitating shark skin table 1 lists representative reports on drag reduction of non smooth surface in chronological order in order to reveal the mechanism of non smooth surface in details the research methods mainly include numerical calculation and experimental analysis the research objects involve the flat plate the rotating body and the wing with non smooth surface the goal is revealing the flow field distribution and drag reduction characteristics of non smooth surface when solid contact with water a single shield scale model was obtained through high precision scanning and data processing zhang et al 2011b the results indicated that the shark skin structure could reduce the diffusion speed of vortex and the water tunnel experiment also confirmed the drag reduction effect of non smooth surface with shark skin zhang et al 2011a various dimensional riblets were examined with close channel internal flow and the results showed that the riblet structures were helpful for reducing the amplitude of convective lamination bixler and bhushan 2013b three different riblets drag characteristics and vortex structures were compared and optimal riblet parameters were obtained martin and bhushan 2016 microstructures of real shark denticles were measured and digital model was constructed to explore the hydrodynamics effect miyazaki et al 2018 the results indicated that the morphological inhomogeneity of denticles may play a non negligible role in the passive control of local turbulent flow shark skin denticles could generate lift and increase the lift to drag ratio in addition to drag reduction domel et al 2018a b they also investigated the effect of denticles size on hydrodynamics domel et al 2018a b they proposed that the 1x denticles size could achieve significant drag reduction while 1 5x and 2x size resulted in higher drag that could explain the reason why the increase in drag in the research boomsma and sotiropoulos 2016 on shark skin denticles although lots of researches have proved that the drag reduction effect of biomimetic non smooth surface is obvious the drag reduction mechanism still be controversial because there are still some problems in turbulence which not resolved in theoretical research there are two main concepts namely the secondary vortex theory and the protruding height theory to explain the mechanism for the secondary vortex theory the generation and development of secondary vortex effectively weaken the ability of uplifting low velocity fluid and hence the burst strength of turbulence is reduced and the stability of fluid movement on the boundary layer is improved which finally leads to the decrease of turbulence frictional resistance bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 fu et al 2017 for the protruding height theory the flow in riblets below the protruding height is mostly blocked by viscosity that making flow more stable and it is equivalent to increasing the thickness of the viscosity underlying layer so the riblet surface could play a role to weaken the whole turbulence in the boundary layer and reduce the friction bechert et al 1997 dean and bhushan 2010 luo et al 2016 furthermore the turbulence intensity is reduced by the presence of the attack angle of the shark skin shield scale and the attack angle could cause a small back flow on the valley of the groove luo et al 2014 2015a luo 2015 in addition mucus secreted on the surface of shark skin also has a positive effect on drag reduction the biomimetic shark skin surface combined with polymer additive was proposed and the maximum drag reduction rate is up to 80 chen et al 2014 moreover the experimental results in water tunnel also showed that the artificial composite drag reduction surface based on biological sharkskin morphology and mucus nano long chain could obtain more than 20 of drag reduction compared with the smooth skin luo et al 2015b 2 3 manufacture both non smooth surface and superhydrophobic surface are based on the microstructure which plays an important role on drag reduction effect although there are numerous theoretical studies on biomimetic drag reduction the practical applications of biomimetic non smooth surfaces are difficult because of lacking suitable microstructure manufacturing technology at present there are four main manufacturing methods direct bio replicated micro imprinting technology luo et al 2015a luo and zhang 2013 lithography kim et al 2016 laser engraving and polishing wu et al 2018 and 3d printing technology domel et al 2018a b wen et al 2014 the biomimetic sharkskin was fabricated by a direct bio replicated micro imprinting technology to explore sharkskin hydrodynamics luo et al 2015a luo and zhang 2013 and the result indicated that the surface has a good effect on drag reduction fig 2 i a top down manufacturing method was proposed for a large area metal layered structure with good controllability and reproducibility fig 2 ii kim et al 2016 the laser engraving machine and polishing machine were used to fabricate the biomimetic surface with microstructures of fish scales wu et al 2018 thousands of artificial shark shield scales were placed on flexible membranes in an adjustable linear arrangement based on the 3d printing fig 2 iii wen et al 2014 a multi material objet connex500 3d printer was used to embed rigid denticles into a flexible substrate which could explore the effect of denticles size fig 2 iv domel et al 2018a b compared with a smooth surface the 3d printed denticles could reduce energy consumption under certain condition 3 superhydrophobic surface 3 1 morphology most of the inspirations of superhydrophobic surface come from plants such as the superhydrophobic surface of lotus leaf rice leaf or water strider leg during the period many outstanding studies were emerged such as wenzel 1936 cassie and baxter 1944 feng et al 2002 daniello et al 2009 wang et al 2015a b zhang and lv 2015 with the development of sem the incredible micro structures of plants surfaces are discovered and observing the surface of the lotus leaf by electron microscopy revealed a protruding nucleus of 20 40 μm on the surface guo et al 2011 w and c 1997 zhang and lv 2015 it was found that the water strider s legs are superhydrophobic which induced by the nano sized grooves of its legs feng et al 2007 bixler and bhushan 2014 found that rice leaves and butterfly wings combined the sharkskin effect and lotus effect that might lead to high drag reduction the sem images as shown in fig 3 depict actual lotus leaf water strider legs and rice leaf surfaces and each example above which contains mechanism that may promote the effect of drag reduction 3 2 drag reduction effect and mechanisms of superhydrophobic surface the study of biomimetic hydrophobic technology started from the 1950s and prevailed in the 1990s onda et al 1996 successfully synthesized the superhydrophobic materials and opened the door of superhydrophobic drag reduction research surface wettability is one of the important features of a solid surface which plays a crucial role on self cleaning and hydrophobic effects typically ca contact angle is often used as a measurement of wettability a surface with ca more than 90 is assumed to be hydrophobic and a surface with ca less than 90 is termed as hydrophilic with the continuous development of nano micro technology and the urgent need of special surface performance materials researchers have strong interest to both fundamental research and practical applications of superhydrophobic surface s wang et al 2015a a deeper understanding of the relationship between wettability and microstructures were obtained after going from the young equation young 1800 to the wenzel equation wenzel 1936 and then to the cassie and cassie baxter equation cassie and baxter 1944 as shown in table 2 four conditions of water repellent surface are conclude as follows i high ca ii low ca hysteresis iii ability of supporting high liquid pressure requiring high space factor and large perimeter or diameter of pillars iv ability of supporting wide range of droplet sizes requires hierarchical roughness nosonovsky and bhushan 2008 therefore hydrophobic drag reduction is not only about surface material but about nano micro structure for the superhydrophobic surface with micro grooved structures the gas is entrapped into the bottom of microstructures and the trapped gas called plastron can lift the liquid resulting in a large ca the plastron is not steady and it could rotate at a certain speed just like the bearing rollers hence the viscous force on solid liquid interface could be seen as the viscous force on solid gas interface there is a slip quantified as slip length occurs at the interface and the slip length of the solid gas interface increases as compared with the solid liquid interface guo et al 2011 wang et al 2012 the effective slip can be used as an important evaluation for the superhydrophobicity of laminar flows lee et al 2016 while the drag reduction of the superhydrophobic surface in turbulence flows is considered to be the joint effect of interface slip and changes in turbulent structure rastegari and akhavan 2018 j zhang et al 2015a recent studies have shown that the magnitude of drag reduction also depends on the size of the microstructures and the reynolds number of the base flow qiao et al 2017 rastegari and akhavan 2019 parameters should be sufficiently minimized in order to obtain significant drag reduction gose et al 2018 watanabe et al 1999 conducted drag reduction test with hydrophobic materials and got the maximum drag reduction rate of 14 choi et al 2006 used nanoscale grating patterns to study the slip and drag reduction of superhydrophobic surfaces and the drag reduction was about 20 30 daniello et al 2009 demonstrated that regular microstructure superhydrophobic surface could reduce viscous drag by 50 and drag reduction was found to increase with the increase of microstructure units at a certain reynolds number which is similar to laminar flows an accurate metric for predicting the drag reduction performance of superhydrophobic surfaces was proposed and verified by direct comparison of the moving velocity cheng et al 2015 a navigation experiment was conducted on a large underwater vehicle model which proved that the superhydrophobic technology can achieve a drag reduction effect of 15 s zhang et al 2015b wang et al 2017 conducted experiments on the rotating disk with superhydrophobic surface in micro flow field and obtained the maximum drag reduction rate of 13 9 the drag reduction of superhydrophobic surfaces in laminar flows was studied by dns and an analytical solution for laminar flows was obtained y li et al 2017b the superhydrophobic surface was fabricated on steel substrates and the friction resistance of the surface was measured zhang et al 2018 the drag reduction reached 40 50 furthermore monfared et al 2019 proposed that the drag reduction of the riblet with superhydrophobic coating was improved from 18 9 to 56 9 we do believe that superhydrophobic coatings have a broad development prospect in the field of underwater drag reduction through the above scientific research 3 3 manufacture most of the engineering applications are based on superhydrophobic materials whilst most of surfaces are hydrophilic consequently there are various effective fabricating method of superhydrophobic surfaces on a series of substrates such as anodization wang et al 2008 wu et al 2009 electrodeposition xi et al 2008 chemical modification guo et al 2008 qu et al 2017 xiang et al 2017 chemical deposition y wang et al 2015b wu et al 2008 micro etching choi et al 2017 rezayi and entezari 2016 tan et al 2017 high temperature oxidation weng et al 2017 plasma jet wu et al 2019 and photo crosslink cao et al 2017 nanoparticle spraying su et al 2018 taghvaei et al 2017 wang et al 2018 table 3 summarizes the manufacturing methods of superhydrophobic surface on metal substrate in recent years in addition polymers or composite materials are preferred in some applications due to their corrosion resistance mechanical properties slips slippery liquid infused porous surfaces locks the injected lubricating fluid onto a micro structured surface to prevent the surface from adhering to other liquids samaha and gad el hak 2014 the biomimetic pdms film also has well superhydrophobic self healing and drag reduction properties liu et al 2019 4 water jet surface 4 1 morphology gill is the main respiratory organ of fish which is usually symmetrical arrangement on both sides of fishes the gill of fish shows various structures due to the differences of species lifestyles head structures and other factors sharks master the strongest ability of swimming in the ocean and the burst speed of deep sea sharks can reach up to 20 m s as shown in fig 4 there are large panels on sharks front body with each side bearing 5 to 7 pairs of gill slits the water flow from gill was not only related to respiration but could reduce the resistance when swimming zhao et al 2010 the water jet provides an additional thrust for fish which would significantly speed up when swimming especially during the fast moving stage in addition a biomimetic jet surface model was constructed based on the biological characteristics of the earthworm which was similar to shark s gills gu et al 2015 4 2 drag reduction effect and mechanisms of biomimetic jet surface the study of biomimetic water jet drag reduction is just unfolding the high drag reduction rates could verify the correctness and the significant value of water jet drag reduction a best drag reduction rate was obtained while jet angle is 30 zhao et al 2010 the biomimetic jet surface model of shark gills was built and numerical simulations were carried out yunqing et al 2012 the results indicated that the jet had a drag reduction effect when the main flow field velocity was 3 m s and the jet velocity was greater than 0 1 m s they proposed that different configurations of height and base of the jet hole could influence the drag reduction effect gu et al 2013 the maximum drag reduction rate was 32 74 at the height of 8 mm and the base of 11 mm zhao et al 2014 built a biomimetic jet model by measuring the real white shark and the numerical simulation showed that the drag reduction rate was up to 17 15 when the velocity of main flow field was 5 m s gu et al 2014 established the testing system and four models with different diameters were fabricated to test the drag reduction effect the results indicated that the best drag reduction effect appeared at d 3 mm while the worst was at d 1 mm both the numerical simulation and the experiment obtained that the drag reduction rate reached the maximum when the jet velocity was 1 m s and the jet direction angle was 30 which was 8 69 and 7 86 respectively gu et al 2015 the biomimetic jet surface models of different jet hole shapes were studied by numerical simulation fang et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 results showed that all kinds of the holes performed drag reducing effect and the third one was superior with the maximum drag reduction rate of 8 40 through numerical simulation and experiment f li et al 2017a obtained the drag reduction effect reached 33 93 when the jet diameter of 5 mm the jet angle is 15 and the velocity ratio is 0 15 the influence of multi parameter coupling of biomimetic jet surface was also explored on drag reduction the best rate appeared when the jet diameter is 5 mm and the jet velocity is 1 2 m s gu et al 2019 the mechanism of water jet drag reduction is to influence the pressure drag and friction resistance which are the mainly forces exerted on underwater vehicles while moving in the water meanwhile the jet may changes the flow filed structure of boundary layer near the jet surface for pressure drag the water jet produces vortex pad effect the viscous sublayer in the downstream flow filed of jet hole is thickened and the corresponding speed gradient is reduced under the jet effect and the reverse vortex is produced so that the vortex structure exists stably thus the shear stress reduces for friction resistance the water jet produces driving effect the jet effects as an additional power that could inhibit the friction resistance which contributes to the drag reduction gu et al 2014 f li et al 2017a yunqing et al 2012 creatures have possessed a variety of structures and characteristics through long term mutual optimization and coupling which greatly improved their adaptive ability to the environment hence it is necessary to consider the coupling and interference among multiple factors in biomimetic researches the main factors that affect the water jet drag reduction could be divided into three aspects jet holes flow filed and surface factors each of the factors can also be subdivided into multiple sub factors as shown in fig 6 4 3 manufacture the processing method for the jet surface is relatively simple due to the limited research at present with the deepening research on drag reduction of water jet the material selection and manufacturing methods on the jet surface will become the new research focus 3d printing laser engraving chemical engraving and other methods could be well applied to jet surface manufacture we believe that jet surface processing will develop towards refinement and flexibility in the future 5 conclusion in this review the development of mainly three bio inspired drag reduction technologies in fluid engineering are presented from which the following conclusions could be acquired 1 the effect of biomimetic drag reduction is obvious but it still has a long way to go both in theoretical research and practical application one of the most fundamental questions is that some issues in turbulence have not been fully resolved which results the coexistence of several different explanations about the drag reduction mechanisms additionally a great drag reducing rate could be observed under certain conditions in other words the drag reduction effect would be weakened or even disappeared if the conditions are changed so generic characteristics existing for the phenomenon and the functional relationship between bio inspired surface and drag reduction effect need to be further explored on the other hand some engineering application problems have not been solved such as how to manufacture large drag reduction surface efficiently and how to improve the hardness and corrosion resistance of the surface many researches on drag reduction technology are still in the stage of laboratory exploration 2 the composite drag reduction technology is one of the future research direction whether it is from the perspective of bionics or practical application the differences in drag reducing effect and stability manufacturing difficulty producting cost and other aspects among various drag reduction methods determine that only one single drag reduction method is unable to satisfy the actual requirement there is no doubt that the combination of multiple drag reduction technologies will greatly improve the adaptability and drag reduction effect the future researches may be focused on the composite of non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface 3 biomimetic drag reduction surface usually works through the effect of specific micro structures or materials therefore the research and application of biomimetic drag reduction technology are restricted by the development of material science and manufacturing technology nowadays the emerging intelligent materials and new manufacturing technologies play an important role in the theoretical and experimental study which may greatly increase the practical application of biomimetic drag reduction technology nature has developed various materials objects and structures ranging from macroscale to nanoscale which have unlimited benefits for human to solve engineering problems the current biomimetic drag reduction technologies should be deeply explored and investigated in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper acknowledgments the work was supported by natural science foundation of shandong province grant no

22043,characteristics of creatures that have been evolved over long time in nature provide numerous inspirations to mankind for solving engineering problems inspired by biological principles the development of bio inspired surfaces for reducing the frictional resistance in fluid such as the micro groove surface of shark skin the self cleaning and antifouling surface of lotus leaf has attracted even more attention over the last couple of years based on the development of biomimetic drag reduction technology in recent decades the present paper explains the morphology in brief and reviews the development of mainly three types of biomimetic surfaces including non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface the drag reduction effect and mechanism are discussed as well to understand the biomimetic drag reduction technology comprehensively moreover the manufacturing methods are briefly summarized in the end the existing issues and future research priorities are proposed this paper may provide a better comprehension of the current research status of bio inspired drag reduction techniques keywords bio inspired surface biomimetic drag reduction non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface water jet surface 1 introduction in the 21st century the energy crisis has become a tricky problem all over the world the surface friction resistance causes a lot of energy consuming by various transportations the surface friction resistance of conventional aircraft and ship is about 50 of the total resistance while the proportion of submarine can up to 70 koeltzsch et al 2002 and in the long distance pipeline transportation process the power of pump station is almost all used to overcome the surface friction for underwater robots energy is also a major factor limiting its working scope and time since 1970 researches of bio inspired drag reduction have already been the focus of energy conservation moore and lowson 1995 nature provides many inspirations for the advancement of mankind science and technology bhushan 2009 for example fast swimming sharks own the special micro groove skin to reduce friction the surface of lotus leaf demonstrates the superhydrophobic effect gecko feet possesses the supper adhesion function that can climb up the smoothest surface organisms spent millions of years on getting the spectacular skills we can not only copy these functions or duplicate the biological structures but need to discover the general principles and then use these characteristics reasonably according to the actual situation it has been widely accepted that the smoother the surface the less friction it produces however researchers discovered that shark skin has a micro groove structure which can greatly reduce friction under certain turbulent conditions as early as 1982 in addition as the phenomenon of other biological morphology on different scales was discovered the traditional view of smooth surface for drag reduction was doubted new biomimetic approaches on drag reducing were increasingly accepted so far there are lots of achievements on biomimetic drag reduction and they can be roughly divided into 3 categories including non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface in this paper three types of bio inspired drag reduction technologies are reviewed in section 2 to 4 in these sections the morphology is explained in brief and the drag reduction effect and mechanisms are discussed additionally their manufacture methods are presented in section 5 the existing issues and the promising routes from biomimetic drag reduction surfaces in the next are proposed this review may provide a better comprehension of the current research status of bio inspired drag reduction techniques 2 non smooth surface 2 1 morphology the studies on non smooth surface are mainly inspired by scale structures of shark skin to reduce sailing resistance which could apply to the underwater surface shark skin as shown in fig 1 is generally composed of many small tooth like scales which called denticles wen et al 2014 the denticles have intricate shapes and the size of the denticles are basically located in hundreds of cubic microns luo et al 2016 the shape of denticles shows different characteristics in different parts of shark individuals and different species bechert et al 2000 miyazaki et al 2018 which could adapt to the flow fields of different body parts and different marine environments it may be the result of natural selection and is helpful to develop the advantageous flowing field around the body initially shark skin was simplified into regular grooves with triangular or rectangular cross sections and hydrodynamic studies were performed on these riblets bechert et al 1997 bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 bixler and bhushan 2013a dean and bhushan 2010 el samni et al 2005 walsh 1983 with the continuous advancement of scanning microscopy models of real shark denticles have been built and studied both experimentally and computationally han et al 2008 luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b 2 2 drag reduction effect and mechanisms of non smooth surface the study of non smooth surface drag reduction technology has been started for years and numerous achievements have been obtained in the 1970s it was found that the surface with tiny trenches riblets flowing down the flow could effectively reduce the wall frictional resistance and the grooves with a certain degree of triangular v shaped are the optimal drag reduction trench geometry bushnell and hefner 1990 the parameters of the riblets were optimized which laid the foundation for the development of biomimetic drag reduction technology walsh 1983 since then a large number of biomimetic non smooth surface drag reduction studies have emerged and most researches concentrate on the riblet imitating shark skin table 1 lists representative reports on drag reduction of non smooth surface in chronological order in order to reveal the mechanism of non smooth surface in details the research methods mainly include numerical calculation and experimental analysis the research objects involve the flat plate the rotating body and the wing with non smooth surface the goal is revealing the flow field distribution and drag reduction characteristics of non smooth surface when solid contact with water a single shield scale model was obtained through high precision scanning and data processing zhang et al 2011b the results indicated that the shark skin structure could reduce the diffusion speed of vortex and the water tunnel experiment also confirmed the drag reduction effect of non smooth surface with shark skin zhang et al 2011a various dimensional riblets were examined with close channel internal flow and the results showed that the riblet structures were helpful for reducing the amplitude of convective lamination bixler and bhushan 2013b three different riblets drag characteristics and vortex structures were compared and optimal riblet parameters were obtained martin and bhushan 2016 microstructures of real shark denticles were measured and digital model was constructed to explore the hydrodynamics effect miyazaki et al 2018 the results indicated that the morphological inhomogeneity of denticles may play a non negligible role in the passive control of local turbulent flow shark skin denticles could generate lift and increase the lift to drag ratio in addition to drag reduction domel et al 2018a b they also investigated the effect of denticles size on hydrodynamics domel et al 2018a b they proposed that the 1x denticles size could achieve significant drag reduction while 1 5x and 2x size resulted in higher drag that could explain the reason why

attack angle could cause a small back flow on the valley of the groove luo et al 2014 2015a luo 2015 in addition mucus secreted on the surface of shark skin also has a positive effect on drag reduction the biomimetic shark skin surface combined with polymer additive was proposed and the maximum drag reduction rate is up to 80 chen et al 2014 moreover the experimental results in water tunnel also showed that the artificial composite drag reduction surface based on biological sharkskin morphology and mucus nano long chain could obtain more than 20 of drag reduction compared with the smooth skin luo et al 2015b 2 3 manufacture both non smooth surface and superhydrophobic surface are based on the microstructure which plays an important role on drag reduction effect although there are numerous theoretical studies on biomimetic drag reduction the practical applications of biomimetic non smooth surfaces are difficult because of lacking suitable microstructure manufacturing

wen et al 2014 a multi material objet connex500 3d printer was used to embed rigid denticles into a flexible substrate which could explore the effect of denticles size fig 2 iv domel et al 2018a b compared with a smooth surface the 3d printed denticles could reduce energy consumption under certain condition 3 superhydrophobic surface 3 1 morphology most of the inspirations of superhydrophobic

porous surfaces locks the injected lubricating fluid onto a micro structured surface to prevent the surface from adhering to other liquids samaha and gad el hak 2014 the biomimetic pdms film also has well superhydrophobic self healing and drag reduction properties liu et al 2019 4 water jet surface 4 1 morphology gill is the main respiratory organ of fish which is usually symmetrical arrangement on both sides of fishes the gill of fish shows various structures due to the differences of species lifestyles head structures and other factors sharks master the strongest ability of swimming in the ocean and the burst speed of deep sea sharks can reach up to 20 m s as shown in fig 4 there are large panels on sharks front body with each side bearing 5 to 7 pairs of gill slits the water flow from gill was not only related to respiration but could reduce the resistance when swimming zhao et al 2010 the water jet provides an additional thrust for fish which would significantly speed up when swimming especially during the fast moving stage in addition a biomimetic jet surface model was constructed based on the biological characteristics of the earthworm which was similar to shark s gills gu et al 2015 4 2 drag reduction effect and mechanisms of biomimetic jet surface the study of biomimetic water jet drag reduction is just unfolding the high drag reduction rates could verify the correctness and the significant value of water jet drag reduction a best drag reduction rate was obtained while jet angle is 30 zhao et al 2010 the biomimetic jet surface model of shark gills was built and numerical simulations were carried out yunqing et al 2012 the results indicated that the jet had a drag reduction effect when the main flow field velocity was 3 m s and the jet velocity was greater than 0 1 m s they proposed that different configurations of height and base of the jet hole could influence the drag reduction effect gu et al 2013 the maximum drag reduction rate was 32 74 at the height of 8 mm and the base of 11 mm zhao et al 2014 built a biomimetic jet model by measuring the real white shark and the numerical simulation showed that the drag reduction rate was up to 17 15 when the velocity of main flow field was 5 m s gu et al 2014 established the testing system and four models with different diameters were fabricated to test the drag reduction effect the results indicated that the best drag reduction effect appeared at d 3 mm while the worst was at d 1 mm both the numerical simulation and the experiment obtained that the drag reduction rate reached the maximum when the jet velocity was 1 m s and the jet direction angle was 30 which was 8 69 and 7 86 respectively gu et al 2015 the biomimetic jet surface models of different jet hole shapes were studied by numerical simulation fang et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 results showed that all kinds of the holes performed drag reducing effect and the third one was superior with the maximum drag reduction rate of 8 40 through numerical simulation and experiment f li et al 2017a obtained the drag reduction effect reached 33 93 when the jet diameter of 5 mm the jet angle is 15 and the velocity ratio is 0 15 the influence of multi parameter coupling of biomimetic jet surface was also explored on drag reduction the best rate appeared when the jet diameter is 5 mm and the jet velocity is 1 2 m s gu et al 2019 the mechanism of water jet drag reduction is to influence the pressure drag and friction resistance which are the mainly forces exerted on underwater vehicles while moving in the water meanwhile the jet may changes the flow filed structure of boundary layer near the jet surface for pressure drag the water jet produces vortex pad effect the viscous sublayer in the downstream flow filed of jet hole is thickened and the corresponding speed gradient is reduced under the jet effect and the reverse vortex is produced so that the vortex structure exists stably thus the shear stress reduces for friction resistance the water jet produces driving effect the jet effects as an additional power that could inhibit the friction resistance which contributes to the drag reduction gu et al 2014 f li et al 2017a yunqing et al 2012 creatures have possessed a variety of structures and characteristics through long term mutual optimization and coupling which greatly improved their adaptive ability to the environment hence it is necessary to consider the coupling and interference among multiple factors in biomimetic researches the main factors that affect the water jet drag reduction could be divided into three aspects jet holes flow filed and surface factors each of the factors can also be subdivided into multiple sub factors as shown in fig 6 4 3 manufacture the processing method for the jet surface is relatively simple due to the limited research at present with the deepening research on drag reduction of water jet the material selection and manufacturing methods on the jet surface will become the new research focus 3d printing laser engraving chemical engraving and other methods could be well applied to jet surface manufacture we believe that jet surface processing will develop towards refinement and flexibility in the future 5 conclusion in this review the development of mainly three bio inspired drag reduction technologies in fluid engineering are presented from which the following conclusions could be acquired 1 the effect of biomimetic drag reduction is obvious but it still has a long way to go both in theoretical research and practical application one of the most fundamental questions is that some issues in turbulence have not been fully resolved which results the coexistence of several different explanations about the drag reduction mechanisms additionally a great drag reducing rate could be observed under certain conditions in other words the drag reduction effect would be weakened or even disappeared if the conditions are changed so generic characteristics existing for the phenomenon and the functional relationship between bio inspired surface and drag reduction effect need to be further explored on the other hand some engineering application problems have not been solved such as how to manufacture large drag reduction surface efficiently and how to improve the hardness and corrosion resistance of the surface many researches on drag reduction technology are still in the stage of laboratory exploration 2 the composite drag reduction technology is one of the future research direction whether it is from the perspective of bionics or practical application the differences in drag reducing effect and stability manufacturing difficulty producting cost and other aspects among various drag reduction methods determine that only one single drag reduction method is unable to satisfy the actual requirement there is no doubt that the combination of multiple drag reduction technologies will greatly improve the adaptability and drag reduction effect the future researches may be focused on the composite of non smooth surface superhydrophobic surface and water jet surface 3 biomimetic drag reduction surface usually works through the effect of specific micro structures or materials therefore the research and application of biomimetic drag reduction technology are restricted by the development of material science and manufacturing technology nowadays the emerging intelligent materials and new manufacturing technologies play an important role in the theoretical and experimental study which may greatly increase the practical application of biomimetic drag reduction technology nature has developed various materials objects and structures ranging from macroscale to nanoscale which have unlimited benefits for human to solve engineering problems the current biomimetic drag reduction technologies should be deeply explored and investigated in the future declaration of competing interest the

22044,this paper is aimed to explore the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt multiple conditions of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is adopted to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in different conditions of the external environment the results reveal that the efficiency and stability of the power generation are significantly affected by the yaw error moreover the yaw error will decrease the effective power and increase the power fluctuation however the yaw error has little effects on the motion and the structural load of wind turbines in addition the wind wave misalignment also has little effects on power generation but it greatly affects the motion and the structural load of wind turbines the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are closely related to the performances of the fowt therefore it is essential to explore the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the entire wind turbine and take them into consideration in the design keywords yaw error wind wave misalignment the floating offshore wind turbine time domain analysis dynamic characteristics 1 introduction wind power is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy countries around the world are vigorously developing the wind energy industry in recent years more attention has been paid to the development of offshore wind resources yuanchuan et al 2018 onshore wind turbines are no longer applicable in the area with water depth more than 50 m therefore researchers and engineers across the world focus on the study of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt that can function in the deep offshore sites for the horizontal axis wind turbine the nacelle needs to rotate to the wind according to the shortest path to eliminate the yaw error which can improve the utilization rate of wind energy xiaoguang et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to solve the yaw steering problem and study the corresponding relationship between the wind direction and the wind wheel in fig 1 and fig 2 the red region represents the initial position of the wind wheel and the blue region represents the yaw position the wind direction and the wind wheel have two situations the angles are relative values shown as follows 1 if the angle between the wind direction and the wind wheel is less than 180 the yaw angle is expressed as 1 θ w i n d θ y a w 2 if the angle between the wind direction and wind wheel axis angle is greater than 180 the yaw angle can be expressed as 2 θ y a w 360 θ w i n d there are three reasons why the modern wind turbine is running in yaw state under most circumstances li feng 2017 firstly the natural wind has randomness the wind speed and direction change from time to time secondly when wind energy is absorbed wake effect will be produced which leads to the decrease of the yaw accuracy lastly the yaw control needs to have certain sluggishness to ensure the stable operation of the wind turbine these factors make it impossible for the wind turbine to align with the wind direction all the time as shown in fig 3 when the wind wheel deviates from the wind direction by an angle γ the yaw error is caused therefore it is of great practical value to study the influences of yaw error on the wind turbine to ensure the security of the operation and improve the power generation efficiency currently the studies of the wind turbine under the yaw error focus on the power generation and the aerodynamic characteristics jeong et al 2013 zhou and tang 2011 fadaeinedjad et al 2009 xiao guang et al 2014 has been researched but all the research object is the stationary wind turbine jeong et al 2013 established a coupled blade model including the geometric nonlinearity and analyzed the influence of the yaw error on the stability of blades zhou et al zhou and tang 2011 used the vortex column theory to establish the aerodynamic performance calculation model of a wind turbine when it was in steady yaw state roohollah et al fadaeinedjad et al 2009 used the simulation software to study the dynamic aerodynamics of the wind turbine on the wind diesel combined generation system lu et al xiao guang et al 2014 analyzed the force characteristics of blades under yaw state and studied the aerodynamic force of the wind turbines under different wind speeds however the most significant feature of the fowt is that it is carried on a floating platform with the mooring system and subject to various environmental loads compared with the stationary wind turbine the research on the fowt is insufficient and mostly focus on the condition of the wind and wave in the common direction in reality there is always a misalignment between the wind and the wave when the wind speed is high the wind and wave tend to appear small misalignment when the wind speed is small wind and waves tend to appear large misalignment according to the literature barth and eecen 2006 kuhn 2001 the misalignment of 30 is common and the probability of 60 is very low the recent research on the performance of wind turbine under wind wave misalignment focuses on the structural load and the yaw error is ignored yin et al 2017 analyzed the structural loads of blades and the yaw bearing in extreme hurricanes bachynski et al 2014 eritenel and parker 2009 researched the influence of wind wave misalignment on the tower base and found the peak value of the tower base bending moment increased yoshida et al yoshida and utsunomiya 2010 studied the variation of foundation fatigue load under wind wave misalignment and found that the longitudinal bending moment is the main factor of the fatigue load barj et al 2014 found that only considering collinearity conditions would underestimate tower base fatigue damage and suggested that the wind wave misalignment should be considered stewart et al stewart and lackner 2014a effectively reduced the fatigue load in the fore aft direction of the tower base by applying tower tuned mass damper overall the current research focuses on the impact of a single factor however the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are inevitable factors in the actual operation of the fowt this paper is aimed to study the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the fowt multiple conditions of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is adopted to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in different conditions of the external environment the discussion focuses on the power generation the wind turbine motion and the structure load 2

fig 4 the oc4 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is carried on the deepcwind submersible platform the whole system is located in the offshore site through the mooring system the main parameter of the wind turbine system is listed in table 1 as can be seen from fig 5 the deepcwind submersible platform consists of three main offset cabins a central cabin and support members the oc4 5 mw floating offshore wind turbine system is arranged in the offshore site with a water depth of 200 m the mooring system consists of three catenary lines the mooring system consists of three suspension chains they are arranged symmetrically with an angle of 60 parameters of the platform and mooring system are listed in table 2 3 the fast model the time domain software fast v8 16 00a bjj jonkman and jonkman 2016 released by nrel is used to study the dynamic characteristics of the oc4 5 mw floating offshore wind turbine system in various combinations of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment the calculation flow chart of the coupled dynamic model in fast software is shown in fig 6 the entire system is divided into the aerodynamic model hydrodynamic model mooring system model and servo system

mooring line to the floating body 3 1 aerodynamic modeling the aerodynamic calculation is to study the aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbines in steady yaw state by using the blade element momentum method bem it has a basic assumption the force acting on the blade element is only related to the momentum change of the airflow passing through the blade element sweeping ring the schematic diagram of the sweeping ring and the blade element are as shown as in fig 7 according to the blade element theory it is assumed that the number of blades is n the radius of the wind wheel is r the chord length of the blade element is c the yaw error is γ the wind speed is u the air density is ρ a the angular velocity of the wind wheel is ω the initial values of both axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a are zero the inflow angle r of the blade element at the radius r is expressed as 4a sin r u 1 a w c o s r ω r 1 a w 4b w u 2 1 a 2 ω 2 r 2 1 a 2 the axial thrust δ t b on the blade element scanning ring can be calculated in proportion is expressed as 5a δ t b 1 2 ρ a w 2 σ r c x r δ r δ ψ where 5b c x c l c o s r c d s i n r 5c σ r n c 2 π r for the given blade element position μ and the azimuth ψ the radial thickness is δ r the wind wheel rotation angle is δ ψ and the wake inclination angle is χ the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are obtained from the airfoil data considering the yaw error and prandtl tip loss the momentum change rate of blade element is expressed as 6 δ t m 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 a c o s γ t a n χ 2 s i n γ a s e c 2 χ 2 r δ r δ ψ the expression of blade element momentum relative to the wake axis is expressed as 7a δ m b 1 2 ρ a w 2 n c c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ r δ r δ ψ 2 π where 7b c y c l s i n r c d c o s r by applying the momentum theorem to the entire sweeping ring the distribution of the axial induction factor with the change of radius can be obtained to solve the momentum change rate of the entire sweeping ring integral must be performed along the ring the axial momentum is expressed as 8 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 α cos γ tan x 2 sin γ α s e c 2 x 2 r δ r d ψ 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a w 2 σ r c x r δ r d ψ therefore it is 9 8 π a c o s γ t a n χ 2 s i n γ a s e c 2 χ 2 σ r 0 2 π w 2 u 2 c x d ψ the rate of change of angular momentum is expressed as 10 δ m m 1 2 ρ a u 2 λ μ n 4 a c o s γ a c o s 2 ψ c o s 2 x s i n 2 ψ r 2 δ ψ δ r integrating along the ring is expressed as 11 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a u 2 λ μ 4 a c o s γ a c o s 2 ψ c o s 2 x s i n 2 ψ r 2 δ r d ψ 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a w 2 n c c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ r δ r d ψ 2 π after the simplification 12 σ r 0 2 π w 2 u 2 c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ d ψ the integral values in equations 9 and 12 can be determined and the solution can be obtained through multiple iterations the integral can be calculated after given the position μ of the scanning ring the calculation value of a can be solved by equation 9 and the calculation value of a can be solved by equation 12 the same sweeping ring is iterated repeatedly until a satisfactory convergence effect is achieved before moving to the next one this is the blade element momentum method for steady yaw state li feng 2017 3 2 hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic model is based on the potential flow theory which assumes that the fluid meets the conditions of non viscosity non rotation and incompressibility fast calculates the hydrodynamic parameters in the frequency domain and then converts the hydrodynamic parameters into time domain parameters which served as the boundary conditions for simulation calculation fast s hydrodynamic model receives motion parameters at each time step and these motion parameters are returned to the whole model for the next calculation the structural division of the deepcwind submersible platform as shown as in fig 8 the potential flow theory is used to solve wave forces in large diameter member wamit module coupled in fast is used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficient in the frequency domain according to the potential flow solution the velocity potential v is decomposed into the incident potential i the diffraction potential d and the radiation potential r the incident potential i is expressed as 13 i i g a c o s h k z d ω c o s h k d e k x c o s β w y s i n β w where g is the gravitational acceleration a is the amplitude of the wave k is the wave number d is the water depth d is the diameter of the component and β w is the wave direction angle in order to obtain the velocity potential at each node d and r are solved by the boundary element method based on the linear bernoulli equation the wave force on the structure is calculated hantang et al 2013 the strip theory solution is used to solve wave forces in small diameter member the wave force is calculated according to morrison s equation 14 d f ρ s π d 2 4 c m u w c a x c d x 1 2 ρ s c d d u w x c u w x c d x where ρ s is the density of seawater c m is the inertial

acceleration perpendicular to the component axis x c is the component velocity perpendicular to the component axis and x c is the component acceleration perpendicular to the component axis 3 3 mooring system modeling the mooring system model is built by the lumped mass method and the mooring line is represented by connecting nodes and spring damping system each line is divided into i segments and i 1 nodes mooring forces and platform location are coupled in fast the mooring system model uses xyz reference frame which is consistent with the whole system of the fowt mass concentration method and force analysis are shown in fig 9 the node is subjected to gravity tension and fluid force the spring damping system is not subjected to any load the mooring dynamic equation tang et al 2009 is shown as 15a m i a i f t i f t i 1 f d i f a i w i 15b f d n i 1 2 ρ c d n d u n u n 15c f d t i 1 2 ρ c d t π d u t u t 15d f a i ρ c m v a i where m i is the mass of node i a i is the acceleration vector

is the fluid inertia force of node i w i is the gravity of node i 3 4 model verification in order to verify the effectiveness of the simulation model the natural period and the dynamic response are compared with the test data coulling et al 2013b the natural period of the floating platform is consistent with the test data as shown as in table 3 the responses of surge and pitch are in good agreement with the test data as shown in fig 10 the model is subjected to six kinds of steady winds in still water wind load is incident along the direction of surge 4 boundary condition 4 1 environmental conditions the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine are obviously affected by the wind field liang et al 2018 in order to eliminate the influence of wind shear and wind turbulence steady wind under the rated working conditions is selected the regular wave parameters are calculated to match the actual statistical data according to ref johannessen et al 2002 at first the rated wind speed u 11 4 m s was defined then wave height h can be obtained by the fitting curve finally the wave period t is determined by equation 16 16 t 4 883 2 68 h 0 529 1 0 19 u 1 764 3 426 h 0 78 1 764 3 426 h 0 78 the simulation environment parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 operation setting in order to study the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on dynamic characteristics of the fowt this paper supposes an angle β as wind wave misalignment and the wave incidence is along the x axis a limited number of wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ were considered as shown as in fig 11 the wind wave misalignments β include 0 wave and five wind directions 0 15 30 45 60 distributed clockwise as well as the yaw error γ include seven directions 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 distributed clockwise when the yaw error γ is zero the axis of the wind wheel is collinear with the wind direction when the yaw error γ is negative the axis of the wind wheel is skewed to the x axis when the yaw error γ is positive the axis of the wind wheel is skewed to the y axis 5 results for all conditions the simulation runs 1000 s the time step 0 1 s is chosen to reduce calculation time when the wind turbine is in the starting stage the power generation wind turbine motion and structural load will be changed greatly however this paper focuses on the dynamic response of the fowt under the condition of stable yaw error and wind wave misalignment therefore in order to exclude the influence of start up fluctuation on simulation results only the data of the last 500 s are selected for analysis 5 1 power generation the effective value of power generation is shown in fig 12 a the wind wave misalignment β correspond to different curves the abscissa is the yaw error γ and the ordinate is the power generation when the ordinate value of the curve is the same as the abscissa the difference is very small that is the wind wave misalignments β has little influence on the generation power which is about 1 based on the aerodynamics theory the equation for obtaining energy is shown as 17a p m 1 2 c p a w v 3 17b v a v i c o s γ where p m is the torque kinetic energy c p is the wind energy utilization coefficient a w is the area of the wind wheel v a is the axial wind speed v i is the inflow wind speed in this paper the rated wind speed is chosen and c p 0 593 is assigned the axial wind speed v a is decreased with the increase of the yaw error γ and the less wind energy can be captured the axial wind speed v a under different the yaw error γ when the wind wave misalignment β 0 is shown in fig 12 b the specific value of the power generation is shown in table 5 the power generation is varied with the yaw error γ and the power generation is decreased with the increase of the absolute value of yaw error γ when the wind wave misalignment β 30 the loss proportion can be up to 8 11 the standard deviation of power generation is shown in fig 13 a with the increase of the absolute value of the yaw error γ the generation power fluctuation increases gradually in addition the influence of wind wave misalignment β is increased with the increase of the yaw error γ which is related to the wind turbine motion the axial wind speed v a under different the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 15 is shown in fig 13 b 5 2 wind turbine motion the motion of fowt has always been the focus of discussion all over the world wei et al 2017 stewart and lackner 2014b the maximum structural motion reflects the stability of the wind turbine platform dynamic motions and nacelle vibration will be discussed in this section 5 2 1 platform dynamic motions platform dynamic motions are shown in fig 14 the surge sway roll and pitch motions of the platform are significantly influenced by the wind wave misalignment β as shown as in fig 14 a b d e the surge and pitch motions is decreased and sway and roll motions is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 14 c f the heave and yaw motion are not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ the reason is that the deepcwind floating platform belongs to the semi submersible platform the buoyancy is greater than the self weight the heave motion is not affected and the yaw motion is limited by the trisymmetric mooring system 5 2 2 nacelle vibration the vibration of the nacelle is shown in fig 15 the surge sway roll and pitch vibration of the nacelle are significantly affected by wind wave misalignment β shown in fig 15 a b d e the amplitude of surge and pitch vibration is decreased and the amplitude of sway and roll motion is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 15 c f the heave and yaw vibration are not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the vibration of the nacelle is similar as the movement of the platform dynamic motions 5 3 structure load the maximum and standard deviation of structural load are correlated with ultimate load and fatigue load kragh and hansen 2014 koukoura et al 2016 structural load is of great significance to the development in the design and verification of fowt 5 3 1 tower base loading condition the loading condition of the tower base is shown in fig 16 the roll and pitch bending moments of the tower base are significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β as shown as in fig 16 a and b the amplitude of the roll bending moment is increased and the pitch bending moment is decreased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 16 c the yaw bending moment is not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the loading condition of the tower base corresponds to the movement of the platform the maximum value of the tower base roll bending moment is shown in table 6 the roll bending moment is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 0 the rise proportion can be up to 1240 38 the equivalent fatigue load is produced by the fluctuation load of the tower base and the structure of the wind turbine will be damaged the standard deviations of the roll and pitch bending moment are shown in fig 17 a and b the roll bending moment fluctuation is increased and the pitch bending moment fluctuation is almost constant with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β the influence of yaw error γ on the standard deviation is very little 5 3 2 yaw bearing loading condition the loading condition of the yaw bearing is shown in fig 18 the roll and pitch bending moment of the yaw bearing are significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β shown in fig 18 a and b the amplitude of the roll bending moment is increased and the amplitude of the pitch bending moment is decreased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 18 c the yaw bending moment is not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the loading condition of the yaw bearing corresponds to the vibration of the nacelle the maximum value of the yaw bearing roll bending moment is shown in table 7 the roll bending moment is varied with the wind wave misalignment β and the roll bending moment is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 0 the rise proportion can be up to 732 34 the equivalent fatigue load is produced by the fluctuation load of the yaw bearing and the structure of the wind turbine will be damaged the standard deviation of the roll and pitch bending moment is shown in fig 19 a and b the roll bending moment fluctuation is decreased and the pitch bending moment fluctuation is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β the influence of yaw error γ on the standard deviation is a little 6 conclusions and future works the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt is studied in this article multiple composites of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is used to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in the different environmental conditions the discussion focuses on the power generation the wind turbine motion and the structure load the major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows 1 the yaw error has an obvious effect on power generation the efficiency and stability of the power generation are obviously affected by the yaw error when the yaw error exists the effective power is decreased and the power fluctuation is increased in addition the yaw error has a little effect on the wind turbine motion and the structure load 2 the wind wave misalignment has little effect on the power generation however the wind turbine motion and the structure load are obviously affected by the wind wave misalignment when the wind wave misalignment exists the wind turbine motion and the structure load are changed greatly 3 the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are related to the performance of the fowt so the influence of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment must be considered together to calculate the performance of fowt more realistically we are planning to consider the irregular wave as the environmental condition in the next research besides to improve the dynamic response accuracy the future research plan is based on the ref pegalajar jurado et al 2018 to establish more detailed fowt system with viscous damping author

22044,this paper is aimed to explore the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt multiple conditions of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is adopted to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in different conditions of the external environment the results reveal that the efficiency and stability of the power generation are significantly affected by the yaw error moreover the yaw error will decrease the effective power and increase the power fluctuation however the yaw error has little effects on the motion and the structural load of wind turbines in addition the wind wave misalignment also has little effects on power generation but it greatly affects the motion and the structural load of wind turbines the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are closely related to the performances of the fowt therefore it is essential to explore the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the entire wind turbine and take them into consideration in the design keywords yaw error wind wave misalignment the floating offshore wind turbine time domain analysis dynamic characteristics 1 introduction wind power is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy countries around the world are vigorously developing the wind energy industry in recent years more attention has been paid to the development of offshore wind resources yuanchuan et al 2018 onshore wind turbines are no longer applicable in the area with water depth more than 50 m therefore researchers and engineers across the world focus on the study of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt that can function in the deep offshore sites for the horizontal axis wind turbine the nacelle needs to rotate to the wind according to the shortest path to eliminate the yaw error which can improve the utilization rate of wind energy xiaoguang et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to solve the yaw steering problem and study the corresponding relationship between the wind direction and the wind wheel in fig 1 and fig 2 the red region represents the initial position of the wind wheel and the blue region represents the yaw position the wind direction and the wind wheel have two situations the angles are relative values shown as follows 1 if the angle between the wind direction and the wind wheel is less than 180 the yaw angle is expressed as 1 θ w i n d θ y a w 2 if the angle between the wind direction and wind wheel axis angle is greater than 180 the yaw angle can be expressed as 2 θ y a w 360 θ w i n d there are three reasons why the modern wind turbine is running in yaw state under most circumstances li feng 2017 firstly the natural wind has randomness the wind speed and direction change from time to time secondly when wind energy is absorbed wake effect will be produced which leads to the decrease of the yaw accuracy lastly the yaw control needs to have certain sluggishness to ensure the stable operation of the wind turbine these factors make it impossible for the wind turbine to align with the wind direction all the time as shown in fig 3 when the wind wheel deviates from the wind direction by an angle γ the yaw error is caused therefore it is of great practical value to study the influences of yaw error on the wind turbine to ensure the security of the operation and improve the power generation efficiency currently the studies of the wind turbine under the yaw error focus on the power generation and the aerodynamic characteristics jeong et al 2013 zhou and tang 2011 fadaeinedjad et al 2009 xiao guang et al 2014 has been researched but all the research object is the stationary wind turbine jeong et al 2013 established a coupled blade model including the geometric nonlinearity and analyzed the influence of the yaw error on the stability of blades zhou et al zhou and tang 2011 used the vortex column theory to establish the aerodynamic performance calculation model of a wind turbine when it was in steady yaw state roohollah et al fadaeinedjad et al 2009 used the simulation software to study the dynamic aerodynamics of the wind turbine on the wind diesel combined generation system lu et al xiao guang et al 2014 analyzed the force characteristics of blades under yaw state and studied the aerodynamic force of the wind turbines under different wind speeds however the most significant feature of the fowt is that it is carried on a floating platform with the mooring system and subject to various environmental loads compared with the stationary wind turbine the research on the fowt is insufficient and mostly focus on the condition of the wind and wave in the common direction in reality there is always a misalignment between the wind and the wave when the wind speed is high the wind and wave tend to appear small misalignment when the wind speed is small wind and waves tend to appear large misalignment according to the literature barth and eecen 2006 kuhn 2001 the misalignment of 30 is common and the probability of 60 is very low the recent research on the performance of wind turbine under wind wave misalignment focuses on the structural load and the yaw error is ignored yin et al 2017 analyzed the structural loads of blades and the yaw bearing in extreme hurricanes bachynski et al 2014 eritenel and parker 2009 researched the influence of wind wave misalignment on the tower base and found the peak value of the tower base bending moment increased yoshida et al yoshida and utsunomiya 2010 studied the variation of foundation fatigue load under wind wave misalignment and found that the longitudinal bending moment is the main factor of the fatigue load barj et al 2014 found that only considering collinearity conditions would underestimate tower base fatigue damage and suggested that the wind wave misalignment should be considered stewart et al stewart and lackner 2014a effectively reduced the fatigue load in the fore aft direction of the tower base by applying tower tuned mass damper overall the current research focuses on the impact of a single factor however the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are inevitable factors in the actual operation of the fowt this paper is aimed to study the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the fowt multiple conditions of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is adopted to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in different conditions of the external environment the discussion focuses on the power generation the wind turbine motion and the structure load 2

mooring line to the floating body 3 1 aerodynamic modeling the aerodynamic calculation is to study the aerodynamic characteristics of wind turbines in steady yaw state by using the blade element momentum method bem it has a basic assumption the force acting on the blade element is only related to the momentum change of the airflow passing through the blade element sweeping ring the schematic diagram of the sweeping ring and the blade element are as shown as in fig 7 according to the blade element theory it is assumed that the number of blades is n the radius of the wind wheel is r the chord length of the blade element is c the yaw error is γ the wind speed is u the air density is ρ a the angular velocity of the wind wheel is ω the initial values of both axial induction factor a and tangential induction factor a are zero the inflow angle r of the blade element at the radius r is expressed as 4a sin r u 1 a w c o s r ω r 1 a w 4b w u 2 1 a 2 ω 2 r 2 1 a 2 the axial thrust δ t b on the blade element scanning ring can be calculated in proportion is expressed as 5a δ t b 1 2 ρ a w 2 σ r c x r δ r δ ψ where 5b c x c l c o s r c d s i n r 5c σ r n c 2 π r for the given blade element position μ and the azimuth ψ the radial thickness is δ r the wind wheel rotation angle is δ ψ and the wake inclination angle is χ the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are obtained from the airfoil data considering the yaw error and prandtl tip loss the momentum change rate of blade element is expressed as 6 δ t m 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 a c o s γ t a n χ 2 s i n γ a s e c 2 χ 2 r δ r δ ψ the expression of blade element momentum relative to the wake axis is expressed as 7a δ m b 1 2 ρ a w 2 n c c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ r δ r δ ψ 2 π where 7b c y c l s i n r c d c o s r by applying the momentum theorem to the entire sweeping ring the distribution of the axial induction factor with the change of radius can be obtained to solve the momentum change rate of the entire sweeping ring integral must be performed along the ring the axial momentum is expressed as 8 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 α cos γ tan x 2 sin γ α s e c 2 x 2 r δ r d ψ 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a w 2 σ r c x r δ r d ψ therefore it is 9 8 π a c o s γ t a n χ 2 s i n γ a s e c 2 χ 2 σ r 0 2 π w 2 u 2 c x d ψ the rate of change of angular momentum is expressed as 10 δ m m 1 2 ρ a u 2 λ μ n 4 a c o s γ a c o s 2 ψ c o s 2 x s i n 2 ψ r 2 δ ψ δ r integrating along the ring is expressed as 11 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a u 2 λ μ 4 a c o s γ a c o s 2 ψ c o s 2 x s i n 2 ψ r 2 δ r d ψ 0 2 π 1 2 ρ a w 2 n c c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ r δ r d ψ 2 π after the simplification 12 σ r 0 2 π w 2 u 2 c y c o s χ c x c o s ψ s i n χ d ψ the integral values in equations 9 and 12 can be determined and the solution can be obtained through multiple iterations the integral can be calculated after given the position μ of the scanning ring the calculation value of a can be solved by equation 9 and the calculation value of a can be solved by equation 12 the same sweeping ring is iterated repeatedly until a satisfactory convergence effect is achieved before moving to the next one this is the blade element momentum method for steady yaw state li feng 2017 3 2 hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic model is based on the potential flow theory which assumes that the fluid meets the conditions of non viscosity non rotation and incompressibility fast calculates the hydrodynamic parameters in the frequency domain and then converts the hydrodynamic parameters into time domain parameters which served as the boundary conditions for simulation calculation fast s hydrodynamic model receives motion parameters at each time step and these motion parameters are returned to the whole model for the next calculation the structural division of the deepcwind submersible platform as shown as in fig 8 the potential flow theory is used to solve wave forces in large diameter member wamit module coupled in fast is used to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficient in the frequency domain according to the potential flow solution the velocity potential v is decomposed into the incident potential i the diffraction potential d and the radiation potential r the incident potential i is expressed as 13 i i g a c o s h k z d ω c o s h k d e k x c o s β w y s i n β w where g is the gravitational acceleration a is the amplitude of the wave k is the wave number d is the water depth d is the diameter of the component and β w is the wave direction angle in order to obtain the velocity potential at each node d and r are solved by the boundary element method based on the linear bernoulli equation the wave force on the structure is calculated hantang et al 2013 the strip theory solution is used to solve wave forces in small diameter member the wave force is calculated according to morrison s equation 14 d f ρ s π d 2 4 c m u w c a x c d x 1 2 ρ s c d d u w x c u w x c d x where ρ s is the density of seawater c m is the inertial

system modeling the mooring system model is built by the lumped mass method and the mooring line is represented by connecting nodes and spring damping system each line is divided into i segments and i 1 nodes mooring forces and platform location are coupled in fast the mooring system model uses xyz reference frame which is consistent with the whole system of the fowt mass concentration method and force analysis are shown in fig 9 the node is subjected to gravity tension and fluid force the spring damping system is not subjected to any load the mooring dynamic equation tang et al 2009 is shown as 15a m i a i f t i f t i 1 f d i f a i w i 15b f d n i 1 2 ρ c d n d u n u n 15c f d t i 1 2 ρ c d t π d u t u t 15d f a i ρ c m v a i where m i is the mass of node i a i is the acceleration vector

is the fluid inertia force of node i w i is the gravity of node i 3 4 model verification in order to verify the effectiveness of the simulation model the natural period and the dynamic response are compared with the test data coulling et al 2013b the natural period of the floating platform is consistent with the test data as shown as in table 3 the responses of surge and pitch are in good agreement with the test data as shown in fig 10 the model is subjected to six kinds of steady winds in still water wind load is incident along the direction of surge 4 boundary condition 4 1 environmental conditions the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine are obviously affected by the wind field liang et al 2018 in order to eliminate the influence of wind shear and wind turbulence steady wind under the rated working conditions is selected the regular wave parameters are calculated to match the actual statistical data according to ref johannessen et al 2002 at first the rated wind speed u 11 4 m s was defined then wave height h can be obtained by the fitting curve finally the wave period t is determined by equation 16 16 t 4 883 2 68 h 0 529 1 0 19 u 1 764 3 426 h 0 78 1 764 3 426 h 0 78 the simulation environment parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 operation setting in order to study the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on dynamic characteristics of the fowt this paper supposes an angle β as wind wave misalignment and the wave incidence is along the x axis a limited number of wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ were considered as shown as in fig 11 the wind wave misalignments β include 0 wave and five wind directions 0 15 30 45 60 distributed clockwise as well as the yaw error γ include seven directions 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 distributed clockwise when the yaw error γ is zero the axis of the wind wheel is collinear with the wind direction when the yaw error γ is negative the axis of the wind wheel is skewed to the x axis when the yaw error γ is positive the axis of the wind wheel is skewed to the y axis 5 results for all conditions the simulation runs 1000 s the time step 0 1 s is chosen to reduce calculation time when the wind turbine is in the starting stage the power generation wind turbine motion and structural load will be changed greatly however this paper focuses on the dynamic response of the fowt under the condition of stable yaw error and wind wave misalignment therefore in order to exclude the influence of start up fluctuation on simulation results only the data of the last 500 s are selected for analysis 5 1 power generation the effective value of power generation is shown in fig 12 a the wind wave misalignment β correspond to different curves the abscissa is the yaw error γ and the ordinate is the power generation when the ordinate value of the curve is the same as the abscissa the difference is very small that is the wind wave misalignments β has little influence on the generation power which is about 1 based on the aerodynamics theory the equation for obtaining energy is shown as 17a p m 1 2 c p a w v 3 17b v a v i c o s γ where p m is the torque kinetic energy c p is the wind energy utilization coefficient a w is the area of the wind wheel v a is the axial wind speed v i is the inflow wind speed in this paper the rated wind speed is chosen and c p 0 593 is assigned the axial wind speed v a is decreased with the increase of the yaw error γ and the less wind energy can be captured the axial wind speed v a under different the yaw error γ when the wind wave misalignment β 0 is shown in fig 12 b the specific value of the power generation is shown in table 5 the power generation is varied with the yaw error γ and the power generation is decreased with the increase of the absolute value of yaw error γ when the wind wave misalignment β 30 the loss proportion can be up to 8 11 the standard deviation of power generation is shown in fig 13 a with the increase of the absolute value of the yaw error γ the generation power fluctuation increases gradually in addition the influence of wind wave misalignment β is increased with the increase of the yaw error γ which is related to the wind turbine motion the axial wind speed v a under different the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 15 is shown in fig 13 b 5 2 wind turbine motion the motion of fowt has always been the focus of discussion all over the world wei et al 2017 stewart and lackner 2014b the maximum structural motion reflects the stability of the wind turbine platform dynamic motions and nacelle vibration will be discussed in this section 5 2 1 platform dynamic motions platform dynamic motions are shown in fig 14 the surge sway roll and pitch motions of the platform are significantly influenced by the wind wave misalignment β as shown as in fig 14 a b d e the surge and pitch motions is decreased and sway and roll motions is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 14 c f the heave and yaw motion are not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ the reason is that the deepcwind floating platform belongs to the semi submersible platform the buoyancy is greater than the self weight the heave motion is not affected and the yaw motion is limited by the trisymmetric mooring system 5 2 2 nacelle vibration the vibration of the nacelle is shown in fig 15 the surge sway roll and pitch vibration of the nacelle are significantly affected by wind wave misalignment β shown in fig 15 a b d e the amplitude of surge and pitch vibration is decreased and the amplitude of sway and roll motion is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 15 c f the heave and yaw vibration are not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the vibration of the nacelle is similar as the movement of the platform dynamic motions 5 3 structure load the maximum and standard deviation of structural load are correlated with ultimate load and fatigue load kragh and hansen 2014 koukoura et al 2016 structural load is of great significance to the development in the design and verification of fowt 5 3 1 tower base loading condition the loading condition of the tower base is shown in fig 16 the roll and pitch bending moments of the tower base are significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β as shown as in fig 16 a and b the amplitude of the roll bending moment is increased and the pitch bending moment is decreased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 16 c the yaw bending moment is not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the loading condition of the tower base corresponds to the movement of the platform the maximum value of the tower base roll bending moment is shown in table 6 the roll bending moment is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 0 the rise proportion can be up to 1240 38 the equivalent fatigue load is produced by the fluctuation load of the tower base and the structure of the wind turbine will be damaged the standard deviations of the roll and pitch bending moment are shown in fig 17 a and b the roll bending moment fluctuation is increased and the pitch bending moment fluctuation is almost constant with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β the influence of yaw error γ on the standard deviation is very little 5 3 2 yaw bearing loading condition the loading condition of the yaw bearing is shown in fig 18 the roll and pitch bending moment of the yaw bearing are significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β shown in fig 18 a and b the amplitude of the roll bending moment is increased and the amplitude of the pitch bending moment is decreased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ is negative that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the x axis and the variation trend is weakened when the yaw error γ is positive that is the axis of the wind wheel is biased to the y axis and the variation trend is strengthened the wind wave misalignment β is the main influencing factor and the yaw error γ is the minor factor however as shown in fig 18 c the yaw bending moment is not significantly affected by the wind wave misalignment β and the yaw error γ in conclusion the loading condition of the yaw bearing corresponds to the vibration of the nacelle the maximum value of the yaw bearing roll bending moment is shown in table 7 the roll bending moment is varied with the wind wave misalignment β and the roll bending moment is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β when the yaw error γ 0 the rise proportion can be up to 732 34 the equivalent fatigue load is produced by the fluctuation load of the yaw bearing and the structure of the wind turbine will be damaged the standard deviation of the roll and pitch bending moment is shown in fig 19 a and b the roll bending moment fluctuation is decreased and the pitch bending moment fluctuation is increased with the increase of the wind wave misalignment β the influence of yaw error γ on the standard deviation is a little 6 conclusions and future works the effects of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt is studied in this article multiple composites of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are generated the time domain software fast is used to assess the reliability and safety of the fowt in the different environmental conditions the discussion focuses on the power generation the wind turbine motion and the structure load the major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows 1 the yaw error has an obvious effect on power generation the efficiency and stability of the power generation are obviously affected by the yaw error when the yaw error exists the effective power is decreased and the power fluctuation is increased in addition the yaw error has a little effect on the wind turbine motion and the structure load 2 the wind wave misalignment has little effect on the power generation however the wind turbine motion and the structure load are obviously affected by the wind wave misalignment when the wind wave misalignment exists the wind turbine motion and the structure load are changed greatly 3 the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment are related to the performance of the fowt so the influence of the yaw error and the wind wave misalignment must be considered together to calculate the performance of fowt more realistically we are planning to consider the irregular wave as the environmental condition in the next research besides to improve the dynamic response accuracy the future research plan is based on the ref pegalajar jurado et al 2018 to establish more detailed fowt system with viscous damping author
