19475,many pathogens can enter into a viable but nonculturable vbnc state in response to harsh environmental stresses bacteria in this state can retain certain features of viable cells such as cellular integrity metabolic activity or virulence and may present health risks associated with drinking water in this study we investigated the ability of chlorination and chloramination which are widely used methods to disinfect drinking water to induce escherichia coli into a vbnc state after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mg l the counts of culturable e coli cells decreased from 106 cfu ml to 0 cfu ml at 5 60 min post treatment meanwhile viable cell counts were still approximately 103 105 cells ml these viable e coli cells may be induced into a vbnc state by chlorination and chloramination scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy showed that some bacteria maintained cellular integrity but the average length of vbnc cells was less than that of culturable cells respiratory activity of vbnc cells decreased approximately 50 relative to that of culturable cells we also used heavy water d2o combined with raman microspectroscopy to show that e coli in a vbnc state retained metabolic activity involving water e g condensation reactions at the single cell level furthermore soxr gada and katg genes remained highly expressed suggesting that vbnc cells were physiologically active finally resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chlorine in luria bertani lb broth was identified by calculating the generation time results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the health risks associated with vbnc bacteria and the development of more effective strategies for drinking water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination chloramination vbnc induction resuscitation 1 introductionc the presence of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water treatment systems can greatly impact human health heterotrophic plate counts hpc are used routinely by water utilities to monitor bacteria in drinking water chowdhury 2012 this method enumerates various heterotrophic bacteria that can be cultivated on nutrient rich media under defined incubation conditions the rationale behind the use of these methods is that the viable bacteria are culturable and the culturability of the bacteria represents their viability zhang et al 2015 however many bacteria including campylobacter spp thomas et al 2001 escherichia coli zhang et al 2015 francisella noatunensis colquhoun and duodu 2011 legionella pneumophila marinelli et al 2017 listeria monocytogenes gurresch et al 2016 mycobacterium tuberculosis shleeva et al 2004 pseudomonas aeruginosa chen et al 2017 shigella spp orruno et al 2017 and v vulnificus yoon et al 2017 responding to environmental stresses such as antibiotic pressure high low temperature starvation a change in ph are known to enter into a viable but nonculturable vbnc state ayrapetyan and oliver 2016 oliver 2010 in a vbnc state cells remain viable but they are no longer culturable with standard culturing method and can retain certain features of viable cells such as cellular integrity metabolic activity or virulence liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 it is noted that most of the bacteria in the environment are in the vbnc state and have never been cultivated yet however in the sense of hygienically relevant microorganisms the definition is restricted to species which do not grow any more on the media and conditions usually employed for their detection they are formerly culturable and thus evade the hygienic surveillance oliver 2005 vbnc bacteria in drinking water present a potential health risk because their occurrence can lead to an underestimate of total viable bacterial cell counts many disinfectants in use to eradicate pathogenic bacteria in drinking water are inducers of a vbnc state in bacteria for instance zhang et al 2015 reported that ultraviolet uv disinfection could induce e coli and p aeruginosa into a vbnc state liu et al 2009 induced culturable e coli o157 h7 cells into a vbnc state with chloraminating tap water turetgen 2008 showed that vbnc legionella pneumophila cells obtained by monochloramine treatment were still able to synthesize proteins some of which were associated with virulence in addition ozone had been reported to induce bacteria into a vbnc state orta et al 2017 chlorination and chloramination are the disinfection methods most commonly used by water suppliers ma and bibby 2017 chlorine can disrupt a variety of subcellular components and metabolic processes including protein synthesis in spite of a slower bactericidal rate chloramine is more stable than chlorine which means residual chloramine can persist longer than residual chlorine in a water distribution system alleron et al 2008 although chlorination and chloramination can induce bacteria into a vbnc state there is little information on the physiology biochemistry and genetics of cells that enter into this state in addition vbnc bacteria could recover culturability in appropriate conditions for instance resuscitation of e coli and p aeruginosa in a vbnc state can be observed by incubating in lb broth at 37 c after uv treatment zhang et al 2015 e coli o157 h7 in a vbnc state induced by high pressure co2 treatment was resuscitated when incubated in tryptic soy broth at 37 c zhao et al 2013 with a temperature upshift v vulnificus was resuscitated from a vbnc state induced by low temperature nilsson et al 1991 shigella flexneri was converted to a culturable state by co culture with selected eukaryotic cells senoh et al 2012 however whether vbnc bacteria induced by chlorination and chloramination can be resuscitated and whether their physiological characteristics can be retained are unknown in general there are still few researches about the induction of bacteria into vbnc state by chlorine and chloramine disinfection in drinking water treatment it is necessary to study the following questions 1 determination of whether chlorine and chloramine at different doses can induce e coli into vbnc state 2 quantifying the physiological and biochemical characteristics of vbnc bacteria 3 whether vbnc e coli induced by chlorine and chloramine can resuscitate at appropriate conditions to understand the above three questions the following methods have been used the morphology respiratory activity metabolic activity and gene expression of vbnc bacteria were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 5 cyano 2 3 ditoyl tetrazolium chloride flow cytometric measurements ctc fcm leonard et al 2016 confocal raman microspectroscopy and reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr respectively a comparison of generation time between resuscitation and regrowth bacteria was used to examine whether true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurs this is the first report on the resuscitation of chlorination and chloramination induced vbnc bacteria in moderate nutrient and temperature conditions our findings indicate that the potential risks caused by vbnc cells that are induced by chlorine and chloramine in drinking water treatment systems 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and culture conditions e coli cmcc 44103 was obtained from the guangdong microbiology culture center guangdong china a pure culture of e coli incubated in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c for 10 h with shaking at 180 r min ten milliliters of the logarithmic phase cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 5000 r min for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with sterile nacl 0 9 solution 2 2 chlorine and chloramine disinfection hypochlorite solutions were prepared from a sodium hypochlorite naclo commercial solution a stock solution of chlorine was performed using a naclo aqueous solution at a dose of 3 free chlorine chloramine solutions were prepared by adding 300 mg l naclo to 4 mm nahco3 and 300 mg l nh4 2so4 concentrations were determined using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and expressed in milligrams of free chlorine equivalent per liter apha 2005 the cells described above were resuspended and diluted in 10 ml of the sterile nacl solution 0 9 to obtain an initial concentration of approximately 106 cfu ml naclo aqueous solution was added to the suspension to achieve the target initial disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l at predetermined time points of 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h 24 h the samples were taken and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine the bacteria characteristics e g morphology respiratory activity of samples treated with chlorine for 0 5 h and treated with chloramine for 2 h at various initial concentrations were analyzed 2 3 culturable cell counting the quantities of culturable bacteria were determined by heterotrophic plate counts hpc after chlorine and chloramine disinfection sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine and 100 μl from each dilution was evenly spread on nutrient agar na plates raffi et al 2008 the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h before colony forming units were counted 2 4 total viable and vbnc cell counting total and viable cell counts were investigated using the flow cytometer millipore guava easycyte usa with two different fluorescent dyes the first dye applied was sybr green i which binds to dna and emits green fluorescence the other dye used was ctc which is readily reduced to an insoluble red fluorescent dye and then accumulates intracellularly with formazan during bacterial respiration total and viable cell counts were determined by single staining with sybr green i and ctc respectively e coli suspensions of 198 μl were collected in a 1 5 ml tube two microliters of fluorescent dye was added to each sample the final sybr green i used was diluted 104 from the original stock and analyzed after 20 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature the final ctc used was 2 mmol and analyzed after 3 h of incubation in the dark at 37 c gasol and aristegui 2007 the gating strategy for sybr green i and ctc stained cells is shown in fig s1 vbnc cell counts were calculated as the difference between viable and culturable cell counts 2 5 resuscitation assay ten milliliters of e coli suspension in a 50 ml centrifuge tube was treated with chlorine and chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively to ensure that the culturable cell counts were 0 cfu ml then sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine the 10 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml was added to 10 ml of sterile lb broth and incubated at 37 c for 32 h with shaking at 180 r min one hundred microliter samples were removed at hourly intervals and plated onto na to determine the time required for the appearance of colonies culturability of the bacteria in these samples was determined by plating samples on na at 37 c for 24 h and then counting colonies twenty independent experiments were performed and all counts were performed in triplicate the principle of this method is that if the generation time of cells is far more below 20 min which control e coli cells require resuscitation has occurred 2 6 characteristics of vbnc and culturable bacterium 2 6 1 morphological observations sem was used to observe the morphology of e coli after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at different initial concentrations for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively logarithmic phase control and treated cells were resuspended in 0 9 nacl solution and then centrifuged at 8000 r min for 15 min the pellets were fixed initially in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 37 c for 12 h then the cells were centrifuged at 8000 r min for 10 min rinsed in pbs two times further dehydrated for 15 min in a list of cold ethanol solutions 30 50 70 90 100 the cells were then lyophilized and coated with gold palladium samples were observed and photomicrograph obtained under a hitachi s 4800 scanning electron microscope hitachi instruments inc japan 2 6 2 identification of intact membrane bacteria using clsm live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen carlsbad ca was used to distinguish intact from membrane permeabilized cells using a clsm lsm710 zeiss jena german the baclight solution was a mixture of equal volumes of 0 134 μm syto9 green fluorescence and 2 μm pi red fluorescence in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the intensities of syto 9 and pi were monitored at 480 500 nm and 488 617 nm respectively syto 9 stained all cells green whereas only dead cells were stained red with pi after chlorine and chloramine disinfection samples were enriched 500 times by centrifugation at 8000 r min for 15 min adjusting the e coli suspensions from 106 cells ml live and dead to 1 108 cells ml then 199 μl of e coli suspension was added to 1 μl of the mixture of reagents followed by incubation in the dark at room temperature for 20 min after staining 20 μl of each suspension was mounted on a microscope slide with immersion oil and then covered with a coverglass then the samples were observed under a clsm 2 6 3 determination of respiratory activity in vbnc cells ctc fluorescence intensity was used to indicate differences in respiratory activity between culturable and vbnc cells intensities were determined by calculating the average florescence intensity per cell the average amount of respiration when the cells were subjected to flow cytometry as described above 2 6 4 determination of single cell activity using confocal raman microspectroscopy and spectral processing after chlorine and chloramine treatment for 0 5 and 2 h at 4 mg l 1 ml of lb medium and 2 ml of d2o were added to each 1 ml culture and incubated at 37 c for 24 h to achieve a heavy water of approximately 50 then one hundred microliters of each bacterial sample were plated onto na in triplicate samples were washed three times with ultrapure water thermo scientific to remove the lb medium and spotted on aluminum coated slides single microbial cell spectra were acquired using a labram aramis horiba jobin yvon french confocal raman microspectroscopy spectra in the range of 300 3300 cm 1 were acquired to quantify the degree of d substitution in c h bonds the metric d d h was defined as the integrated spectral intensity of the c d 2040 2300 signature region as a percentage of the integrated spectral intensity of both the c d 2040 2300 and c h 2800 3100 signature regions 2 6 5 gene expression level determination using rt qpcr rna samples were first treated with rnase free dnase i to remove dna contaminants mrna was extracted and transcribed to cdna using superscript iii reverse transcriptase invitrogen according to the manufacturer s protocol the cdna was used for the rt qpcr analysis specific primers were designed according to the corresponding sequences in the genome of e coli using primer3 http primer3 ut ee table s1 the qpcrs were performed in triplicate using gene specific primers and a power sybr green pcr kit applied biosystems samples were run in a 96 well reaction plate on an abi q6 real time pcr system applied biosystems the qpcr program consisted of a 30 s denaturation at 94 c followed by 40 cycles of 94 c for 5 s and a final annealing step at 60 c for 40 s the normalized fold changes in the relative expression ratio were calculated using the 2 δδct method zhang et al 2018 2 7 statistical analysis total viable and culturable cell counts were log10 transformed means and standard deviation sd were calculated for triplicates differences between variables were tested for significance using an one way analysis of variance anova differences were considered significant if p 0 05 statistical analyses were performed using matlab version r2016a the length of e coli was analysed by using three hypothesis tests jarque bera kolmogorov smirnov and chi square test 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of chlorine and chloramine treatment on the culturability and viability of e coli e coli cells were exposed to the disinfectants at various concentrations chlorination and chloramination effectively decreased the culturable cell counts of e coli figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 at concentrations of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l free chlorine the culturable cell counts of e coli decreased from 106 cfu ml to 0 cfu ml at 120 60 30 5 and 5 min respectively however viable cell counts were still approximately 103 105 cells ml at the same time points with an increase of disinfectant dose the time required to enter into a vbnc state decreased for example 60 min was needed to reduce the culturable cell counts to 0 cfu ml at a dose of 1 mg l of chlorine but only 5 min was required at 4 mg l even with longer exposure times 24 h viable e coli cell counts were not significantly reduced moreover total cell counts generally remained constant with 24 h of exposure to 0 5 1 and 2 mg l free chlorine only with 3 and 4 mg l of chlorine an obvious decline in total cell counts was detected after a period of exposure some of the cells were disrupted with a high dose of chlorine and then released the intracellular material including cellular dna simon et al 2014 which decreased the total cell number in contrast with the results of chlorination longer contact time was needed with chloramination to decrease culturable and viable cell counts with choramination 15 min of contact time was required to decrease culturable cell counts to 0 cfu ml at a dose of 4 mg l compared with chlorine chloramine could induce more e coli into a vbnc state these results indicated that chlorination and chloramination can induce e coli cells into a vbnc state meaning that a part of the treated cells were not dead rather they had lost culturability but maintained low levels of respiratory activity a similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2009 whose results showed induction of e coli o157 h7 into a vbnc state with 0 7 mg l monochloramine and 1 5 mg l total chloramine kong et al 2015 showed that most bacteria entered into a vbnc state after treatment with chlorine at a dose of 0 12 mg l however they used very low doses of disinfectants to induce bacteria into a vbnc state in our study the doses of disinfectants 0 5 4 mg l were closer to those used in actual situations 3 2 resuscitation of vbnc cells after induction of e coli into a vbnc state by chlorine and the addition of lb broth culturable cell counts were 0 cfu ml for periods of up to 20 h then reached approximately 103 cfu ml at 21 h 24 h 27 h and 28 h in different four batches fig 3 if it is the regrowth of surviving culturable cells generation time should be approximately 6 min and e coli division rate should be more than 10 generations during 1 h period in fact the generation time of control e coli cells is about 20 min fig s2 the abnormal generation time observed here is attributable to the resuscitation of vbnc cells rather than the regrowth of undetected culturable cells in contrast there was no cell growth in the remaining 16 batches this shows that occurrence of resuscitation is a certain probability in previous studies various approaches were used to examine whether true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurs however whether the appearance of culturable cells was the result of true resuscitation of vbnc cells present as opposed to regrowth of a few undetected culturable cells was not determined in these studies bogosian et al 2000 zhang et al 2015 in our study we used the highest dose of disinfectant 4 mg l to eliminate culturable bacteria to the maximum extent and resuscitation was concluded based on the difference between the normal generation time of e coli and the generation time observed in our study these results suggest that true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurred whitesides and oliver 1997 but no culturable cells appeared at 48 h with 4 mg l of chloramine treatment for 2 h although resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chloramine was not observed in this study this does not mean that the vbnc cells could not be resuscitated it is important to note that for resuscitation a nutrient rich media medium is the preferential stimulus in fact there are many other methods to resuscitate vbnc cells such as temperature upshift presence of sodium pyruvate autoinducers amino acids use of host cells and co culture with amoeba v vulnificus was induced into vbnc state with temperatures of 10 c and a temperature upshift was enough to make them recover from the vbnc state nilsson et al 1991 other studies have reported that sodium pyruvate is the key molecule in the resuscitation process of salmonella enteritidis sodium pyruvate repairs the biosynthesis of dna and proteins thus transforming the vbnc state to a culturable state morishige et al 2013 liu et al 2009 found that e coli could be resuscitated with ai 2 a autoinducer produced during biofilm formation in a serum based medium pinto et al 2011 investigated the ability of vbnc e coli to resuscitate with different amino acids their study suggested that a combination of glutamine threonine leucine and methionine would be able to facilitate resuscitation for legionella pneumophila many studies demonstrated co incubation of the vbnc cells with the amoeba is a very effective method steinert et al 1997 other resuscitation conditions include inoculation into yolk sacs of embryonated eggs into mice and into human volunteers oliver 2010 maybe the resuscitation method used in this study was not suitable to recover the culturability of cells induced into a vbnc state by chloramination the results presented here are important for consideration of the biological safety of drinking water the resuscitation conditions 37 c nutrient rich used in our experiments were similar to those in the human body if a person ingests vbnc cells and the cells can recover culturability vbnc bacteria induced by chlorination present potential health risk 3 3 differences in characteristics of the bacterium between states 3 3 1 morphologies of culturable and vbnc e coli cells morphological characteristics of culturable logarithmic phase and vbnc cells were determined by using sem fig 4 e coli cells treated with chlorine and chloramine showed cell wall and membrane damage notably damage in the cell membrane indicated that chlorine and chloramine reacted with various cellular components and directly disintegrated this protective layer phe et al 2005 cell death resulting from chlorine or chloramine disinfection was a surface damage at first before entering into cells resulting in intracellular damage however a number of bacteria maintained intact cell structure as shown in fig 5 green fluorescence represents intact cell membrane whereas red fluorescence represents cell membrane damage with an increase in disinfectant dose more serious cell membrane damage and greater red fluorescence were observed bacteria with intact cell membrane after chlorine and chloramine treatment might be vbnc cells in addition to the damage of bacterial surfaces the length of the bacteria changed after chlorine and chloramine treatment the average length of culturable cells was 1 20 μm whereas cells treated by 4 mg l chlorine and chloramine were approximately 1 06 μm p 0 05 and 1 15 μm p 0 05 in length respectively fig s4 furthermore we determined the distributions of bacterial length after chlorine and chloramine treatment fig s3 and table s2 lengths of control cells were normally distribution after chlorine and chloramine disinfection however the lengths of e coli cells did not conform to a normal distribution table s3 rather they showed a lognormal or gamma distribution indicating that these bacteria became shorter in their new state 3 3 2 respiratory activity of vbnc cells respiratory activity was measured in culturable and vbnc cells by ctc fcm after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively fig 6 the vbnc bacteria even maintained a certain level of respiratory activity approximately 50 of the control with chlorine and chloramine doses as high as 4 mg l ctc fcm results indicated that chlorine and chloramine are capable of decreasing the respiratory activity of e coli 2 mg l of disinfectant appears to be the threshold concentration with the respiratory activity plateauing at a minimum after 2 mg l these results indicated that chlorine and chloramine disinfection could significantly impact the electron transport process of bacteria p 0 05 this low cellular respiratory activity implied a decrease of exchange of materials and energy with the extracellular environment lin et al 2017 energy for basic metabolic activity of vbnc cells should be guaranteed in the first place and then little energy remaining could be used to assimilate various organic compounds from the environment fewer substrates therefore are needed from the environment which allows bacteria to survive starvation as well as chlorine and chloramine disinfection by taking up less chlorine and chloramine into intercellular haas and engelbrecht 1980 results from a similar experiment showed that h2o2 treated cells in a vbnc state retained their activity at approximately 70 that of the control morishige et al 2013 3 3 3 raman microspectroscopy reveals metabolic activity in single vbnc cells metabolic activity is essential to the viability of bacteria including those in a vbnc state previously we measured respiratory activity of bacteria by ctc fcm and then we measured water related metabolic activity to understand these aspects of bacterial metabolism berry et al 2015 in this study we used a technique that allows the nondestructive measurement of bacterial water related metabolic activity at the single cell level cells were amended with heavy water d2o 50 vol vol which does not affect bacterial growth berry et al 2015 after incubation viable cells were identified by measuring cellular d incorporation by raman microspectroscopy using this approach we characterized the metabolic activity of e coli in a vbnc state fig 7 we examined the raman spectra of 45 cells from each sample as shown in fig 7 a broad peak appeared in a region between 2040 and 2300 cm 1 that typically has detectable c d peaks in the raman spectra of d2o labeled e coli cells that were not treated with disinfectants positive control in contrast there were no detectable c d peaks in the raman spectra of non deuterium labeled e coli cells negative control this spectral pattern shows that c d substituted c h for the synthesis of macromolecular substances under the heavy water and it is safe to assume that one of the important components of intake d is lipids damoglou and dawes 1986 d will also be incorporated to some extent via other processes such as amino acid and carbohydrate biosynthesis fischer et al 2013 justice et al 2014 and d incorporation indicated that these cells were active c d peaks were also detected from two cells after disinfection with chlorine or chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 and 2 h respectively meanwhile the number of culturable bacteria after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 and 2 h was 0 cfu ml therefore the four cells with c d peaks detected were in a vbnc state furthermore we calculated the percentage of d h d to reflect the metabolic activity of vbnc bacteria and culturable bacteria the average percentages of vbnc bacteria treated with chlorine and chloramine were 9 1 p 0 05 and 12 2 p 0 05 respectively whereas normal culturable bacteria had a value of 14 6 this indicates that the water related metabolic activity of e coli in a vbnc state was reduced in addition we observed the changes of bacteria after chlorine and chloramine treatment by raman spectroscopy without d2o labeling fig s5 a shows the resulting free labeled raman spectra for each of the bacteria that were untreated and treated with chlorine and chloramine table s4 provides an overview of the observed raman bands of the investigated bacterial cells the intensity of ch 3 066 cm 1 ch2 720 cm 1 and ch2 ch3 2 935 cm 1 bands decreased after chlorine disinfection indicating that these bonds were oxidized in bacteria in contrast these bands did not change significantly after chloramine disinfection the characteristic peaks of amide i 1665 cm 1 and amide iii 1240 cm 1 in proteins almost disappeared and chlorine destroyed protein structure but there was almost no change in these peaks after chloramine treatment the nucleic acid peak 1094 cm 1 indicates that the phosphodiester bonds in the dna backbone and the characteristic peak intensity after the chlorine disinfection were weakened whereas the characteristic peaks of the bases a and g 1575 cm 1 were not weakened indicating that the dna was cut into fragments rather than base pairs being affected fig s5 b shows a three dimensional score plot of the principal component analysis for different disinfection methods which are represented by dots of different colors e coli without chlorine or chloramine disinfection is shown in blue e coli with chlorine disinfection is shown in red and e coli with chloramine disinfection is shown in green chloramine disinfected bacteria clustered with the control bacteria whereas chlorine disinfected bacteria were distinct this is consistent with the results shown in fig s5 a 3 3 4 gene transcript levels to investigate the response of e coli genes to chlorine and chloramine exposure rrna and selected mrna expression levels served as indicators of physiological activity and cellular viability of vbnc bacteria as shown in fig 8 nucleotide sequences of the gapa gene which encodes the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase decreased slightly in response to chlorine and chloramine treatment suggesting that vbnc e coli could maintain basic cellular function chlorine p 0 062 chloramine p 0 081 in contrast soxr in the superoxide regulon p 0 05 and katg in the oxyr regulon were both significantly upregulated p 0 05 it shows that e coli has activated antioxidant defense genes in response to oxidative disinfectants moreover expression of the major stress factor rpos also increased significantly p 0 05 this is consistent with the findings of boaretti et al 2003 who reported that rpos was associated with e coli in a vbnc state the glutamate decarboxylase gad system is associated with the bacteria s ability to tolerate extreme acid conditions biase et al 1999 the gada genes can be used as an indicator of the potential virulence of bacteria in acidic environments such as the human stomach zhang et al 2015 gad is encoded by gada which was expressed continuously in vbnc e coli p 0 05 4 conclusions e coli could be induced into the vbnc state after treat with chlorine and chloramine however routine method of hpc could not be used to detect the presence of vbnc bacteria because it would lead to an underestimation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the drinking water post distribution the combination of hpc and ctc fcm methods is recommended to determine the vbnc cell counts vbnc e coli induced by chlorine and chloramine can retain cellular integrity but these cells become shorter respiratory and water related metabolic activity are maintained at a lower level after treatment with chlorine and chloramine soxr and katg genes remained highly expressed suggesting that e coli responds to oxidant stress by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes meanwhile the expression of gapa the pathogenic gene indicates that vbnc e coli may be potentially primed for pathogenicity resuscitation experiments show that e coli in a chlorine induced vbnc state can resuscitate in lb at 37 c which has not been recognized previously however resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chloramine was not observed in this study it is important to emphasize that failing of resuscitation does not mean that the cells cannot be resuscitated in principle before suitable methods have been found resuscitation of vbnc e coli may pose a potential health risk our study indicates the potential health risk posed by e coli in a vbnc state after chlorine and chloramine disinfection therefore

19475,many pathogens can enter into a viable but nonculturable vbnc state in response to harsh environmental stresses bacteria in this state can retain certain features of viable cells such as cellular integrity metabolic activity or virulence and may present health risks associated with drinking water in this study we investigated the ability of chlorination and chloramination which are widely used methods to disinfect drinking water to induce escherichia coli into a vbnc state after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mg l the counts of culturable e coli cells decreased from 106 cfu ml to 0 cfu ml at 5 60 min post treatment meanwhile viable cell counts were still approximately 103 105 cells ml these viable e coli cells may be induced into a vbnc state by chlorination and chloramination scanning electron microscopy and laser confocal microscopy showed that some bacteria maintained cellular integrity but the average length of vbnc cells was less than that of culturable cells respiratory activity of vbnc cells decreased approximately 50 relative to that of culturable cells we also used heavy water d2o combined with raman microspectroscopy to show that e coli in a vbnc state retained metabolic activity involving water e g condensation reactions at the single cell level furthermore soxr gada and katg genes remained highly expressed suggesting that vbnc cells were physiologically active finally resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chlorine in luria bertani lb broth was identified by calculating the generation time results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the health risks associated with vbnc bacteria and the development of more effective strategies for drinking water disinfection

vbnc state ayrapetyan and oliver 2016 oliver 2010 in a vbnc state cells remain viable but they are no longer culturable with standard culturing method and can retain certain features of viable cells such as cellular integrity metabolic activity or virulence liu et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 it is noted that most of the bacteria in the environment are in the vbnc state and have never been cultivated yet however in the sense of hygienically relevant microorganisms the definition is restricted to species which do not grow any more on the media and conditions usually employed for their detection they are formerly culturable and thus evade the hygienic surveillance oliver 2005 vbnc bacteria in drinking water present a potential health risk because their occurrence can lead to an underestimate of total viable bacterial cell counts many disinfectants in use to eradicate pathogenic bacteria in drinking water are inducers of a vbnc state in bacteria for instance zhang et al 2015 reported that ultraviolet uv disinfection could induce e coli and p aeruginosa into a vbnc state liu et al 2009 induced culturable e coli o157 h7 cells into a vbnc state with chloraminating tap water turetgen 2008 showed that vbnc legionella pneumophila cells obtained by monochloramine treatment were still able to synthesize proteins some of which were associated with virulence in addition ozone had been reported to induce bacteria into a vbnc state orta et al 2017 chlorination and chloramination are the disinfection methods most commonly used by water suppliers ma and bibby 2017 chlorine can disrupt a variety of subcellular components and metabolic processes including protein synthesis in spite of a slower bactericidal rate chloramine is more stable than chlorine which means residual chloramine can persist longer than residual chlorine in a water distribution system alleron et al 2008 although chlorination and chloramination can induce bacteria into a vbnc state there is little information on the physiology biochemistry and genetics of cells that enter into this state in addition vbnc bacteria could recover culturability in appropriate conditions for instance resuscitation of e coli and p aeruginosa in a vbnc state can be observed by incubating in lb broth at 37 c after uv treatment zhang et al 2015 e coli o157 h7 in a vbnc state induced by high pressure co2 treatment was resuscitated when incubated in tryptic soy broth at 37 c zhao et al 2013 with a temperature upshift v vulnificus was resuscitated from a vbnc state induced by low temperature nilsson et al 1991 shigella flexneri was converted to a culturable state by co culture with selected eukaryotic cells senoh et al 2012 however whether vbnc bacteria induced by chlorination and chloramination can be resuscitated and whether their physiological characteristics can be retained are unknown in general there are still few researches about the induction of bacteria into vbnc state by chlorine and chloramine disinfection in drinking water treatment it is necessary to study the following questions 1 determination of whether chlorine and chloramine at different doses can induce e coli into vbnc state 2 quantifying the physiological and biochemical characteristics of vbnc bacteria 3 whether vbnc e coli induced by chlorine and chloramine can resuscitate at appropriate conditions to understand the above three questions the following methods have been used the morphology respiratory activity metabolic activity and gene expression of vbnc bacteria were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 5 cyano 2 3 ditoyl tetrazolium chloride flow cytometric measurements ctc fcm leonard et al 2016 confocal raman microspectroscopy and reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr respectively a comparison of generation time between resuscitation and regrowth bacteria was used to examine whether true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurs this is the first report on the resuscitation of chlorination and chloramination induced vbnc bacteria in moderate nutrient and temperature conditions our findings indicate that the potential risks caused by vbnc cells that are induced by chlorine and chloramine in drinking water treatment systems 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and culture conditions e coli cmcc 44103 was obtained from the guangdong microbiology culture center guangdong china a pure culture of e coli incubated in luria bertani lb broth at 37 c for 10 h with shaking at 180 r min ten milliliters of the logarithmic phase cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 5000 r min for 10 min at room temperature and washed twice with sterile nacl 0 9 solution 2 2 chlorine and chloramine disinfection hypochlorite solutions were prepared from a sodium hypochlorite naclo commercial solution a stock solution of chlorine was performed using a naclo aqueous solution at a dose of 3 free chlorine chloramine solutions were prepared by adding 300 mg l naclo to 4 mm nahco3 and 300 mg l nh4 2so4 concentrations were determined using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and expressed in milligrams of free chlorine equivalent per liter apha 2005 the cells described above were resuspended and diluted in 10 ml of the sterile nacl solution 0 9 to obtain an initial concentration of approximately 106 cfu ml naclo aqueous solution was added to the suspension to achieve the target initial disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l at predetermined time points of 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h 12 h 24 h the samples were taken and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine the bacteria characteristics e g morphology respiratory activity of samples treated with chlorine for 0 5 h and treated with chloramine for 2 h at various initial concentrations were analyzed 2 3 culturable cell counting the quantities of culturable bacteria were determined by heterotrophic plate counts hpc after chlorine and chloramine disinfection sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine and 100 μl from each dilution was evenly spread on nutrient agar na plates raffi et al 2008 the plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h before colony forming units were counted 2 4 total viable and vbnc cell counting total and viable cell counts were investigated using the flow cytometer millipore guava easycyte usa with two different fluorescent dyes the first dye applied was sybr green i which binds to dna and emits green fluorescence the other dye used was ctc which is readily reduced to an insoluble red fluorescent dye and then accumulates intracellularly with formazan during bacterial respiration total and viable cell counts were determined by single staining with sybr green i and ctc respectively e coli suspensions of 198 μl were collected in a 1 5 ml tube two microliters of fluorescent dye was added to each sample the final sybr green i used was diluted 104 from the original stock and analyzed after 20 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature the final ctc used was 2 mmol and analyzed after 3 h of incubation in the dark at 37 c gasol and aristegui 2007 the gating strategy for sybr green i and ctc stained cells is shown in fig s1 vbnc cell counts were calculated as the difference between viable and culturable cell counts 2 5 resuscitation assay ten milliliters of e coli suspension in a 50 ml centrifuge tube was treated with chlorine and chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively to ensure that the culturable cell counts were 0 cfu ml then sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 0 12 1 100 was added to quench the chlorine and chloramine the 10 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml was added to 10 ml of sterile lb broth and incubated at 37 c for 32 h with shaking at 180 r min one hundred microliter samples were removed at hourly intervals and plated onto na to determine the time required for the appearance of colonies culturability of the bacteria in these samples was determined by plating samples on na at 37 c for 24 h and then counting colonies twenty independent experiments were performed and all counts were performed in triplicate the principle of this method is that if the generation time of cells is far more below 20 min which control e coli cells require resuscitation has occurred 2 6 characteristics of vbnc and culturable bacterium 2 6 1 morphological observations sem was used to observe the morphology of e coli after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at different initial concentrations for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively logarithmic phase control and treated cells were resuspended in 0 9 nacl solution and then centrifuged at 8000 r min for 15 min the pellets were fixed initially in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 37 c for 12 h then the cells were centrifuged at 8000 r min for 10 min rinsed in pbs two times further dehydrated for 15 min in a list of cold ethanol solutions 30 50 70 90 100 the cells were then lyophilized and coated with gold palladium samples were observed and photomicrograph obtained under a hitachi s 4800 scanning electron microscope hitachi instruments inc japan 2 6 2 identification of intact membrane bacteria using clsm live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen carlsbad ca was used to distinguish intact from membrane permeabilized cells using a clsm lsm710 zeiss jena german the baclight solution was a mixture of equal volumes of 0 134 μm syto9 green fluorescence and 2 μm pi red fluorescence in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the intensities of syto 9 and pi were monitored at 480 500 nm and 488 617 nm respectively syto 9 stained all cells green whereas only dead cells were stained red with pi after chlorine and chloramine disinfection samples were enriched 500 times by centrifugation at 8000 r min for 15 min adjusting the e coli suspensions from 106 cells ml live and dead to 1 108 cells ml then 199 μl of e coli suspension was added to 1 μl of the mixture of reagents followed by incubation in the dark at room temperature for 20 min after staining 20 μl of each suspension was mounted on a microscope slide with immersion oil and then covered with a coverglass then the samples were observed under a clsm 2 6 3 determination of respiratory activity in vbnc cells ctc fluorescence intensity was used to indicate differences in respiratory activity between culturable and vbnc cells intensities were determined by calculating the average florescence intensity per cell the average amount of respiration when the cells were subjected to flow cytometry as described above 2 6 4 determination of single cell activity using confocal raman microspectroscopy and spectral processing after chlorine and chloramine treatment for 0 5 and 2 h at 4 mg l 1 ml of lb medium and 2 ml of d2o were added to each 1 ml culture and incubated at 37 c for 24 h to achieve a heavy water of approximately 50 then one hundred microliters of each bacterial sample were plated onto na in triplicate samples were washed three times with ultrapure water thermo scientific to remove the lb medium and spotted on aluminum coated slides single microbial cell spectra were acquired using a labram aramis horiba jobin yvon french confocal raman microspectroscopy spectra in the range of 300 3300 cm 1 were acquired to quantify the degree of d substitution in c h bonds the metric d d h was defined as the integrated spectral intensity of the c d 2040 2300 signature region as a percentage of the integrated spectral intensity of both the c d 2040 2300 and c h 2800 3100 signature regions 2 6 5 gene expression level determination using rt qpcr rna samples were first treated with rnase free dnase i to remove dna contaminants mrna was extracted and transcribed to cdna using superscript iii reverse transcriptase invitrogen according to the manufacturer s protocol the cdna was used for the rt qpcr analysis specific primers were designed according to the corresponding sequences in the genome of e coli using primer3 http primer3 ut ee table s1 the qpcrs were performed in triplicate using gene specific primers and a power sybr green pcr kit applied biosystems samples were run in a 96 well reaction plate on an abi q6 real time pcr system applied biosystems the qpcr program consisted of a 30 s denaturation at 94 c followed by 40 cycles of 94 c for 5 s and a final annealing step at 60 c for 40 s the normalized fold changes in the relative expression ratio were calculated using the 2 δδct method zhang et al 2018 2 7 statistical analysis total viable and culturable cell counts were log10 transformed means and standard deviation sd were calculated for triplicates differences between variables were tested for significance using an one way analysis of variance anova differences were considered significant if p 0 05 statistical analyses were performed using matlab version r2016a the length of e coli was analysed by using three hypothesis tests jarque bera kolmogorov smirnov and chi square test 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of chlorine and chloramine treatment on the culturability and viability of e coli e coli cells were exposed to the disinfectants at various concentrations chlorination and chloramination effectively decreased the culturable cell counts of e coli figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 at concentrations of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l free chlorine the culturable cell counts of e coli decreased from 106 cfu ml to 0 cfu ml at 120 60 30 5 and 5 min respectively however viable cell counts were still approximately 103 105 cells ml at the same time points with an increase of disinfectant dose the time required to enter into a vbnc state decreased for example 60 min was needed to reduce the culturable cell counts to 0 cfu ml at a dose of 1 mg l of chlorine but only 5 min was required at 4 mg l even with longer exposure times 24 h viable e coli cell counts were not significantly reduced moreover total cell counts generally remained constant with 24 h of exposure to 0 5 1 and 2 mg l free chlorine only with 3 and 4 mg l of chlorine an obvious decline in total cell counts was detected after a period of exposure some of the cells were disrupted with a high dose of chlorine and then released the intracellular material including cellular dna simon et al 2014 which decreased the total cell number in contrast with the results of chlorination longer contact time was needed with chloramination to decrease culturable and viable cell counts with choramination 15 min of contact time was required to decrease culturable cell counts to 0 cfu ml at a dose of 4 mg l compared with chlorine chloramine could induce more e coli into a vbnc state these results indicated that chlorination and chloramination can induce e coli cells into a vbnc state meaning that a part of the treated cells were not dead rather they had lost culturability but maintained low levels of respiratory activity a similar phenomenon was reported by liu et al 2009 whose results showed induction of e coli o157 h7 into a vbnc state with 0 7 mg l monochloramine and 1 5 mg l total chloramine kong et al 2015 showed that most bacteria entered into a vbnc state after treatment with chlorine at a dose of 0 12 mg l however they used very low doses of disinfectants to induce bacteria into a vbnc state in our study the doses of disinfectants 0 5 4 mg l were closer to those used in actual situations 3 2 resuscitation of vbnc cells after induction of e coli into a vbnc state by chlorine and the addition of lb broth culturable cell counts were 0 cfu ml for periods of up to 20 h then reached approximately 103 cfu ml at 21 h 24 h 27 h and 28 h in different four batches fig 3 if it is the regrowth of surviving culturable cells generation time should be approximately 6 min and e coli division rate should be more than 10 generations during 1 h period in fact the generation time of control e coli cells is about 20 min fig s2 the abnormal generation time observed here is attributable to the resuscitation of vbnc cells rather than the regrowth of undetected culturable cells in contrast there was no cell growth in the remaining 16 batches this shows that occurrence of resuscitation is a certain probability in previous studies various approaches were used to examine whether true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurs however whether the appearance of culturable cells was the result of true resuscitation of vbnc cells present as opposed to regrowth of a few undetected culturable cells was not determined in these studies bogosian et al 2000 zhang et al 2015 in our study we used the highest dose of disinfectant 4 mg l to eliminate culturable bacteria to the maximum extent and resuscitation was concluded based on the difference between the normal generation time of e coli and the generation time observed in our study these results suggest that true resuscitation of vbnc cells occurred whitesides and oliver 1997 but no culturable cells appeared at 48 h with 4 mg l of chloramine treatment for 2 h although resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chloramine was not observed in this study this does not mean that the vbnc cells could not be resuscitated it is important to note that for resuscitation a nutrient rich media medium is the preferential stimulus in fact there are many other methods to resuscitate vbnc cells such as temperature upshift presence of sodium pyruvate autoinducers amino acids use of host cells and co culture with amoeba v vulnificus was induced into vbnc state with temperatures of 10 c and a temperature upshift was enough to make them recover from the vbnc state nilsson et al 1991 other studies have reported that sodium pyruvate is the key molecule in the resuscitation process of salmonella enteritidis sodium pyruvate repairs the biosynthesis of dna and proteins thus transforming the vbnc state to a culturable state morishige et al 2013 liu et al 2009 found that e coli could be resuscitated with ai 2 a autoinducer produced during biofilm formation in a serum based medium pinto et al 2011 investigated the ability of vbnc e coli to resuscitate with different amino acids their study suggested that a combination of glutamine threonine leucine and methionine would be able to facilitate resuscitation for legionella pneumophila many studies demonstrated co incubation of the vbnc cells with the amoeba is a very effective method steinert et al 1997 other resuscitation conditions include inoculation into yolk sacs of embryonated eggs into mice and into human volunteers oliver 2010 maybe the resuscitation method used in this study was not suitable to recover the culturability of cells induced into a vbnc state by chloramination the results presented here are important for consideration of the biological safety of drinking water the resuscitation conditions 37 c nutrient rich used in our experiments were similar to those in the human body if a person ingests vbnc cells and the cells can recover culturability vbnc bacteria induced by chlorination present potential health risk 3 3 differences in characteristics of the bacterium between states 3 3 1 morphologies of culturable and vbnc e coli cells morphological characteristics of culturable logarithmic phase and vbnc cells were determined by using sem fig 4 e coli cells treated with chlorine and chloramine showed cell wall and membrane damage notably damage in the cell membrane indicated that chlorine and chloramine reacted with various cellular components and directly disintegrated this protective layer phe et al 2005 cell death resulting from chlorine or chloramine disinfection was a surface damage at first before entering into cells resulting in intracellular damage however a number of bacteria maintained intact cell structure as shown in fig 5 green fluorescence represents intact cell membrane whereas red fluorescence represents cell membrane damage with an increase in disinfectant dose more serious cell membrane damage and greater red fluorescence were observed bacteria with intact cell membrane after chlorine and chloramine treatment might be vbnc cells in addition to the damage of bacterial surfaces the length of the bacteria changed after chlorine and chloramine treatment the average length of culturable cells was 1 20 μm whereas cells treated by 4 mg l chlorine and chloramine were approximately 1 06 μm p 0 05 and 1 15 μm p 0 05 in length respectively fig s4 furthermore we determined the distributions of bacterial length after chlorine and chloramine treatment fig s3 and table s2 lengths of control cells were normally distribution after chlorine and chloramine disinfection however the lengths of e coli cells did not conform to a normal distribution table s3 rather they showed a lognormal or gamma distribution indicating that these bacteria became shorter in their new state 3 3 2 respiratory activity of vbnc cells respiratory activity was measured in culturable and vbnc cells by ctc fcm after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at concentrations of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 mg l for 0 5 h and 2 h respectively fig 6 the vbnc bacteria even maintained a certain level of respiratory activity approximately 50 of the control with chlorine and chloramine doses as high as 4 mg l ctc fcm results indicated that chlorine and chloramine are capable of decreasing the respiratory activity of e coli 2 mg l of disinfectant appears to be the threshold concentration with the respiratory activity plateauing at a minimum after 2 mg l these results indicated that chlorine and chloramine disinfection could significantly impact the electron transport process of bacteria p 0 05 this low cellular respiratory activity implied a decrease of exchange of materials and energy with the extracellular environment lin et al 2017 energy for basic metabolic activity of vbnc cells should be guaranteed in the first place and then little energy remaining could be used to assimilate various organic compounds from the environment fewer substrates therefore are needed from the environment which allows bacteria to survive starvation as well as chlorine and chloramine disinfection by taking up less chlorine and chloramine into intercellular haas and engelbrecht 1980 results from a similar experiment showed that h2o2 treated cells in a vbnc state retained their activity at approximately 70 that of the control morishige et al 2013 3 3 3 raman microspectroscopy reveals metabolic activity in single vbnc cells metabolic activity is essential to the viability of bacteria including those in a vbnc state previously we measured respiratory activity of bacteria by ctc fcm and then we measured water related metabolic activity to understand these aspects of bacterial metabolism berry et al 2015 in this study we used a technique that allows the nondestructive measurement of bacterial water related metabolic activity at the single cell level cells were amended with heavy water d2o 50 vol vol which does not affect bacterial growth berry et al 2015 after incubation viable cells were identified by measuring cellular d incorporation by raman microspectroscopy using this approach we characterized the metabolic activity of e coli in a vbnc state fig 7 we examined the raman spectra of 45 cells from each sample as shown in fig 7 a broad peak appeared in a region between 2040 and 2300 cm 1 that typically has detectable c d peaks in the raman spectra of d2o labeled e coli cells that were not treated with disinfectants positive control in contrast there were no detectable c d peaks in the raman spectra of non deuterium labeled e coli cells negative control this spectral pattern shows that c d substituted c h for the synthesis of macromolecular substances under the heavy water and it is safe to assume that one of the important components of intake d is lipids damoglou and dawes 1986 d will also be incorporated to some extent via other processes such as amino acid and carbohydrate biosynthesis fischer et al 2013 justice et al 2014 and d incorporation indicated that these cells were active c d peaks were also detected from two cells after disinfection with chlorine or chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 and 2 h respectively meanwhile the number of culturable bacteria after treatment with chlorine and chloramine at a dose of 4 mg l for 0 5 and 2 h was 0 cfu ml therefore the four cells with c d peaks detected were in a vbnc state furthermore we calculated the percentage of d h d to reflect the metabolic activity of vbnc bacteria and culturable bacteria the average percentages of vbnc bacteria treated with chlorine and chloramine were 9 1 p 0 05 and 12 2 p 0 05 respectively whereas normal culturable bacteria had a value of 14 6 this indicates that the water related metabolic activity of e coli in a vbnc state was reduced in addition we observed the changes of bacteria after chlorine and chloramine treatment by raman spectroscopy without d2o labeling fig s5 a shows the resulting free labeled raman spectra for each of the bacteria that were untreated and treated with chlorine and chloramine table s4 provides an overview of the observed raman bands of the investigated bacterial cells the intensity of ch 3 066 cm 1 ch2 720 cm 1 and ch2 ch3 2 935 cm 1 bands decreased after chlorine disinfection indicating that these bonds were oxidized in bacteria in contrast these bands did not change significantly after chloramine disinfection the characteristic peaks of amide i 1665 cm 1 and amide iii 1240 cm 1 in proteins almost disappeared and chlorine destroyed protein structure but there was almost no change in these peaks after chloramine treatment the nucleic acid peak 1094 cm 1 indicates that the phosphodiester bonds in the dna backbone and the characteristic peak intensity after the chlorine disinfection were weakened whereas the characteristic peaks of the bases a and g 1575 cm 1 were not weakened indicating that the dna was cut into fragments rather than base pairs being affected fig s5 b shows a three dimensional score plot of the principal component analysis for different disinfection methods which are represented by dots of different colors e coli without chlorine or chloramine disinfection is shown in blue e coli with chlorine disinfection is shown in red and e coli with chloramine disinfection is shown in green chloramine disinfected bacteria clustered with the control bacteria whereas chlorine disinfected bacteria were distinct this is consistent with the results shown in fig s5 a 3 3 4 gene transcript levels to investigate the response of e coli genes to chlorine and chloramine exposure rrna and selected mrna expression levels served as indicators of physiological activity and cellular viability of vbnc bacteria as shown in fig 8 nucleotide sequences of the gapa gene which encodes the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase decreased slightly in response to chlorine and chloramine treatment suggesting that vbnc e coli could maintain basic cellular function chlorine p 0 062 chloramine p 0 081 in contrast soxr in the superoxide regulon p 0 05 and katg in the oxyr regulon were both significantly upregulated p 0 05 it shows that e coli has activated antioxidant defense genes in response to oxidative disinfectants moreover expression of the major stress factor rpos also increased significantly p 0 05 this is consistent with the findings of boaretti et al 2003 who reported that rpos was associated with e coli in a vbnc state the glutamate decarboxylase gad system is associated with the bacteria s ability to tolerate extreme acid conditions biase et al 1999 the gada genes can be used as an indicator of the potential virulence of bacteria in acidic environments such as the human stomach zhang et al 2015 gad is encoded by gada which was expressed continuously in vbnc e coli p 0 05 4 conclusions e coli could be induced into the vbnc state after treat with chlorine and chloramine however routine method of hpc could not be used to detect the presence of vbnc bacteria because it would lead to an underestimation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the drinking water post distribution the combination of hpc and ctc fcm methods is recommended to determine the vbnc cell counts vbnc e coli induced by chlorine and chloramine can retain cellular integrity but these cells become shorter respiratory and water related metabolic activity are maintained at a lower level after treatment with chlorine and chloramine soxr and katg genes remained highly expressed suggesting that e coli responds to oxidant stress by increasing the expression of antioxidant genes meanwhile the expression of gapa the pathogenic gene indicates that vbnc e coli may be potentially primed for pathogenicity resuscitation experiments show that e coli in a chlorine induced vbnc state can resuscitate in lb at 37 c which has not been recognized previously however resuscitation of vbnc cells induced by chloramine was not observed in this study it is important to emphasize that failing of resuscitation does not mean that the cells cannot be resuscitated in principle before suitable methods have been found resuscitation of vbnc e coli may pose a potential health risk our study indicates the potential health risk posed by e coli in a vbnc state after chlorine and chloramine disinfection therefore it is suggested that we use boiled tap water for drink or food preparation acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the natural science foundation of china 51478450 51678551 51678552 the

19476,seasonal algal blooms in freshwater and marine water can increase the input of algal organic matter aom to the pool of dissolved organic matter the impact of bromide br and iodide i on the formation of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts dbps was studied from chlorination of aom solutions extracted from three species of cultured isolates of freshwater and marine algae microcystis aeruginosa ma synechococcus syn and alexandrium tamarense at comparable concentrations of dbps were formed from three types of aom in the absence of br trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloacetaldehydes hals were the main groups of dbp formed and haloacetonitriles hans were formed at lower concentrations in contrast the formation of iodinated thms was 8 nm 1 7 μg l since most of initial i was oxidized to iodate increasing initial br concentrations increased the formation of thms and hans while concentrations of total organic halogen and haa remained stable on the contrary total hal concentrations decreased due to the instability of bromated hals decreasing the specific uv absorbance suva value of aom favours bromine substitution since bromine more preferentially reacts with low reactivity organic matter than chlorine increasing the ph enhanced the formation of thms but decreased the formation of hans concentrations of hans and hals decreased at high ph e g 9 0 high initial chlorine concentration and long reaction time due to the decomposition based on the cytotoxicity calculations unregulated hans and hals were the main contributors for the total toxicity of dbps measured even though based on the weight regulated thms and haas predominated graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts algal organic matter bromide iodide total organic halogen bromine substitution 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in freshwater and marine water worldwide poses a challenge to water supply chapra et al 2017 paerl and huisman 2008 in an algal bloom event the addition of oxidants e g ozone chlorine and permanganate to untreated water prior to coagulation has been shown to increase the removal of algae since these oxidants alter the surface charge of algae thus improving their removal during coagulation henderson et al 2008a qi et al 2016b however the oxidants can also damage or lyse the algae cells resulting in the release of bulk algal organic matter aom coral et al 2013 daly et al 2007 qi et al 2016a xie et al 2013 aom is comprised of a wide variation of proteins carbohydrates lipids nucleic acids and other dissolved organic substances henderson et al 2008b her et al 2004 thus aom exhibits a more hydrophilic character and less aromatic carbon content as evidenced by much lower specific uv absorbance suva values 2 0 l mg m and higher heterogeneity fang et al 2010b li et al 2012 nguyen et al 2005 in contrast with terrestrial natural organic matter nom which is derived from lignin and contains a high aromatic content leenheer and croué 2003 the hydrophilic organic carbon fraction is less prone to coagulation and is recalcitrant to conventional treatment process lee and westerhoff 2006 widrig et al 1996 therefore the fraction of aom over the bulk dissolved organic matter dom might increase after a conventional treatment train chlorine disinfection after conventional treatment is commonly used to provide hygienically safe drinking water however chlorine reacts with dom to produce toxic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps liu et al 2017 richardson and postigo 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 in addition to four trihalomethanes thm4 and five haloacetic acids haa5 which are currently regulated by the united states environmental protection agency us epa u s environmental protection agency 2001 unregulated dbps including haloacetaldehydes hals haloketones hks haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms were of particular concern due to their much higher toxicity even though their concentrations are much lower than regulated dbps plewa et al 2017 bromide br and iodide i levels in fresh surface waters which are highly variable range from 10 to 1000 μg l and 0 5 20 μg l respectively liu et al 2012 2014 however the median concentrations of br and total iodine including i and iodate are much higher in seawater e g ca 66 mg l and 60 μg l respectively heeb et al 2014 liu et al 2014 in addition anthropogenic activities such as hydraulic fracturing coal fired power plants and wastewater effluent discharge may lead to the elevated halide concentrations in the downstream surface waters good and vanbriesen 2016 harkness et al 2015 vidic et al 2013 for example discharge from hydraulic fracturing has high concentrations of br up to 1 9 g l and i up to 54 mg l harkness et al 2015 leading to an increase in br concentrations in surface waters in pennsylvania usa vidic et al 2013 in the algal bloom event and source water impacted by high concentration of br and i the blending introduction of bromide and iodide enriched water to algal impacted surface waters may bring elevated levels of br and i and aom to potable water during chlorination process naturally occurring br and i can be oxidized to hypobromous and hypoiodous acids hobr and hoi respectively they can react with terrestrial nom to form brominated and iodinated dbps br dbps and i dbps respectively which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic as a group than their chlorinated analogues liu and croue 2016 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 previous studies indicated that aom could serve as important precursors of dbps under formation potential conditions fang et al 2010a 2010b hoehn et al 1980 hong et al 2008 huang et al 2009 li et al 2012 nguyen et al 2005 plummer and edzwald 2001 tomlinson et al 2016 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 among these a few studies have reported the formation and speciation of thm and haa at single initial br concentration 100 μg l wert and rosario ortiz 2013 and 480 μg l huang et al 2009 however high initial concentrations of chlorine employed in these studies result in a low br cl2 ratio there is limited information regarding to the formation and speciation of dbps from aom under various initial br concentrations especially corresponding to high br cl2 ratios due to the distinct nature of aom with nom it is unclear how br and i will affect formation and speciation of regulated and unregulated dbps from aom an understanding of how the halogen competes for the aom to produce halogenated dbps still lacks the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of br and i on the formation and speciation of regulated thms and haas unregulated iodinated thms i thms hals hans hks and hnms and total organic halogen tox during chlorination of aom derived from three freshwater and marine algae furthermore the effect of aom type ph initial chlorine concentration and reaction time on the formation of dbps was studied based on the information of measured dbp the theoretical cytotoxicity assessment was performed to evaluate the significance of dbps with respect to their potential

trichloronitromethane tcnm were quantified 2 4 experimental setup and procedures the role of aom type initial chlorine and br concentrations ph and reaction time on the formation of dbps from various aom dissolved organic carbon doc 2 mg l in the presence of 0 4 μm i was investigated initial concentrations of chlorine and br ranged from 14 to 224 μm i e 1 0 16 0 mg l as cl2 and 0 10 μm i e 0 800 μg l respectively the ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 with hno3 or naoh solutions in the presence of a 10 0 mm tetraborate or phosphate buffer all experiments were conducted in the dark in 250 ml of capped amber bottles under headspace free conditions at room temperature 21 1 c reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of chlorine stock solution to the buffered solutions containing aom in the presence or absence of br and i samples were withdrawn at preselected time points ranging from 0 5 to 72 h and then samples were analysed for residual oxidant i e sum of free chlorine bromine or iodine concentrations an equimolar ascorbic acid was added immediately to quench the residual for dbp measurements each experiment was performed in duplicate 2 5 calculations of bromine substitution factor bromine substitution factor bsf between 0 and 1 is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of bromine incorporated into a given class of dbp to the total molar concentrations of chlorine and bromine in that class hua et al 2006 as shown in equation 1 1 bsf br dbp br dbp cl dbp when thm was used as an example molar concentrations of bromine and chlorine could be calculated by equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 br thm bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm 3 cl thm 3 tcm 2 bdcm dbcm 2 6 calculations of theoretical cytotoxicity the theoretical cytotoxicity assessment was performed by dividing measured molar concentrations of each group of dbps by concentrations i e lc50 value determined in toxicological assays and assuming that toxicity is additive yeatts et al 2010 the lc50 value is the concentration of each individual dbp inducing a 50 reduction in the density of chinese hamster ovary cells for 72h wagner and plewa 2017 the lc50 values of individual dbps thms haas hans hal i thms and hnm were available in the literature wagner and plewa 2017 which are also presented in table s3 of supplementary material this approach has been used to assess toxicity of measured dbps and evaluate the contribution of individual dbps to the total dbp associated toxicity chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016b smith et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of aom type on dbp formation 3 1 1 thms fig 1 shows the concentrations of dbp formed from aom extracted from three types of algae species in the presence of various initial br concentrations and fig s1 of supplementary material presents the residual oxidant after 24 h reaction residual oxidant concentrations were in the ranges of 8 0 22 7 μm i e 0 6 1 6 mg l cl2 indicating that there is enough oxidant to allow the reaction to produce dbps generally increasing initial br concentration led to an enhanced chlorine demand since bromine reacts much faster than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 the concentrations of thms in the presence of ma aom solution ranging from 74 1 1 1 to 174 8 6 9 nm i e from 8 8 0 2 to 36 3 1 4 μg l are slightly lower than those produced from two seawater algae i e syn 113 1 1 0 202 0 40 8 nm and at 111 8 1 8 192 9 3 6 nm this can be ascribed to more thm precursors available in aom extracted from syn and at increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total thms fig 1a which is similar to previous studies on the thm formation from natural waters hu et al 2010 hua et al 2006 for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 10 μm the formation of total thms from ma aom increased from 74 1 1 1 nm i e 8 8 0 2 μg l to 174 8 6 9 nm i e 36 3 1 4 μg l respectively in the absence of br only for ma only tcm was formed from the chlorination of aom increasing initial br concentration led to less tcm formation but enhanced the formation of brominated thms at an initial br concentration of 2 5 μm chlorine concentration hocl 0 55 μm was 20 times higher than the formed bromine however the formed bdcm was close to that of dbcm 16 1 nm vs 17 6 nm indicating that the ability of bromine to produce thms from aom is at least 20 times higher than chlorine 3 1 2 haas ma aom produced higher concentrations of total haas than the two seawater algae fig 1b for example total haa concentrations in the presence of ma aom ranged from 112 5 3 3 nm to 118 6 5 5 nm corresponding to concentrations ranging from 16 8 0 5 to 22 6 0 9 μg l while those for syn and at were 74 3 7 4 87 1 8 0 and 75 7 7 4 85 4 5 5 nm respectively it was reported that increasing the aromaticity of nom i e suva enhanced the formation of thms and haas liu and croue 2016 however the similar trend was not observed for aom for example ma has the highest suva among the three aom solutions produced higher haas but lower thms it was reported that thm and haa can be formed from different precursors hua and reckhow 2007 therefore more haa precursors in ma aom led to the higher formation of haas in terms of doc nom comprised of 50 of humics which contain aromatic phenolic and carboxyl group contents and are the thm haa precursors leenheer and croué 2003 liu and croue 2016 however humic substances only account for 14 22 of the total doc in aom fig s2 supplementary material therefore no relationship was observed between suva and dbps produced for aom considering also the narrow suva range of aom suva does not appear to be a good surrogate to characterize the dbp formation when the initial br concentration increased total haa concentrations remained stable for any algae species but the formation of haas was shifted from chlorinated species to brominated analogues all nine haa species were measured and their concentrations vary according to the initial br concentration nine species of haas were grouped as the mono mxaa including mcaa and mbaa di dxaa including dcaa dbaa and bcaa and tri halogenated acetic acids txaa including tcaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa since each group of haa may be formed through similar chemical pathways interestingly the ratios of mxaa dxaa and txaa over total haas were relatively stable irrespective of initial br concentrations as shown in fig s3 of supplementary material in agreement with a previous study on haa formation from nom cowman and singer 1995 generally txaa accounted for comparable fraction ranging from 40 to 50 to total haa pool with dxaa while mxaa only accounted for c a 20 of total haas this indicates that txaa and dxaa were the main species while mxaa was the minor species 3 1 3 hans aom extracted from three algae produced comparable total hans ranging from 25 to 27 nm at lower initial br concentrations fig 1c when br 0 10 μm however concentrations of total hans from ma e g 42 9 1 7 nm were higher than syn e g 36 7 8 7 nm and at e g 31 1 2 2 nm likely due to more precursor for brominated hans available from ma aom based on a dbp survey in europe the weight ratio of dcan to tcm was 10 on a median basis krasner et al 2016a in this study this ratio ranged from 22 to 28 which could be attributed to the presence of more n containing organics e g amino acids in aom than nom increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total hans for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 10 μm the formation of total hans from ma aom increased from 25 7 0 3 nm i e 2 7 0 1 μg l to 42 9 1 7 nm i e 6 4 0 3 μg l this indicates that bromine favours the formation of hans as compared to chlorine dihalogenated acetonitrile dhan was the major species of hans while mono halogenated acetonitrile mhan was the minor species and tri halogenated acetonitrile was not even detected 3 1 4 hals hals were reported to be third largest group of dbps based on weight following thms and haas krasner et al 2006 however aom produced comparable molar concentrations of hals with total thms in this study at lower initial br concentrations fig 1d at ambient br concentration syn produced higher concentrations of hals 92 7 8 7 nm i e 14 5 1 4 μg l than ma and at did 74 0 5 7 and 57 4 3 3 nm respectively probably because syn has the highest dissolved organic nitrogen among the three types of aom table s2 supplementary material it was reported that amino acids can serve as the precursors of tcal trehy et al 1986 again there is no trend between suva and hal formation different from other groups of dbps thm haa and han increasing the initial br concentration decreased the concentration of total hals due to the decomposition of brominated hals the stability of hals at neutral ph follows the sequence tcal bdcal dbcal tbal koudjonou and lebel 2006 xie 2016 thm was the corresponding hydrolysis product barrott 2004 due to its instability concentrations of tbal were 3 nm i e 0 8 μg l in this study 3 1 5 i thms hks and hnms it was seen from fig 1e that concentrations of i thms were relatively low 8 nm i e 1 7 μg l and only dcim and cdim were measured reaction between hoi and dom to form i thms is in competition with the oxidation of hoi by chlorine or bromine bichsel and von gunten 1999 criquet et al 2012 however in chlorination system in the presence of br the latter pathway is much faster based on kinetic model calculations liu et al 2014 the calculated times for the transformation of 90 of initial i to io3 are 24 14 6 4 and 2 min for br 0 0 0 5 2 5 5 0 and 10 μm respectively this time range was certainly not enough for hoi reactions with aom to produce a significant amount of i dbps and therefore iodate was the main sink iodate is non toxic and is therefore the desired sink for iodine in drinking waters burgi et al 2001 concentrations of hks e g 1 1 1 tcp and 1 1 dcp and hnms e g tcnm in the presence of any aom were below 5 nm data not shown therefore the formation of hks and hnms was relatively negligible for the aom tested in this study and the brominated analogues were not measured 3 1 6 tox fig 1f shows the formation of tox tocl and tobr during chlorination of aom from three species of algae ma produced the highest tox 2 7 2 8 μm among the three aom followed by syn 2 2 2 7 μm and at 2 1 2 4 μm for any algae species tox formation is generally stable irrespective of initial br concentrations due to the constant concentrations of precursors however increasing initial br concentrations shifted the formation of tox from chlorinated species to brominated analogues it was noted that toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i and iodate was the main sink of total iodine which agrees with the insignificant formation of i thms shown in fig 1e fig s4 of supplementary material shows the fraction of each group of dbp of total tocl and tobr at lower initial br concentration thm hal and haa are the main groups of dbps in the total tocl while at higher initial br concentrations thm are the main groups of dbps for the tobr pool the main group of dbps formed is thm unknown tocl tobr was calculated from the difference between the tocl tobr and the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of measured specific dbps unknown tocl tobr accounted for 60 of total tocl tobr due to the hydrophilic nature of aom generally increasing the initial br concentration decreased the percentage of unknown tobr indicating that the formation of known brominated dbps e g thm han etc was favoured in bromination process 3 1 7 bsf fig 2 presents the comparison of bsf among thm dhan dhaa thaa hal and tox as expected increasing the initial br concentrations increased the bsf of any class of dbps also increasing the suva generally decreased the bsf of any class of dbps this indicates that bromine preferentially reacts with organic matter moiety with low reactivity which can be explained by the difference in the reactivity of chlorine and bromine toward aom bromine is a much stronger substuting halogen than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 aom with a low reactivity i e suva enriched in electron withdrawing groups e g amino acid would lead to a higher degree of bromination than chlorination when the bsf values of thm formed from aom were compared with those obtained from chlorination of surface water with higher suva from 2 1 to 5 1 at similar conditions ersan et al 2018 aom exhibits higher bsf especially when br 0 5 0 μm than nom does fig s5 supplementary material this further confirms that bromine preferentially reacts with dom with lower suva leading to a higher bsf three trihalogenated dbp classes exhibited distinct bsf patterns with increasing initial br concentrations the bsfs of thm was higher than those of thaa and hal for three types of aom fig s6 supplementary material it indicates that bromine substitution into thm is more effective than into thaa and hal also there is a high linearity r2 0 976 between bsfs of thm and bsfs of hal probably because thm is the decomposition product of hal barrott 2004 3 2 effect of ph under various initial bromide concentrations 3 2 1 thms considering that three types of aom showed comparable dbp formation pattern and ma was one of the most popular and problematic algae species in fresh water leading to harmful algae bloom in many large lakes worldwide paerl and paul 2012 aom from ma was selected to investigate the effect of ph 6 9 on the formation and speciation of dbps fig 3 fig s7 of supplementary material presents the concentrations of residual oxidants after 24 h reaction residual oxidant concentrations ranged from 9 5 to 22 7 μm with the highest chlorine demand at ph 9 increasing the ph increased the total concentrations of thms at any initial br concentration for example at initial br concentration of 10 μm thm4 concentrations were 89 8 1 3 174 8 6 9 and 288 6 4 1 nm for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively the enolization of the carbonyl moiety of aom or the hydrolysis of intermediate e g trihalocarbonyl to thm may be catalysed by hydroxide ion liu and croue 2016 these reactions may play more important roles in determining ph effects on thm formation 3 2 2 haas total haa concentrations increased as the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 5 and then decreased within ph range of 7 5 9 0 fig 3b among the nine species of haa dhaa increased from ph 6 0 to 9 0 while the optimum formation of thaa was at ph 7 5 for example dcaa formation in the absence of br was 28 6 0 5 44 0 3 4 and 53 4 0 5 nm in contrast to the tcaa concentrations of 25 7 1 1 51 6 2 0 and 17 7 1 8 nm at ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively this can be ascribed to the fact that dhaa formation was also hydroxide catalysed even though the catalytic effect was not pronounced as that for thm however formation of thaa in the higher ph range 9 0 was inhibited therefore lower ph will favour the oxidation of thaa precursor such as r co cx3 to produce thaa if the r group is a readily oxidizable functional group capable of donating an electron pair to the rest of the molecule liang and singer 2003 in addition thaa may undergo the decomposition to thm at higher ph zhang and minear 2002 3 2 3 hans for han the effect of ph is complex fig 3c at lower initial br concentrations in which dcan was the major species of han han concentrations significantly decreased with the increasing ph in contrast at higher initial br concentrations han concentrations only decreased slightly with the increasing ph e g 47 3 1 1 42 9 1 7 and 41 8 0 5 nm for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively at br 0 10 μm it was noted that at br 0 10 μm dban concentrations increased significantly from 11 7 1 4 nm at ph 7 5 to 31 7 nm at ph 9 0 which compensated the loss of total hans dcan and dban were formed from the same precursors and reaction pathway their distinct concentrations at higher ph can be attributed to the stability in chlorinated solutions han can undergo the reactions with chlorine or hydrolysis to its respective haloacetamide and further to haa and the rate constants follow the sequence tcan dcan bcan dban mcan mban yu and reckhow 2015 the fact that tcan was not detected in this study is in line with this sequence 3 2 4 hals fig 3d shows the effect of ph on the formation and speciation of hals increasing the ph from 6 0 to 7 5 increased the formation of hals and a further increase in ph from 7 5 to 9 0 led to a decreasing hal formation at ph 9 0 brominated hals were not detected owning to the decomposition of brominated hals at alkaline conditions xie 2016 3 2 5 tox the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox from ph 6 0 to 9 0 are presented in fig s8 of supplementary material the highest tox formation 3 5 3 9 μm was observed at ph 6 0 and there was no significant difference between ph 7 5 and ph 9 0 this may be ascribed to the higher reactivity of halogens in their molecular form again increasing the initial br concentration did not change the total tox formation only shifting the formation from tocl to tobr toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i from ph 6 0 to 9 0 utox decreased as the increasing ph fig s9 supplementary material due to the enhanced formation of known species i e thm which is the major class of dbp identified at higher ph 3 2 6 bsf fig s10 of supplementary material depicts the effect of ph and initial br concentration on chlorination dbp bsfs for thm and dhan no significant difference was observed for the bsfs between ph 6 0 and ph 7 5 however a significant increase of bsf from ph 7 5 to 9 0 indicated that bromine substitution was favoured at higher ph in addition the lesser stability of dcan than dban would contribute to the higher bsf at ph 9 0 increasing the ph also increased bsfs of dhaa thaa and hal this indicated that bromine outcompetes chlorine at higher ph 3 3 effect of initial chlorine concentration fig 4 shows concentrations of formed dbps at various initial chlorine concentrations 14 224 μm i e 1 0 16 0 mg cl2 l residual oxidant after 24 h is presented in fig s11 of supplementary material no residual was observed for initial chlorine concentrations of 14 and 28 μm while at higher initial chlorine concentrations residual oxidant concentrations are 19 3 μm increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 112 μm increased thm4 from 194 9 6 5 to 379 9 86 4 nm i e 47 6 1 6 to 90 9 20 5 μg l but further increasing chlorine concentrations from 112 to 224 μm did not increase thm4 due to the limited precursor available increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated thms where tcm and bdcm were the major thm species total haa concentrations increased 5 5 0 2 to 275 3 15 9 nm i e 0 6 to 43 6 3 2 μg l with increasing initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 224 μm fig 4b again increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated haas where mcaa dcaa and tcaa were the major haa species because high concentrations of chlorine facilitates the chlorination of aom moieties intermediates total hans increased from 0 to 56 0 1 0 nm i e 6 9 0 2 μg l when initial chlorine concentrations increased from 14 to 112 μm fig 4c however increasing initial chlorine concentration from 112 to 224 μm decreased the han formation to 35 8 1 1 nm i e 4 3 0 2 μg l due to the reaction between han and chlorine or the hydrolysis of han yu and reckhow 2015 again increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated hans therefore can dcan and bcan were the major han species while ban and dban were the minor species increasing initial chlorine concentration from 14 to 56 μm increased the formation of hal which afterwards remained stable for initial chlorine concentration from 56 to 224 μm probably due to the limited hal precursor available fig 4c the formation of chlorinated hals increased while total hals remained stable due to the increased ratio of cl2 br the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox are presented in fig s12 of supplementary material increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 224 μm i e 1 16 mg l cl2 increased the formation of tocl in contrast the formation of tobr remained relatively stable ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 μm owing to the constant initial br concentration toi at cl2 0 14 μm was 0 13 μm i e 16 6 μg l as i increasing initial cl2 concentrations from 28 to 224 μm decreased the toi to 0 079 μm since high cl2 exposure facilitated the transformation of i to io3 liu et al 2014 fig s13 of supplementary material shows the effect of initial chlorine concentration on the bsfs of chlorination dbps increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 28 μm i e 1 2 mg l cl2 significantly increased the bsfs of dbps for example bsf of thm increased from 0 23 to 0 57 and bsf of other dbps increased from 0 to 0 5 when applied chlorine dose was below 28 μm aom concentration was in excess of oxidant no residual after 24 h hocl or hobr reacts with dom via oxidation releasing cl or br and halogen substitution forming dbps liu and croue 2016 the recycling of br to hobr in the presence of chlorine would increase the bromination of aom i e bsf however when oxidant was in excess of organic matter cl2 0 56 μm further increase in the initial chlorine concentrations gradually decreased bsf this can be related to the increasing ratio of chlorine over formed bromine 3 4 effect of reaction time fig 5 shows the concentrations of dbps at different reaction times residual oxidants were available from 0 5 to 72 h residual oxidant at 72 h 4 2 μm 0 3 mg cl2 l fig s14 supplementary material increasing the reaction time gradually increased the formation of thm haa and han in contrast hal concertation decreased from 24 to 72 h of reaction time the concentration of dbps depends on their formation and stability i e decomposition or oxidation thms and haas which were relatively stable were the final products during chlorination of organic matter reckhow et al 1990 their concentrations therefore gradually increased as a function of reaction time even han can undergo decomposition or degradation yu and reckhow 2015 concentrations of total hans increased from 24 to 72 h primarily owning to the increase in bcan and dban which are stable at neutral ph and low chlorine concentration in a short reaction time however concentrations of bdcal and dbcal decreased significantly due to the hydrolysis xie 2016 leading to a decrease in total hal concentration from 24 to 72 h fig 5d the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox are presented in fig s15 of supplementary material increasing the reaction time from 0 5 to 72 h increased the formation of tocl 1 1 2 8 μm tobr 0 6 1 3 μm and tox 1 7 4 1 μm toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i fig s16 of supplementary material shows the bsfs of chlorination dbps under different reaction times the bsfs of dbps except for hals slightly increased with reaction time owning to the decomposition of brominated hals from 24 to 72 h of reaction the corresponding bsf decreased significantly 3 5 evaluation of theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps 3 5 1 effect of initial bromide concentration in the presence of three aom the influence of initial br concentrations in the presence of three aom on theoretical cytotoxicity based on the measured dbps is shown in fig 6 a increasing initial br concentration increased the calculated cytotoxicity of dbp measured han and hal are the major contributors 90 to the cytotoxicity increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total hans and led to the formation of brominated species therefore total cytotoxicity increased significantly even thm contributes to the similar or even higher fraction of total dbps formed based on molar concentration because of its low cytotoxicity index wagner and plewa 2017 there was no significant contribution from thm haa is another important class dbp formed based on molar concentration but haa only constituted 10 of cytotoxicity among the three types of aom ma and syn present slightly higher toxicity than at at higher initial br concentration since han and hal are the controlling agent for the calculated cytotoxicity no relationship between toxicity and suva was found aom produced less thm and haa than terrestrial nom due to the hydrophilic nature of aom however aom may form higher or comparable unregulated dbps hans and hals which control the toxicity of dbps produced currently only thm and haa are regulated these findings indicate the necessity to quantify and control the unregulated dbps especially in the seasonal algal bloom the formation of toi 10 μg l and i thms 1 7 μg l was low fig 1 and io3 which is non toxic was expected to be the main sink in this study therefore even iodinated dbps are more cytotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 i thms did not contribute to the total toxicity when source water is threatened by high concentration of br and i during algal bloom events to mitigate the formation of highly toxic i dbps the chlorine exposure should be optimized to allow the full conversion of i to io3 meanwhile minimize the formation of chlorinated and brominated dbps thereby reducing the total toxicity of dbp formed 3 5 2 effect of ph fig 6b presents the influence of ph on total theoretical cytotoxicity from dbps measured in the absence of br chlorinated han controls the total toxicity increasing the ph decreased the concentrations of han due to the decomposition at higher ph thereby decreasing the calculated toxicity at lower initial br concentration 0 5 2 5 μm the maximum toxicity was at ph 7 5 due to the enhanced formation of brominated hals however due to the decomposition of brominated hals at ph 9 0 the cytotoxicity decreased from ph 7 5 to 9 0 at higher initial br concentrations han is the controlling agent for the cytotoxicity brominated han such as dban which is relatively stable dominates the toxicity increasing formation of dban led to the increased calculated cytotoxicity 3 5 3 effect of initial chlorine concentration the influence of initial chlorine concentrations on calculated cytotoxicity of dbp measured is shown in fig 6c when applied chlorine dose was 28 μm aom concentration was in excess of oxidant increasing the initial chlorine concentration significantly increased the calculated toxicity where han is the controlling agent further increasing the initial chlorine concentration from 56 to 224 μm decreased the calculated toxicity due to the less contribution from hal increasing the initial chlorine concentration shifted the formation of hal from brominated species to tcal the lc50 of brominated hals was 2 orders of magnitude lower than tcal table s3 supplementary material this may indicate that excess amount of chlorine may favour the reduction of toxicity since dbp speciation was shifted from brominated species to chlorinated analogues and toxic hans and hals can be degraded by chlorine 3 5 4 effect of reaction time fig 6d shows that the calculated cytotoxicity of measured dbps increased as a function of reaction time again han is the controlling agent for the calculated toxicity due to its low lc50 plewa et al 2017 the increase in toxicity from han led to an increasing toxicity of measured dbps as a function of reaction time from 24 to 72 h even the contribution for the toxicity from hal decreased owning to the decomposition of hals the significant increase from han compensates the loss of toxicity from hal it should be noted that the theoretical cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbps which however only accounts for partial tox therefore it is of great importance to consider the toxicity of all formed dbps experimental evaluations of cyto toxicity and geno toxicity of dbp mixture for selected water samples may be addressed in future studies 4 conclusions comparable dbp formation was observed from chlorination of aom extracted from three species of freshwater and marine algae thms haas hals and hans were the main groups of dbps formed even though hans were formed at relatively lower concentrations than the former three groups in the absence of br in contrast the formation of other dbps e g i thms hks and hnms was low 8 nm increasing the initial br concentration decreased the formation of hals but increased hans and thms unregulated hans and hals were relatively less stable than regulated thms and haas therefore their concentrations decreased at higher ph and chlorine residual and longer reaction time when measured dbps were weighed against their toxicity index regulated thms and haas only account for 10 of total calculated toxicity and unregulated hans and hals were the controlling agents for the calculated toxicity acknowledgements this study was funded in part by the national science foundation cbet 1511051 the authors thank liz taylor edmonds and robert

19476,seasonal algal blooms in freshwater and marine water can increase the input of algal organic matter aom to the pool of dissolved organic matter the impact of bromide br and iodide i on the formation of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts dbps was studied from chlorination of aom solutions extracted from three species of cultured isolates of freshwater and marine algae microcystis aeruginosa ma synechococcus syn and alexandrium tamarense at comparable concentrations of dbps were formed from three types of aom in the absence of br trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloacetaldehydes hals were the main groups of dbp formed and haloacetonitriles hans were formed at lower concentrations in contrast the formation of iodinated thms was 8 nm 1 7 μg l since most of initial i was oxidized to iodate increasing initial br concentrations increased the formation of thms and hans while concentrations of total organic halogen and haa remained stable on the contrary total hal concentrations decreased due to the instability of bromated hals decreasing the specific uv absorbance suva value of aom favours bromine substitution since bromine more preferentially reacts with low reactivity organic matter than chlorine increasing the ph enhanced the formation of thms but decreased the formation of hans concentrations of hans and hals decreased at high ph e g 9 0 high initial chlorine concentration and long reaction time due to the decomposition based on the cytotoxicity calculations unregulated hans and hals were the main contributors for the total toxicity of dbps measured even though based on the weight regulated thms and haas predominated graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts algal organic matter bromide iodide total organic halogen bromine substitution 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in freshwater and marine water worldwide poses a challenge to water supply chapra et al 2017 paerl and huisman 2008 in an algal bloom event the addition of oxidants e g ozone chlorine and permanganate to untreated water prior to coagulation has been shown to increase the removal of algae since these oxidants alter the surface charge of algae thus improving their removal during coagulation henderson et al 2008a qi et al 2016b however the oxidants can also damage or lyse the algae cells resulting in the release of bulk algal organic matter aom coral et al 2013 daly et al 2007 qi et al 2016a xie et al 2013 aom is comprised of a wide variation of proteins carbohydrates lipids nucleic acids and other dissolved organic substances henderson et al 2008b her et al 2004 thus aom exhibits a more hydrophilic character and less aromatic carbon content as evidenced by much lower specific uv absorbance suva values 2 0 l mg m and higher heterogeneity fang et al 2010b li et al 2012 nguyen et al 2005 in contrast with terrestrial natural organic matter nom which is derived from lignin and contains a high aromatic content leenheer and croué 2003 the hydrophilic organic carbon fraction is less prone to coagulation and is recalcitrant to conventional treatment process lee and westerhoff 2006 widrig et al 1996 therefore the fraction of aom over the bulk dissolved organic matter dom might increase after a conventional treatment train chlorine disinfection after conventional treatment is commonly used to provide hygienically safe drinking water however chlorine reacts with dom to produce toxic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps liu et al 2017 richardson and postigo 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 in addition to four trihalomethanes thm4 and five haloacetic acids haa5 which are currently regulated by the united states environmental protection agency us epa u s environmental protection agency 2001 unregulated dbps including haloacetaldehydes hals haloketones hks haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms were of particular concern due to their much higher toxicity even though their concentrations are much lower than regulated dbps plewa et al 2017 bromide br and iodide i levels in fresh surface waters which are highly variable range from 10 to 1000 μg l and 0 5 20 μg l respectively liu et al 2012 2014 however the median concentrations of br and total iodine including i and iodate are much higher in seawater e g ca 66 mg l and 60 μg l respectively heeb et al 2014 liu et al 2014 in addition anthropogenic activities such as hydraulic fracturing coal fired power plants and wastewater effluent discharge may lead to the elevated halide concentrations in the downstream surface waters good and vanbriesen 2016 harkness et al 2015 vidic et al 2013 for example discharge from hydraulic fracturing has high concentrations of br up to 1 9 g l and i up to 54 mg l harkness et al 2015 leading to an increase in br concentrations in surface waters in pennsylvania usa vidic et al 2013 in the algal bloom event and source water impacted by high concentration of br and i the blending introduction of bromide and iodide enriched water to algal impacted surface waters may bring elevated levels of br and i and aom to potable water during chlorination process naturally occurring br and i can be oxidized to hypobromous and hypoiodous acids hobr and hoi respectively they can react with terrestrial nom to form brominated and iodinated dbps br dbps and i dbps respectively which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic as a group than their chlorinated analogues liu and croue 2016 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 previous studies indicated that aom could serve as important precursors of dbps under formation potential conditions fang et al 2010a 2010b hoehn et al 1980 hong et al 2008 huang et al 2009 li et al 2012 nguyen et al 2005 plummer and edzwald 2001 tomlinson et al 2016 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 among these a few studies have reported the formation and speciation of thm and haa at single initial br concentration 100 μg l wert and rosario ortiz 2013 and 480 μg l huang et al 2009 however high initial concentrations of chlorine employed in these studies result in a low br cl2 ratio there is limited information regarding to the formation and speciation of dbps from aom under various initial br concentrations especially corresponding to high br cl2 ratios due to the distinct nature of aom with nom it is unclear how br and i will affect formation and speciation of regulated and unregulated dbps from aom an understanding of how the halogen competes for the aom to produce halogenated dbps still lacks the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of br and i on the formation and speciation of regulated thms and haas unregulated iodinated thms i thms hals hans hks and hnms and total organic halogen tox during chlorination of aom derived from three freshwater and marine algae furthermore the effect of aom type ph initial chlorine concentration and reaction time on the formation of dbps was studied based on the information of measured dbp the theoretical cytotoxicity assessment was performed to evaluate the significance of dbps with respect to their potential

trichloronitromethane tcnm were quantified 2 4 experimental setup and procedures the role of aom type initial chlorine and br concentrations ph and reaction time on the formation of dbps from various aom dissolved organic carbon doc 2 mg l in the presence of 0 4 μm i was investigated initial concentrations of chlorine and br ranged from 14 to 224 μm i e 1 0 16 0 mg l as cl2 and 0 10 μm i e 0 800 μg l respectively the ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 with hno3 or naoh solutions in the presence of a 10 0 mm tetraborate or phosphate buffer all experiments were conducted in the dark in 250 ml of capped amber bottles under headspace free conditions at room temperature 21 1 c reactions were initiated by the injection of an aliquot of chlorine stock solution to the buffered solutions containing aom in the presence or absence of br and i samples were withdrawn at preselected time points ranging from 0 5 to 72 h and then samples were analysed for residual oxidant i e sum of free chlorine bromine or iodine concentrations an equimolar ascorbic acid was added immediately to quench the residual for dbp measurements each experiment was performed in duplicate 2 5 calculations of bromine substitution factor bromine substitution factor bsf between 0 and 1 is defined as the ratio of the molar concentration of bromine incorporated into a given class of dbp to the total molar concentrations of chlorine and bromine in that class hua et al 2006 as shown in equation 1 1 bsf br dbp br dbp cl dbp when thm was used as an example molar concentrations of bromine and chlorine could be calculated by equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 br thm bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm 3 cl thm 3 tcm 2 bdcm dbcm 2 6 calculations of theoretical cytotoxicity the theoretical cytotoxicity assessment was performed by dividing measured molar concentrations of each group of dbps by concentrations i e lc50 value determined in toxicological assays and assuming that toxicity is additive yeatts et al 2010 the lc50 value is the concentration of each individual dbp inducing a 50 reduction in the density of chinese hamster ovary cells for 72h wagner and plewa 2017 the lc50 values of individual dbps thms haas hans hal i thms and hnm were available in the literature wagner and plewa 2017 which are also presented in table s3 of supplementary material this approach has been used to assess toxicity of measured dbps and evaluate the contribution of individual dbps to the total dbp associated toxicity chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016b smith et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of aom type on dbp formation 3 1 1 thms fig 1 shows the concentrations of dbp formed from aom extracted from three types of algae species in the presence of various initial br concentrations and fig s1 of supplementary material presents the residual oxidant after 24 h reaction residual oxidant concentrations were in the ranges of 8 0 22 7 μm i e 0 6 1 6 mg l cl2 indicating that there is enough oxidant to allow the reaction to produce dbps generally increasing initial br concentration led to an enhanced chlorine demand since bromine reacts much faster than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 the concentrations of thms in the presence of ma aom solution ranging from 74 1 1 1 to 174 8 6 9 nm i e from 8 8 0 2 to 36 3 1 4 μg l are slightly lower than those produced from two seawater algae i e syn 113 1 1 0 202 0 40 8 nm and at 111 8 1 8 192 9 3 6 nm this can be ascribed to more thm precursors available in aom extracted from syn and at increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total thms fig 1a which is similar to previous studies on the thm formation from natural waters hu et al 2010 hua et al 2006 for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 10 μm the formation of total thms from ma aom increased from 74 1 1 1 nm i e 8 8 0 2 μg l to 174 8 6 9 nm i e 36 3 1 4 μg l respectively in the absence of br only for ma only tcm was formed from the chlorination of aom increasing initial br concentration led to less tcm formation but enhanced the formation of brominated thms at an initial br concentration of 2 5 μm chlorine concentration hocl 0 55 μm was 20 times higher than the formed bromine however the formed bdcm was close to that of dbcm 16 1 nm vs 17 6 nm indicating that the ability of bromine to produce thms from aom is at least 20 times higher than chlorine 3 1 2 haas ma aom produced higher concentrations of total haas than the two seawater algae fig 1b for example total haa concentrations in the presence of ma aom ranged from 112 5 3 3 nm to 118 6 5 5 nm corresponding to concentrations ranging from 16 8 0 5 to 22 6 0 9 μg l while those for syn and at were 74 3 7 4 87 1 8 0 and 75 7 7 4 85 4 5 5 nm respectively it was reported that increasing the aromaticity of nom i e suva enhanced the formation of thms and haas liu and croue 2016 however the similar trend was not observed for aom for example ma has the highest suva among the three aom solutions produced higher haas but lower thms it was reported that thm and haa can be formed from different precursors hua and reckhow 2007 therefore more haa precursors in ma aom led to the higher formation of haas in terms of doc nom comprised of 50 of humics which contain aromatic phenolic and carboxyl group contents and are the thm haa precursors leenheer and croué 2003 liu and croue 2016 however humic substances only account for 14 22 of the total doc in aom fig s2 supplementary material therefore no relationship was observed between suva and dbps produced for aom considering also the narrow suva range of aom suva does not appear to be a good surrogate to characterize the dbp formation when the initial br concentration increased total haa concentrations remained stable for any algae species but the formation of haas was shifted from chlorinated species to brominated analogues all nine haa species were measured and their concentrations vary according to the initial br concentration nine species of haas were grouped as the mono mxaa including mcaa and mbaa di dxaa including dcaa dbaa and bcaa and tri halogenated acetic acids txaa including tcaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa since each group of haa may be formed through similar chemical pathways interestingly the ratios of mxaa dxaa and txaa over total haas were relatively stable irrespective of initial br concentrations as shown in fig s3 of supplementary material in agreement with a previous study on haa formation from nom cowman and singer 1995 generally txaa accounted for comparable fraction ranging from 40 to 50 to total haa pool with dxaa while mxaa only accounted for c a 20 of total haas this indicates that txaa and dxaa were the main species while mxaa was the minor species 3 1 3 hans aom extracted from three algae produced comparable total hans ranging from 25 to 27 nm at lower initial br concentrations fig 1c when br 0 10 μm however concentrations of total hans from ma e g 42 9 1 7 nm were higher than syn e g 36 7 8 7 nm and at e g 31 1 2 2 nm likely due to more precursor for brominated hans available from ma aom based on a dbp survey in europe the weight ratio of dcan to tcm was 10 on a median basis krasner et al 2016a in this study this ratio ranged from 22 to 28 which could be attributed to the presence of more n containing organics e g amino acids in aom than nom increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total hans for example increasing the initial br concentration from 0 to 10 μm the formation of total hans from ma aom increased from 25 7 0 3 nm i e 2 7 0 1 μg l to 42 9 1 7 nm i e 6 4 0 3 μg l this indicates that bromine favours the formation of hans as compared to chlorine dihalogenated acetonitrile dhan was the major species of hans while mono halogenated acetonitrile mhan was the minor species and tri halogenated acetonitrile was not even detected 3 1 4 hals hals were reported to be third largest group of dbps based on weight following thms and haas krasner et al 2006 however aom produced comparable molar concentrations of hals with total thms in this study at lower initial br concentrations fig 1d at ambient br concentration syn produced higher concentrations of hals 92 7 8 7 nm i e 14 5 1 4 μg l than ma and at did 74 0 5 7 and 57 4 3 3 nm respectively probably because syn has the highest dissolved organic nitrogen among the three types of aom table s2 supplementary material it was reported that amino acids can serve as the precursors of tcal trehy et al 1986 again there is no trend between suva and hal formation different from other groups of dbps thm haa and han increasing the initial br concentration decreased the concentration of total hals due to the decomposition of brominated hals the stability of hals at neutral ph follows the sequence tcal bdcal dbcal tbal koudjonou and lebel 2006 xie 2016 thm was the corresponding hydrolysis product barrott 2004 due to its instability concentrations of tbal were 3 nm i e 0 8 μg l in this study 3 1 5 i thms hks and hnms it was seen from fig 1e that concentrations of i thms were relatively low 8 nm i e 1 7 μg l and only dcim and cdim were measured reaction between hoi and dom to form i thms is in competition with the oxidation of hoi by chlorine or bromine bichsel and von gunten 1999 criquet et al 2012 however in chlorination system in the presence of br the latter pathway is much faster based on kinetic model calculations liu et al 2014 the calculated times for the transformation of 90 of initial i to io3 are 24 14 6 4 and 2 min for br 0 0 0 5 2 5 5 0 and 10 μm respectively this time range was certainly not enough for hoi reactions with aom to produce a significant amount of i dbps and therefore iodate was the main sink iodate is non toxic and is therefore the desired sink for iodine in drinking waters burgi et al 2001 concentrations of hks e g 1 1 1 tcp and 1 1 dcp and hnms e g tcnm in the presence of any aom were below 5 nm data not shown therefore the formation of hks and hnms was relatively negligible for the aom tested in this study and the brominated analogues were not measured 3 1 6 tox fig 1f shows the formation of tox tocl and tobr during chlorination of aom from three species of algae ma produced the highest tox 2 7 2 8 μm among the three aom followed by syn 2 2 2 7 μm and at 2 1 2 4 μm for any algae species tox formation is generally stable irrespective of initial br concentrations due to the constant concentrations of precursors however increasing initial br concentrations shifted the formation of tox from chlorinated species to brominated analogues it was noted that toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i and iodate was the main sink of total iodine which agrees with the insignificant formation of i thms shown in fig 1e fig s4 of supplementary material shows the fraction of each group of dbp of total tocl and tobr at lower initial br concentration thm hal and haa are the main groups of dbps in the total tocl while at higher initial br concentrations thm are the main groups of dbps for the tobr pool the main group of dbps formed is thm unknown tocl tobr was calculated from the difference between the tocl tobr and the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of measured specific dbps unknown tocl tobr accounted for 60 of total tocl tobr due to the hydrophilic nature of aom generally increasing the initial br concentration decreased the percentage of unknown tobr indicating that the formation of known brominated dbps e g thm han etc was favoured in bromination process 3 1 7 bsf fig 2 presents the comparison of bsf among thm dhan dhaa thaa hal and tox as expected increasing the initial br concentrations increased the bsf of any class of dbps also increasing the suva generally decreased the bsf of any class of dbps this indicates that bromine preferentially reacts with organic matter moiety with low reactivity which can be explained by the difference in the reactivity of chlorine and bromine toward aom bromine is a much stronger substuting halogen than chlorine westerhoff et al 2004 aom with a low reactivity i e suva enriched in electron withdrawing groups e g amino acid would lead to a higher degree of bromination than chlorination when the bsf values of thm formed from aom were compared with those obtained from chlorination of surface water with higher suva from 2 1 to 5 1 at similar conditions ersan et al 2018 aom exhibits higher bsf especially when br 0 5 0 μm than nom does fig s5 supplementary material this further confirms that bromine preferentially reacts with dom with lower suva leading to a higher bsf three trihalogenated dbp classes exhibited distinct bsf patterns with increasing initial br concentrations the bsfs of thm was higher than those of thaa and hal for three types of aom fig s6 supplementary material it indicates that bromine substitution into thm is more effective than into thaa and hal also there is a high linearity r2 0 976 between bsfs of thm and bsfs of hal probably because thm is the decomposition product of hal barrott 2004 3 2 effect of ph under various initial bromide concentrations 3 2 1 thms considering that three types of aom showed comparable dbp formation pattern and ma was one of the most popular and problematic algae species in fresh water leading to harmful algae bloom in many large lakes worldwide paerl and paul 2012 aom from ma was selected to investigate the effect of ph 6 9 on the formation and speciation of dbps fig 3 fig s7 of supplementary material presents the concentrations of residual oxidants after 24 h reaction residual oxidant concentrations ranged from 9 5 to 22 7 μm with the highest chlorine demand at ph 9 increasing the ph increased the total concentrations of thms at any initial br concentration for example at initial br concentration of 10 μm thm4 concentrations were 89 8 1 3 174 8 6 9 and 288 6 4 1 nm for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively the enolization of the carbonyl moiety of aom or the hydrolysis of intermediate e g trihalocarbonyl to thm may be catalysed by hydroxide ion liu and croue 2016 these reactions may play more important roles in determining ph effects on thm formation 3 2 2 haas total haa concentrations increased as the ph increased from 6 0 to 7 5 and then decreased within ph range of 7 5 9 0 fig 3b among the nine species of haa dhaa increased from ph 6 0 to 9 0 while the optimum formation of thaa was at ph 7 5 for example dcaa formation in the absence of br was 28 6 0 5 44 0 3 4 and 53 4 0 5 nm in contrast to the tcaa concentrations of 25 7 1 1 51 6 2 0 and 17 7 1 8 nm at ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively this can be ascribed to the fact that dhaa formation was also hydroxide catalysed even though the catalytic effect was not pronounced as that for thm however formation of thaa in the higher ph range 9 0 was inhibited therefore lower ph will favour the oxidation of thaa precursor such as r co cx3 to produce thaa if the r group is a readily oxidizable functional group capable of donating an electron pair to the rest of the molecule liang and singer 2003 in addition thaa may undergo the decomposition to thm at higher ph zhang and minear 2002 3 2 3 hans for han the effect of ph is complex fig 3c at lower initial br concentrations in which dcan was the major species of han han concentrations significantly decreased with the increasing ph in contrast at higher initial br concentrations han concentrations only decreased slightly with the increasing ph e g 47 3 1 1 42 9 1 7 and 41 8 0 5 nm for ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 respectively at br 0 10 μm it was noted that at br 0 10 μm dban concentrations increased significantly from 11 7 1 4 nm at ph 7 5 to 31 7 nm at ph 9 0 which compensated the loss of total hans dcan and dban were formed from the same precursors and reaction pathway their distinct concentrations at higher ph can be attributed to the stability in chlorinated solutions han can undergo the reactions with chlorine or hydrolysis to its respective haloacetamide and further to haa and the rate constants follow the sequence tcan dcan bcan dban mcan mban yu and reckhow 2015 the fact that tcan was not detected in this study is in line with this sequence 3 2 4 hals fig 3d shows the effect of ph on the formation and speciation of hals increasing the ph from 6 0 to 7 5 increased the formation of hals and a further increase in ph from 7 5 to 9 0 led to a decreasing hal formation at ph 9 0 brominated hals were not detected owning to the decomposition of brominated hals at alkaline conditions xie 2016 3 2 5 tox the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox from ph 6 0 to 9 0 are presented in fig s8 of supplementary material the highest tox formation 3 5 3 9 μm was observed at ph 6 0 and there was no significant difference between ph 7 5 and ph 9 0 this may be ascribed to the higher reactivity of halogens in their molecular form again increasing the initial br concentration did not change the total tox formation only shifting the formation from tocl to tobr toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i from ph 6 0 to 9 0 utox decreased as the increasing ph fig s9 supplementary material due to the enhanced formation of known species i e thm which is the major class of dbp identified at higher ph 3 2 6 bsf fig s10 of supplementary material depicts the effect of ph and initial br concentration on chlorination dbp bsfs for thm and dhan no significant difference was observed for the bsfs between ph 6 0 and ph 7 5 however a significant increase of bsf from ph 7 5 to 9 0 indicated that bromine substitution was favoured at higher ph in addition the lesser stability of dcan than dban would contribute to the higher bsf at ph 9 0 increasing the ph also increased bsfs of dhaa thaa and hal this indicated that bromine outcompetes chlorine at higher ph 3 3 effect of initial chlorine concentration fig 4 shows concentrations of formed dbps at various initial chlorine concentrations 14 224 μm i e 1 0 16 0 mg cl2 l residual oxidant after 24 h is presented in fig s11 of supplementary material no residual was observed for initial chlorine concentrations of 14 and 28 μm while at higher initial chlorine concentrations residual oxidant concentrations are 19 3 μm increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 112 μm increased thm4 from 194 9 6 5 to 379 9 86 4 nm i e 47 6 1 6 to 90 9 20 5 μg l but further increasing chlorine concentrations from 112 to 224 μm did not increase thm4 due to the limited precursor available increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated thms where tcm and bdcm were the major thm species total haa concentrations increased 5 5 0 2 to 275 3 15 9 nm i e 0 6 to 43 6 3 2 μg l with increasing initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 224 μm fig 4b again increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated haas where mcaa dcaa and tcaa were the major haa species because high concentrations of chlorine facilitates the chlorination of aom moieties intermediates total hans increased from 0 to 56 0 1 0 nm i e 6 9 0 2 μg l when initial chlorine concentrations increased from 14 to 112 μm fig 4c however increasing initial chlorine concentration from 112 to 224 μm decreased the han formation to 35 8 1 1 nm i e 4 3 0 2 μg l due to the reaction between han and chlorine or the hydrolysis of han yu and reckhow 2015 again increasing the initial chlorine concentrations also increased the formation of chlorinated hans therefore can dcan and bcan were the major han species while ban and dban were the minor species increasing initial chlorine concentration from 14 to 56 μm increased the formation of hal which afterwards remained stable for initial chlorine concentration from 56 to 224 μm probably due to the limited hal precursor available fig 4c the formation of chlorinated hals increased while total hals remained stable due to the increased ratio of cl2 br the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox are presented in fig s12 of supplementary material increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 224 μm i e 1 16 mg l cl2 increased the formation of tocl in contrast the formation of tobr remained relatively stable ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 μm owing to the constant initial br concentration toi at cl2 0 14 μm was 0 13 μm i e 16 6 μg l as i increasing initial cl2 concentrations from 28 to 224 μm decreased the toi to 0 079 μm since high cl2 exposure facilitated the transformation of i to io3 liu et al 2014 fig s13 of supplementary material shows the effect of initial chlorine concentration on the bsfs of chlorination dbps increasing the initial chlorine concentrations from 14 to 28 μm i e 1 2 mg l cl2 significantly increased the bsfs of dbps for example bsf of thm increased from 0 23 to 0 57 and bsf of other dbps increased from 0 to 0 5 when applied chlorine dose was below 28 μm aom concentration was in excess of oxidant no residual after 24 h hocl or hobr reacts with dom via oxidation releasing cl or br and halogen substitution forming dbps liu and croue 2016 the recycling of br to hobr in the presence of chlorine would increase the bromination of aom i e bsf however when oxidant was in excess of organic matter cl2 0 56 μm further increase in the initial chlorine concentrations gradually decreased bsf this can be related to the increasing ratio of chlorine over formed bromine 3 4 effect of reaction time fig 5 shows the concentrations of dbps at different reaction times residual oxidants were available from 0 5 to 72 h residual oxidant at 72 h 4 2 μm 0 3 mg cl2 l fig s14 supplementary material increasing the reaction time gradually increased the formation of thm haa and han in contrast hal concertation decreased from 24 to 72 h of reaction time the concentration of dbps depends on their formation and stability i e decomposition or oxidation thms and haas which were relatively stable were the final products during chlorination of organic matter reckhow et al 1990 their concentrations therefore gradually increased as a function of reaction time even han can undergo decomposition or degradation yu and reckhow 2015 concentrations of total hans increased from 24 to 72 h primarily owning to the increase in bcan and dban which are stable at neutral ph and low chlorine concentration in a short reaction time however concentrations of bdcal and dbcal decreased significantly due to the hydrolysis xie 2016 leading to a decrease in total hal concentration from 24 to 72 h fig 5d the concentrations of tocl tobr and tox are presented in fig s15 of supplementary material increasing the reaction time from 0 5 to 72 h increased the formation of tocl 1 1 2 8 μm tobr 0 6 1 3 μm and tox 1 7 4 1 μm toi was below 0 079 μm i e 10 μg l as i fig s16 of supplementary material shows the bsfs of chlorination dbps under different reaction times the bsfs of dbps except for hals slightly increased with reaction time owning to the decomposition of brominated hals from 24 to 72 h of reaction the corresponding bsf decreased significantly 3 5 evaluation of theoretical cytotoxicity of measured dbps 3 5 1 effect of initial bromide concentration in the presence of three aom the influence of initial br concentrations in the presence of three aom on theoretical cytotoxicity based on the measured dbps is shown in fig 6 a increasing initial br concentration increased the calculated cytotoxicity of dbp measured han and hal are the major contributors 90 to the cytotoxicity increasing the initial br concentration increased the formation of total hans and led to the formation of brominated species therefore total cytotoxicity increased significantly even thm contributes to the similar or even higher fraction of total dbps formed based on molar concentration because of its low cytotoxicity index wagner and plewa 2017 there was no significant contribution from thm haa is another important class dbp formed based on molar concentration but haa only constituted 10 of cytotoxicity among the three types of aom ma and syn present slightly higher toxicity than at at higher initial br concentration since han and hal are the controlling agent for the calculated cytotoxicity no relationship between toxicity and suva was found aom produced less thm and haa than terrestrial nom due to the hydrophilic nature of aom however aom may form higher or comparable unregulated dbps hans and hals which control the toxicity of dbps produced currently only thm and haa are regulated these findings indicate the necessity to quantify and control the unregulated dbps especially in the seasonal algal bloom the formation of toi 10 μg l and i thms 1 7 μg l was low fig 1 and io3 which is non toxic was expected to be the main sink in this study therefore even iodinated dbps are more cytotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 i thms did not contribute to the total toxicity when source water is threatened by high concentration of br and i during algal bloom events to mitigate the formation of highly toxic i dbps the chlorine exposure should be optimized to allow the full conversion of i to io3 meanwhile minimize the formation of chlorinated and brominated dbps thereby reducing the total toxicity of dbp formed 3 5 2 effect of ph fig 6b presents the influence of ph on total theoretical cytotoxicity from dbps measured in the absence of br chlorinated han controls the total toxicity increasing the ph decreased the concentrations of han due to the decomposition at higher ph thereby decreasing the calculated toxicity at lower initial br concentration 0 5 2 5 μm the maximum toxicity was at ph 7 5 due to the enhanced formation of brominated hals however due to the decomposition of brominated hals at ph 9 0 the cytotoxicity decreased from ph 7 5 to 9 0 at higher initial br concentrations han is the controlling agent for the cytotoxicity brominated han such as dban which is relatively stable dominates the toxicity increasing formation of dban led to the increased calculated cytotoxicity 3 5 3 effect of initial chlorine concentration the influence of initial chlorine concentrations on calculated cytotoxicity of dbp measured is shown in fig 6c when applied chlorine dose was 28 μm aom concentration was in excess of oxidant increasing the initial chlorine concentration significantly increased the calculated toxicity where han is the controlling agent further increasing the initial chlorine concentration from 56 to 224 μm decreased the calculated toxicity due to the less contribution from hal increasing the initial chlorine concentration shifted the formation of hal from brominated species to tcal the lc50 of brominated hals was 2 orders of magnitude lower than tcal table s3 supplementary material this may indicate that excess amount of chlorine may favour the reduction of toxicity since dbp speciation was shifted from brominated species to chlorinated analogues and toxic hans and hals can be degraded by chlorine 3 5 4 effect of reaction time fig 6d shows that the calculated cytotoxicity of measured dbps increased as a function of reaction time again han is the controlling agent for the calculated toxicity due to its low lc50 plewa et al 2017 the increase in toxicity from han led to an increasing toxicity of measured dbps as a function of reaction time from 24 to 72 h even the contribution for the toxicity from hal decreased owning to the decomposition of hals the significant increase from han compensates the loss of toxicity from hal it should be noted that the theoretical cytotoxicity was calculated based on the measured dbps which however only accounts for partial tox therefore it is of great importance to consider the toxicity of all formed dbps experimental evaluations of cyto toxicity and geno toxicity of dbp mixture for selected water samples may be addressed in future studies 4 conclusions comparable dbp formation was observed from chlorination of aom extracted from three species of freshwater and marine algae thms haas hals and hans were the main groups of dbps formed even though hans were formed at relatively lower concentrations than the former three groups in the absence of br in contrast the formation of other dbps e g i thms hks and hnms was low 8 nm increasing the initial br concentration decreased the formation of hals but increased hans and thms unregulated hans and hals were relatively less stable than regulated thms and haas therefore their concentrations decreased at higher ph and chlorine residual and longer reaction time when measured dbps were weighed against their toxicity index regulated thms and haas only account for 10 of total calculated toxicity and unregulated hans and hals were the controlling agents for the calculated toxicity acknowledgements this study was funded in part by the national science foundation cbet 1511051 the authors thank liz taylor edmonds and robert

19477,in urine separating sanitation systems bacterial urease enzymes can hydrolyse urea to ammonia during the pipe transport and storage of urine the present study investigated whether it was possible to reduce the urine volume without losing the nitrogen as ammonia a method for stabilising the urine prior to dehydration was developed briefly fresh human urine was stabilised by passage through an anion exchanger added to an alkaline media wood ash or alkalised biochar and dehydrated urine dehydration was investigated at three temperatures 40 45 and 50 c the influence of various factors affecting the dehydration process was modelled and the rate of urine dehydration was optimised results indicated that 75 v v of the urine has to pass through the ion exchanger for alkaline stabilisation of urine to occur at all investigated temperatures the dehydrator accomplished 90 volume reduction of ion exchanged urine 70 n retention and 100 recovery of p and k to realise high degree of nutrient valorisation this study proposes combining source separation of human urine with alkaline dehydration graphical abstract fresh urine was passed through an ion exchanger stabilised by alkalisation ph 10 and added to an alkaline media wood ash alkalised biochar and dehydrated image 1 keywords decentralised sanitation ion exchange response surface optimisation urease urea stabilisation urine dehydration 1 introduction new sanitation systems based on source separation of human urine offer the exciting prospect of creating and establishing a new sustainability paradigm in wastewater management guest et al 2009 this emerging paradigm seeks to challenge the rationale of current approaches to wastewater collection treatment disposal and reuse if it exists larsen et al 2009 conventional sanitation systems are designed and operated on the presumption as well as perception that human excreta are wastes this consideration is subsequently used to justify its disposal esrey et al 2001 however sewer networks connecting household toilets with centralised treatment plants utilise potable water to mediate the transport of excreta thereby magnifying the volume of waste at the end of the pipe lettinga et al 2001 this is paradoxical because if human excreta are indeed waste streams it is surprising that reducing its volume in the environment is not a treatment objective of conventional sanitation systems in the eu however municipal solid waste management a utility that shares several similarities with sanitation does operate according to a hierarchy where reducing waste generation is considered the ultimate management option ec 2016 such a hierarchy of treatment options has not been applied to wastewater management the exception being household demand side measures that reduce water consumption inman and jeffrey 2006 another growing concern is the continuity of agricultural production to meet the demands of a resource scarce yet growing world population fao 2017 in this regard human excreta especially urine has been proposed as an alternative to chemical fertilisers as a source of plant nutrients winker et al 2009 however urine contains only 0 6 n vinnerås et al 2006 and is an aqueous dilute fertiliser in comparison to chemical fertilisers such as urea 46 n or ammonium nitrate 35 n kirchmann and pettersson 1994 taking into account that per capita urine generation is 550 kg yr 1 vinnerås et al 2006 and that the world population is approximately 7 5 billion the annual urine load that needs to be safely handled treated and assimilated in the environment is more than 4000 million tonnes waterless urine diverting toilets that separately collect human urine and faeces at source are in use in several parts of the world von münch and winker 2011 cheng et al 2018 however storing transporting and applying large volumes of collected urine as a liquid fertiliser can pose financial and logistical burden on users of urine recycling systems johansson et al 2001 while recycling urine one problem is the hydrolysis of urea which occurs during the pipe transport and storage of urine catalysed by the bacterial enzyme urease urea amidohydrolase krajewska 2009 the bacteria producing urease are ubiquitous and can trigger mineral precipitation in urine collecting systems causing pipe blockages and maintenance issues udert et al 2003 the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea is however strongly dependent on the ph of the solution sissons et al 1990 reported that around ph 9 urease activity falls to less than 10 of its maximum while kabdaşlı et al 2006 observed no urea hydrolysis at ph 10 recent studies have demonstrated that stabilising urine with wood ash dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 and lime randall et al 2016 inhibits urea hydrolysis ion exchange resins have been used previously for the selective removal or recovery of compounds from polluted water and wastewater milmile et al 2011 ion exchangers have also been used for recovering nutrients from source separated urine o neal and boyer 2013 tarpeh et al 2017 2018 o neal and boyer 2013 were able to selectively adsorb phosphate from synthetic urine solution using anion exchange resin impregnated with hydrous ferric oxide nanoparticles tarpeh et al 2017 investigated the use of cation exchange resins for recovery of ammonium from hydrolysed urine tarpeh et al 2018 demonstrated the feasibility of anion and cation exchangers for the recovery of n and k from hydrolysed urine despite these studies on ion exchange of urine some research gaps exist previous investigations focused on using ion exchange resins for nutrient recovery from synthetic hydrolysed urine to the best knowledge of the authors anion exchange resins have not been applied for alkalising and stabilising fresh human urine human urine contains several anions such as hco 3 cl no 3 po 4 3 and so 4 2 putnam 1971 ferslew et al 2001 table s1 the concentration of cl ions as nacl is relatively large when compared to the rest of the ions present in urine thus one approach to increase the ph of urine to levels required for urea stabilisation 10 geinzer 2017 could be to use an anion exchange resin that exchanges cl ions in urine with hydroxide ions oh in order to reduce the volume of urine dehydration technologies have been the subject of recent investigations antonini et al 2012 dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 convective air drying is a relatively simple technological operation used extensively in several industries especially for food preservation mcminn and magee 1999 water constitutes more than 95 of the volume of human urine putnam 1971 in principle this water can be removed to a large extent by heating urine and forcing a current of air over its surface in practice however evaporation of human urine is inhibited by a thin oily film that forms over the liquid surface tettenborn et al 2007 ventilation would also result in the loss of n as nh3 jönsson et al 2000 dehydrating human urine is therefore a process challenge since the objectives of volume reduction and nutrient stabilisation need to be realised simultaneously as illustrated in fig 1 the use of an alkaline media over which stabilised urine is spread can circumvent the formation of oil films dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 subsequently dehydrating urine by convective heat and mass transfer can remove water while the media retains urine nutrients hence the broader question this study seeks to answer is whether human urine can be dehydrated to produce a dry fertiliser the specific objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effectiveness of anion exchange to alkalise human urine ii investigate the possibility of reducing the volume of alkalised urine through alkaline dehydration by designing a dehydrator that removes 90 of urine s water content and assess the nutrient recovery potential of the combination of anion exchange and alkaline dehydration and iii identify understand and optimise the functional relationship between parameters that affect dehydration and the rate of urine dehydration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fresh human urine was collected in sterile 1 l polypropylene bottles urine was obtained anonymously from both men and women 10 persons 24 65 years old at different times of the day freshly collected urine was used immediately in experiments studying the ion exchange of urine in the urine drying experiments fresh urine and ion exchanged urine was stored at 3 1 c for 1 week prior to use the urine was brought to room temperature 20 0 5 c industrial grade amberlite ira410 type 2 resin merck chemicals gmbh darmstadt germany was used to exchange the anions present in urine with oh ions the resin comprised of spherical beads harmonic mean ø 0 60 0 75 mm 1 1 data available from manufacturer of styrene divinylbenzene copolymer with dimethyl ethanol ammonium functional group r n c 2 h 5 2 c 2 h 5 oh and had an exchange capacity 1 of 1 25 eq l 1 for dehydrating human urine wood ash and alkalised biochar were used as the dehydration media ash produced from the burning of birch wood used for domestic heating in uppsala sweden was collected sieved ø 1 mm and thermally treated at 500 c for 5 h in a furnace lh30 12 nabertherm gmbh germany biochar was manufactured through pyrolysis 450 c of chopped willow trees salix grown in germany and sieved to ø 1 mm to increase the ph of the biochar to 12 5 the procedure suggested by tseng and tseng 2005 was used koh pellets and biochar were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 4 dissolved using deionised water and kept aside for 1 h to ensure uniform dissolution subsequently the mixture was oven dried overnight at 110 c and used in further experiments 2 2 experimental setup the objective of the first set of experiments was to test the resin s efficiency in alkalising urine fig 1 experiments were performed to estimate the minimum volume of the sub sample of urine that needed to be ion exchanged in order for the mixture of ion exchanged urine and fresh urine to attain a final ph 10 using 50 different fresh urine samples composites comprising 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 of ion exchanged urine mixed with 100 80 60 40 20 and 0 fresh urine respectively were prepared and ph of each composite investigated in the second set of experiment the possibility of reducing the volume of ion exchanged urine through alkaline dehydration was investigated through three treatments performed as singlets wood ash at 40 c ash 40 and 50 c ash 50 and alkalised biochar at 45 c char 45 table 1 these treatments were exploratory in nature and were performed so as to provide insights into the dehydration process and help guide the development of the optimisation model experiment iii the nutrient recovery potential of the treatments was also investigated in the third set of experiments the objective was to identify understand and optimise the functional relationship between parameters that affect dehydration of ion exchanged urine and the rate of dehydration based on dehydration rates obtained in experiment ii wood ash was chosen as the dehydration media a set of 30 dehydration experiments were performed based on a four factorial five level central composite rotary design 2 2 1 experiment i anion exchange of urine fresh urine samples 50 samples 500 ml each were taken and each sample was divided into five equal portions of 100 ml subsequently 20 100 v v fresh urine from each 100 ml portion was ion exchanged using the resin in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml over a magnetic stirrer for 1 2 min based on preliminary studies the resin to urine volume ratio was fixed at 0 2 fig s1 finally the ion exchanged urine was mixed with residual fresh urine to prepare 100 ml urine composites where the anion exchange urine constituted 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the total volume fig s2 the ph of the urine composites was monitored using a radiometer electrode phc2011 8 denmark the resin was regenerated by placing 250 ml of 3 w w koh solution on a shaker table at 175 rpm for 1 h followed by washing with deionised water until ph of the wash water reached 9 after every fifth ion exchange experiment the resin was acid washed with 0 1 m h2so4 followed by rinsing with deionised water this was done to remove any struvite that could have precipitated over the resin cf williams 1999 2 2 2 experiment ii urine dehydration setup and procedure urine dehydration was performed in a modified benchtop incubator electrolux sweden with inbuilt cavity of 470 330 580 mm and adjustable temperature setting of 30 60 c two circulating fans cf1 and cf2 were installed to ensure uniform heat distribution in the incubator cavity fig 2 an air pump p1 was introduced to remove moisture laden air while a flow meter fm1 and a gate valve v1 regulated the air flow rate all parts of the setup were interconnected using 10 mm polypropylene pipes supported with steel wire temperature was monitored using three ss 304 probes with ds18b20 1 wire temperature sensors embedded data systems llc usa the probes measured temperature in the range between 55 and 125 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c fig 2 in each dehydration treatment pre treated ash or biochar 1 ø 0 25 mm was spread uniformly over a 250 μm sieve inner ø 19 8 cm that was placed at the centre of the incubator since these treatments were exploratory different amounts of dehydration media were used although the surface area available for dehydration was fixed the incubator temperature was varied according to the treatment table 1 but air flow rate and humidity were held constant at 1 l min 1 and 20 measured at 20 0 5 c respectively subsequently based on results from experiment i 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was added to the dehydration media in a fed batch procedure the weight loss was monitored periodically using a scale kern kb 2000 2nm germany 0 01 g precision dehydration was performed until 90 of the moisture was removed at which point a new batch of 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was fed to the same media therefore in each treatment urine was added several times table 1 to monitor the change in alkalinity 5 g dehydration media was withdrawn diluted with 25 ml deionised water and ph1 5 was measured using a radiometer electrode phc2011 8 denmark following the measurement the media and water were returned to the sieve all three dehydration treatments were performed until ph1 5 declined to 10 5 at which point the media was considered to be saturated with nutrients to compare the performance of the three treatments their dehydration rate l day 1m 2 was calculated this expressed the volume l of urine dehydrated in one day and in one square meter of the dehydration media 2 2 3 experiment iii response surface optimisation of urine dehydration rate since urine dehydration is likely to be influenced by several parameters that can be measured controlled and adjusted response surface methodology rsm was employed with the objective of optimising the urine dehydration rate in wood ash a four factorial five level central composite rotary design ccrd was set up with x 1 incubator temperature c x 2 air flow rate l min 1 x 3 amount of ash placed in the sieve g and x 4 volume of urine added to the ash ml table 2 using the urine dehydrator fig 2 a set of 30 experiments were performed as suggested by the software table s5 in each experiment 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was added once to wood ash placed in a 250 μm sieve and dehydrated until 90 moisture was removed the sequence of the 30 experiments was randomised as suggested by the software to counteract any potential effect of uncontrolled parameters since the same sieve was used throughout surface area available for dehydration was kept constant whereas the distance between the surface and the edge of the sieve varied with the amount of ash added the output response from the model y expressed the dehydration rate of urine l day 1m 2 using the generalised equation for response surface cubic models eq 1 the functional relationship between the response and the factors x i was evaluated where a 0 a i a i i and a i i i are model coefficients for the intercept linear squared and cubic terms respectively a i j and a i j k represent the cross

the model fischer test and analysis of variance anova was carried out at 95 confidence interval design expert usa model terms with p value less than 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 were considered highly significant moderately significant and of low significance respectively the output response was visualised as a function of two of the factors while keeping the others constant using 3 d surface plots and contour plots optimal conditions were selected according to derringer s desired function method roosta et al 2014 based on results obtained in treatments ash 40 and ash 50 the following goals were set to help guide the desirability function development maximum incubator temperature and urine addition minimum ash addition to sieve and air flow rate 2 3 sampling and physicochemical analysis to determine the initial properties and nutrient composition 1 v v of urine was cumulatively collected and refrigerated at 20 c total nitrogen total phosphorous and ammonium nitrogen were analysed using spectroquant test kits and a nova 60 photometer following the instructions provided by the supplier merck kgaa darmstadt germany test kits 14763 12543 and 14544 for tot n tot p and nh4 n respectively urine was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter sarstedt germany prior to analysis the dehydration media was characterised before and after the treatments for the following parameters a tot n and total c content was measured by dumas combustion method on an elemental analyser leco trumac cn usa b p k ca and mg concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp optima 7300 dv perkin elmer usa all values are reported as mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 anion exchange alkalisation of urine in experiments studying the anion exchange of urine ph of fresh urine varied from 5 5 to 7 3 with a mean value of 6 5 0 5 n 50 the ph as a result of anion exchange of fixed proportions of urine 20 100 v v passing through the resin varied from 8 1 0 8 to 11 2 0 6 fig 3 the increase in ph correlated well with the volume of urine that was ion exchanged r 2 0 95 p 0 001 the rationale behind treating different portions of fresh urine with the resin was twofold i to estimate the minimum amount of urine that needed to be ion exchanged so as to increase ph 10 and ii to minimise the number of times the resin needed to be regenerated based on the linear relationship between volume of anion exchanged urine and ph of the urine composite p h c o m p o s i t e 0 91 f e x 6 13 r 2 0 96 it could be suggested that at least 75 v v of fresh urine must pass through the resin to attain ph 10 when mixed with fresh urine 3 2 dehydration rates and treatment capacities for the dehydration treatments 75 v v ion exchanged fresh urine composites with ph of 10 2 0 5 were prepared and used the dehydration was performed until ph1 5 of the dehydration media decreased to 10 5 at this point the total volume of urine added to 175 100 and 125 g of the media in treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 was 1 80 1 55 and 1 42 l respectively this gives an addition of 10 3 15 5 and 11 4 ml urine per g dehydration media for treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively in ash 40 the average dehydration rate was found to be 6 6 0 4 l day 1m 2 table s2 at 50 c ash 50 the average dehydration rate was highest 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 and thus the average dehydration time the shortest 192 min table s3 in char 45 adding 50 ml urine to 125 g of biochar yielded a low dehydration rate 5 2 1 1 l day 1m 2 in comparison to the two ash treatments since biochar pores can store and retain water brewer and brown 2012 the urine addition rate was increased to 100 ml per run this increased the dehydration rate to 6 4 0 6 l day 1m 2 table s4 the dehydration capacity of the treatments at saturation ph 10 5 was evaluated by considering the total volume of urine that had been cumulatively added to 1 kg media and the time required for dehydrating that amount of urine in ash 40 1 kg ash could dehydrate 9 2 l urine at 40 c in 8 days while 13 5 l urine could be dehydrated in 1 kg alkalised biochar in 7 2 days when the dehydrator was operated at 45 c fig 4 the highest dehydration capacity and the shortest drying time was observed in ash 50 here 1 kg ash could dehydrate 15 2 l of urine in 4 2 days at 50 c it was found that if treatments ash 40 and char 45 are used 1 kg dehydration media is sufficient to dehydrate the cumulative volume of urine excreted daily by one person fig 4 the dehydration times varied between the three treatments on account of different urine media ratios and different temperatures used in the treatments differences in material properties e g water holding capacity porosity thermal conductivity may also have influenced the dehydration times within the treatments the time required to dehydrate urine varied over the course of the treatment tables s2 s4 and this could be mainly due to two factors firstly the dehydration was considered complete when 90 moisture was removed from the media since urine was added several times to the same media and dehydrated residual moisture gradually accumulated secondly the addition of urine to the media may have caused it to compact and loose porosity the compaction would have occurred until an equilibrium height was attained presumably compaction reduces voidage which is inversely proportional to the heat and mass transfer coefficients dwivedi and upadhyay 1977 this trend was observed during the initial dehydration experiments e g experiments 1 4 in ash 40 or 1 5 in ash 50 where the first dehydration experiment always provided the least dehydration rate across all treatments tables s2 s4 3 3 mass and nutrient balance during anion exchange and dehydration to establish the volume reduction accomplished through dehydration and nutrient recovery through inhibition of urea hydrolysis alkalinisation a mass balance was carried out fig 5 in all the three treatments urine volume reduction 2 2 volume reduction is measured by monitoring the change in mass of the mixture of urine and dehydration media of 90 was achieved since the urine media ratio varied between treatments the concentration factor defined in this study as the ratio of the total urine dehydrated by a given initial amount of dehydration media was calculated it was found to be higher in ash 50 15 5 than ash 40 10 3 and char 45 11 4 hence to dehydrate the urine excreted by one person in a year 550 kg urine yr 1 vinnerås et al 2006 55 33 and 37 kg dehydration media would be required if treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 are respectively used in a urine dehydrator in effect this suggests that using a urine dehydrator could produce 30 60 kg of nutrient rich dry product instead of 550 kg of liquid waste urine each year in the anion exchanger three losses occurred fig 5 firstly there was a change in density of the urine as heavier cl 35 g mol 1 ions were substituted by lighter oh 17 g mol 1 ions however even if all the cl in urine was exchanged 8 4 g l 1 according to putnam 1971 this would result in 4 g l 1 decrease in mass secondly p content of urine decreased by over 35 this was probably due to precipitation of struvite mgnh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o over the resin and some amorphous calcium phosphate ca 3 po 4 2 and octacalcium phosphate ca 8 h 2 po 4 6 5 h 2 o that could form in alkaline solutions udert et al 2003 the resin could also have adsorbed po 4 3 ions from urine tarpeh et al 2018 thirdly subjecting fresh urine to anion exchange resulted in some loss of n 3 6 this may be attributed to volatilisation of free nh4 n at high ph as approximately 5 of the n is excreted as nh3 since the ion exchange resin was stored in koh prior to use and was washed with deionised water only until ph 9 the ion exchanger also functioned to increase the k content in the end product after dehydration not all of the n from the ion exchanged urine could be recovered based on the tot n concentrations in ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite and the dehydration media 77 74 and 72 n was retained during dehydration in ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively increasing the incubator temperature from 40 c ash 40 to 50 c ash 50 resulted in less than 5 increase in n loss but resulted in considerably higher dehydration rate 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 as compared to 6 6 0 4 l day 1m 2 figs 4 and 5 within the temperature range investigated in this study 40 50 c urea hydrolysis is the primary reason for n losses during dehydration as discussed elsewhere zhigang et al 2008 randall et al 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 this hydrolysis can be catalysed biologically urease chemically ph 12 and or thermally 38 c zerner 1991 the most effective catalyst is the urease enzyme which is 108 times faster in degrading urea than chemical hydrolysis at 65 c and ph 12 callahan et al 2005 warner 1942 thus inhibiting enzyme activity during dehydration is more important than inhibiting chemical hydrolysis with uniform alkaline ph 10 in the dehydration media there should not be any significant biochemical activity and the loss of urea n due to enzymatic hydrolysis should have been minimal as suggested by randall et al 2016 however some n is assumed lost to chemical hydrolysis during the treatment period when the ph of the media was above 12 at ph 12 an elimination reaction occurs that yields ammonia and cyanic acid eq 2 a b blakeley et al 1982 this reaction is catalysed by oh and would proceed to hydrolyse urea in high ph environments such as that present in dehydration media at the start of the treatment 2a nh 2 co nh 2 oh nh 2 co nh h 2 o 2b nh 2 co nh h 2 o chno nh 3 oh based on the formula for urea loss by hydrolysis put forward by senecal and vinnerås 2017 p 653 0 5 n would have been lost in treatment ash 40 due to non enzymatic urea hydrolysis since the urine was not exposed for a long time 8 days to either elevated ph or temperature the reasons for higher losses of n were not identified and further detailed studies are required to evaluate this in all three dehydration treatments there was complete recovery of p from the ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite fig 5 complete recovery of k is also assumed since it is non volatile at the investigated temperatures the forms in which p and k were retained was not investigated in this study although it is likely that some of the p precipitated as struvite mgnh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o and hydroxyapatite ca 10 po 4 6 oh 2 udert et al 2003 the presence of mg in both wood ash 23 0 6 g kg 1 and untreated biochar 0 63 0 04 g kg 1 may have induced supersaturation and subsequently precipitation of the minerals 3 4 change in alkalinity the limiting factor during urine dehydration the initial ph of wood ash and alkalised biochar was measured to be 12 9 13 0 and 12 6 in ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively the ph of 75 v v ion exchanged fresh urine composites added to these treatments varied as 10 2 0 5 over the course of the treatments the ph1 5 of the dehydration media decreased as more urine was added to the same media fig 6 in comparison to the two other treatments ash 50 dehydrated more urine per g dehydration media 16 ml g 1 before reaching the threshold ph of 10 5 this was probably because ash 50 was subjected to air exchange co 2 absorption for lesser time duration on account higher temperature and faster dehydration rates that in ash 40 or char 45 in an earlier study senecal and vinnerås 2017 observed that the drop in ph1 5 of wood ash when dehydrating deionised water and human urine was very similar a plausible explanation for the drop in alkalinity is that as air passes over the urine filled media co 2 gets absorbed and dissolved resulting in an increase in h concentration eq 3 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 hco 3 h co 3 2 2 h the relative concentrations of co 2 aq carbonic acid h 2 co 3 bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 during the absorption of co 2 g by aqueous solutions is a function of the solution temperature and ph wolf gladrow et al 2007 in high ph environments such as that in the dehydration media ph1 5 at t 0 is 12 5 co 3 2 is the dominant species in the dehydrator as more air exchange occurs over time and more co 2 is absorbed by the media co 2 aq increases and h 2 co 3 forms decreasing the media ph in that case the equilibrium eq 3 would gradually shift towards the right increasing hco 3 and h any reaction that removes co 3 2 from the equilibrium would drive the process further ultimately resulting in more h production mitchell et al 2009 one such reaction could have been with alkaline earth metals that are present in both urine and the dehydration media according to putnam 1971 urine contains ca2 30 90 mg l 1 and mg2 20 205 mg l 1 initial elemental analysis performed on the dehydration media showed that these metals also occurred in the wood ash 241 9 g ca kg 1 23 1 g mg kg 1 and to a lesser extent in the biochar 1 55 0 08 g ca kg 1 0 63 0 04 g mg kg 1 another process that reduced the ph is the degradation of urea by hydrolysis hence the primary factors influencing alkalinity during dehydration could be carbonic acid formation due to co2 absorption intrinsic urine and extrinsic media buffering action of alkaline earth metals and ammonia weak base formation from degradation of urea in urine 3 5 optimisation of urine dehydration rate 3 5 1 development of the response surface cubic model to optimise the dehydrator operation this study used response surface methodology to identify the relationship between the dehydration rate y and x 1 incubator temperature x 2 air flow rate x 3 amount of ash placed in the sieve and x 4 volume of urine added to the ash non linear regression of experimental data against eq 1 revealed that model terms x 1 x 3 and x 1 2 x 3 were highly significant x 3 2 was moderately significant and x 2 x 1 2 and x 1 x 2 2 were of low significance table s6 ignoring the contribution of non significant factors reduced the cubic model to 4 d e h y d r a t i o n r a t e 6 202 0 613 t e m p e r a t u r e 0 304 a i r f

a s h the statistical validity of the response surface model was verified by the test for lack of fit where the p values were found to be low p 0 05 table s6 the developed model accounted for more than 92 of the variability in the experimental data the coefficient of variation cv 6 6 and adequate precision 4 values confirmed that the difference between predicted and experimental dehydration rates was minimal fig s4 3 5 2 influence of process parameters on dehydration rate in convective hot air drying the dehydration rate and temperature usually display a positive relationship since temperature is a driving force for heat and mass transfer menzies and o callaghan 1971 this was also observed in experiment iii as increasing the temperature from 38 to 42 c increased the dehydration rate from 4 to 6 5 l day 1m 2 respectively fig 7 a and b increasing the temperature allowed quicker removal of moisture from the ash surface which in turn decreased drying time at constant temperature and relative humidity air flow rate did not significantly affect the dehydration rate fig 7c and d increasing the air flow rate up to 0 75 l min 1 data not shown in the figure increased the dehydration rate but an inverse relationship was displayed when the setup was operated at flow rates 0 75 l min 1 the lowest dehydration rate 5 1 l day 1m 2 was observed at the highest air flow rate 1 5 l min 1 similar observations have been made by others working with the drying of natural materials yaldýz and ertekýn 2001 toğrul and pehlivan 2003 in the present study although the incubator was initially set to a fixed temperature variations in air flow rate were observed to have an effect on temperature development in the incubator cavity at low air flow rates the time required for establishing the set temperature in the incubator was observed to be less than that at higher air flow rates according to toğrul and pehlivan 2003 at high air flow rates turbulence and flow channelling may occur the amount of ash and the urine dehydration rate were negatively correlated r 2 0 86 p 0 005 fig 7 b e by placing more ash in the sieve the bed depth increased this in turn reduced the surface to volume ratio available for dehydration perhaps in experiments with high ash addition water was removed from the ash surface but higher bed depths meant poor removal of water trapped below the surface resulting in low dehydration rates in conventional drying techniques such as the one used in this study it is easier to remove water from the surface of the material than water trapped within it zhang et al 2006 wang and xi 2005 for a fixed amount of ash 150 g placed in the sieve increasing the addition of urine from 40 to 80 ml increased the dehydration rate from 5 4 to 6 4 l day 1m 2 fig 7 c f increasing the volumetric addition of urine affected the dehydration in two ways i it increased the moisture content in the ash which in turn provided the driving force to overcome mass transfer resistance and ii it reduced voidage in the dehydration bed the thermal conductivity of wood ash air and water at 40 c is 0 047 0 027 and 0 574 w m 1k 1 aduda 1987 respectively and that of urine 24 t 38 c is 0 56 w m 1k 1 poppendiek et al 1967 presumably a bed with large fraction of its volume occupied by voids would be more prone to resist heat and mass transfer 3 5 3 numerical optimisation identifying optimal dehydration conditions numerical optimisation was performed according to a pre determined set of constraints table s8 and provided the optimal operating conditions for the urine dehydrator the model predicted a dehydration rate of 6 7 l day 1m 2 when 100 g wood ash was placed in the sieve at an incubator temperature of 41 4 c air flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 and when 80 ml urine was added to the ash table s9 3 6 implementation potential and challenges 3 6 1 anion exchanger alkalisation by anion exchange offers an interesting approach to stabilise urea n in urine the resin used in the present study functioned to increase the ph of fresh urine 7 to levels required for stabilisation 10 however alkalising urine required a large amount of resin to treat the urine produced by a family of four over 1 week our results indicate that 8 2 l of amberlite ira410 type 2 resin would be required on a weekly basis tarpeh et al 2017 have estimated that 5 3 19 l of ion exchange adsorbents are required for recovering nitrogen from source separated urine while the resin could be regenerated this would require supplying storing and using strong alkalis alternatively commonly available household alkaline agents such as caustic soda limewater or milk of magnesia could be used as the regenerant this could however introduce unwanted impurities in the resin matrix and reduce its exchange capacity some additional questions emerged during this study firstly the concentration of anions in urine can vary greatly putnam 1971 making it difficult to estimate the point of exhaustion of the resin i e when most of the anions in urine would have been replaced by oh secondly the ion exchanger removed considerable amounts of p from fresh urine during regeneration this p could be eluted from the resin matrix and concentrated in post treatment operations to ensure complete recovery of p from urine thirdly the resin used in this study provides unique functionality it removes cl ions from urine previous studies have indicated that regular application of urine as a fertiliser may result in soil salinization and affect the growth of salt sensitive plants mnkeni et al 2008 these are aspects that future studies should investigate there could also be practical challenges in implementing ion exchangers at the household level for instance while users could service the system themselves this would require knowledge dissemination and operator training another option could be to setup a semi decentralised system facilitated by a service provider that installs replaces and regenerates the ion exchange cartridges at households in either case costs related to manufacturing the resin cartridges the regenerant transport distances and frequency skilled labour etc will affect the financial sustainability of the system although the market value of the fertiliser products from new sanitation systems is low there are significant benefits of integrating such systems with centralised treatment plant operations jimenez et al 2015 local collection of urine nutrients can result in more efficient removal of nitrogen at centralised treatment plants wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 in that case having centralised treatment plants as system stakeholders and subsidise a portion of the costs of servicing the new system could be one option 3 6 2 urine dehydrator the present study used wood ash and alkalised biochar as the dehydration media wood ash is a waste product originating primarily from power wood and paper industries sweden for instance produces 800 000 tonnes of ash of which 300 000 tonnes is pure wood ash that can be recycled emilsson 2006 based on the results of our study there is enough wood ash in sweden to dehydrate the urine produced each year by 92 of the swedish population if treatment ash 50 is used biochar is another interesting option for dehydrating urine since there are several co benefits of applying it to soils as a conditioner or amender lehmann 2007 however using koh for alkalising biochar could be a limiting factor here there is room for further research as less expensive and more widely available alkalising agents could be used for producing alkalised biochar in a urine dehydrating sanitation system sustaining alkalinity is necessary for stabilising urea and recovering nitrogen during dehydration hence a major limiting factor when operating such a system is the ph drop of the dehydration media the rate at which this ph decreases depends on several factors such as the type and amount of dehydration media the volume of urine added to the media and the dehydration rate achieved which in turn is influenced by additional factors e g temperature air flow rate some of which this study evaluated and modelled in turn this determines how long a urine dehydrator can be operated and the final nutrient concentration of the dry fertiliser produced in the present study since the objective was to reduce the volume of urine the optimisation studies were designed to maximise the dehydration rate of urine despite achieving appreciable nutrient recovery across the investigated treatments further optimisation studies will be necessary to maximise nitrogen recovery during dehydration 4 conclusions this study evaluated the effectiveness of an ion exchange resin to alkalise human urine results indicated that when 75 v v of the urine passed through the resin ph of the composite mixture of ion exchanged and fresh urine was 10 although the resin was effective in promoting alkalisation of urine some p 35 bound to the resin and thus was not available during dehydration large resin requirements 20 v v may however limit its practical application a sieve based setup to dehydrate urine using wood ash and alkalised biochar was developed in the three different dehydration treatments investigated 90 volume reduction 70 n retention and 100 recovery of p and k was accomplished using wood ash as the dehydration media when the dehydrator was operated at a temperature of 50 c air flow rate of 1 l min 1 and inlet air humidity of 20 a high urine dehydration rate 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 was obtained this suggested that in just 4 2 days of the dehydrator being operated and with 10 kg of wood ash the entire monthly urine production of a household with four members could be dehydrated by using a response surface cubic model the influence of various parameters affecting the rate of urine dehydration was investigated it was found that increasing the dehydration temperature and volume of urine added and decreasing the amount of ash placed in the sieve and air flow rate yielded high dehydration rates acknowledgements this study received funding from the

19477,in urine separating sanitation systems bacterial urease enzymes can hydrolyse urea to ammonia during the pipe transport and storage of urine the present study investigated whether it was possible to reduce the urine volume without losing the nitrogen as ammonia a method for stabilising the urine prior to dehydration was developed briefly fresh human urine was stabilised by passage through an anion exchanger added to an alkaline media wood ash or alkalised biochar and dehydrated urine dehydration was investigated at three temperatures 40 45 and 50 c the influence of various factors affecting the dehydration process was modelled and the rate of urine dehydration was optimised results indicated that 75 v v of the urine has to pass through the ion exchanger for alkaline stabilisation of urine to occur at all investigated temperatures the dehydrator accomplished 90 volume reduction of ion exchanged urine 70 n retention and 100 recovery of p and k to realise high degree of nutrient valorisation this study proposes combining source separation of human urine with alkaline dehydration graphical abstract fresh urine was passed through an ion exchanger stabilised by alkalisation ph 10 and added to an alkaline media wood ash alkalised biochar and dehydrated image 1 keywords decentralised sanitation ion exchange response surface optimisation urease urea stabilisation urine dehydration 1 introduction new sanitation systems based on source separation of human urine offer the exciting prospect of creating and establishing a new sustainability paradigm in wastewater management guest et al 2009 this emerging paradigm seeks to challenge the rationale of current approaches to wastewater collection treatment disposal and reuse if it exists larsen et al 2009 conventional sanitation systems are designed and operated on the presumption as well as perception that human excreta are wastes this consideration is subsequently used to justify its disposal esrey et al 2001 however sewer networks connecting household toilets with centralised treatment plants utilise potable water to mediate the transport of excreta thereby magnifying the volume of waste at the end of the pipe lettinga et al 2001 this is paradoxical because if human excreta are indeed waste streams it is surprising that reducing its volume in the environment is not a treatment objective of conventional sanitation systems in the eu however municipal solid waste management a utility that shares several similarities with sanitation does operate according to a hierarchy where reducing waste generation is considered the ultimate management option ec 2016 such a hierarchy of treatment options has not been applied to wastewater management the exception being household demand side measures that reduce water consumption inman and jeffrey 2006 another growing concern is the continuity of agricultural production to meet the demands of a resource scarce yet growing world population fao 2017 in this regard human excreta especially urine has been proposed as an alternative to chemical fertilisers as a source of plant nutrients winker et al 2009 however urine contains only 0 6 n vinnerås et al 2006 and is an aqueous dilute fertiliser in comparison to chemical fertilisers such as urea 46 n or ammonium nitrate 35 n kirchmann and pettersson 1994 taking into account that per capita urine generation is 550 kg yr 1 vinnerås et al 2006 and that the world population is approximately 7 5 billion the annual urine load that needs to be safely handled treated and assimilated in the environment is more than 4000 million tonnes waterless urine diverting toilets that separately collect human urine and faeces at source are in use in several parts of the world von münch and winker 2011 cheng et al 2018 however storing transporting and applying large volumes of collected urine as a liquid fertiliser can pose financial and logistical burden on users of urine recycling systems johansson et al 2001 while recycling urine one problem is the hydrolysis of urea which occurs during the pipe transport and storage of urine catalysed by the bacterial enzyme urease urea amidohydrolase krajewska 2009 the bacteria producing urease are ubiquitous and can trigger mineral precipitation in urine collecting systems causing pipe blockages and maintenance issues udert et al 2003 the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea is however strongly dependent on the ph of the solution sissons et al 1990 reported that around ph 9 urease activity falls to less than 10 of its maximum while kabdaşlı et al 2006 observed no urea hydrolysis at ph 10 recent studies have demonstrated that stabilising urine with wood ash dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 and lime randall et al 2016 inhibits urea hydrolysis ion exchange resins have been used previously for the selective removal or recovery of compounds from polluted water and wastewater milmile et al 2011 ion exchangers have also been used for recovering nutrients from source separated urine o neal and boyer 2013 tarpeh et al 2017 2018 o neal and boyer 2013 were able to selectively adsorb phosphate from synthetic urine solution using anion exchange resin impregnated with hydrous ferric oxide nanoparticles tarpeh et al 2017 investigated the use of cation exchange resins for recovery of ammonium from hydrolysed urine tarpeh et al 2018 demonstrated the feasibility of anion and cation exchangers for the recovery of n and k from hydrolysed urine despite these studies on ion exchange of urine some research gaps exist previous investigations focused on using ion exchange resins for nutrient recovery from synthetic hydrolysed urine to the best knowledge of the authors anion exchange resins have not been applied for alkalising and stabilising fresh human urine human urine contains several anions such as hco 3 cl no 3 po 4 3 and so 4 2 putnam 1971 ferslew et al 2001 table s1 the concentration of cl ions as nacl is relatively large when compared to the rest of the ions present in urine thus one approach to increase the ph of urine to levels required for urea stabilisation 10 geinzer 2017 could be to use an anion exchange resin that exchanges cl ions in urine with hydroxide ions oh in order to reduce the volume of urine dehydration technologies have been the subject of recent investigations antonini et al 2012 dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 convective air drying is a relatively simple technological operation used extensively in several industries especially for food preservation mcminn and magee 1999 water constitutes more than 95 of the volume of human urine putnam 1971 in principle this water can be removed to a large extent by heating urine and forcing a current of air over its surface in practice however evaporation of human urine is inhibited by a thin oily film that forms over the liquid surface tettenborn et al 2007 ventilation would also result in the loss of n as nh3 jönsson et al 2000 dehydrating human urine is therefore a process challenge since the objectives of volume reduction and nutrient stabilisation need to be realised simultaneously as illustrated in fig 1 the use of an alkaline media over which stabilised urine is spread can circumvent the formation of oil films dutta and vinnerås 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 subsequently dehydrating urine by convective heat and mass transfer can remove water while the media retains urine nutrients hence the broader question this study seeks to answer is whether human urine can be dehydrated to produce a dry fertiliser the specific objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effectiveness of anion exchange to alkalise human urine ii investigate the possibility of reducing the volume of alkalised urine through alkaline dehydration by designing a dehydrator that removes 90 of urine s water content and assess the nutrient recovery potential of the combination of anion exchange and alkaline dehydration and iii identify understand and optimise the functional relationship between parameters that affect dehydration and the rate of urine dehydration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fresh human urine was collected in sterile 1 l polypropylene bottles urine was obtained anonymously from both men and women 10 persons 24 65 years old at different times of the day freshly collected urine was used immediately in experiments studying the ion exchange of urine in the urine drying experiments fresh urine and ion exchanged urine was stored at 3 1 c for 1 week prior to use the urine was brought to room temperature 20 0 5 c industrial grade amberlite ira410 type 2 resin merck chemicals gmbh darmstadt germany was used to exchange the anions present in urine with oh ions the resin comprised of spherical beads harmonic mean ø 0 60 0 75 mm 1 1 data available from manufacturer of styrene divinylbenzene copolymer with dimethyl ethanol ammonium functional group r n c 2 h 5 2 c 2 h 5 oh and had an exchange capacity 1 of 1 25 eq l 1 for dehydrating human urine wood ash and alkalised biochar were used as the dehydration media ash produced from the burning of birch wood used for domestic heating in uppsala sweden was collected sieved ø 1 mm and thermally treated at 500 c for 5 h in a furnace lh30 12 nabertherm gmbh germany biochar was manufactured through pyrolysis 450 c of chopped willow trees salix grown in germany and sieved to ø 1 mm to increase the ph of the biochar to 12 5 the procedure suggested by tseng and tseng 2005 was used koh pellets and biochar were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 4 dissolved using deionised water and kept aside for 1 h to ensure uniform dissolution subsequently the mixture was oven dried overnight at 110 c and used in further experiments 2 2 experimental setup the objective of the first set of experiments was to test the resin s efficiency in alkalising urine fig 1 experiments were performed to estimate the minimum volume of the sub sample of urine that needed to be ion exchanged in order for the mixture of ion exchanged urine and fresh urine to attain a final ph 10 using 50 different fresh urine samples composites comprising 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 of ion exchanged urine mixed with 100 80 60 40 20 and 0 fresh urine respectively were prepared and ph of each composite investigated in the second set of experiment the possibility of reducing the volume of ion exchanged urine through alkaline dehydration was investigated through three treatments performed as singlets wood ash at 40 c ash 40 and 50 c ash 50 and alkalised biochar at 45 c char 45 table 1 these treatments were exploratory in nature and were performed so as to provide insights into the dehydration process and help guide the development of the optimisation model experiment iii the nutrient recovery potential of the treatments was also investigated in the third set of experiments the objective was to identify understand and optimise the functional relationship between parameters that affect dehydration of ion exchanged urine and the rate of dehydration based on dehydration rates obtained in experiment ii wood ash was chosen as the dehydration media a set of 30 dehydration experiments were performed based on a four factorial five level central composite rotary design 2 2 1 experiment i anion exchange of urine fresh urine samples 50 samples 500 ml each were taken and each sample was divided into five equal portions of 100 ml subsequently 20 100 v v fresh urine from each 100 ml portion was ion exchanged using the resin in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml over a magnetic stirrer for 1 2 min based on preliminary studies the resin to urine volume ratio was fixed at 0 2 fig s1 finally the ion exchanged urine was mixed with residual fresh urine to prepare 100 ml urine composites where the anion exchange urine constituted 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 of the total volume fig s2 the ph of the urine composites was monitored using a radiometer electrode phc2011 8 denmark the resin was regenerated by placing 250 ml of 3 w w koh solution on a shaker table at 175 rpm for 1 h followed by washing with deionised water until ph of the wash water reached 9 after every fifth ion exchange experiment the resin was acid washed with 0 1 m h2so4 followed by rinsing with deionised water this was done to remove any struvite that could have precipitated over the resin cf williams 1999 2 2 2 experiment ii urine dehydration setup and procedure urine dehydration was performed in a modified benchtop incubator electrolux sweden with inbuilt cavity of 470 330 580 mm and adjustable temperature setting of 30 60 c two circulating fans cf1 and cf2 were installed to ensure uniform heat distribution in the incubator cavity fig 2 an air pump p1 was introduced to remove moisture laden air while a flow meter fm1 and a gate valve v1 regulated the air flow rate all parts of the setup were interconnected using 10 mm polypropylene pipes supported with steel wire temperature was monitored using three ss 304 probes with ds18b20 1 wire temperature sensors embedded data systems llc usa the probes measured temperature in the range between 55 and 125 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c fig 2 in each dehydration treatment pre treated ash or biochar 1 ø 0 25 mm was spread uniformly over a 250 μm sieve inner ø 19 8 cm that was placed at the centre of the incubator since these treatments were exploratory different amounts of dehydration media were used although the surface area available for dehydration was fixed the incubator temperature was varied according to the treatment table 1 but air flow rate and humidity were held constant at 1 l min 1 and 20 measured at 20 0 5 c respectively subsequently based on results from experiment i 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was added to the dehydration media in a fed batch procedure the weight loss was monitored periodically using a scale kern kb 2000 2nm germany 0 01 g precision dehydration was performed until 90 of the moisture was removed at which point a new batch of 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was fed to the same media therefore in each treatment urine was added several times table 1 to monitor the change in alkalinity 5 g dehydration media was withdrawn diluted with 25 ml deionised water and ph1 5 was measured using a radiometer electrode phc2011 8 denmark following the measurement the media and water were returned to the sieve all three dehydration treatments were performed until ph1 5 declined to 10 5 at which point the media was considered to be saturated with nutrients to compare the performance of the three treatments their dehydration rate l day 1m 2 was calculated this expressed the volume l of urine dehydrated in one day and in one square meter of the dehydration media 2 2 3 experiment iii response surface optimisation of urine dehydration rate since urine dehydration is likely to be influenced by several parameters that can be measured controlled and adjusted response surface methodology rsm was employed with the objective of optimising the urine dehydration rate in wood ash a four factorial five level central composite

dehydrator fig 2 a set of 30 experiments were performed as suggested by the software table s5 in each experiment 75 v v ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite was added once to wood ash placed in a 250 μm sieve and dehydrated until 90 moisture was removed the sequence of the 30 experiments was randomised as suggested by the software to counteract any potential effect of uncontrolled parameters since the same sieve was used throughout surface area available for dehydration was kept constant whereas the distance between the surface and the edge of the sieve varied with the amount of ash added the output response from the model y expressed the dehydration rate of urine l day 1m 2 using the generalised equation for response surface cubic models eq 1 the functional relationship between the

set to help guide the desirability function development maximum incubator temperature and urine addition minimum ash addition to sieve and air flow rate 2 3 sampling and physicochemical analysis to determine the initial properties and nutrient composition 1 v v of urine was cumulatively collected and refrigerated at 20 c total nitrogen total phosphorous and ammonium nitrogen were analysed using spectroquant test kits and a nova 60 photometer following the instructions provided by the supplier merck kgaa darmstadt germany test kits 14763 12543 and 14544 for tot n tot p and nh4 n respectively urine was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter sarstedt germany prior to analysis the dehydration media was characterised before and after the treatments for the following parameters a tot n and

exchange of urine ph of fresh urine varied from 5 5 to 7 3 with a mean value of 6 5 0 5 n 50 the ph as a result of anion exchange of fixed proportions of urine 20 100 v v passing through the resin varied from 8 1 0 8 to 11 2 0 6 fig 3 the increase in ph correlated well with the volume of urine that was ion exchanged r 2 0 95 p 0 001 the rationale behind treating different portions of fresh urine with the resin was twofold i to estimate the minimum amount of urine that needed to be ion exchanged so as to increase ph 10 and ii to minimise the number of times the resin needed to be regenerated based on the linear relationship between volume of anion exchanged urine and ph of the urine composite p h c o m p o s i t e 0 91 f e x 6 13 r 2 0 96 it could be suggested that at least 75

urine composites with ph of 10 2 0 5 were prepared and used the dehydration was performed until ph1 5 of the dehydration media decreased to 10 5 at this point the total volume of urine added to 175 100 and 125 g of the media in treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 was 1 80 1 55 and 1 42 l respectively this gives an addition of 10 3 15 5 and 11 4 ml urine per g dehydration media for treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively in ash 40 the average dehydration rate was found to be 6 6 0 4 l day 1m 2 table s2 at 50 c ash 50 the average dehydration rate was highest 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 and thus the average dehydration time the shortest 192 min table s3 in char 45 adding 50 ml urine to 125 g of biochar yielded a low dehydration rate 5 2 1 1 l day 1m 2 in comparison to the two ash treatments since biochar pores can store and retain water brewer and brown 2012 the urine addition rate was increased to 100 ml per run this increased the dehydration rate to 6 4 0 6 l day 1m 2 table s4 the dehydration capacity of the treatments at saturation ph 10 5 was evaluated by considering the total volume of urine that had been cumulatively added to 1 kg media and the time required for dehydrating that amount of urine in ash 40 1 kg ash could dehydrate 9 2 l urine at 40 c in 8 days while 13 5 l urine could be dehydrated in 1 kg alkalised biochar in 7 2 days when the dehydrator was operated at 45 c fig 4 the highest dehydration capacity and the shortest drying time was observed in ash 50 here 1 kg ash could dehydrate 15 2 l of urine in 4 2 days at 50 c it was found that if treatments ash 40 and char 45 are used 1 kg dehydration media is sufficient to dehydrate the cumulative volume of urine excreted daily by one person fig 4 the dehydration times varied between the three treatments on account of different urine media ratios and different temperatures used in the treatments differences in material properties e g water holding capacity porosity thermal conductivity may also have influenced the dehydration times within the treatments the time required to dehydrate urine varied over the course of the treatment tables s2 s4 and this could be mainly due to two factors firstly the dehydration was considered complete when 90 moisture was removed from the media since urine was added several times to the same media and dehydrated residual moisture gradually accumulated secondly the addition of urine to the media may have caused it to compact and loose porosity the compaction would have occurred until an equilibrium height was attained presumably compaction reduces voidage which is inversely proportional to the heat and mass transfer coefficients dwivedi and upadhyay 1977 this trend was observed during the initial dehydration experiments e g experiments 1 4 in ash 40 or 1 5 in ash 50 where the first dehydration experiment always provided the least dehydration rate across all treatments tables s2 s4 3 3 mass and nutrient balance during anion exchange and dehydration to establish the volume reduction accomplished through dehydration and nutrient recovery through inhibition of urea hydrolysis alkalinisation a mass balance was carried out fig 5 in all the three treatments urine volume reduction 2 2 volume reduction is measured by monitoring the change in mass of the mixture of urine and dehydration media of 90 was achieved since the urine media ratio varied between treatments the concentration factor defined in this study as the ratio of the total urine dehydrated by a given initial amount of dehydration media was calculated it was found to be higher in ash 50 15 5 than ash 40 10 3 and char 45 11 4 hence to dehydrate the urine excreted by one person in a year 550 kg urine yr 1 vinnerås et al 2006 55 33 and 37 kg dehydration media would be required if treatments ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 are respectively used in a urine dehydrator in effect this suggests that using a urine dehydrator could produce 30 60 kg of nutrient rich dry product instead of 550 kg of liquid waste urine each year in the anion exchanger three losses occurred fig 5 firstly there was a change in density of the urine as heavier cl 35 g mol 1 ions were substituted by lighter oh 17 g mol 1 ions however even if all the cl in urine was exchanged 8 4 g l 1 according to putnam 1971 this would result in 4 g l 1 decrease in mass secondly p content of urine decreased by over 35 this was probably due to precipitation of struvite mgnh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o over the resin and some amorphous calcium phosphate ca 3 po 4 2 and octacalcium phosphate ca 8 h 2 po 4 6 5 h 2 o that could form in alkaline solutions udert et al 2003 the resin could also have adsorbed po 4 3 ions from urine tarpeh et al 2018 thirdly subjecting fresh urine to anion exchange resulted in some loss of n 3 6 this may be attributed to volatilisation of free nh4 n at high ph as approximately 5 of the n is excreted as nh3 since the ion exchange resin was stored in koh prior to use and was washed with deionised water only until ph 9 the ion exchanger also functioned to increase the k content in the end product after dehydration not all of the n from the ion exchanged urine could be recovered based on the tot n concentrations in ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite and the dehydration media 77 74 and 72 n was retained during dehydration in ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively increasing the incubator temperature from 40 c ash 40 to 50 c ash 50 resulted in less than 5 increase in n loss but resulted in considerably higher dehydration rate 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 as compared to 6 6 0 4 l day 1m 2 figs 4 and 5 within the temperature range investigated in this study 40 50 c urea hydrolysis is the primary reason for n losses during dehydration as discussed elsewhere zhigang et al 2008 randall et al 2016 senecal and vinnerås 2017 this hydrolysis can be catalysed biologically urease chemically ph 12 and or thermally 38 c zerner 1991 the most effective catalyst is the urease enzyme which is 108 times faster in degrading urea than chemical hydrolysis at 65 c and ph 12 callahan et al 2005 warner 1942 thus inhibiting enzyme activity during dehydration is more important than inhibiting chemical hydrolysis with uniform alkaline ph 10 in the dehydration media there should not be any significant biochemical activity and the loss of urea n due to enzymatic hydrolysis should have been minimal as suggested by randall et al 2016 however some n is assumed lost to chemical hydrolysis during the treatment period when the ph of the media was above 12 at ph 12 an elimination reaction occurs that yields ammonia and cyanic acid eq 2 a b blakeley et al 1982 this reaction is catalysed by oh and would proceed to hydrolyse urea in high ph environments such as that present in dehydration media at the start of the treatment 2a nh 2 co nh 2 oh nh 2 co nh h 2 o 2b nh 2 co nh h 2 o chno nh 3 oh based on the formula for urea loss by hydrolysis put forward by senecal and vinnerås 2017 p 653 0 5 n would have been lost in treatment ash 40 due to non enzymatic urea hydrolysis since the urine was not exposed for a long time 8 days to either elevated ph or temperature the reasons for higher losses of n were not identified and further detailed studies are required to evaluate this in all three dehydration treatments there was complete recovery of p from the ion exchanged urine fresh urine composite fig 5 complete recovery of k is also assumed since it is non volatile at the investigated temperatures the forms in which p and k were retained was not investigated in this study although it is likely that some of the p precipitated as struvite mgnh 4 po 4 6 h 2 o and hydroxyapatite ca 10 po 4 6 oh 2 udert et al 2003 the presence of mg in both wood ash 23 0 6 g kg 1 and untreated biochar 0 63 0 04 g kg 1 may have induced supersaturation and subsequently precipitation of the minerals 3 4 change in alkalinity the limiting factor during urine dehydration the initial ph of wood ash and alkalised biochar was measured to be 12 9 13 0 and 12 6 in ash 40 ash 50 and char 45 respectively the ph of 75 v v ion exchanged fresh urine composites added to these treatments varied as 10 2 0 5 over the course of the treatments the ph1 5 of the dehydration media decreased as more urine was added to the same media fig 6 in comparison to the two other treatments ash 50 dehydrated more urine per g dehydration media 16 ml g 1 before reaching the threshold ph of 10 5 this was probably because ash 50 was subjected to air exchange co 2 absorption for lesser time duration on account higher temperature and faster dehydration rates that in ash 40 or char 45 in an earlier study senecal and vinnerås 2017 observed that the drop in ph1 5 of wood ash when dehydrating deionised water and human urine was very similar a plausible explanation for the drop in alkalinity is that as air passes over the urine filled media co 2 gets absorbed and dissolved resulting in an increase in h concentration eq 3 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 hco 3 h co 3 2 2 h the relative concentrations of co 2 aq carbonic acid h 2 co 3 bicarbonate hco 3 and carbonate co 3 2 during the absorption of co 2 g by aqueous solutions is a function of the solution temperature and ph wolf gladrow et al 2007 in high ph environments such as that in the dehydration media ph1 5 at t 0 is 12 5 co 3 2 is the dominant species in the dehydrator as more air exchange occurs over time and more co 2 is absorbed by the media co 2 aq increases and h 2 co 3 forms decreasing the media ph in that case the equilibrium eq 3 would gradually shift towards the right increasing hco 3 and h any reaction that removes co 3 2 from the equilibrium would drive the process further ultimately resulting in more h production mitchell et al 2009 one such reaction could have been with alkaline earth metals that are present in both urine and the dehydration media according to putnam 1971 urine contains ca2 30 90 mg l 1 and mg2 20 205 mg l 1 initial elemental analysis performed on the dehydration media showed that these metals also occurred in the wood ash 241 9 g ca kg 1 23 1 g mg kg 1 and to a lesser extent in the biochar 1 55 0 08 g ca kg 1 0 63 0 04 g mg kg 1 another process that reduced the ph is the degradation of urea by hydrolysis hence the primary factors influencing alkalinity during dehydration could be carbonic acid formation due to co2 absorption intrinsic urine and extrinsic media buffering action of alkaline earth metals and ammonia weak base formation from degradation of urea in urine 3 5 optimisation of urine dehydration rate 3 5 1 development of the response surface cubic model to optimise the dehydrator operation this study used response surface methodology to identify the relationship between the dehydration rate y and x 1 incubator temperature x 2 air flow rate x 3 amount of ash placed in the sieve and x 4 volume of urine added to the ash non linear regression of experimental data against eq 1 revealed that model terms x 1 x 3 and x 1 2 x 3 were highly significant x 3 2 was moderately significant and x 2 x 1 2 and x 1 x 2 2 were of low significance table s6 ignoring the contribution of non significant factors reduced the cubic model to 4 d e h y d r a t i o n r a t e 6 202 0 613 t e m p e r a t u r e 0 304 a i r f

a s h the statistical validity of the response surface model was verified by the test for lack of fit where the p values were found to be low p 0 05 table s6 the developed model accounted for more than 92 of the variability in the experimental data the coefficient of variation cv 6 6 and adequate precision 4 values confirmed that the difference between predicted and experimental dehydration rates was minimal fig s4 3 5 2 influence of process parameters on dehydration rate in convective hot air drying the dehydration rate and temperature usually display a positive relationship since temperature is a driving force for heat and mass transfer menzies and o callaghan 1971 this was also observed in experiment iii as increasing the temperature from 38 to 42 c increased the dehydration rate from 4 to 6 5 l day 1m 2 respectively fig 7 a and b increasing the temperature allowed quicker removal of moisture from the ash surface which in turn decreased drying time at constant temperature and relative humidity air flow rate did not significantly affect the dehydration rate fig 7c and d increasing the air flow rate up to 0 75 l min 1 data not shown in the figure increased the dehydration rate but an inverse relationship was displayed when the setup was operated at flow rates 0 75 l min 1 the lowest dehydration rate 5 1 l day 1m 2 was observed at the highest air flow rate 1 5 l min 1 similar observations have been made by others working with the drying of natural materials yaldýz and ertekýn 2001 toğrul and pehlivan 2003 in the present study although the incubator was initially set to a fixed temperature variations in air flow rate were observed to have an effect on temperature development in the incubator cavity at low air flow rates the time required for establishing the set temperature in the incubator was observed to be less than that at higher air flow rates according to toğrul and pehlivan 2003 at high air flow rates turbulence and flow channelling may occur the amount of ash and the urine dehydration rate were negatively correlated r 2 0 86 p 0 005 fig 7 b e by placing more ash in the sieve the bed depth increased this in turn reduced the surface to volume ratio available for dehydration perhaps in experiments with high ash addition water was removed from the ash surface but higher bed depths meant poor removal of water trapped below the surface resulting in low dehydration rates in conventional drying techniques such as the one used in this study it is easier to remove water from the surface of the material than water trapped within it zhang et al 2006 wang and xi 2005 for a fixed amount of ash 150 g placed in the sieve increasing the addition of urine from 40 to 80 ml increased the dehydration rate from 5 4 to 6 4 l day 1m 2 fig 7 c f increasing the volumetric addition of urine affected the dehydration in two ways i it increased the moisture content in the ash which in turn provided the driving force to overcome mass transfer resistance and ii it reduced voidage in the dehydration bed the thermal conductivity of wood ash air and water at 40 c is 0 047 0 027 and 0 574 w m 1k 1 aduda 1987 respectively and that of urine 24 t 38 c is 0 56 w m 1k 1 poppendiek et al 1967 presumably a bed with large fraction of its volume occupied by voids would be more prone to resist heat and mass transfer 3 5 3 numerical optimisation identifying optimal dehydration conditions numerical optimisation was performed according to a pre determined set of constraints table s8 and provided the optimal operating conditions for the urine dehydrator the model predicted a dehydration rate of 6 7 l day 1m 2 when 100 g wood ash was placed in the sieve at an incubator temperature of 41 4 c air flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 and when 80 ml urine was added to the ash table s9 3 6 implementation potential and challenges 3 6 1 anion exchanger alkalisation by anion exchange offers an interesting approach to stabilise urea n in urine the resin used in the present study functioned to increase the ph of fresh urine 7 to levels required for stabilisation 10 however alkalising urine required a large amount of resin to treat the urine produced by a family of four over 1 week our results indicate that 8 2 l of amberlite ira410 type 2 resin would be required on a weekly basis tarpeh et al 2017 have estimated that 5 3 19 l of ion exchange adsorbents are required for recovering nitrogen from source separated urine while the resin could be regenerated this would require supplying storing and using strong alkalis alternatively commonly available household alkaline agents such as caustic soda limewater or milk of magnesia could be used as the regenerant this could however introduce unwanted impurities in the resin matrix and reduce its exchange capacity some additional questions emerged during this study firstly the concentration of anions in urine can vary greatly putnam 1971 making it difficult to estimate the point of exhaustion of the resin i e when most of the anions in urine would have been replaced by oh secondly the ion exchanger removed considerable amounts of p from fresh urine during regeneration this p could be eluted from the resin matrix and concentrated in post treatment operations to ensure complete recovery of p from urine thirdly the resin used in this study provides unique functionality it removes cl ions from urine previous studies have indicated that regular application of urine as a fertiliser may result in soil salinization and affect the growth of salt sensitive plants mnkeni et al 2008 these are aspects that future studies should investigate there could also be practical challenges in implementing ion exchangers at the household level for instance while users could service the system themselves this would require knowledge dissemination and operator training another option could be to setup a semi decentralised system facilitated by a service provider that installs replaces and regenerates the ion exchange cartridges at households in either case costs related to manufacturing the resin cartridges the regenerant transport distances and frequency skilled labour etc will affect the financial sustainability of the system although the market value of the fertiliser products from new sanitation systems is low there are significant benefits of integrating such systems with centralised treatment plant operations jimenez et al 2015 local collection of urine nutrients can result in more efficient removal of nitrogen at centralised treatment plants wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 in that case having centralised treatment plants as system stakeholders and subsidise a portion of the costs of servicing the new system could be one option 3 6 2 urine dehydrator the present study used wood ash and alkalised biochar as the dehydration media wood ash is a waste product originating primarily from power wood and paper industries sweden for instance produces 800 000 tonnes of ash of which 300 000 tonnes is pure wood ash that can be recycled emilsson 2006 based on the results of our study there is enough wood ash in sweden to dehydrate the urine produced each year by 92 of the swedish population if treatment ash 50 is used biochar is another interesting option for dehydrating urine since there are several co benefits of applying it to soils as a conditioner or amender lehmann 2007 however using koh for alkalising biochar could be a limiting factor here there is room for further research as less expensive and more widely available alkalising agents could be used for producing alkalised biochar in a urine dehydrating sanitation system sustaining alkalinity is necessary for stabilising urea and recovering nitrogen during dehydration hence a major limiting factor when operating such a system is the ph drop of the dehydration media the rate at which this ph decreases depends on several factors such as the type and amount of dehydration media the volume of urine added to the media and the dehydration rate achieved which in turn is influenced by additional factors e g temperature air flow rate some of which this study evaluated and modelled in turn this determines how long a urine dehydrator can be operated and the final nutrient concentration of the dry fertiliser produced in the present study since the objective was to reduce the volume of urine the optimisation studies were designed to maximise the dehydration rate of urine despite achieving appreciable nutrient recovery across the investigated treatments further optimisation studies will be necessary to maximise nitrogen recovery during dehydration 4 conclusions this study evaluated the effectiveness of an ion exchange resin to alkalise human urine results indicated that when 75 v v of the urine passed through the resin ph of the composite mixture of ion exchanged and fresh urine was 10 although the resin was effective in promoting alkalisation of urine some p 35 bound to the resin and thus was not available during dehydration large resin requirements 20 v v may however limit its practical application a sieve based setup to dehydrate urine using wood ash and alkalised biochar was developed in the three different dehydration treatments investigated 90 volume reduction 70 n retention and 100 recovery of p and k was accomplished using wood ash as the dehydration media when the dehydrator was operated at a temperature of 50 c air flow rate of 1 l min 1 and inlet air humidity of 20 a high urine dehydration rate 11 9 1 l day 1m 2 was obtained this suggested that in just 4 2 days of the dehydrator being operated and with 10 kg of wood ash the entire monthly urine production of a household with four members could be dehydrated by using a response surface cubic model the influence of various parameters affecting the rate of urine dehydration was investigated it was found that increasing the dehydration temperature and volume of urine added and decreasing the amount of ash placed in the sieve and air flow rate yielded high dehydration rates acknowledgements this study received funding from the

19478,modified phosphogypsum mpg was developed to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge and dewatering performance properties of treated sludge composition and morphology distribution of eps dynamic analysis and multiple regression model on bound water release were investigated the results showed that addition of mpg caused extracellular polymeric substances eps disintegration through charge neutralization destruction of eps promoted the formation of larger sludge flocs and the release of bound water into supernatant simultaneously content of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in soluble eps sb eps increased with increasing of eps dissolved into the liquid phase besides about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment with 40 ds mpg dosage additionally a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established showing that lower loosely bond eps lb eps content and specific resistance of filtration srf may improve dehydration performance and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge dewatering extracellular polymeric substances fractal dimension binding energy 1 introduction large amount of sewage sludge generated from the urban waste water treatment plants wwtp has had a great impact on the environment due to the defects of sludge in subsequent utilization chen 2013 meanwhile transport of bulk sludge has caused serious economic burden because of the higher water content of sludge de luca et al 2014 in wwtp sludge with high moisture content more than 99 could be reduced to 80 through the common dehydration methods such as a combined treatment with chemical agents and mechanical filtration guan et al 2012 to our best knowledge sludge is a stable colloid system in which lots of water is wrapped around the sludge particles by organics and cannot be easily released into the free water phase chen et al 2015 thus it is very difficult to further dewater sludge undoubtedly 80 of water content will still hinder the subsequent disposal of sludge and is also a problem to be solved therefore it is necessary to increase the proportion of dry solids in sludge in order to promote the disposal of sludge ye et al 2011 moreover developing high performance dewatering process is essential to reduce the volume of sludge so far many efforts have been made to develop the effective methods for sludge dewatering and also reveal the dewatering mechanisms scholars have attempted to explain the reason of poor sludge dewatering through designing water structure in sludge as being unbound water free water usually account for above 70 and bound water capillary bound water surface absorbed water and intracellular bound water kavitha et al 2013 free water is dispersive in the sludge particles and can be removed easily by gravity concentration capillary bound water which is tied between sludge particles through capillary tension is generally being eliminated by higher mechanical pressure or temperature surface absorbed water is adsorbed on the surface of sludge particles through the physical and chemical stress higher mechanical pressure or thermal treatment are mainly used to remove it and intracellular bound water exists in microbial cells maintaining a survival of microbes guan et al 2012 it is found that above three kinds of bound water is tightly trapped in the sludge colloid system and cannot be released into the free water phase li and yu 2014 as is known to all the surface electrical property of sludge particles are negative because those particles are enveloped by large amount of substances which are negatively charged and called as eps guan et al 2012 it was reported that eps as the main component of sludge flocs played an important role in binding water tightly to the sludge colloid system and was accepted as one of the major causes of the poor dewaterability of sludge li and yu 2014 eps is primarily composed of macromolecular microbial secretions and the products of both cellular lysis and macromolecule hydrolysis such as protein polysaccharide humic acid dna which accounts for about 60 80 of total sludge mass he et al 2015 furthermore electronegativity of eps is caused mainly by proteins polysaccharide humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical in it rodriguez chueca et al 2014 consequently negatively charged eps directly causes sludge particles to be negatively charged thus forming a stable and electrically exclusive colloid system in the colloid network hydrated sludge structure is maintained and release of water and other components such as proteins polysaccharide and heavy metals are effectively prevented colombo et al 2014 as a result plenty of water is still contained in the dewatered sludge and hinder the subsequent disposal of sludge thus destruction and degradation of eps are proposed to be significant in promoting the release of bound water from sludge focs li and yu 2014 eps has a multilayer structure with rheological properties the inner layer of eps is tightly bound eps tb eps which adhere to the cell wall closely the outer layer is lb eps which disperse in liquid phase with a colloidal state while partial eps dissolved in the supernatant is described as sb eps he et al 2015 it was reported that poor dewatering was closely related to sb eps and lb eps other than tb eps he et al 2015 therefore making investigation on sb eps and lb eps could evaluate the sludge dewatering performance for a few years dewatering processes such as ultrasonic pretreatment microwave treatment kavitha et al 2013 thermo drying segalen et al 2015 flocculant conditioning and biological leaching have been developed colombo et al 2014 as is known to all chemical conditioning has shown high efficiency in sludge dewatering generally speaking chemical agents could destroy the stable colloid system thus leading to the release of bound water into free water phase and improving sludge dewatering kavitha et al 2013 currently organic polymeric flocculant combined with mechanical press are commonly used in sludge dewatering generally largely improving the dewaterability and settleability of sludge and also releasing toxic monomers proved to be harmful to the environment segalen et al 2015 actually organic polymeric flocculant with high viscosity will increase the total viscosity of sludge thus worsening the settling performance of sludge and finally making a poor dewatering tuan and sillappää 2010 it was found that various cationic inorganic flocculant were applied to pretreat sludge seek to improve the dewaterability of sludge huang et al 2016 chen 2013 huang et al 2016 reported that clinoptilolite modified with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide could strengthen dewatering performance of sludge reducing water content of sludge from 87 to 60 chen 2013 found that in dual conditioning on sludge with modified coal fly ash and chitosan the srf reduced by 98 7 and filter cake moisture was 69 0 thus it is feasible to use cationic inorganic flocculant for sludge dewatering phosphogypsum pg generally containing high content of ca si and al released in the wet producing process of phosphoric acid is a solid industrial waste with a mineral structure rashad 2014 lin et al 2015 have mentioned that a novel flocculant combined with silicon aluminum iron and starch is recognized to be efficient in improving dewaterability of sludge thus in consideration of the mineral structure it is possible for pg to be performed as raw materials to prepare pretreatment agent for sludge dewatering in this work pg was modified by cationic surfactant octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride odbac which could change the surface electrical property of pg from negative to positive huang et al 2016 the final products were signed as modified pg mpg as mentioned above mpg pretreatment may be able to destroy the stable sludge colloid system and release bound water into free water phase thus improving sludge dewatering therefore the main objectives of this research are to 1 compare the dewatering performance of sludge before and after pretreatment with pg mpg and traditional flocculant cationic polyacrylamide cpam 2 investigate the effects of mpg pretreatment on sludge properties and morphology of sludge floc 3

data in this paper were represented with means and standard error 2 2 2 sludge pretreatment with different agents pg mpg and cpam pretreatment of sludge was performed in a glass barrel with an agitator at ambient temperature mpg was added into the raw sludge stirring until well combined the optimum pretreatment parameters which lead to a lower moisture content of 62 58 and a lower srf of 3

eps 2 3 5 1 detection of eps content concentration of protein polysaccharide humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical in extracted eps were detected according the approach described by zhang et al 2014 and ou et al 2011 protein was measured with filon hydroxybenzene method using bovine serum albumin as the standard solution zhang et al 2014 polysaccharide and humic acid were measured by anthrone h2so4 colorimetry and dichromate titration respectively zhang et al 2016 besides phosphate radical and sulfate radical were determined using spectrophotometry ou et al 2011 2 3 5 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem excitation emission matrix was measured using fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with a three dimension scan mode the eem data were obtained with scanning emission em wavelength from 300 to 800 nm at 4 nm interval by changing the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 650 nm at 4 nm interval data were recorded at a scan speed of 60000 nm min with a 20 nm of ex and em slit furthermore contour interval in the spectra was 10 zhang et al 2014 have found that location of fluorescence peaks could reflect the organics type while intensity of peaks represented the concentration of organics in samples thus fluorescence peaks could be used to explore the morphology distribution of eps 2 3 5 3 molecular weight distribution of organics molecular weight of organics in eps was measured using electrospray ionization mass spectrometer esi ms 6530b singapore working conditions of which were as follows a capillary voltage of

reactive atmosphere at a sweeping speed of 40 ml min 1 2 3 7 statistics analysis correlation analysis on bound water release and major factors mean diameter lb eps content and srf was carried out using ibm spss statistics 22 0 the linear correlation between bound water release and key factors was estimated with pearson s correlation coefficient r generally speaking correlation was deemed statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval probability p 0 05 xiao et al 2016 multiple linear regression models were built seek to explain relationship between the above factors besides reliability of established models was detected by the following results 1 a regression coefficient r2 should be more than 95 which means it could explicate more than 95 of the variation 2 the residuals which is defined as the difference between the actual and fitting values should follow a normal distribution and independence 3 the p values of all estimated coefficients should be less than 0 05 xiao et al 2016 ince and inel 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of mpg pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance srf were reduced significantly after mpg addition fig s1 a generally speaking a good dewatering performance of sludge could be obtained with a srf value less than 4 1012 m kg 1 while a bad one is found with a higher srf value more than 10 1012 m kg 1 huang et al 2016 besides although cpam sludge showed a better dewaterability compared to raw sludge due to its flocculent capacity a lowest srf value of 3 69 1012 m kg 1 was found in mpg sludge indicating that water in sludge was easy to be removed after mpg treatment fig s1 a meanwhile increase of yn showed an improvement for sludge dewatering it can be seen from fig s1 a almost no change was detected in sludge treated with pg explaining that it was necessary to modify pg into mpg for sludge pretreatment a better filtration performance of mpg sludge was also found in fig s1 b which indicated that more water could be removed from sludge with addition of mpg other than cpam 3 2 effects of mpg addition on sludge properties 3 2 1 zeta potential of sludge after pretreatment with mpg generally zeta potential which is largely affected by eps wrapped around the sludge particles represents the electrical property of sludge zhang et al 2016 with increase of mpg dosage zeta potential changed gradually from negative to positive fig 1 the result can be explained by the opinion that lots of negative charges from eps on the surface of sludge particles were neutralized by positive charges from mpg thus leading to destruction of stable sludge colloid system therefore increasing in zeta potential showed the disintegration of eps xu et al 2017 furthermore more and more sludge particles were kept on the surface of mpg particles through charge neutralization forming large flocs electrical property transition was found till excessive mpg was added to the sludge resulting in a positive potential of sludge besides accumulation of large flocs was interrupted which will lead to a bad dewatering performance many researchers have mentioned that excessive cationic agents will form a stable cationic colloid system which could hinder the release of eps and hydrogen ions into supernatant could bind the bound water tightly in the system thus leading to a terrible sludge dewatering peng et al 2017 yang and li 2009 theoretically optimum dosage was zero potential dosage with which all negative charges in sludge are just neutralized and thus the best dewatering performance could be found murugesan et al 2016 3 2 2 ph and orp of treated sludge ph and orp of sludge showed an obvious change with mpg addition fig 2 originally ph decreased obviously and a minimum 6 01 of ph was obtained with a 100 ds of mpg dosage however with the further increase of mpg more than 100 ds ph increased gradually fig 2 the result revealed that cationic mpg could absorb anion such as hydroxyl ion in sludge supernatant leading to release of hydrogen ion furthermore addition of mpg in sludge will destroy eps and accordingly release lots of proteins and humic acids into the supernatant he et al 2015 it was reported that protein could release hydrogen ions thus increasing the concentration of h in the supernatant fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 while excessive mpg will hinder disintegration of eps and promote release of oh into the supernatant finally leading to increasing of ph fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 revealed that orp could reflect the oxidation reduction properties of substances in solution the higher the orp was the stronger the oxidizing property was with increase of mpg dosage ph decreased while orp increased fig 2 the result showed that the oxidation ability of treated sludge was enhanced which could decompose more organics and promote the release of bound water thus improving sludge dewaterability 3 2 3 morphological properties of sludge flocs with mpg addition normally particles size was decreased upon increasing pretreated agents in the destruction process of stable sludge colloid system and then increased in the re agglomeration process of sludge flocs tuan and sillappää 2010 mean size of sludge particles before and after pretreatment with mpg was 47 and 153 μm respectively furthermore an obvious re flocculation of sludge flocs can be observed fig s2 and larger flocs were generated in the process it was reported that increase of zeta potential would lead to destruction of sludge colloid system then promote flocculation of sludge particles and enlarge the particle size and finally improve sludge dewatering performance rodriguez chueca et al 2014 markis et al 2014 therefore both larger particle size and higher zeta potential were found with mpg addition showing a good dewaterability besides wang et al 2013 have mentioned that the smaller the sludge particles the more the organics and the worse the dewatering performance before and after pretreatment with mpg structure of sludge particles changed from tight to loose fig s3 the raw sludge particles obviously had a relatively smooth and closely surface fig s3 a while after treated with mpg the surface became porous with lots of gullies fig s3 b which were considered to be of great significance for water release in the dewatering process markis et al 2014 fractal dimension df reflects the structure of sludge flocs a higher df is correlated with a compact and dense surface structure wang et al 2013 according to yu and zheng 1995 df of particles is related to its area and perimeter which is described by eq 1 1 a c p 2 d f where a and p are regarded as area and perimeter of particles respectively c is constant subsequently the area and perimeter of particles can be obtained using ipp 6 0 for pixel computing thus df of sludge particles could be easily calculated by eq 1 after pretreatment with mpg df of sludge particles decreased from 1 98 to 1 73 indicating that structure of sludge flocs became loose besides loose structure could facilitate the release of bound water meanwhile compared with raw sludge a strong response to the fluorescence intensity of sludge flocs treated with mpg was observed in fig s4 explaining that df of treated sludge particles decreased obviously 3 2 4 effects of mpg addition on filtrate chemical properties almost the same trends were found from cod color and tds curves fig 3 a with increasing mpg addition cod color and tds in filtrate significantly increased especially in tds these changes could be illustrated by the diversification of chemical substances in filtrate to some extent cod and tds could reflect the amount of organics in filtrate the more organics the more the cod and tds coussot 2014 large amount of eps was destroyed into the supernatant with mpg addition directly leading to increase of organics such as protein polysaccharide and humic substances in filtrate it was reported that humic substances were largely responsible for the filtrate color due to the release of melanoidins and humic acid in humic substances wang and li 2015 therefore it can be found that increase of filtrate color was mainly caused by humic substances that entered into the filtrate together with eps besides excessive mpg will hinder disintegration of eps thus decreasing cod color and tds of filtrate fig 3 a generally speaking decreasing of filtrate turbidity predicated decrease of suspended particles in filtrate obviously with mpg addition amount of filtrate suspended particles decreased rapidly fig 3 b yang and li 2009 found that chemical agents could destroy the stable sludge colloid system into small and dispersed flocs and subsequently promote the re flocculation of sludge flocs through charge neutralization and adsorption bridging yang and li 2009 in the re flocculation process massive suspended particles were captured by large particles to form the larger flocs which were easier to sink and were greatly related to a better dewatering performance finally decreasing amount of suspended particles similarly excessive mpg will certainly hinder the formation of large flocs and further affect the capture to suspended particles 3 3 composition and morphology distribution of eps in sludge under pretreatment with mpg 3 3 1 concentration distribution of components in eps compared with raw sludge the filtrate cod and tds content increased sharply and then decreasing slightly after mpg pretreatment fig 3 a meanwhile the filtrate color increased from 10 to 45 as shown in fig 4 in raw sludge proteins polysaccharide humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical accounted for 78 78 10 74 8 04 1 39 and 1 05 of the total eps respectively a finding reported that biopolymer content in lb eps and sb eps was greatly responsible for sludge dewaterability he et al 2015 the more biopolymer was in sb eps or the less biopolymer was in lb eps the better the dewatering performance was he et al 2015 after mpg pretreatment sb eps content obviously increased with decrease of lb eps content fig 4 the result showed that addition of mpg could effectively crack lb eps surrounding the tb eps into supernatant thus releasing bound water wrapped in lb eps and further increasing sb eps content however for tb eps only humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical content decreased slightly with mpg addition protein and polysaccharide content had no change it was reported that tb eps cannot be destroyed with chemical agent addition due to a huge bondage between tb eps and microbial cells yang and li 2009 meanwhile a study found that tb eps had no contribution to improve sludge dewatering he et al 2015 fig 4 shows that a thorough destruction on lb eps was obtained with mpg dosage ranged from 40 ds to 80 ds and accordingly sb eps content reached the peak besides zhu et al 2013 have mentioned that ratio of protein to polysaccharide signed as pn ps in lb eps was tightly related to sludge dewatering a low ratio showed a good dehydration zhu et al 2013 a lower pn ps was also observed with the same mpg dosage further confirming the optimum mpg dosage for sludge pretreatment fig 5 3 3 2 effects of mpg addition on eps composition distribution it can be seen from fig 6 that mpg pretreatment resulted in obvious decline of fluorescent intensity of organics in lb eps compositions of eps corresponding to those peaks marked in fig 6 were shown in table 2 for raw sludge only aromatic protein like substances protein ⅱ were observed in sb eps while aromatic protein like substances fulvic acid like substances soluble microbial by product like substances and humic acid like substances were found in lb eps fig 6 after pretreatment with 40 ds mpg large amount of organics in lb eps released into supernatant then forming the sb eps the result indicated that with mpg addition sludge flocs were effectively destroyed and organics in lb eps were significantly decomposed and further released into supernatant thus directly leading to increasing of sb eps content additionally composition distribution of tb eps was changed slightly before and after pretreatment further indicating that tb eps played an insignificant role in improving sludge dewatering simultaneously this finding also coincided with the analysis of eps concentration distribution 3 3 3 changes in molecular weight of organics molecular weight of organics in sb eps increased significantly under pretreatment with different mpg dosage 25 ds 40 ds 55 ds fig 7 a with destruction of sludge flocs lb eps was disintegrated and released into the supernatant then leading to a sharp decrease of organics it can be seen from fig 7 b organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in lb eps were reduced sharply under pretreatment with mpg the result expressed that disintegration and decomposition of lb eps leading to the increase of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in sb eps which further indicated that organics especially with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in lb eps was largely responsible for sludge dewatering 3 4 dynamic analysis on sludge dewatering 3 4 1 binding energy eb of bound water in sludge filter cake under pretreatment with mpg eb of bond water in sludge filter cake was defined as the energy required to release this part of water based on the tg dta method richardson et al 1986 it was reported that eb of bond water in sludge filter cake can be quantified by the amount of heat sighed as hpw absorbed by pure water in the constant rate evaporation region richardson et al 1986 foucat and lahaye 2014 relationships between eb and hw are as follows 2 e b dtg p w d t a p w d t a s w d t g s w 1 h p w where d t a p w and d t a s w represent heat gradient of pure water and bond water in sludge filter cake in constant rate evaporation region respectively d t g s w and d t g p w represent mass gradient of pure water and bond water in sludge filter cake in constant rate evaporation region respectively h p w is the gasification latent heat of pure water at 343 15k moreover ratio of dtg pw and dta pw i e dtg p w d t a p w or ratio of dta sw and dtg sw i e d t a s w d t g s w could be calculated by dtg dta curve in constant rate evaporation region expressed with a temperature interval thus it was convenient to calculate eb through tg dta analysis on pure water and sludge sample fig 8 a shows that the constant rate evaporation region of pure water was changed from 337 75k to 339 68k furthermore dtg dta curve corresponding with the constant rate evaporation region was drawn to determine the ratio dtg p w d t a p w subsequently a ratio value of 0 08492 was calculated fig 8 b meantime for raw sludge the constant rate evaporation region lasted from 334 95k to 335 40k and 0 09476 of d t g s w d t a s w value were obtained from fig s5 likewise different d t g s w d t a s w value of different sludge sample with different mpg addition could be calculated using tg dta method and eq 2 foucat and lahaye 2014 suggested that different eb was required to release different water type releasing free water capillary water surface adsorbed water and intracellular bound water needed a minimum eb of 0 5 5 167 278 kj kg 1 respectively foucat and lahaye 2014 moreover according to foucat and lahaye 2014 sludge with a higher moisture content generally more than 90 always has a lower eb value generally lower than 5 kj kg 1 which indicated that capillary water surface adsorbed water and intracellular bound water are still contained in it similarly a higher eb value more than 278 kj kg 1 illustrating that only intracellular bound water is left in sludge and a minimum of 278 kj of energy is needed to release 1 kg water in it thus water type could be determined by eb table 3 shows eb and type of water in sludge filter cake under mpg pretreatment we can find that only surface absorbed water and intracellular bound water were contained in sludge filter cake indicating that capillary bound water could be released into supernatant under mpg pretreatment while excessive mpg will certainly hinder bound water release table 3 these findings were in good agreement with the conclusion that destruction of eps leading to release of bound water 3 4 2 release of bound water in sludge pretreated with different mpg dosage under mpg addition bound water content of sludge filter cake was largely reduced fig 9 with 40 ds of mpg addition bound water content of sludge filter cake decreased from 10 65 to 1 82 kg kg 1ds illustrating that about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment as shown in fig 9 after mpg pretreatment decreasing of bound water content of sludge filter cake led to increase of eb which indicating that the less the bound water content in sludge filter cake the greater the eb was required to release this part of water besides with increase of mpg dosage mean diameter of sludge flocs incereased sharply fig 9 ther result explained that sludge flocs size was significantly responsicble for releasing of bound water the larger the size the more bound water release similarly excessive mpg will lead to a bad dewatering performance consequently it could be considered that sludge dewatering was greatly correlated with bound water release and sludge flocs size 3 5 statistical analyses as mentioned before bound water release was significantly related to lb eps content sludge flocs size and srf additionally a strong positive correlation between bound water release and sludge flocs size r 0 8816 p 0 0025 a negative correlation between bound water release and lb eps content r 0 6618 p 0 02 and a strong negative correlation between bound water release and srf r 0 9876 p 0 00165 were observed respectively table s3 through statistical analysis a multiple linear regression model which indicated the relationship between bound water release and lb eps content sludge flocs size and srf was established and proved to be independent tables s4 s6 regression model was shown as follows 3 w r 9 096 0 03 d m 0 01 c l b e p s 3 756 10 13 s r f where w r represents bound water release kg kgds d m is the mean diameter of sludge flocs μm c l b e p s is the lb eps content mg gvss s r f is the specific resistance of filtration m kg a regression coefficient r2 of 0 982 was obtained illustrating that 98 2 of the variations could be explained by the model table s4 besides the regression square sum accounted for 98 18 of the total square sum indicating that the linear model could explain the vast majority of total square sum and the fitting effect of model was better table s5 meanwhile all estimated variables were proved to be significant with a p value less than 0 05 table s6 as shown in residual plot fig s6 the residuals followed the normal probability distribution and were unbiased and independent due to the appropriate value of durbin watson dw and vif table s4 table s6 thus illustrating that the model was valid as described in eq 3 lower lb eps content and srf may improve dehydration performance while larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering 3 6 environmental and economy benefits analysis it was reported that benefit cost ratio bcr was a highly practical technology to evaluate the benefits and costs of pollution control and a better control effect could be obtained with a bcr value greater than 1 horton et al 2011 certainly the higher the bcr value the better the benefits as shown in table 4 both mpg and cpam could improve sludge dewatering furthermore a higher bcr value of 98 02 was observed with mpg addition indicating that a better environmental and economy benefit can be obtained using mpg pretreatment for sludge dewatering 4 conclusions mpg could effectively disintegrate the stable sludge colloid system and then destroy lb eps and further release bound water into the supernatant with mpg addition large amount of lb eps was disintegrated into the filtrate increasing the amount of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in sb eps concomitantly about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established and proved to be valid according to the model we can find that lower lb eps content and srf may improve dehydration performance and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

19478,modified phosphogypsum mpg was developed to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge and dewatering performance properties of treated sludge composition and morphology distribution of eps dynamic analysis and multiple regression model on bound water release were investigated the results showed that addition of mpg caused extracellular polymeric substances eps disintegration through charge neutralization destruction of eps promoted the formation of larger sludge flocs and the release of bound water into supernatant simultaneously content of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in soluble eps sb eps increased with increasing of eps dissolved into the liquid phase besides about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment with 40 ds mpg dosage additionally a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established showing that lower loosely bond eps lb eps content and specific resistance of filtration srf may improve dehydration performance and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge dewatering extracellular polymeric substances fractal dimension binding energy 1 introduction large amount of sewage sludge generated from the urban waste water treatment plants wwtp has had a great impact on the environment due to the defects of sludge in subsequent utilization chen 2013 meanwhile transport of bulk sludge has caused serious economic burden because of the higher water content of sludge de luca et al 2014 in wwtp sludge with high moisture content more than 99 could be reduced to 80 through the common dehydration methods such as a combined treatment with chemical agents and mechanical filtration guan et al 2012 to our best knowledge sludge is a stable colloid system in which lots of water is wrapped around the sludge particles by organics and cannot be easily released into the free water phase chen et al 2015 thus it is very difficult to further dewater sludge undoubtedly 80 of water content will still hinder the subsequent disposal of sludge and is also a problem to be solved therefore it is necessary to increase the proportion of dry solids in sludge in order to promote the disposal of sludge ye et al 2011 moreover developing high performance dewatering process is essential to reduce the volume of sludge so far many efforts have been made to develop the effective methods for sludge dewatering and also reveal the dewatering mechanisms scholars have attempted to explain the reason of poor sludge dewatering through designing water structure in sludge as being unbound water free water usually account for above 70 and bound water capillary bound water surface absorbed water and intracellular bound water kavitha et al 2013 free water is dispersive in the sludge particles and can be removed easily by gravity concentration capillary bound water which is tied between sludge particles through capillary tension is generally being eliminated by higher mechanical pressure or temperature surface absorbed water is adsorbed on the surface of sludge particles through the physical and chemical stress higher mechanical pressure or thermal treatment are mainly used to remove it and intracellular bound water exists in microbial cells maintaining a survival of microbes guan et al 2012 it is found that above three kinds of bound water is tightly trapped in the sludge colloid system and cannot be released into the free water phase li and yu 2014 as is known to all the surface electrical property of sludge particles are negative because those particles are enveloped by large amount of substances which are negatively charged and called as eps guan et al 2012 it was reported that eps as the main component of sludge flocs played an important role in binding water tightly to the sludge colloid system and was accepted as one of the major causes of the poor dewaterability of sludge li and yu 2014 eps is primarily composed of macromolecular microbial secretions and the products of both cellular lysis and macromolecule hydrolysis such as protein polysaccharide humic acid dna which accounts for about 60 80 of total sludge mass he et al 2015 furthermore electronegativity of eps is caused mainly by proteins polysaccharide humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical in it rodriguez chueca et al 2014 consequently negatively charged eps directly causes sludge particles to be negatively charged thus forming a stable and electrically exclusive colloid system in the colloid network hydrated sludge structure is maintained and release of water and other components such as proteins polysaccharide and heavy metals are effectively prevented colombo et al 2014 as a result plenty of water is still contained in the dewatered sludge and hinder the subsequent disposal of sludge thus destruction and degradation of eps are proposed to be significant in promoting the release of bound water from sludge focs li and yu 2014 eps has a multilayer structure with rheological properties the inner layer of eps is tightly bound eps tb eps which adhere to the cell wall closely the outer layer is lb eps which disperse in liquid phase with a colloidal state while partial eps dissolved in the supernatant is described as sb eps he et al 2015 it was reported that poor dewatering was closely related to sb eps and lb eps other than tb eps he et al 2015 therefore making investigation on sb eps and lb eps could evaluate the sludge dewatering performance for a few years dewatering processes such as ultrasonic pretreatment microwave treatment kavitha et al 2013 thermo drying segalen et al 2015 flocculant conditioning and biological leaching have been developed colombo et al 2014 as is known to all chemical conditioning has shown high efficiency in sludge dewatering generally speaking chemical agents could destroy the stable colloid system thus leading to the release of bound water into free water phase and improving sludge dewatering kavitha et al 2013 currently organic polymeric flocculant combined with mechanical press are commonly used in sludge dewatering generally largely improving the dewaterability and settleability of sludge and also releasing toxic monomers proved to be harmful to the environment segalen et al 2015 actually organic polymeric flocculant with high viscosity will increase the total viscosity of sludge thus worsening the settling performance of sludge and finally making a poor dewatering tuan and sillappää 2010 it was found that various cationic inorganic flocculant were applied to pretreat sludge seek to improve the dewaterability of sludge huang et al 2016 chen 2013 huang et al 2016 reported that clinoptilolite modified with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide could strengthen dewatering performance of sludge reducing water content of sludge from 87 to 60 chen 2013 found that in dual conditioning on sludge with modified coal fly ash and chitosan the srf reduced by 98 7 and filter cake moisture was 69 0 thus it is feasible to use cationic inorganic flocculant for sludge dewatering phosphogypsum pg generally containing high content of ca si and al released in the wet producing process of phosphoric acid is a solid industrial waste with a mineral structure rashad 2014 lin et al 2015 have mentioned that a novel flocculant combined with silicon aluminum iron and starch is recognized to be efficient in improving dewaterability of sludge thus in consideration of the mineral structure it is possible for pg to be performed as raw materials to prepare pretreatment agent for sludge dewatering in this work pg was modified by cationic surfactant octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride odbac which could change the surface electrical property of pg from negative to positive huang et al 2016 the final products were signed as modified pg mpg as mentioned above mpg pretreatment may be able to destroy the stable sludge colloid system and release bound water into free water phase thus improving sludge dewatering therefore the main objectives of this research are to 1 compare the dewatering performance of sludge before and after pretreatment with pg mpg and traditional flocculant cationic polyacrylamide cpam 2 investigate the effects of mpg pretreatment on sludge properties and morphology of sludge floc 3

mass spectrometer esi ms and other analytical methods 4 delve dewatering dynamic by investigating the release of bond water in sludge and binding energy eb of water in sludge 5 make statistics analysis seek to determine the correlation between bound water release and key factors 6 make economic analysis seek to evaluate the practicability and feasibility of mpg pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sludge samples used in this study were collected from kunming wastewater treatment plant kunming china anaerobic anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor 3ambr is used to treat wastewater in this plant and accordingly sludge sample is from the activated sludge process the sludge collected from gravity thickener was kept in refrigerated bucket at 4 c and used less than three days the characteristics of the raw sludge are shown in table 1 pg was supplied by furui chemical of yuntianhua kunming china particle size of pg used in this experiment was less than 150 μm in this paper pg was modified by odbac and the final products were signed as mpg chemical components and corresponding content of mpg were analyzed using energy dispersive spectrometer eds and x ray diffraction xrd and the results were shown in table s1 as shown in table s1 the main mineral components of mpg were caso4 al2o3 and sio2 all chemical agents were analytical reagent and used without further purification 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 effects of mpg addition on sludge properties 100 ml of raw sludge was added in 250 ml beakers and preserved at room temperature then various dosages

morphology distribution of eps to make fluorescence analysis and mass spectrometry analysis besides all experiments were repeated for three times to ensure the accuracy of obtained results moreover data in this paper were represented with means and standard error 2 2 2 sludge pretreatment with different agents pg mpg and cpam pretreatment of sludge was performed in a glass barrel with an agitator at ambient temperature mpg was added into the raw sludge stirring until well combined the optimum pretreatment parameters which lead to a lower moisture content of 62 58 and a lower srf of 3 7 1012 m kg i e better dewatering performance for sludge were 40 ds of mpg dosage 35 min of reaction time and 500 rpm of agitation speed besides pg and cpam pretreatment for sludge dewatering were

et al 2014 and ou et al 2011 protein was measured with filon hydroxybenzene method using bovine serum albumin as the standard solution zhang et al 2014 polysaccharide and humic acid were measured by anthrone h2so4 colorimetry and dichromate titration respectively zhang et al 2016 besides phosphate radical and sulfate radical were determined using spectrophotometry ou et al 2011 2 3 5 2 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem excitation emission matrix was measured using fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with a three dimension scan mode the eem data were obtained with scanning emission em wavelength from 300 to 800 nm at 4 nm interval by changing the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 650 nm at 4 nm interval data were recorded at a scan speed of 60000 nm min with a 20 nm of ex and em slit furthermore contour interval in the spectra was 10 zhang et al 2014 have found that location of fluorescence peaks could reflect the organics type while intensity of peaks represented the concentration of organics in samples thus fluorescence peaks could be used to explore the morphology distribution of eps 2 3 5 3 molecular weight distribution of organics molecular weight of organics in eps was measured using electrospray ionization mass spectrometer esi ms 6530b singapore working conditions of which were as follows a capillary voltage of 4500v operating temperature of 350 c drying gas flow was 10 0 l min 1 nebulizing gas pressure was 45 psi and fragmentation voltage was 100v 2 3 6 tg dta tg dta was performed using thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzer tg dta hct 3 henven beijing with the heating interval from 298 15k to 343 15k at a heating rate of 283 15k min sludge sample was kept at 343 15k for 1 h using nitrogen n2 reactive atmosphere at a sweeping speed of 40 ml min 1 2 3 7 statistics analysis correlation analysis on bound water release and major factors mean diameter lb eps content and srf was carried out using ibm spss statistics 22 0 the linear correlation between bound water release and key factors was estimated with pearson s correlation coefficient r generally speaking correlation was deemed statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval probability p 0 05 xiao et al 2016 multiple linear regression models were built seek to explain relationship between the above factors besides reliability of established models was detected by the following results 1 a regression coefficient r2 should be more than 95 which means it could explicate more than 95 of the variation 2 the residuals which is defined as the difference between the actual and fitting values should follow a normal distribution and independence 3 the p values of all estimated coefficients should be less than 0 05 xiao et al 2016 ince and inel 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of mpg pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance srf were reduced significantly after mpg addition fig s1 a generally speaking a good dewatering performance of sludge could be obtained with a srf value less than 4 1012 m kg 1 while a bad one is found with a higher srf value more than 10 1012 m kg 1 huang et al 2016 besides although cpam sludge showed a better dewaterability compared to raw sludge due to its flocculent capacity a lowest srf value of 3 69 1012 m kg 1 was found in mpg sludge indicating that water in sludge was easy to be removed after mpg treatment fig s1 a meanwhile increase of yn showed an improvement for sludge dewatering it can be seen from fig s1 a almost no change was detected in sludge treated with pg explaining that it was necessary to modify pg into mpg for sludge pretreatment a better filtration performance of mpg sludge was also found in fig s1 b which indicated that more water could be removed from sludge with addition of mpg other than cpam 3 2 effects of mpg addition on sludge properties 3 2 1 zeta potential of sludge after pretreatment with mpg generally zeta potential which is largely affected by eps wrapped around the sludge particles represents the electrical property of sludge zhang et al 2016 with increase of mpg dosage zeta potential changed gradually from negative to positive fig 1 the result can be explained by the opinion that lots of negative charges from eps on the surface of sludge particles were neutralized by positive charges from mpg thus leading to destruction of stable sludge colloid system therefore increasing in zeta potential showed the disintegration of eps xu et al 2017 furthermore more and more sludge particles were kept on the surface of mpg particles through charge neutralization forming large flocs electrical property transition was found till excessive mpg was added to the sludge resulting in a positive potential of sludge besides accumulation of large flocs was interrupted which will lead to a bad dewatering performance many researchers have mentioned that excessive cationic agents will form a stable cationic colloid system which could hinder the release of eps and hydrogen ions into supernatant could bind the bound water tightly in the system thus leading to a terrible sludge dewatering peng et al 2017 yang and li 2009 theoretically optimum dosage was zero potential dosage with which all negative charges in sludge are just neutralized and thus the best dewatering performance could be found murugesan et al 2016 3 2 2 ph and orp of treated sludge ph and orp of sludge showed an obvious change with mpg addition fig 2 originally ph decreased obviously and a minimum 6 01 of ph was obtained with a 100 ds of mpg dosage however with the further increase of mpg more than 100 ds ph increased gradually fig 2 the result revealed that cationic mpg could absorb anion such as hydroxyl ion in sludge supernatant leading to release of hydrogen ion furthermore addition of mpg in sludge will destroy eps and accordingly release lots of proteins and humic acids into the supernatant he et al 2015 it was reported that protein could release hydrogen ions thus increasing the concentration of h in the supernatant fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 while excessive mpg will hinder disintegration of eps and promote release of oh into the supernatant finally leading to increasing of ph fontmorin and sillanpää 2015 revealed that orp could reflect the oxidation reduction properties of substances in solution the higher the orp was the stronger the oxidizing property was with increase of mpg dosage ph decreased while orp increased fig 2 the result showed that the oxidation ability of treated sludge was enhanced which could decompose more organics and promote the release of bound water thus improving sludge dewaterability 3 2 3 morphological properties of sludge flocs with mpg addition normally particles size was decreased upon increasing pretreated agents in the destruction process of stable sludge colloid system and then increased in the re agglomeration process of sludge flocs tuan and sillappää 2010 mean size of sludge particles before and after pretreatment with mpg was 47 and 153 μm respectively furthermore an obvious re flocculation of sludge flocs can be observed fig s2 and larger flocs were generated in the process it was reported that increase of zeta potential would lead to destruction of sludge colloid system then promote flocculation of sludge particles and enlarge the particle size and finally improve sludge dewatering performance rodriguez chueca et al 2014 markis et al 2014 therefore both larger particle size and higher zeta potential were found with mpg addition showing a good dewaterability besides wang et al 2013 have mentioned that the smaller the sludge particles the more the organics and the worse the dewatering performance before and after pretreatment with mpg structure of sludge particles changed from tight to loose fig s3 the raw sludge particles obviously had a relatively smooth and closely surface fig s3 a while after treated with mpg the surface became porous with lots of gullies fig s3 b which were considered to be of great significance for water release in the dewatering process markis et al 2014 fractal dimension df reflects the structure of sludge flocs a higher df is correlated with a compact and dense surface structure wang et al 2013 according to yu and zheng 1995 df of particles is related to its area and perimeter which is described by eq 1 1 a c p 2 d f where a and p are regarded as area and perimeter of particles respectively c is constant subsequently the area and perimeter of particles can be obtained using ipp 6 0 for pixel computing thus df of sludge particles could be easily calculated by eq 1 after pretreatment with mpg df of sludge particles decreased from 1 98 to 1 73 indicating that structure of sludge flocs became loose besides loose structure could facilitate the release of bound water meanwhile compared with raw sludge a strong response to the fluorescence intensity of sludge flocs treated with mpg was observed in fig s4 explaining that df of treated sludge particles decreased obviously 3 2 4 effects of mpg addition on filtrate chemical properties almost the same trends were found from cod color and tds curves fig 3 a with increasing mpg addition cod color and tds in filtrate significantly increased especially in tds these changes could be illustrated by the diversification of chemical substances in filtrate to some extent cod and tds could reflect the amount of organics in filtrate the more organics the more the cod and tds coussot 2014 large amount of eps was destroyed into the supernatant with mpg addition directly leading to increase of organics such as protein polysaccharide and humic substances in filtrate it was reported that humic substances were largely responsible for the filtrate color due to the release of melanoidins and humic acid in humic substances wang and li 2015 therefore it can be found that increase of filtrate color was mainly caused by humic substances that entered into the filtrate together with eps besides excessive mpg will hinder disintegration of eps thus decreasing cod color and tds of filtrate fig 3 a generally speaking decreasing of filtrate turbidity predicated decrease of suspended particles in filtrate obviously with mpg addition amount of filtrate suspended particles decreased rapidly fig 3 b yang and li 2009 found that chemical agents could destroy the stable sludge colloid system into small and dispersed flocs and subsequently promote the re flocculation of sludge flocs through charge neutralization and adsorption bridging yang and li 2009 in the re flocculation process massive suspended particles were captured by large particles to form the larger flocs which were easier to sink and were greatly related to a better dewatering performance finally decreasing amount of suspended particles similarly excessive mpg will certainly hinder the formation of large flocs and further affect the capture to suspended particles 3 3 composition and morphology distribution of eps in sludge under pretreatment with mpg 3 3 1 concentration distribution of components in eps compared with raw sludge the filtrate cod and tds content increased sharply and then decreasing slightly after mpg pretreatment fig 3 a meanwhile the filtrate color increased from 10 to 45 as shown in fig 4 in raw sludge proteins polysaccharide humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical accounted for 78 78 10 74 8 04 1 39 and 1 05 of the total eps respectively a finding reported that biopolymer content in lb eps and sb eps was greatly responsible for sludge dewaterability he et al 2015 the more biopolymer was in sb eps or the less biopolymer was in lb eps the better the dewatering performance was he et al 2015 after mpg pretreatment sb eps content obviously increased with decrease of lb eps content fig 4 the result showed that addition of mpg could effectively crack lb eps surrounding the tb eps into supernatant thus releasing bound water wrapped in lb eps and further increasing sb eps content however for tb eps only humic acid phosphate radical and sulfate radical content decreased slightly with mpg addition protein and polysaccharide content had no change it was reported that tb eps cannot be destroyed with chemical agent addition due to a huge bondage between tb eps and microbial cells yang and li 2009 meanwhile a study found that tb eps had no contribution to improve sludge dewatering he et al 2015 fig 4 shows that a thorough destruction on lb eps was obtained with mpg dosage ranged from 40 ds to 80 ds and accordingly sb eps content reached the peak besides zhu et al 2013 have mentioned that ratio of protein to polysaccharide signed as pn ps in lb eps was tightly related to sludge dewatering a low ratio showed a good dehydration zhu et al 2013 a lower pn ps was also observed with the same mpg dosage further confirming the optimum mpg dosage for sludge pretreatment fig 5 3 3 2 effects of mpg addition on eps composition distribution it can be seen from fig 6 that mpg pretreatment resulted in obvious decline of fluorescent intensity of organics in lb eps compositions of eps corresponding to those peaks marked in fig 6 were shown in table 2 for raw sludge only aromatic protein like substances protein ⅱ were observed in sb eps while aromatic protein like substances fulvic acid like substances soluble microbial by product like substances and humic acid like substances were found in lb eps fig 6 after pretreatment with 40 ds mpg large amount of organics in lb eps released into supernatant then forming the sb eps the result indicated that with mpg addition sludge flocs were effectively destroyed and organics in lb eps were significantly decomposed and further released into supernatant thus directly leading to increasing of sb eps content additionally composition distribution of tb eps was changed slightly before and after pretreatment further indicating that tb eps played an insignificant role in improving sludge dewatering simultaneously this finding also coincided with the analysis of eps concentration distribution 3 3 3 changes in molecular weight of organics molecular weight of organics in sb eps increased significantly under pretreatment with different mpg dosage 25 ds 40 ds 55 ds fig 7 a with destruction of sludge flocs lb eps was disintegrated and released into the supernatant then leading to a sharp decrease of organics it can be seen from fig 7 b organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in lb eps were reduced sharply under pretreatment with mpg the result expressed that disintegration and decomposition of lb eps leading to the increase of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in sb eps which further indicated that organics especially with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in lb eps was largely responsible for sludge dewatering 3 4 dynamic analysis on sludge dewatering 3 4 1 binding energy eb of bound water in sludge filter cake under pretreatment with mpg eb of bond water in sludge filter cake was defined as the energy required to release this part of water based on the tg dta method richardson et al 1986 it was reported that eb of bond water in sludge filter cake can be quantified by the amount of heat sighed as hpw absorbed by pure water in the constant rate evaporation region richardson et al 1986 foucat and lahaye 2014 relationships between eb and hw are as follows 2 e b dtg p w d t a p w d t a s w d t g s w 1 h p w where d t a p w and d t a s w represent heat gradient of pure water and bond water in sludge filter cake in constant rate evaporation region respectively d t g s w and d t g p w represent mass gradient of pure water and bond water in sludge filter cake in constant rate evaporation region respectively h p w is the gasification latent heat of pure water at 343 15k moreover ratio of dtg pw and dta pw i e dtg p w d t a p w or ratio of dta sw and dtg sw i e d t a s w d t g s w could be calculated by dtg dta curve in constant rate evaporation region expressed with a temperature interval thus it was convenient to calculate eb through tg dta analysis on pure water and sludge sample fig 8 a shows that the constant rate evaporation region of pure water was changed from 337 75k to 339 68k furthermore dtg dta curve corresponding with the constant rate evaporation region was drawn to determine the ratio dtg p w d t a p w subsequently a ratio value of 0 08492 was calculated fig 8 b meantime for raw sludge the constant rate evaporation region lasted from 334 95k to 335 40k and 0 09476 of d t g s w d t a s w value were obtained from fig s5 likewise different d t g s w d t a s w value of different sludge sample with different mpg addition could be calculated using tg dta method and eq 2 foucat and lahaye 2014 suggested that different eb was required to release different water type releasing free water capillary water surface adsorbed water and intracellular bound water needed a minimum eb of 0 5 5 167 278 kj kg 1 respectively foucat and lahaye 2014 moreover according to foucat and lahaye 2014 sludge with a higher moisture content generally more than 90 always has a lower eb value generally lower than 5 kj kg 1 which indicated that capillary water surface adsorbed water and intracellular bound water are still contained in it similarly a higher eb value more than 278 kj kg 1 illustrating that only intracellular bound water is left in sludge and a minimum of 278 kj of energy is needed to release 1 kg water in it thus water type could be determined by eb table 3 shows eb and type of water in sludge filter cake under mpg pretreatment we can find that only surface absorbed water and intracellular bound water were contained in sludge filter cake indicating that capillary bound water could be released into supernatant under mpg pretreatment while excessive mpg will certainly hinder bound water release table 3 these findings were in good agreement with the conclusion that destruction of eps leading to release of bound water 3 4 2 release of bound water in sludge pretreated with different mpg dosage under mpg addition bound water content of sludge filter cake was largely reduced fig 9 with 40 ds of mpg addition bound water content of sludge filter cake decreased from 10 65 to 1 82 kg kg 1ds illustrating that about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment as shown in fig 9 after mpg pretreatment decreasing of bound water content of sludge filter cake led to increase of eb which indicating that the less the bound water content in sludge filter cake the greater the eb was required to release this part of water besides with increase of mpg dosage mean diameter of sludge flocs incereased sharply fig 9 ther result explained that sludge flocs size was significantly responsicble for releasing of bound water the larger the size the more bound water release similarly excessive mpg will lead to a bad dewatering performance consequently it could be considered that sludge dewatering was greatly correlated with bound water release and sludge flocs size 3 5 statistical analyses as mentioned before bound water release was significantly related to lb eps content sludge flocs size and srf additionally a strong positive correlation between bound water release and sludge flocs size r 0 8816 p 0 0025 a negative correlation between bound water release and lb eps content r 0 6618 p 0 02 and a strong negative correlation between bound water release and srf r 0 9876 p 0 00165 were observed respectively table s3 through statistical analysis a multiple linear regression model which indicated the relationship between bound water release and lb eps content sludge flocs size and srf was established and proved to be independent tables s4 s6 regression model was shown as follows 3 w r 9 096 0 03 d m 0 01 c l b e p s 3 756 10 13 s r f where w r represents bound water release kg kgds d m is the mean diameter of sludge flocs μm c l b e p s is the lb eps content mg gvss s r f is the specific resistance of filtration m kg a regression coefficient r2 of 0 982 was obtained illustrating that 98 2 of the variations could be explained by the model table s4 besides the regression square sum accounted for 98 18 of the total square sum indicating that the linear model could explain the vast majority of total square sum and the fitting effect of model was better table s5 meanwhile all estimated variables were proved to be significant with a p value less than 0 05 table s6 as shown in residual plot fig s6 the residuals followed the normal probability distribution and were unbiased and independent due to the appropriate value of durbin watson dw and vif table s4 table s6 thus illustrating that the model was valid as described in eq 3 lower lb eps content and srf may improve dehydration performance while larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering 3 6 environmental and economy benefits analysis it was reported that benefit cost ratio bcr was a highly practical technology to evaluate the benefits and costs of pollution control and a better control effect could be obtained with a bcr value greater than 1 horton et al 2011 certainly the higher the bcr value the better the benefits as shown in table 4 both mpg and cpam could improve sludge dewatering furthermore a higher bcr value of 98 02 was observed with mpg addition indicating that a better environmental and economy benefit can be obtained using mpg pretreatment for sludge dewatering 4 conclusions mpg could effectively disintegrate the stable sludge colloid system and then destroy lb eps and further release bound water into the supernatant with mpg addition large amount of lb eps was disintegrated into the filtrate increasing the amount of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 da in sb eps concomitantly about 8 8 kg kg 1ds of bound water was released after pretreatment a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established and proved to be valid according to the model we can find that lower lb eps content and srf may improve dehydration performance and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

19479,tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa has attracted considerable attention due to its ubiquitous presence in different environmental compartments worldwide however information on its aerobic biodegradability in coastal environments remains unknown here the aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa using a pseudoalteromonas species commonly found in the marine environment was investigated we found that extracellular biogenic siderophore superoxide anion radical o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were involved in tbbpa degradation upregulation of genes nqra and loda encoding na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase and l lysine ε oxidase supported the extracellular o2 and h2o2 production the underlying mechanism of tbbpa biodegradation presumably involves both o2 reduction and oh based advanced oxidation process aop furthermore tbbpa intermediates of tribromobisphenol a 4 isopropylene 2 6 dibromophenol 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 2 bromobenzoic acid were detected in the culture medium debromination and β scission pathways of tbbpa biodegradation were proposed additionally membrane integrity assays revealed that the increase of intracellular catalase cat activity and the extracellular polymeric substances eps might account for the alleviation of oxidative damage these findings could deepen understanding of the biodegradation mechanism of tbbpa and other related organic pollutants in coastal and artificial bioremediation systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetrabromobisphenol a cometabolism marine bacterium reactive oxygen species coastal pollution 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is widely used as reactive or additive brominated flame retardants bfrs to protect materials against ignition covering approximately 60 of the total bfrs market globally law et al 2006 the widespread use of tbbpa has led to its universal occurrence in various environmental matrices and in biota morris et al 2004 tbbpa is also being increasingly detected in the coastal environments such as sediments seawater and seafoods aznar alemany et al 2017 cruz et al 2015 gong et al 2017 gu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2014 2016 sühring et al 2015 notably the level of tbbpa in seawater samples collected from the intertidal zone of qingdao china was up to 1 8 μg l 1 gong et al 2017 tbbpa is known to exhibit deleterious toxicological effects like hepatotoxicity immunotoxicity neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity birnbaum and staskal 2004 darnerud 2003 moreover it may also act as an endocrine disruptor birnbaum and staskal 2004 generally the coastal oceans are the final sink for a wide range of anthropogenic pollutants like many other bfrs tbbpa will inevitably be introduced into the coastal ecosystems by human activities and via atmospheric deposition riverine discharge and leaching from marine plastic debris once released tbbpa may suffer from long term exposure to oxic conditions before burial in coastal sediments although photolytic decomposition in the marine environments has not yet been reported both photochemical and chemical oxidation contribute to tbbpa degradation in simulated aqueous solutions bao and niu 2015 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 yang et al 2014a in view of the occurrence of tbbpa in coastal sediments in monitoring studies gu et al 2017 sühring et al 2015 we reasoned that its fate in the coastal environments would not be explained by photolysis alone there are a limited number of studies on aerobic tbbpa biodegradation the degradation and metabolism of tbbpa by indigenous soil microorganisms have been investigated previously li et al 2014 2015b liu et al 2013a sun et al 2014 additionally several studies have shown that tbbpa can be biodegraded by o methylating enzyme george and häggblom 2008 laccase feng et al 2013 peroxidase lu et al 2015 freshwater microalgae peng et al 2014 and pure bacterial culture an et al 2011 more recently we highlighted the importance of h2o2 and fe ii oligopeptide mediated biogenic fenton like reaction in tbbpa degradation in the external milieu of pseudomonas sp strain fz isolated from activated sludge gu et al 2016 however these studies are exclusively focused on terrigenous microorganisms marine microbes are often under conditions of high pressure high salinity and low temperature have unique metabolic capacities and physiological traits that distinguish from their terrestrial counterparts thus far tbbpa biodegradation in coastal environments remains obscure further tbbpa generally coexists with various readily degradable substances in natural environment and thus cometabolic degradation may be the dominating biodegradation process therefore understanding the mechanism of aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of tbbpa by marine microorganisms may provide vital information regarding the fate of other organic pollutants in coastal systems the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the aerobic biodegradability of tbbpa by a marine microorganism and 2 more importantly to explore the underlying mechanism we isolated tbbpa degrading strains and selected pseudoalteromonas sp strain gcy as model marine bacterium because this genus is commonly found in the world s oceans ranging from surface water to deep

gcy fig 1 a depicts the tbbpa degradation curves versus time under different conditions in uninoculated and heat killed control experiments there was no apparent decrease of tbbpa indicating that its loss resulted from the abiotic process was negligible moreover approximately 80 of tbbpa was disappeared in bp medium while separately ca 40 or 55 of tbbpa was removed in only beef extract or peptone amended asw tbbpa could not be utilized as the sole carbon and energy source data not shown these data suggested that tbbpa biodegradation was attributed to cometabolic degradation processes and the bp medium could provide more nutrients for the stimulation of microbial activity than either alone tbbpa degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b the degradation rate constants k were 0 1466 0 0856 and 0 0533 d 1 in bp medium peptone only and beef extract only asw which corresponded to half lives t 1 2 of 4 7 8 1 and 13 days respectively 3 2 active species localization and extracellular siderophore characterization as seen in fig s4 approximately 62 of tbbpa degrading efficiency was found in the extracellular fraction while both the periplasmic and intracellular fractions had a negligible effect on tbbpa removal less than 5 providing evidence that tbbpa disappearance was an extracellular process further heat treatment suppressed about 93 of tbbpa degrading activity while proteinase k treatment showed a 44 decrease compared with the untreated extracellular fraction implying that both extracellular enzymatic and nonenzymatic active species seemed to play central roles besides tbbpa degrading activity in the ultrafiltrated retentate 3 kda was conspicuously decreased by 78 2 compared with the control without ultrafiltration and further implied a prominent role for low molecular mass component lmmc 3 kda in tbbpa removal cas assay fig s5a confirmed the existence of siderophore in permeate 3 kda as reflected by the decreased absorbance at 630 nm compared with the control bp medium the mixed catecholate and hydroxamate were the main functional groups figs s5b and s5c furthermore fe ii and fe iii could be complexed and reduced in the permeate specifically when phenanthroline was added the a512 nm value continually increased from 0 0006 to 0 0252 for fe iii reducing capacity in the presence of sod the a562 nm value was rapidly increased from 0 0002 to 0 0740 additionally no measurable siderophore was detected in fe replete bp medium meanwhile a marked decrease in tbbpa removal was observed when cells were grown in the fe replete medium suggesting the involvement of siderophore in tbbpa removal 3 3 extracellular ros involved in tbbpa degradation o2 was produced by exponential and stationary phase cultures with without addition of tbbpa respectively fig s6 moreover o2 production during the exponential phase cultures had a higher concentration than the stationary phase nbt2 reduction assays further showed that nad p h strongly potentiated o2 production in a manner that was dose dependent whereas neither nad nor nadp did stimulate o2 formation fig 2 additionally the nadh dependent o2 generation was strongly attenuated by dpi treatment as for h2o2 h2o2 concentration increased sharply to ca 1 2 and 1 6 μmol l 1 until the cells reached the late exponential phase during cultivation with without tbbpa respectively and then plateaued thereafter fig s7a moreover a negligible fraction of h2o2 was decreased in the extracellular fraction in the presence of sod verified that h2o2 production was not derived from o2 dismutation data not shown fig s7b showed that the laao exhibited broad substrate specificity and was most active with l leucine the increase in ph values in the growing medium might be due to such cellular metabolism fig s8 collectively we concluded that h2o2 formation was derived from laao catalyzed reaction in the case of oh the characteristic quartet peaks with 1 2 2 1 and the hyperfine splitting constants of a h a n 14 9 g were observed by esr detection of oh spin adduct dmpo oh in the extracellular fraction upon fe iii addition fig 3 a a strong suppressing intensity of dmpo oh was observed after exposure to thiourea which clearly indicated the existence of oh furthermore nadh could slightly stimulate the intensity of dmpo oh the intensity of dmpo oh was greatly suppressed after sod or cat addition revealing that the oh formation was attributed to o2 and h2o2 subsequently hpf fluorescence probe was then used to quantify the oh concentration fig 3b approximately 7 65 μmol l 1 of oh was found in the extracellular fraction control a rapid drop in fluorescence intensity was also observed by adding thiourea thus further confirming that the oh was produced moreover the oh concentrations were markedly increased by 38 6 or 48 5 after addition of nadh or h2o2 whereas the fluorescence intensities were distinctly suppressed by adding cat or sod compared to the control once again showing that the h2o2 and o2 contributed to oh generation additionally oh concentration was decreased by 14 7 in extracellular fraction of tbbpa exposed cells tbbpa degrading efficiency was enhanced over 10 in extracellular fraction amended nadh compared to the unamended control furthermore approximately 35 5 of tbbpa content was removed in an abiotic o2 generating system whereas no obvious loss of tbbpa less than 5 was observed after addition of sod these results indicated that nadh could stimulate biological o2 generation which played an important role in tbbpa degradation in addition approximately 68 27 or 82 of tbbpa degrading activity in the extracellular fraction was inhibited after exposure to cat sod or thiourea revealing that h2o2 o2 and oh were all participated in tbbpa degradation it should be noted that no appreciable amount of tbbpa was removed less than 5 in the retentate 3 kda upon the combined addition of cat sod and thiourea confirming that the contribution of other crucial factor s e g conventional enzymes to tbbpa degradation could be excluded 3 4 expression profile of loda and nqr gene the genome of strain gcy was sequenced and annotated fig s9 of particular interest were the lysine epsilon oxidase antimicrobial protein loda loda gene and na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase nqr gene which presented in its genome and have been reported to play vital roles in extracellular h2o2 and o2 production respectively rt qpcr results fig 4 showed that the loda gene expression was 60 97 and 93 38 folds up regulated by incubating cells with without tbbpa compared to the control early exponentially growing cells respectively meanwhile the nqra gene expression was separately 1 65 and 2 06 folds up regulated when cells were incubated with without tbbpa 3 5 tbbpa degradation pathway hplc chromatogram m z spectrum suggested molecular structure retention time bromine isotopic distribution pattern and molecular formula of tbbpa metabolites are given in fig s10 fig s11 and table s3 six intermediates of tbbpa were identified among them product d was further verified by an authentic standard fig s12 and it was assigned to 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp on the basis of the intermediates analyses a proposed pathway for tbbpa biodegradation is shown in fig s13 tbbpa could be degraded via debromination and β scission routes tbbpa was debrominated through the cleavage of the c br bond to form product a concurrently the phenol moiety of tbbpa was oxidized to lose an electron forming a phenoxy radical which might undergo β scission to form a cationic intermediate with a single benzene ring r1 and a phenyl radical r2 r1 might be converted to product b after a deprotonation reaction the isomers of product c might be formed after substitution and deprotonation routes of r1 then products of b and c might be converted to products e and f meanwhile r2 might undergo bromination leading to product d formation 3 6 membrane integrity fcm data showed that oxidative stresses exerted negligible effects less than 1 cell damage at 10 day on the membrane fig s14 suggesting that the cell membrane might not experience damage it was found that the cat activity increased during cell growth with without tbbpa and then leveled off fig s15 revealing that intracellular ros burden might be counteracted by the antioxidant defense system additionally the amount of eps at stationary phase cultures with without tbbpa addition was ca 235 and 210 mg l 1 fig s16 respectively suggested that eps might also participate in protecting cells against oxidative damage 4 discussion the coastal environments worldwide are subjected to increasing tbbpa pollution however the fate of tbbpa in coastal environments at present is poorly understood especially about its susceptibility to aerobic biodegradation this study is the first report describing the aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa by marine derived bacterium and the underlying mechanism involved in this process our results showed that the degradation of tbbpa by a pseudoalteromonas sp commonly found in the marine environment is an extracellular non enzymatic process based on our findings the involvement of both o2 reduction and oh based advanced oxidation process aop mechanisms in tbbpa degradation by this marine bacterium was proposed involving the siderophore o2 h2o2 and oh the mixed types of siderophore were detected in the extracellular fraction fig s5 while absent in fe replete conditions as indicated by the cas and ultrafiltration assays which played a crucial role in tbbpa disappearance moreover the lmmc was capable of reducing fe iii and complexing fe ii all the results suggest that the active lmmc is probably a bacterial siderophore wang and gao 2002 marine bacteria are known to secrete low molecular weight fe iii chelating siderophore to facilitate uptake of fe iii under iron deficient conditions martinez et al 2000 furthermore it has been reported that the production of a mixed type siderophore is one of the physiological characteristics of the pseudoalteromonas sp armstrong et al 2004 o2 was generated by our strain and its production was associated with nadh oxidoreductase as indicated by the sod inhibitable cytochrome c and nbt2 reduction assays figs 2 and s6 in agreement with these results the nqra gene was found to be upregulated by rt qpcr analysis fig 4b in fact o2 is mainly formed via abiotic photooxidation of colored dissolved organic matter in the sunlit surface ocean dister and zafiriou 1993 besides a diverse group of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms are known to produce light independent extracellular o2 which is linked to the membrane associated nad p h oxidoreductases i e transmembrane oxidases and soluble peroxidases andeer et al 2015 diaz et al 2013 hansel et al 2012 rose et al 2005 shaked and rose 2013 zhang et al 2016 to date only sporadic reports have shown that the membrane associated proton or na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase is responsible for extracellular o2 production by respiring cells of enterococcus faecalis huycke et al 2001 or vibrio cholera lin et al 2007 however the mechanism in pseudoalteromonas sp has so far not been explained at the molecular level in this study we provide the first genetic evidence for an involvement of na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase as a source of extracellular o2 production in pseudoalteromonas sp as for tbbpa degradation tbbpa degrading activity was correlated with nadh addition in the extracellular fraction moreover an abiotic x xo o2 generating system further demonstrated that tbbpa could be decomposed by o2 it has also been recently reported that tbbpa can be removed via o2 mediated reductive debromination since o2 can act as a nucleophile and reducing agent gao et al 2017 peng et al 2017 thus based on these recent studies and results in this work we suggest that biogenic o2 may lead to reductive debromination of tbbpa after cells enter exponential phase of growth h2o2 was found during the late exponential phase cultures through an o2 dismutation independent route fig s7a moreover the cells displayed laao activity with broad substrate specificity of which l leucine was the most active substrate fig s7b these findings were further supported by rt qpcr analysis in which the loda gene was upregulated fig 4a indeed h2o2 is ubiquitous in the marine environment o sullivan et al 2005 it can be formed via photochemical reaction atmospheric input o2 dismutation redox cycling of metals and biological reaction herut et al 1998 in biological reaction laaos are widely distributed in different organisms including bacteria which play a vital role in extracellular h2o2 production yu et al 2013 among the laaos l lysine ε oxidase loda synthesized by a marine bacterium marinomonas mediterranea is the first described enzyme that can catalyze the oxidative deamination of l lysine releasing h2o2 gómez et al 2006 gómez et al 2010 further confirmed that the loda is typically secreted to the extracellular milieu of m mediterranea during the stationary phase of growth furthermore most of the antimicrobial proteins found in pseudoalteromonas sp were loda family with a broad substrate range campillo brocal et al 2015 mai prochnow et al 2008 also demonstrated that the marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas tunicata possesses a loda homologue alpp which can display lysine oxidase activity we suggest that the l amino acids present in the constituents of beef extract and peptone are oxidized by the extracellular secreted loda in late exponential phase cultures to yield h2o2 additionally marine microalgae contain high levels of proteins which can be a major potential source of amino acids samarakoon and jeon 2012 especially under conditions of algal blooms the amino acids concentrations in marine environments have been reported in the μmol l 1 range mopper and lindroth 1982 it thus seems that the occurrence of laao catalyzed reaction is ubiquitous in marine ecosystems in this study we found that oh production was related to fe iii fe iii siderophore o2 and h2o2 as indicated by the esr fig 3a and hpf fig 3b results the quenching experiments further showed that o2 h2o2 and oh all participated in tbbpa degradation and their contributions to tbbpa removal under stationary phase conditions were in the following order oh h2o2 o2 which is consistent with results from a recent study peng et al 2017 in seawater oh is generally produced via dissolved organic matter photo oxidation process mopper and zhou 1990 furthermore miller et al 2016 suggested that oh can be produced in marine systems through fenton reaction occurring upon h2o2 decomposition by organic fe ii ligands additionally extracellular oh formation by red tide phytoplankton chattonella marina via iron catalyzed haber weiss cycle has been demonstrated of which a trace amount of iron present in seawater served as catalyst oda et al 1992 on the basis of these previous studies and the results obtained in this study we are led to propose that tbbpa may also be degraded by oh via biogenic fenton like reaction eq 1 and haber weiss reaction eqs 2 1 and 2 2 in stationary phase cultures 1 fe ii siderophore h2o2 fe iii siderophore oh oh 2 1 o2 fe iii o2 fe ii 2 2 h2o2 fe ii fe iii oh oh tbbpa degradation routes in this study included debromination and β scission fig s13 the detection of tri bbpa product a suggests that debromination might occur moreover tri bbpa has also been detected in other oxidation cases e g pure strain an et al 2011 microalgae peng et al 2014 biogenic fenton like reaction gu et al 2016 microbial consortium peng et al

2014 ji et al 2016 peng et al 2017 zhong et al 2012 tbp product d has also been found in oxidation processes an et al 2011 gao et al 2016 guo et al 2014 ji et al 2016 qu et al 2015 4 hba product e has also been reported by ronen and abeliovich 2000 in their study on bpa degradation by an aerobic sphingomonas strain 2 bba product f has not been reported in previous oxidation studies halides are ubiquitously present in seawater the bromine ion br concentration 67 mg l 1 in seawater is 675 folds lower than that of chlorine ion previous studies indicated that br can be transformed by oh into reactive bromine species rbs including bromine radicals br br2 broh and free bromine br2 hbro eq 3 8 while reactive chlorine species can be formed only under strong acidic conditions grebel et al 2010 vione et al 2005 yang et al 2014b moreover these oxidized rbs are moderate electrophilic species that can attack electron rich organic compounds selectively such as phenolic tbbpa degradation intermediates as mentioned in fig s13 tbp was detected during tbbpa biodegradation which suggested that the rbs was probably involved theoretically br content in asw is higher than the bromine originated from tbbpa hence inferring asw as the primary source of bromine during tbp formation a similar route for the formation of tbp has also been demonstrated in tbbpa degradation by so4 based aop in which bromine was derived from tbbpa per se ji et al 2016 however the formation of brominated organics by so4 and oh based aop has received little attention in previous tbbpa degradation studies guo et al 2014 ji et al 2016 and this crucial factor needs to be taken into account in future work 3 oh br oh br k 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 4 br br br2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 5 br oh broh k 1 2 1010 m 1 s

loss cabiscol et al 2000 unlike negatively charged o2 huycke et al 2001 h2o2 is uncharged and can penetrate membrane imlay 2008 on the other hand the bacterial cells generally produce eps to protect themselves against external unfavorable environmental stressors and thus alleviate membrane damage henriques and love 2007 hessler et al 2012 our results showed that cat activity was stimulated in response to oxidative stress fig s15 which is in accordance with the fcm results fig s14 besides we further confirmed that eps was produced by our strain fig s16 eps production has also been observed in another strain of the same species liu et al 2013b taken together these findings indicate that two possible modes of antioxidant defense mechanism are involved thus allowing the physiological function of cell to remain constant under oxidative stress in summary three principal mechanisms in tbbpa degradation via extracellular biogenic ros by this marine pseudoalteromonas sp were proposed as follows i biogenic o2 could debrominate tbbpa directly ii biogenic fenton like reaction fe iii fe ii siderophores cycling by biogenic h2o2 could result in tbbpa degradation via fenton like reaction iii biogenic haber weiss mechanism reaction of biogenic o2 and h2o2 with fe iii fe ii as catalyst could drive haber weiss cycle in tbbpa removal a schematic of tbbpa biodegradation is illustrated in fig 5 the mechanistic interpretation of the biogenic ros is shown in fig s17 notably the latter two proposed oh based aops might lead to parallel formation of rbs overall we have extended the current knowledge about aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa to coastal environment in view of this current study with a mechanism similar to that of our earlier work on terrigenous bacterium gu et al 2016 these findings imply that the extracellular non enzymatic mechanism is a common feature of tbbpa biodegradation in the environment thus the occurrence of ros is closely related to the nutrient substrate and does not require tbbpa induction making such biochemical mechanism useful for biodegradation of tbbpa at environmentally relevant concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 5 conclusions a potentially profound role of extracellular biogenic ros by marine pseudoalteromonas sp in tbbpa degradation was demonstrated for the first time in this study the extracellular biogenic siderophore and ros i e o2 h2o2 and oh were involved in tbbpa degradation the nqra and loda genes played central roles in extracellular o2 and h2o2 generation the underlying mechanism of extracellular o2 reduction fenton like and haber weiss reactions in tbbpa degradation were proposed tbbpa could be degraded via debromination and β scission routes additionally the cell membrane damage was mitigated by increasing its intracellular antioxidant defense and by inducing eps production under oxidative stress this study deepens the knowledge of the fate of tbbpa and also provides guidance for the design and optimization of more efficient bioremediation technologies for treatment of tbbpa and other related organic contaminants under aerobic conditions in coastal and artificial systems acknowledgements this research was

19479,tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa has attracted considerable attention due to its ubiquitous presence in different environmental compartments worldwide however information on its aerobic biodegradability in coastal environments remains unknown here the aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa using a pseudoalteromonas species commonly found in the marine environment was investigated we found that extracellular biogenic siderophore superoxide anion radical o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were involved in tbbpa degradation upregulation of genes nqra and loda encoding na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase and l lysine ε oxidase supported the extracellular o2 and h2o2 production the underlying mechanism of tbbpa biodegradation presumably involves both o2 reduction and oh based advanced oxidation process aop furthermore tbbpa intermediates of tribromobisphenol a 4 isopropylene 2 6 dibromophenol 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 2 bromobenzoic acid were detected in the culture medium debromination and β scission pathways of tbbpa biodegradation were proposed additionally membrane integrity assays revealed that the increase of intracellular catalase cat activity and the extracellular polymeric substances eps might account for the alleviation of oxidative damage these findings could deepen understanding of the biodegradation mechanism of tbbpa and other related organic pollutants in coastal and artificial bioremediation systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords tetrabromobisphenol a cometabolism marine bacterium reactive oxygen species coastal pollution 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is widely used as reactive or additive brominated flame retardants bfrs to protect materials against ignition covering approximately 60 of the total bfrs market globally law et al 2006 the widespread use of tbbpa has led to its universal occurrence in various environmental matrices and in biota morris et al 2004 tbbpa is also being increasingly detected in the coastal environments such as sediments seawater and seafoods aznar alemany et al 2017 cruz et al 2015 gong et al 2017 gu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2014 2016 sühring et al 2015 notably the level of tbbpa in seawater samples collected from the intertidal zone of qingdao china was up to 1 8 μg l 1 gong et al 2017 tbbpa is known to exhibit deleterious toxicological effects like hepatotoxicity immunotoxicity neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity birnbaum and staskal 2004 darnerud 2003 moreover it may also act as an endocrine disruptor birnbaum and staskal 2004 generally the coastal oceans are the final sink for a wide range of anthropogenic pollutants like many other bfrs tbbpa will inevitably be introduced into the coastal ecosystems by human activities and via atmospheric deposition riverine discharge and leaching from marine plastic debris once released tbbpa may suffer from long term exposure to oxic conditions before burial in coastal sediments although photolytic decomposition in the marine environments has not yet been reported both photochemical and chemical oxidation contribute to tbbpa degradation in simulated aqueous solutions bao and niu 2015 han et al 2008 lin et al 2009 pang et al 2014 yang et al 2014a in view of the occurrence of tbbpa in coastal sediments in monitoring studies gu et al 2017 sühring et al 2015 we reasoned that its fate in the coastal environments would not be explained by photolysis alone there are a limited number of studies on aerobic tbbpa biodegradation the degradation and metabolism of tbbpa by indigenous soil microorganisms have been investigated previously li et al 2014 2015b liu et al 2013a sun et al 2014 additionally several studies have shown that tbbpa can be biodegraded by o methylating enzyme george and häggblom 2008 laccase feng et al 2013 peroxidase lu et al 2015 freshwater microalgae peng et al 2014 and pure bacterial culture an et al 2011 more recently we highlighted the importance of h2o2 and fe ii oligopeptide mediated biogenic fenton like reaction in tbbpa degradation in the external milieu of pseudomonas sp strain fz isolated from activated sludge gu et al 2016 however these studies are exclusively focused on terrigenous microorganisms marine microbes are often under conditions of high pressure high salinity and low temperature have unique metabolic capacities and physiological traits that distinguish from their terrestrial counterparts thus far tbbpa biodegradation in coastal environments remains obscure further tbbpa generally coexists with various readily degradable substances in natural environment and thus cometabolic degradation may be the dominating biodegradation process therefore understanding the mechanism of aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of tbbpa by marine microorganisms may provide vital information regarding the fate of other organic pollutants in coastal systems the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the aerobic biodegradability of tbbpa by a marine microorganism and 2 more importantly to explore the underlying mechanism we isolated tbbpa degrading strains and selected pseudoalteromonas sp strain gcy as model marine bacterium because this genus is commonly found in the world s oceans ranging from surface water to deep sea sediments qin et al 2011 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the detailed information of chemicals is provided in the supporting information text s1 2 2 bacterial strain tbbpa degrading

of this organism are given in text s2 2 3 tbbpa biodegradation by cell tbbpa biodegradation assays were carried out as follows cells were precultured in sterile zobell medium at 25 c for 12 h until they reached exponential phase and harvested by centrifugation 10 280 g 10 min the pellets were washed with sterile artificial seawater asw ph 8 0 and inoculated to an initial od600 of 0 05 into 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of asw supplemented with beef extract 0 1 w v and peptone 0 2 w v henceforth bp medium the initial ph of bp medium was 8 0 0 1 tbbpa was added to a final concentration of 10 mg l 1 for comparison two parallel assays were performed in bp medium lacking beef extract or peptone under identical conditions additionally the abiotic uninoculated and heat killed controls in bp medium were also analyzed to evaluate the non biological transformation all media were autoclaved before use assays were run in triplicate unless otherwise noted all tbbpa

fractionation was performed text s3 tbbpa final 5 mg l 1 was separately added to the obtained three fractions i e extracellular periplasmic and intracellular fractions and bp medium control and the mixtures were incubated for 5 h to assess whether or not tbbpa removal is mediated by enzymatic action the extracellular fraction was subjected to boiling 15 min or protease 20 u ml 1 treatment assays were run in triplicate 2 5 extracellular siderophore characterization to investigate the involvement of siderophore in tbbpa removal the extracellular fraction was concentrated and pooled by ultrafiltration using a 3 kda cutoff membrane millipore more detailed siderophore characterization is provided in text s4 2 6 extracellular reactive oxygen species ros determination and tbbpa degradation 2 6 1 superoxide anion radical o2 the concentration of o2 produced by intact cells was quantified according to the procedure described by korshunov and imlay 2006 with slight modification details of this detection are provided in text s5 to further explore the influence of factors on o2 formation in extracellular fraction the nitroblue tetrazolium nbt2 reduction method was used stenuit et al 2012 the final concentrations of 0 01 or 1 mmol l 1 nadh and nadph 1 mmol l 1 nad and nadp and 50 μmol l 1 diphenylene iodonium dpi a broad spectrum inhibitor of mammalian nad p h oxidizing enzymes were separately added the reactions were initiated by adding nbt2 final 50 μmol l 1 and the absorbance spectra at 560 nm were tracked over 5 min with a uv vis spectrophotometer the unamended extracellular fraction was used as control the dpi treated sample was pretreated with dpi for 10 min at 27 c before adding nadh assays were run in triplicate 2 6 2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration in the supernatant was quantified spectrophotometrically using a modified horseradish peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd pod method voelker and sulzberger 1996 additionally in order to test the contribution of o2 to h2o2 production in extracellular fraction an o2 scavenger superoxide dismutase sod final 50 ku l 1 was added to evaluate the correlation between l amino acid oxidase laao and h2o2 generation the 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnp method was used to determine α keto acid produced in the laao catalyzed reaction i e l amino acid o2 h2o α keto acid nh3 h2o2 as previously described yu et al 2013 assays were run in triplicate 2 6 3 hydroxyl radical oh production of oh was analyzed by electron spin resonance esr and fluorescent probe techniques the esr spectra using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent were recorded to investigate the effects of exogenous fe iii prepared from ferric sulfate h2o2 nadh and o2 on oh generation in extracellular fraction more detailed information on esr assay is given in text s6 a fluorescent probe 3 p hydroxyphenyl fluorescein hpf with high oh specificity was further used for oh quantification setsukinai et al 2003 fenton reagent ferrous iron and h2o2 were used to plot a standard curve of oh fig s1 to study the impact of possible contributors on oh formation we separately added final concentrations of 1 mmol l 1 nadh 1 mmol l 1 h2o2 50 μg l 1 catalase cat 50 ku l 1 sod and 10 mmol l 1 thiourea to the extracellular fraction containing 5 μmol l 1 hpf for comparison extracellular fraction of tbbpa exposed cells was also included the extracellular fraction containing hpf was used as control the fluorescent intensity of oh was measured with a hitachi fl4500 spectrophotometer tokyo japan at an excitation emission wavelength of λex λem 440 515 nm assays were run in triplicate 2 6 4 tbbpa degradation assays to assess the impact of o2 h2o2 and oh on tbbpa removal final concentrations of 5 mmol l 1 nadh 50 μg l 1 cat 50 ku l 1 sod and 10 mmol l 1 thiourea were separately added to the extracellular fraction containing tbbpa final 5 mg l 1 and the mixture was incubated for 5 h the unamended sample was used as control furthermore an abiotic xanthine x xanthine oxidase xo o2 generating system was established to further study the influence of o2 on tbbpa removal text s7 additionally 50 μg l 1 cat 50 ku l 1 sod and 10 mmol l 1 thiourea were all added together to the as prepared retentate 3 kda containing tbbpa final 5 mg l 1 to quench the ros mediated

isolate had a high similarity of 99 to those of pseudoalteromonas strains the phylogenetic tree is shown in fig s3 based on these characteristics we termed this isolate as pseudoalteromonas sp strain gcy fig 1 a depicts the tbbpa degradation curves versus time under different conditions in uninoculated and heat killed control experiments there was no apparent decrease of tbbpa indicating that its loss resulted from the abiotic process was negligible moreover approximately 80 of tbbpa was disappeared in bp medium while separately ca 40 or 55 of tbbpa was removed in only beef extract or peptone amended asw tbbpa could not be utilized as the sole carbon and energy source data not shown these data suggested that tbbpa biodegradation was attributed to cometabolic degradation processes and the bp medium could provide more nutrients for the stimulation of microbial activity than either alone tbbpa degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b the degradation rate constants k were 0 1466 0 0856 and 0 0533 d 1 in bp medium peptone only and beef extract only asw which corresponded to half lives t 1 2 of 4 7 8 1 and 13 days respectively 3 2 active species localization and extracellular siderophore characterization as seen in fig s4 approximately 62 of tbbpa degrading efficiency was found in the extracellular fraction while both the periplasmic and intracellular fractions had a negligible effect on tbbpa removal less than 5 providing evidence that tbbpa disappearance was an extracellular process further heat treatment suppressed about 93 of tbbpa degrading activity while proteinase k treatment showed a 44 decrease compared with the untreated extracellular fraction implying that both extracellular enzymatic and nonenzymatic active species seemed to play central roles besides tbbpa degrading activity in the ultrafiltrated retentate 3 kda was conspicuously decreased by 78 2 compared with the control without ultrafiltration and further implied a prominent role for low molecular mass component lmmc 3 kda in tbbpa removal cas assay fig s5a confirmed the existence of siderophore in permeate 3 kda as reflected by the decreased absorbance at 630 nm compared with the control bp medium the mixed catecholate and hydroxamate were the main functional groups figs s5b and s5c furthermore fe ii and fe iii could be complexed and reduced in the permeate specifically when phenanthroline was added the a512 nm value continually increased from 0 0006 to 0 0252 for fe iii reducing capacity in the presence of sod the a562 nm value was rapidly increased from 0 0002 to 0 0740 additionally no measurable siderophore was detected in fe replete bp medium meanwhile a marked decrease in tbbpa removal was observed when cells were grown in the fe replete medium suggesting the involvement of siderophore in tbbpa removal 3 3 extracellular ros involved in tbbpa degradation o2 was produced by exponential and stationary phase cultures with without addition of tbbpa respectively fig s6 moreover o2 production during the exponential phase cultures had a higher concentration than the stationary phase nbt2 reduction assays further showed that nad p h strongly potentiated o2 production in a manner that was dose dependent whereas neither nad nor nadp did stimulate o2 formation fig 2 additionally the nadh dependent o2 generation was strongly attenuated by dpi treatment as for h2o2 h2o2 concentration increased sharply to ca 1 2 and 1 6 μmol l 1 until the cells reached the late exponential phase during cultivation with without tbbpa respectively and then plateaued thereafter fig s7a moreover a negligible fraction of h2o2 was decreased in the extracellular fraction in the presence of sod verified that h2o2 production was not derived from o2 dismutation data not shown fig s7b showed that the laao exhibited broad substrate specificity and was most active with l leucine the increase in ph values in the growing medium might be due to such cellular metabolism fig s8 collectively we concluded that h2o2 formation was derived from laao catalyzed reaction in the case of oh the characteristic quartet peaks with 1 2 2 1 and the hyperfine splitting constants of a h a n 14 9 g were observed by esr detection of oh spin adduct dmpo oh in the extracellular fraction upon fe iii addition fig 3 a a strong suppressing intensity of dmpo oh was observed after exposure to thiourea which clearly indicated the existence of oh furthermore nadh could slightly stimulate the intensity of dmpo oh the intensity of dmpo oh was greatly suppressed after sod or cat addition revealing that the oh formation was attributed to o2 and h2o2 subsequently hpf fluorescence probe was then used to quantify the oh concentration fig 3b approximately 7 65 μmol l 1 of oh was found in the extracellular fraction control a rapid drop in fluorescence intensity was also observed by adding thiourea thus further confirming that the oh was produced moreover the oh concentrations were markedly increased by 38 6 or 48 5 after addition of nadh or h2o2 whereas the fluorescence intensities were distinctly suppressed by adding cat or sod compared to the control once again showing that the h2o2 and o2 contributed to oh generation additionally oh concentration was decreased by 14 7 in extracellular fraction of tbbpa exposed cells tbbpa degrading efficiency was enhanced over 10 in extracellular fraction amended nadh compared to the unamended control furthermore approximately 35 5 of tbbpa content was removed in an abiotic o2 generating system whereas no obvious loss of tbbpa less than 5 was observed after addition of sod these results indicated that nadh could stimulate biological o2 generation which played an important role in tbbpa degradation in addition approximately 68 27 or 82 of tbbpa degrading activity in the extracellular fraction was inhibited after exposure to cat sod or thiourea revealing that h2o2 o2 and oh were all participated in tbbpa degradation it should be noted that no appreciable amount of tbbpa was removed less than 5 in the retentate 3 kda upon the combined addition of cat sod and thiourea confirming that the contribution of other crucial factor s e g conventional enzymes to tbbpa degradation could be excluded 3 4 expression profile of loda and nqr gene the genome of strain gcy was sequenced and annotated fig s9 of particular interest were the lysine epsilon oxidase antimicrobial protein loda loda gene and na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase nqr gene which presented in its genome and have been reported to play vital roles in extracellular h2o2 and o2 production respectively rt qpcr results fig 4 showed that the loda gene expression was 60 97 and 93 38 folds up regulated by incubating cells with without tbbpa compared to the control early exponentially growing cells respectively meanwhile the nqra gene expression was separately 1 65 and 2 06 folds up regulated when cells were incubated with without tbbpa 3 5 tbbpa degradation pathway hplc chromatogram m z spectrum suggested molecular structure retention time bromine isotopic distribution pattern and molecular formula of tbbpa metabolites are given in fig s10 fig s11 and table s3 six intermediates of tbbpa were identified among them product d was further verified by an authentic standard fig s12 and it was assigned to 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp on the basis of the intermediates analyses a proposed pathway for tbbpa biodegradation is shown in fig s13 tbbpa could be degraded via debromination and β scission routes tbbpa was debrominated through the cleavage of the c br bond to form product a concurrently the phenol moiety of tbbpa was oxidized to lose an electron forming a phenoxy radical which might undergo β scission to form a cationic intermediate with a single benzene ring r1 and a phenyl radical r2 r1 might be converted to product b after a deprotonation reaction the isomers of product c might be formed after substitution and deprotonation routes of r1 then products of b and c might be converted to products e and f meanwhile r2 might undergo bromination leading to product d formation 3 6 membrane integrity fcm data showed that oxidative stresses exerted negligible effects less than 1 cell damage at 10 day on the membrane fig s14 suggesting that the cell membrane might not experience damage it was found that the cat activity increased during cell growth with without tbbpa and then leveled off fig s15 revealing that intracellular ros burden might be counteracted by the antioxidant defense system additionally the amount of eps at stationary phase cultures with without tbbpa addition was ca 235 and 210 mg l 1 fig s16 respectively suggested that eps might also participate in protecting cells against oxidative damage 4 discussion the coastal environments worldwide are subjected to increasing tbbpa pollution however the fate of tbbpa in coastal environments at present is poorly understood especially about its susceptibility to aerobic biodegradation this study is the first report describing the aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa by marine derived bacterium and the underlying mechanism involved in this process our results showed that the degradation of tbbpa by a pseudoalteromonas sp commonly found in the marine environment is an extracellular non enzymatic process based on our findings the involvement of both o2 reduction and oh based advanced oxidation process aop mechanisms in tbbpa degradation by this marine bacterium was proposed involving the siderophore o2 h2o2 and oh the mixed types of siderophore were detected in the extracellular fraction fig s5 while absent in fe replete conditions as indicated by the cas and ultrafiltration assays which played a crucial role in tbbpa disappearance moreover the lmmc was capable of reducing fe iii and complexing fe ii all the results suggest that the active lmmc is probably a bacterial siderophore wang and gao 2002 marine bacteria are known to secrete low molecular weight fe iii chelating siderophore to facilitate uptake of fe iii under iron deficient conditions martinez et al 2000 furthermore it has been reported that the production of a mixed type siderophore is one of the physiological characteristics of the pseudoalteromonas sp armstrong et al 2004 o2 was generated by our strain and its production was associated with nadh oxidoreductase as indicated by the sod inhibitable cytochrome c and nbt2 reduction assays figs 2 and s6 in agreement with these results the nqra gene was found to be upregulated by rt qpcr analysis fig 4b in fact o2 is mainly formed via abiotic photooxidation of colored dissolved organic matter in the sunlit surface ocean dister and zafiriou 1993 besides a diverse group of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms are known to produce light independent extracellular o2 which is linked to the membrane associated nad p h oxidoreductases i e transmembrane oxidases and soluble peroxidases andeer et al 2015 diaz et al 2013 hansel et al 2012 rose et al 2005 shaked and rose 2013 zhang et al 2016 to date only sporadic reports have shown that the membrane associated proton or na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase is responsible for extracellular o2 production by respiring cells of enterococcus faecalis huycke et al 2001 or vibrio cholera lin et al 2007 however the mechanism in pseudoalteromonas sp has so far not been explained at the molecular level in this study we provide the first genetic evidence for an involvement of na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductase as a source of extracellular o2 production in pseudoalteromonas sp as for tbbpa degradation tbbpa degrading activity was correlated with nadh addition in the extracellular fraction moreover an abiotic x xo o2 generating system further demonstrated that tbbpa could be decomposed by o2 it has also been recently reported that tbbpa can be removed via o2 mediated reductive debromination since o2 can act as a nucleophile and reducing agent gao et al 2017 peng et al 2017 thus based on these recent studies and results in this work we suggest that biogenic o2 may lead to reductive debromination of tbbpa after cells enter exponential phase of growth h2o2 was found during the late exponential phase cultures through an o2 dismutation independent route fig s7a moreover the cells displayed laao activity with broad substrate specificity of which l leucine was the most active substrate fig s7b these findings were further supported by rt qpcr analysis in which the loda gene was upregulated fig 4a indeed h2o2 is ubiquitous in the marine environment o sullivan et al 2005 it can be formed via photochemical reaction atmospheric input o2 dismutation redox cycling of metals and biological reaction herut et al 1998 in biological reaction laaos are widely distributed in different organisms including bacteria which play a vital role in extracellular h2o2 production yu et al 2013 among the laaos l lysine ε oxidase loda synthesized by a marine bacterium marinomonas mediterranea is the first described enzyme that can catalyze the oxidative deamination of l lysine releasing h2o2 gómez et al 2006 gómez et al 2010 further confirmed that the loda is typically secreted to the extracellular milieu of m mediterranea during the stationary phase of growth furthermore most of the antimicrobial proteins found in pseudoalteromonas sp were loda family with a broad substrate range campillo brocal et al 2015 mai prochnow et al 2008 also demonstrated that the marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas tunicata possesses a loda homologue alpp which can display lysine oxidase activity we suggest that the l amino acids present in the constituents of beef extract and peptone are oxidized by the extracellular secreted loda in late exponential phase cultures to yield h2o2 additionally marine microalgae contain high levels of proteins which can be a major potential source of amino acids samarakoon and jeon 2012 especially under conditions of algal blooms the amino acids concentrations in marine environments have been reported in the μmol l 1 range mopper and lindroth 1982 it thus seems that the occurrence of laao catalyzed reaction is ubiquitous in marine ecosystems in this study we found that oh production was related to fe iii fe iii siderophore o2 and h2o2 as indicated by the esr fig 3a and hpf fig 3b results the quenching experiments further showed that o2 h2o2 and oh all participated in tbbpa degradation and their contributions to tbbpa removal under stationary phase conditions were in the following order oh h2o2 o2 which is consistent with results from a recent study peng et al 2017 in seawater oh is generally produced via dissolved organic matter photo oxidation process mopper and zhou 1990 furthermore miller et al 2016 suggested that oh can be produced in marine systems through fenton reaction occurring upon h2o2 decomposition by organic fe ii ligands additionally extracellular oh formation by red tide phytoplankton chattonella marina via iron catalyzed haber weiss cycle has been demonstrated of which a trace amount of iron present in seawater served as catalyst oda et al 1992 on the basis of these previous studies and the results obtained in this study we are led to propose that tbbpa may also be degraded by oh via biogenic fenton like reaction eq 1 and haber weiss reaction eqs 2 1 and 2 2 in stationary phase cultures 1 fe ii siderophore h2o2 fe iii siderophore oh oh 2 1 o2 fe iii o2 fe ii 2 2 h2o2 fe ii fe iii oh oh tbbpa degradation routes in this study included debromination and β scission fig s13 the detection of tri bbpa product a suggests that debromination might occur moreover tri bbpa has also been detected in other oxidation cases e g pure strain an et al 2011 microalgae peng et al 2014 biogenic fenton like reaction gu et al 2016 microbial consortium peng et al

2014 ji et al 2016 peng et al 2017 zhong et al 2012 tbp product d has also been found in oxidation processes an et al 2011 gao et al 2016 guo et al 2014 ji et al 2016 qu et al 2015 4 hba product e has also been reported by ronen and abeliovich 2000 in their study on bpa degradation by an aerobic sphingomonas strain 2 bba product f has not been reported in previous oxidation studies halides are ubiquitously present in seawater the bromine ion br concentration 67 mg l 1 in seawater is 675 folds lower than that of chlorine ion previous studies indicated that br can be transformed by oh into reactive bromine species rbs including bromine radicals br br2 broh and free bromine br2 hbro eq 3 8 while reactive chlorine species can be formed only under strong acidic conditions grebel et al 2010 vione et al 2005 yang et al 2014b moreover these oxidized rbs are moderate electrophilic species that can attack electron rich organic compounds selectively such as phenolic tbbpa degradation intermediates as mentioned in fig s13 tbp was detected during tbbpa biodegradation which suggested that the rbs was probably involved theoretically br content in asw is higher than the bromine originated from tbbpa hence inferring asw as the primary source of bromine during tbp formation a similar route for the formation of tbp has also been demonstrated in tbbpa degradation by so4 based aop in which bromine was derived from tbbpa per se ji et al 2016 however the formation of brominated organics by so4 and oh based aop has received little attention in previous tbbpa degradation studies guo et al 2014 ji et al 2016 and this crucial factor needs to be taken into account in future work 3 oh br oh br k 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 4 br br br2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 5 br oh broh k 1 2 1010 m 1 s

loss cabiscol et al 2000 unlike negatively charged o2 huycke et al 2001 h2o2 is uncharged and can penetrate membrane imlay 2008 on the other hand the bacterial cells generally produce eps to protect themselves against external unfavorable environmental stressors and thus alleviate membrane damage henriques and love 2007 hessler et al 2012 our results showed that cat activity was stimulated in response to oxidative stress fig s15 which is in accordance with the fcm results fig s14 besides we further confirmed that eps was produced by our strain fig s16 eps production has also been observed in another strain of the same species liu et al 2013b taken together these findings indicate that two possible modes of antioxidant defense mechanism are involved thus allowing the physiological function of cell to remain constant under oxidative stress in summary three principal mechanisms in tbbpa degradation via extracellular biogenic ros by this marine pseudoalteromonas sp were proposed as follows i biogenic o2 could debrominate tbbpa directly ii biogenic fenton like reaction fe iii fe ii siderophores cycling by biogenic h2o2 could result in tbbpa degradation via fenton like reaction iii biogenic haber weiss mechanism reaction of biogenic o2 and h2o2 with fe iii fe ii as catalyst could drive haber weiss cycle in tbbpa removal a schematic of tbbpa biodegradation is illustrated in fig 5 the mechanistic interpretation of the biogenic ros is shown in fig s17 notably the latter two proposed oh based aops might lead to parallel formation of rbs overall we have extended the current knowledge about aerobic biodegradation of tbbpa to coastal environment in view of this current study with a mechanism similar to that of our earlier work on terrigenous bacterium gu et al 2016 these findings imply that the extracellular non enzymatic mechanism is a common feature of tbbpa biodegradation in the environment thus the occurrence of ros is closely related to the nutrient substrate and does not require tbbpa induction making such biochemical mechanism useful for biodegradation of tbbpa at environmentally relevant concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 5 conclusions a potentially profound role of extracellular biogenic ros by marine pseudoalteromonas sp in tbbpa degradation was demonstrated for the first time in this study the extracellular biogenic siderophore and ros i e o2 h2o2 and oh were involved in tbbpa degradation the nqra and loda genes played central roles in extracellular o2 and h2o2 generation the underlying mechanism of extracellular o2 reduction fenton like and haber weiss reactions in tbbpa degradation were proposed tbbpa could be degraded via debromination and β scission routes additionally the cell membrane damage was mitigated by increasing its intracellular antioxidant defense and by inducing eps production under oxidative stress this study deepens the knowledge of the fate of tbbpa and also provides guidance for the design and optimization of more efficient bioremediation technologies for treatment of tbbpa and other related organic contaminants under aerobic conditions in coastal and artificial systems acknowledgements this research was
