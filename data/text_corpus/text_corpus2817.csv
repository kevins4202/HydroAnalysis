14085,energy efficient technologies that allow for the effective recovery of water from urine are desirable in a variety of environments while light weight and portable forward osmosis fo systems have many advantages over other energy intensive approaches they often do not achieve a high water recovery while small and uncharged solutes such as urea are efficiently rejected by the fo membrane hollow fiber aquaporin based membranes abms represent potential candidates to be used in urine filtration and past work has demonstrated that charged ammonium ions are rejected more efficiently than uncharged urea at low ph in this study we examined urea hydrolysis via the enzyme urease as a pre fo treatment strategy to see if rejection of nitrogenous compounds can be enhanced our results demonstrate that urea hydrolysis in combination with lowering the feed solution ph significantly improved total nitrogen tn rejection nonetheless the increased osmolarity of the resulting feed solution compromised water recovery which was especially noticeable when glucose draw solutions were utilized therefore our results suggest that the introduced strategy is not practicable for general field application however the introduced approach may still be beneficial in applications where draw solutions of high osmolarity can be used to allow for an efficient water recovery from urine

as the international space station where water supply is limited 1 3 the removal of nitrogenous waste is also important to limit impact to delicate ecosystems such as deep caves and antarctica 4 6 as the deposition of human nitrogenous waste is a substantial threat to such environments which often evolve under nitrogen limited conditions 4 6 in such locations a low power light weight filtration system would be desirable that allows for urine volume reduction by water recovery to allow human waste to be removed more easily the primary nitrogenous compound in urine is urea 7 8 different technologies to separate urea from the aqueous phase exist but are usually energy intense or complicated and are often only appropriate for industrial scale applications 9 membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis ro or nano filtration nf have been tested but most membranes reject less than 50 of the urea in human urine 10 11 pressure driven filtration processes such as ro are also expensive prone to fouling and have limited scaling ability 12 13 an alternative strategy is forward osmosis fo which utilizes the osmotic gradient between a feed solution and a higher osmolarity draw solution to facilitate water transport across a water permeable membrane ideally this approach rejects larger molecules from crossing the membrane leading to the volume reduction of the feed stream with the water being absorbed by the draw solution 14 since the composition of the draw solution can be manipulated depending on application fo can be beneficial over other existing pressure driven technologies 12 studies of flat sheet fo membranes such as the hti cellulose triacetate cta or the porifera tfc based membrane have reported high rejection rates for urea in urine treatment studies 15 16 however the amount of water recovery in these assays was either very low or not indicated for most real world applications a high water recovery rate is required although this can reduce solute rejection 17 a commercially available larger size fo system is the x pack from hti hydration innovation technology albany oregon which was evaluated for urine mitigation during long duration cave exploration its long term use over 1 week resulted in a decrease of water recovery from 80 to 47 furthermore the hti pack required up to 48 h to achieve 80 water recovery for 1 5 l of human urine which made the tested system impractical for effective urine treatment 4 in this study we looked at a membrane that incorporates water selective aquaporin proteins into its thin film composite tfc active layer to increase water permeability and solute rejection 18 19 these aquaporin based membranes abms demonstrate high water flux and effective rejection of smaller size trace organics 12 20 which increases their potential effectiveness in urine filtration furthermore abms are commercially available in compact hollow fiber configuration which would allow their integration into portable and light weight fo systems in a previous study we investigated urea and ammonium rejection of an aquaporin based hollow fiber membrane depending on parameter changes in water recovery feed solution ph initial feed solute concentration and draw solution molarity urea rejection was not very high especially when greater water recovery was achieved e g 37 urea rejection for a water recovery rate of 80 which was found to be a result of feed concentration increase and draw dilution over the course of the fo experiment however we found ammonium rejection at a low feed solution ph of 3 was significantly higher exceeding 90 at water recovery rates of 80 17 the increase of ammonium rejection at lower ph appears to be influenced by the ph sensitivity of the tfc membrane which contains carboxyl functional groups pka of 5 2 on the membrane s surface which are less charged at low ph the resultant net reduction in negative surface charge is believed to reduce bidirectional cation exchanges across the membrane e g exchange of ammonium and sodium ions between feed and draw solution increasing overall solute rejection 17 21 22 based on these results we wanted to explore whether urea hydrolysis into ammonia ammonium via the enzyme urease could increase urea rejection by the tfc based abm in a subsequent fo step since ammonium rejection was found to be highest at low feed solution ph in previous studies 17 21 22 we also manipulated the feed solution ph and tested glucose draw solutions to evaluate whether higher rejection of ammonium can be achieved in the absence of cations furthermore the utilization of glucose may also allow for drinkable sugar based draw solutions which may be beneficial in certain environments such as on space stations or during the exploration of remote environments our results suggest that urea rejection can be enhanced by ureolysis however osmolarity changes within the tested solutions limited water transport significantly making the introduced approach impracticable under many conditions 2 experimental 2 1 enzymatic urea hydrolyzes of artificial urine feed solutions via urease jack bean urease 490 u mg was obtained from tci america portland oregon and suspended in di water before being stored under nitrogen gas at 2 c in order to examine possible ph changes due to enzyme activity ph curves for different solutions of interest were recorded using a sd 230 ph meter and data logger from reed wilmington north carolina after urease was added 150 u of urease was added to 50 ml of a 50 mm urea solution that was placed on a magnetic stirrer while changes in ph were recorded every minute over a period of 1 h the same was repeated with 50 ml of artificial urine see table 1 and 50 ml of male human urine which was filtered through a 0 2 micron filter for sterility for the artificial urine and human urine 1250 u of urease were added due to the 8 3 fold higher concentration of urea when compared to the 50 mm urea standard to examine ureolytic activity of the urease 50 ml of a 50 mm urea 0 2 m phosphate buffer solution ph 7 was shaken at 90 rpm after 150 u of urease were added samples were collected every 10 min for 1 h and 1 mm cuso4 was added to inactivate urease at each time point the same procedure was repeated for 50 ml of an unbuffered 50 mm urea solution as well as for 50 ml of buffered 0 2 m phosphate buffer and unbuffered artificial urine since artificial urine has a 8 3 fold higher urea concentration compared to the 50 mm urea standard 1250 u of urease were added with samples inactivated with 8 3 mm cuso4 we also added 150 u of urease to a diluted and buffered artificial urine solution 0 2 m phosphate buffer with a urea concentration of 50 mm to compare with the 50 mm urea standard in order to examine possible impacts on urease activity from other solutes within the artificial urine for all solutions ph was measured before and after each experiment urea concentrations were determined via colorimetric quantification using the quantichrom diur 100 urea assay kit from bioassay systems hayward california following the manufacturer recommended protocol readings of high concentration urea samples were taken after a 20 min incubation time with the assay s working reagents at 520 nm using a spectramax m2 96 well plate reader from molecular devices san jose california for low concentration samples an incubation time of 50 min was required with readings taken at 430 nm 2 2 draw and feed solution composition unless otherwise stated all chemicals were obtained from fisher chemical pittsburgh pennsylvania draw solutions were made in di water using either nacl or d glucose a standard draw solution molarity of 2 m was used with variations as described in the results and discussion section as this concentration allowed for a maximum water recovery of 75 in reasonable experimental time artificial human urine was made based on the composition of wilsenach et al 2007 table 1 two l of artificial urine was treated with 12250 u of urease by stirring overnight at room temperature see paragraph 3 2 for detailed explanation on urease concentration samples of the hydrolyzed artificial urine were taken the next day and urea concentrations were determined as described above once over 99 of the initial urea was hydrolyzed the processed artificial urine was adjusted to ph 3 using concentrated hcl and used as feed solution in a subsequent fo experiment 2 3 forward osmosis setup the fo setup used in this study is shown in fig 1 briefly we used initial volumes of 2 l for the feed and draw solutions in each experiment to quantify water recovery or volume reduction of the feed stream the feed reservoir was weighed using a cp3202s precision balance from sartorius göttingen germany two independent peristaltic pumps were used to generate a feed stream flow rate of 1000 ml min run through the active lumen side of the membrane and a draw stream passed through the membrane module s shell side at a rate of 400 ml min as recommended by the membrane manufacturer the membrane s active layer was facing the feed solution throughout the entire experimental campaign an aquaporin inside hollow fiber fo hffo module with an active area of 2 3 m2 was used see reference 17 for membrane details after each experimental series we performed a quality control qc test of membrane performance as defined by the membrane manufacturer at specific test conditions this involved running 2 l of a 1 m nacl draw solution against 2 l of di water until a water recovery of around 75 was obtained while quantifying the increase in salt concentration in the feed stream using a labquest 2 with a con bta conductivity probe from venier beaverton oregon the reverse

unhydrolyzed artificial urine feed solutions using nacl or glucose draw solutions samples from feed and draw were taken before and after each fo experiment since the amount of water recovery or feed volume reduction had an impact on rejection in our previous studies 17 water recovery rates of 25 50 and 75 were tested all samples were diluted in di water and analyzed for total nitrogen tn immediately after experiments all fo experiments were performed in triplicate with the fo system flushed with di water for about 30 min between tests to prevent biofouling the membrane module was filled with di water and stored in a refrigerator at around 2 c when not in use total nitrogen tn concentrations were determined using the tntplus 826 assay hach loveland colorado which involved spectrophotometric measurement at 345 nm using a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer after a 30 min 120 c persulfate digestion in a hach drb 200 heating reactor ammonia concentrations were determined via spectrophotometry at 694 nm using the tntplus 831 assay hach loveland colorado omolarity was measured using a vapro 5600 vapor pressure osmometer from wescor inc logan utah 2 5 rejection rate

in mg l vfi the initial feed volume and cfi the initial tn feed concentration 3 r t n 1 v d e c d e v f i c f i 100 by using ammonia in place of tn formula 3 can also be used for ammonia rejection in some membrane studies solute rejection is quantified as the ratio of average permeate concentration to average feed concentration which considers the concentrated feed solution at the end of the fo experiment however in previous work rejection rates calculated using formula 3 provided a better representation of the increasing accumulation of contaminants in the draw solution with rising water recovery see reference 17 we therefore decided to calculate tn rejection via overall mass balance in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph curves after urease injection fig 2 shows the change in ph for a 50 mm urea solution artificial urine and human urine after the addition of urease the ph of the unbuffered 50 mm urea solution rapidly increases 1 min to 9 4 close to the pka of the ammonia ammonium ion pair following hydrolysis and remains constant throughout the 1 h duration of the experiment the artificial urine and human urine show a slower increase reaching a plateau at ph 9 2 after 15 min our results indicate that the natural buffer capacity of artificial and human urine is insufficient to maintain the reaction at ph 7 4 the ph optimum for urease activity 23 25 the rapid increase to ph 9 2 may therefore impact the rate of urea hydrolysis it is interesting to note that the ph curves of artificial and human urine progress in a similar manner fig 2 which suggests that artificial urine can be used as a substitute to realistically simulate the behavior of human urine in subsequent experiments 3 2 urea digestion curves we used 150 u of urease as a standard to liberate 100 mm of ammonia from 50 mm of urea and tried to establish standard urea digestion curves that approach a urea digestion rate close to 100 after an enzymatic digestion time of 1 h the decrease of urea concentration over time after urease was added in buffered 50 mm urea is shown in fig 3 a the results demonstrate that urea was completely hydrolyzed after 60 min while the ph increased from 6 9 to 7 7 staying around the ph optimum for the urease enzyme no reproducible urea digestion curves could be generated for the unbuffered 50 mm urea solutions data not shown as the ph reached 9 2 9 5 rapidly which impacted enzyme activity the digestion curve for artificial urine which was diluted to a urea concentration of 50 mm fig 3 b also demonstrates complete ureolysis after 60 min suggesting that the other constituents of artificial urine do not significantly impact urease activity as the ph remains around the ph optimum for urease increasing from 6 9 to 7 8 the urea digestion curve for artificial urine fig 3 c did not approach zero after 60 min likely due to the ph increase from 6 7 9 2 we were not able to set up artificial urine solutions in phosphate or other buffers e g triz hepes as due to the high solute concentration of artificial urine any buffer tested fell out of solution we therefore doubled the urease concentration to 2500 u and the experimental time to 2 h which resulted in a complete hydrolysis of urea fig 3 d despite the ph increased to 9 2 given the ability of these conditions to fully hydrolyze the artificial urine we used the conditions shown in fig 3 d as a standard to calculate digestion times and urease concentrations to digest 2 l of artificial urine that we used as feed solution in subsequent fo experiments 3 3 tn rejection rates for fo experiments using nacl draw solutions the average tn rejection rates for fo experiments with processed and unprocessed artificial urine feed solutions under different water recovery rates and nacl draw solutions are shown in fig 4 overall tn rejection declined with increasing water recovery in all experiments a pattern that we observed in a previous study 17 where we explained the decline in urea rejection as a result of urea concentration increase in the feed stream which leads to an increased diffusion of urea across the membrane into the draw additionally the water flux from feed to draw declines over the course of the fo experiment due to the dilution of the draw stream which ultimately leads to a lower dilution of accumulated urea in the draw solution the duration of each fo experiment also affected urea rejection in experiments that required a longer time to achieve the intended feed volume reduction e g a lower concentrated draw solution results in slower water flux more urea could pass the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw in shorter duration experiments e g higher concentrated draw solutions enable a higher water flux less time remained for urea molecules to traverse the membrane fig 4 a shows average tn rejection rates when artificial urine was used in the feed and run against a 2 m nacl draw solution overall the average tn rejection rates ranged from 86 water recovery of 25 to 46 water recovery of 75 when artificial urine was hydrolyzed via urease and the ph was adjusted to 3 fig 4 b the tn rejection rate was higher however 150 ml of concentrated hcl was necessary to drop the feed solution to ph 3 thus even though rejection was higher the osmolarity of the resulting feed solution increased from 750 mmol l to 2000 mmol l leading to a decline in total water flux from feed to draw therefore the duration of each fo experiment did increase significantly as the feed and draw solution approached osmotic equilibrium after only 50 of water recovery as a result a water recovery of 75 could not be achieved when running urease processed and ph adjusted artificial urine against 2 m nacl draw solutions to overcome this limitation we increased the molarity of our nacl draw solution to 5 m in subsequent experiments the results fig 4 c indicate that higher tn rejection can be achieved with higher concentrated draw solutions which may be due to the shorter fo time necessary allowing less time for the urea to diffuse across the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw when urease processed and ph adjusted artificial urine was run against 5 m nacl draw solutions fig 4 d very high tn rejection could be achieved ranging from 98 25 water recovery to 89 75 water recovery these results suggest that tn rejection can be increased when a high concentrated draw solution is used in combination with urea hydrolyzes and ph adjustment as pre fo modification 3 4 tn or nh3 nh4 rejection rates for fo experiments using glucose draw solutions the high volume of concentrated hcl required for ph adjustment and the high molarity draw solution is not very practical for application in the field we therefore decided to repeat the experiments using glucose as a draw solution the use of a non cationic draw solution should make the ph adjustment redundant as cation exchanges between feed an draw solution which are influenced by ph can be excluded this would make the utilization of a lower concentrated draw solutions possible as the osmolarity increase in the feed would be less significant without ph adjustment to test this we compared tn rejection rates for hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed artificial urine feed solutions between glucose and nacl draw solutions fig 5 a displays average tn rejections rates at 25 50 and 75 water recovery when using artificial urine in the feed stream and 2 m glucose as the draw solution the average tn rejection ranged from 90 at 25 water recovery to 28 at 75 water recovery when compared to the analogue experiments with nacl draw solutions fig 4 a the glucose experiments requiered more time until either of the three intended water recovery rates were achieved this is likely based on the dissociation of nacl into na and cl ions in solution creating a higher osmotic pressure when compared to glucose at the same molarity which increases the speed of water transfer from feed to draw our osmolarity measurements indicating that for instance a 2 m nacl draw solutions had about double the osmotic pressure compared to a 2 m glucose draw solution while tn rejection for 25 as well as 50 water recovery was similar for both types of draw solution rejection rates at a 75 water recovery differed greatly 46 for 2 m nacl and 28 for 2 m glucose again this is likely due to the longer experimental duration of the glucose draw solution fo experiment based on the lower osmotic pressure of the 2 m glucose draw solution compared to 2 m nacl feed and draw stream already reached osmotic equilibrium after an approximate water recovery of 75 at which water transfer from feed to draw appraoched zero average tn rejection rates from fo experiments using hydrolyzed artificial urine and 2 m glucose draw solutions are shown in fig 5 b no significant difference in rejection can be reported for water recovery rates of 25 and 50 between unhydrolyzed fig 4 a and hydrolyzed fig 4 b artificial urine therefore the use of glucose based draw solutions in combination with urea hydrolysis is not a beneficial pre fo treatment strategy even though feed solution ph was not adjusted after urea hydrolysis the osmolarity of the hydrolyzed artificial urine was still 950 mmol l this in combination with the low osmotic pressure of the glucose draw solution resulted in longer fo experiments which allowed more time for the ammonium ammonia to accumulate in the draw solution after passing the membrane since the ph of the hydrolyzed artificial urine was 9 2 uncharged ammonia may pass the membrane at higher rates 17 a water recovery rate of 75 could not be achieved when 2 m glucose draw solutions were being used since feed and draw solution approached osmotic equilibrium after a water recovery of around 50 since tn rejection for artificial urine could not be enhanced by urea hydrolysis when 2 m glucose was used we tested whether urea hydrolysis in combination with adjusting the feed solution ph to 3 and using 5 m glucose draw solutions would allow for an increase in tn rejection at high water recovery rates since the high osmolarity of the glucose draw solution interfered with our tn assay we tracked the tn by measuring ammonia as a proxy which used an assay not impacted by high glucose concentrations as a result total nitrogen concentrations including creatinine and small amounts of unhydrolyzed urea could not be used to calculate rejection rates nonetheless as the creatinine concentration is low compared to liberated ammonia variations between tn and ammonia based rejection rates should be negligible and as the samples were analyzed immediately the impact of ammonia volatilization should also be minimal the results fig 5 c show that an average ammonia rejection rate of 99 could be achieved for a water recovery of 25 while 97 ammonia was rejected on average when 50 water was recovered fig 4 c even though we used a 5 m draw solution the maximum water recovery rate was only 70 and due to the duration of the fo experiment 75 min resulting ammonia rejection rates dropped to 77 on average for a better visualization of changes in water flux throughout the different fo experiments fig 6 displays the progression of water flux depending on achieved water recovery rates 3 5 fo membrane performance the fo module performed within the range of the membrane manufacturer s specifications for the majority of the experimental campaign the specific salt flux or draw solution loss per liter of output averaged 0 13 g l which was below the maximum standard value of 0 3 g l in all qc tests performed for most of the study the water flux of the membrane was above the minimum standard of 12 l m2 hr averaging 12 31 l m2 hr however the last qc test which was performed after the experimental series with 5 m glucose draw solutions demonstrated a decline in water flux to 8 6 l m2 hr it is possible that due to the high glucose concentration of the draw solution the membrane rinsing period of 30 min was insufficient to remove all the glucose which may have led to temporary membrane clogging overall even if water flux may have been compromised for a small number of experiments reverse salt flux was not impacted which suggests that all performed fo experiments generated reliable data on the membrane s rejection capabilities 4 conclusion previous studies showed that urea rejection by aquaporin based fo membranes is complicated by the small size and uncharged nature of the urea molecule in this study we explored urea hydrolysis in combination with ph adjustment as a pre fo strategy to improve urea rejection our results demonstrate that total nitrogen rejection can be increased by urea hydrolysis and ph adjustment prior to fo e g from 67 to 89 at a water recovery rate of 75 when using a 5 m nacl draw solution however high amounts of hcl have to be used for ph adjustment which make the proposed approach impracticable for most real world applications furthermore the introduced procedure leads to a significant increase in feed solution osmolality from around 750 mmol l to 2000 mmol l which reduces overall water recovery to compensate for this we used highly concentrated draw solutions which further complicated this stepwise approach reducing the likelihood of light weight and portable fo systems that can be used to recover water from urine nonetheless these strategies may be considered for larger scale applications where high osmolarity draw solutions can be recovered in an energy efficient way e g in integrated industrial processes where waste heat can be used to power draw solution recovery the utilization of glucose draw solutions resulted in lower tn rejection e g 40 for 2 m nacl vs 28 for 2 m glucose at water recovery rates of 75 and reduced the speed of water recovery when compared to nacl e g achieving 75 water recovery took 9 min when using 2 m nacl vs 47 min when using 2 m glucose which reduces the chances of generating drinkable sugar based draw solutions in future fo devices declaration of competing interest the

unhydrolyzed artificial urine feed solutions using nacl or glucose draw solutions samples from feed and draw were taken before and after each fo experiment since the amount of water recovery or feed volume reduction had an impact on rejection in our previous studies 17 water recovery rates of 25 50 and 75 were tested all samples were diluted in di water and analyzed for total nitrogen tn immediately after experiments all fo experiments were performed in triplicate with the fo system flushed with di water for about 30 min between tests to prevent biofouling the membrane module was filled with di water and stored in a refrigerator at around 2 c when not in use total nitrogen tn concentrations were determined using the tntplus 826 assay hach loveland colorado which involved spectrophotometric measurement at 345 nm using a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer after a 30 min 120 c persulfate digestion in a hach drb 200 heating reactor ammonia concentrations were determined via spectrophotometry at 694 nm using the tntplus 831 assay hach loveland colorado omolarity was measured using a vapro 5600 vapor pressure osmometer from wescor inc logan utah 2 5 rejection rate

some membrane studies solute rejection is quantified as the ratio of average permeate concentration to average feed concentration which considers the concentrated feed solution at the end of the fo experiment however in previous work rejection rates calculated using formula 3 provided a better representation of the increasing accumulation of contaminants in the draw solution with rising water recovery see reference 17 we therefore decided to calculate tn rejection via overall mass balance in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph curves after urease injection fig 2 shows the change in ph for a 50 mm urea solution artificial urine and human urine after the addition of urease the ph of the unbuffered 50 mm urea solution rapidly increases 1 min to 9 4 close to the pka of the ammonia ammonium ion pair following hydrolysis and remains constant throughout the 1 h duration of the experiment the artificial urine and human urine show a slower increase reaching a plateau at ph 9 2 after 15 min our results indicate that the natural buffer capacity of artificial and human urine is insufficient to maintain the reaction at ph 7 4 the ph optimum for urease activity 23 25 the rapid increase to ph 9 2 may therefore impact the rate of urea hydrolysis it is interesting to note that the ph curves of artificial and human urine progress in a similar manner fig 2 which suggests that artificial urine can be used as a substitute to realistically simulate the behavior of human urine in subsequent experiments 3 2 urea digestion curves we used 150 u of urease as a standard to liberate 100 mm of ammonia from 50 mm of urea and tried to establish standard urea digestion curves that approach a urea digestion rate close to 100 after an enzymatic digestion time of 1 h the decrease of urea concentration over time after urease was added in buffered 50 mm urea is shown in fig 3 a the results demonstrate that urea was completely hydrolyzed after 60 min while the ph increased from 6 9 to 7 7 staying around the ph optimum for the urease enzyme no reproducible urea digestion curves could be generated for the unbuffered 50 mm urea solutions data not shown as the ph reached 9 2 9 5 rapidly which impacted enzyme activity the digestion curve for artificial urine which was diluted to a urea concentration of 50 mm fig 3 b also demonstrates complete ureolysis after 60 min suggesting that the other constituents of artificial urine do not significantly impact urease activity as the ph remains around the ph optimum for urease increasing from 6 9 to 7 8 the urea digestion curve for artificial urine fig 3 c did not approach zero after 60 min likely due to the ph increase from 6 7 9 2 we were not able to set up artificial urine solutions in phosphate or other buffers e g triz hepes as due to the high solute concentration of artificial urine any buffer tested fell out of solution we therefore doubled the urease concentration to 2500 u and the experimental time to 2 h which resulted in a complete hydrolysis of urea fig 3 d despite the ph increased to 9 2 given the ability of these conditions to fully hydrolyze the artificial urine we used the conditions shown in fig 3 d as a standard to calculate digestion times and urease concentrations to digest 2 l of artificial urine that we used as feed solution in subsequent fo experiments 3 3 tn rejection rates for fo experiments using nacl draw solutions the average tn rejection rates for fo experiments with processed and unprocessed artificial urine feed solutions under different water recovery rates and nacl draw solutions are shown in fig 4 overall tn rejection declined with increasing water recovery in all experiments a pattern that we observed in a previous study 17 where we explained the decline in urea rejection as a result of urea concentration increase in the feed stream which leads to an increased diffusion of urea across the membrane into the draw additionally the water flux from feed to draw declines over the course of the fo experiment due to the dilution of the draw stream which ultimately leads to a lower dilution of accumulated urea in the draw solution the duration of each fo experiment also affected urea rejection in experiments that required a longer time to achieve the intended feed volume reduction e g a lower concentrated draw solution results in slower water flux more urea could pass the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw in shorter duration experiments e g higher concentrated draw solutions enable a higher water flux less time remained for urea molecules to traverse the membrane fig 4 a shows average tn rejection rates when artificial urine was used in the feed and run against a 2 m nacl draw solution overall the average tn rejection rates ranged from 86 water recovery of 25 to 46 water recovery of 75 when artificial urine was hydrolyzed via urease and the ph was adjusted to 3 fig 4 b the tn rejection rate was higher however 150 ml of concentrated hcl was necessary to drop the feed solution to ph 3 thus even though rejection was higher the osmolarity of the resulting feed solution increased from 750 mmol l to 2000 mmol l leading to a decline in total water flux from feed to draw therefore the duration of each fo experiment did increase significantly as the feed and draw solution approached osmotic equilibrium after only 50 of water recovery as a result a water recovery of 75 could not be achieved when running urease processed and ph adjusted artificial urine against 2 m nacl draw solutions to overcome this limitation we increased the molarity of our nacl draw solution to 5 m in subsequent experiments the results fig 4 c indicate that higher tn rejection can be achieved with higher concentrated draw solutions which may be due to the shorter fo time necessary allowing less time for the urea to diffuse across the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw when urease processed and ph adjusted artificial urine was run against 5 m nacl draw solutions fig 4 d very high tn rejection could be achieved ranging from 98 25 water recovery to 89 75 water recovery these results suggest that tn rejection can be increased when a high concentrated draw solution is used in combination with urea hydrolyzes and ph adjustment as pre fo modification 3 4 tn or nh3 nh4 rejection rates for fo experiments using glucose draw solutions the high volume of concentrated hcl required for ph adjustment and the high molarity draw solution is not very practical for application in the field we therefore decided to repeat the experiments using glucose as a draw solution the use of a non cationic draw solution should make the ph adjustment redundant as cation exchanges between feed an draw solution which are influenced by ph can be excluded this would make the utilization of a lower concentrated draw solutions possible as the osmolarity increase in the feed would be less significant without ph adjustment to test this we compared tn rejection rates for hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed artificial urine feed solutions between glucose and nacl draw solutions fig 5 a displays average tn rejections rates at 25 50 and 75 water recovery when using artificial urine in the feed stream and 2 m glucose as the draw solution the average tn rejection ranged from 90 at 25 water recovery to 28 at 75 water recovery when compared to the analogue experiments with nacl draw solutions fig 4 a the glucose experiments requiered more time until either of the three intended water recovery rates were achieved this is likely based on the dissociation of nacl into na and cl ions in solution creating a higher osmotic pressure when compared to glucose at the same molarity which increases the speed of water transfer from feed to draw our osmolarity measurements indicating that for instance a 2 m nacl draw solutions had about double the osmotic pressure compared to a 2 m glucose draw solution while tn rejection for 25 as well as 50 water recovery was similar for both types of draw solution rejection rates at a 75 water recovery differed greatly 46 for 2 m nacl and 28 for 2 m glucose again this is likely due to the longer experimental duration of the glucose draw solution fo experiment based on the lower osmotic pressure of the 2 m glucose draw solution compared to 2 m nacl feed and draw stream already reached osmotic equilibrium after an approximate water recovery of 75 at which water transfer from feed to draw appraoched zero average tn rejection rates from fo experiments using hydrolyzed artificial urine and 2 m glucose draw solutions are shown in fig 5 b no significant difference in rejection can be reported for water recovery rates of 25 and 50 between unhydrolyzed fig 4 a and hydrolyzed fig 4 b artificial urine therefore the use of glucose based draw solutions in combination with urea hydrolysis is not a beneficial pre fo treatment strategy even though feed solution ph was not adjusted after urea hydrolysis the osmolarity of the hydrolyzed artificial urine was still 950 mmol l this in combination with the low osmotic pressure of the glucose draw solution resulted in longer fo experiments which allowed more time for the ammonium ammonia to accumulate in the draw solution after passing the membrane since the ph of the hydrolyzed artificial urine was 9 2 uncharged ammonia may pass the membrane at higher rates 17 a water recovery rate of 75 could not be achieved when 2 m glucose draw solutions were being used since feed and draw solution approached osmotic equilibrium after a water recovery of around 50 since tn rejection for artificial urine could not be enhanced by urea hydrolysis when 2 m glucose was used we tested whether urea hydrolysis in combination with adjusting the feed solution ph to 3 and using 5 m glucose draw solutions would allow for an increase in tn rejection at high water recovery rates since the high osmolarity of the glucose draw solution interfered with our tn assay we tracked the tn by measuring ammonia as a proxy which used an assay not impacted by high glucose concentrations as a result total nitrogen concentrations including creatinine and small amounts of unhydrolyzed urea could not be used to calculate rejection rates nonetheless as the creatinine concentration is low compared to liberated ammonia variations between tn and ammonia based rejection rates should be negligible and as the samples were analyzed immediately the impact of ammonia volatilization should also be minimal the results fig 5 c show that an average ammonia rejection rate of 99 could be achieved for a water recovery of 25 while 97 ammonia was rejected on average when 50 water was recovered fig 4 c even though we used a 5 m draw solution the maximum water recovery rate was only 70 and due to the duration of the fo experiment 75 min resulting ammonia rejection rates dropped to 77 on average for a better visualization of changes in water flux throughout the different fo experiments fig 6 displays the progression of water flux depending on achieved water recovery rates 3 5 fo membrane performance the fo module performed within the range of the membrane manufacturer s specifications for the majority of the experimental campaign the specific salt flux or draw solution loss per liter of output averaged 0 13 g l which was below the maximum standard value of 0 3 g l in all qc tests performed for most of the study the water flux of the membrane was above the minimum standard of 12 l m2 hr averaging 12 31 l m2 hr however the last qc test which was performed after the experimental series with 5 m glucose draw solutions demonstrated a decline in water flux to 8 6 l m2 hr it is possible that due to the high glucose concentration of the draw solution the membrane rinsing period of 30 min was insufficient to remove all the glucose which may have led to temporary membrane clogging overall even if water flux may have been compromised for a small number of experiments reverse salt flux was not impacted which suggests that all performed fo experiments generated reliable data on the membrane s rejection capabilities 4 conclusion previous studies showed that urea rejection by aquaporin based fo membranes is complicated by the small size and uncharged nature of the urea molecule in this study we explored urea hydrolysis in combination with ph adjustment as a pre fo strategy to improve urea rejection our results demonstrate that total nitrogen rejection can be increased by urea hydrolysis and ph adjustment prior to fo e g from 67 to 89 at a water recovery rate of 75 when using a 5 m nacl draw solution however high amounts of hcl have to be used for ph adjustment which make the proposed approach impracticable for most real world applications furthermore the introduced procedure leads to a significant increase in feed solution osmolality from around 750 mmol l to 2000 mmol l which reduces overall water recovery to compensate for this we used highly concentrated draw solutions which further complicated this stepwise approach reducing the likelihood of light weight and portable fo systems that can be used to recover water from urine nonetheless these strategies may be considered for larger scale applications where high osmolarity draw solutions can be recovered in an energy efficient way e g in integrated industrial processes where waste heat can be used to power draw solution recovery the utilization of glucose draw solutions resulted in lower tn rejection e g 40 for 2 m nacl vs 28 for 2 m glucose at water recovery rates of 75 and reduced the speed of water recovery when compared to nacl e g achieving 75 water recovery took 9 min when using 2 m nacl vs 47 min when using 2 m glucose which reduces the chances of generating drinkable sugar based draw solutions in future fo devices declaration of competing interest the

rejection 92 0 is obtained over uf membrane without bentonite keywords pvc ultrafiltration membrane pluronic f127 and bentonite nanoclay salt casting solution thermodynamic and kinetic analysis oilfield produced water purification 1 introduction the increasing volume of oily wastewater generation from petroleum and petrochemicals industries and the frequent oil spill into water with ecotoxicological effects have become nowadays a serious concern to the environment 1 2 though the conventional treatment methods like chemical oxidation ozone treatment gravity separation chemical precipitation mechanical coalescence photocatalytic treatment etc have been used to treat oily wastewater frequently however these methods are ineffective when oil concentration and oil droplet size falls below 400 ppm and 20 μm respectively 3 in this regard different pressure driven rate governed membrane separation techniques which are not limited by the equilibrium like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have got prime importance for the separation of micron and submicron sized oil droplets in the past few decades 4 7 the advantage of using membrane based separating units for the treatment of oily wastewater is mainly due to the i improved separation efficiency ii compact size of the unit iii low capital investment as well as operating cost iv less requirement of chemicals for treatment and v negligible generation of secondary pollutants the details of oily wastewater treatment using conventional and membrane techniques have been reviewed by padaki et al 8 jamaly et al 9 yu et al 10 and aljuboury et al 11 among polymers ultrafiltration uf membranes synthesized using polyvinylidene fluoride 12 polyethersulfone 13 polysulfone 4 polyvinyl alcohol 14 cellulose acetate 14 polyvinyl chloride 15 and polyacrylonitrile 16 have been used for the treatment of oily wastewater though the polymeric uf membranes were used for the treatment of oily wastewater however the limitation on permeate flux is a major concern which results from the deposition of oil droplets within the membrane pores and or on the membrane surface causing membrane fouling 8 9 it has been demonstrated that the fouling can be reduced by increasing the membrane hydrophilicity which improves uf performance to a large extent in this regard numerous studies have been carried out to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity for the separation of oily wastewater mostly by the i blending of inorganic nanoparticles e g mno2 13 al2o3 4 mgo 17 bentonite 15 18 20 caco3 16 sio2 19 zro2 21 etc and polymeric additives e g poly sulfobetaine 12 poly vinyl pyrrolidone 22 poly acrylicacid 23 polyethylene glycol 24 etc with the base polymer ii grafting 18 25 and iii surface modification 12 26 the addition of additives in the casting solution cs enhances the thermodynamic instability which results in the rapid exchange between solvent and non solvent called demixing while precipitation of cs and finger like porous membrane is expected 27 on contrary the viscosity of cs increases by the addition of additives which reduces the demixing rate resulting the sponge like membrane structure 27 therefore the membrane morphology may be manipulated suitably by selecting the best trade off between thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane synthesis several inorganic salts like licl cacl2 mgcl2 zncl2 in membrane casting solution are known to improve the morphology and performance of uf membrane however it is limited to polysulfone 28 polyvinylidene fluoride 29 polyacrylonitrile 30 polyethersulfone 23 and polyethylenimine 31 base polymer only for the separation of saline water and wastewater involving hazards dye materials in this regard there are no studies reported in the open literature to account for the effects of the inorganic salts in casting solution for the synthesis of pvc based uf membranes the use of low cost pvc as a polymeric membrane for the separation of oily wastewater is limited due to its increased fouling tendency however numerous studies have been carried out to improve the anti fouling behavior of pvc membranes by blending additives for the enhancement of hydrophilicity 32 35 in this regard considerable work has been reported in the recent past for the treatment of oily wastewater using uf membrane 4 12 18 20 however it is challenging task to synthesize a super hydrophilic uf membrane with membrane water contact angle 10 using pvc as a base polymer for the treatment of oily wastewater with enhanced permeation and oil rejection therefore the novelty of this study is to synthesize a pvc based super hydrophilic uf membrane for the treatment of oily waster pluronic f127 is triblock amphiphilic copolymer involving hydrophilic polyethylene oxide and hydrophobic polypropylene oxide segments the use of pluronic f127 has been reported as a membrane additive for the improvement of uf membrane performance 32 during phase inversion process polyethylene oxide segment of pluronic f127 prefers to orient towards the membrane surface while polypropylene oxide segment entangles towards the bulk phase of the membrane and improves the hydrophilicity as well as the fouling resistance of the membrane considerably in addition bentonite nanoclay with high cation exchange capacity has a strong tendency to swell in aqueous environment resulting improved membrane hydrophilicity morphology and antifouling characteristics 18 20 in this study pvc and pluronic f127 blended uf membranes were synthesized using n methyl pyrrolidone nmp solvent involving different inorganic in cs the loading of salt in cs was varied and their effect on membrane structure was quantitatively evaluated by estimating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties membrane morphology was determined using the field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem and atomic force microscope afm the hydrophilicity of the synthesized membranes was checked by measuring the membrane water contact angle in addition surface porosity surface pore density molecular weight cut off mwco pure water flux pwf and hydraulic permeability hp were also determined to characterize the synthesized membranes the performance of synthesized membranes was tested by determining permeate flux oil rejection and anti fouling behavior using oilfield produced water opw the effect of bentonite in the salt induced cs involving pvc pluronic f127 and nmp was also studied to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity 2 materials and methods 2 1

light scattering technique was used to measure average oil droplet size and its distribution in opw using zetasizer nano s90 malvern instruments ltd uk oil concentration and oil droplet size were found to be 200 10 ppm and 486 5 18 nm respectively potable multi meter hanna woonsocket ri usa was used to measure total dissolved solids and ph in opw the total dissolved solids and ph of opw were found to be 15 2 ppm and 7 4 0 6 respectively 2 3 synthesis of flat sheet uf membrane pvc based asymmetric uf membranes were synthesized by non solvent induced phase inversion method using nmp solvent and f127 additive in the presence of different inorganic salt in cs 36 the homogeneously mixed cs containing pvc nmp f127 and salt was cast onto a clean glass plate and dipped into water coagulation bath cb at 30 c a known amount of pvc 14 0 g and f127 5 0 g along with the varying amount of salt 0 1 5 g were used in the study whereas a variable amount nmp was added to make cs 100 g and the details are presented in table 1 fixed membrane thickness was obtained by fixing the gap between casting plate and steel rod using doctor blade with 150 μm thick 2 4 thermodynamic study of cs and precipitation kinetics cloud point data is used to generate binodal curve in the ternary phase diagram using pvc additive nmp water system solid liquid equilibrium line which is obtained by titration method at 30 c 32 the position of the binodal curve is influenced by the nature and quantity of additives e g f127 salts and bentonite in cs the degree of shift in binodal curve dsbc using different salts is estimated using the following equation 37 1 d s b c m g w o s a l t m g w s a l t m g w o s a l t 100 where m g w o s a l t and m g w s a l t are the miscibility gap between the polymer solvent axis and binodal line without and with salt in cs respectively the thermodynamic stability enhancement parameter t is also determined by knowing dsbc and given by 38 2 t g n m p a d d i t i v e d s b c where g n m p a d d i t i v e flory huggins interaction parameter between nmp and additive s the positive value of t indicates the instability of the system while zero value indicates the most stable system therefore the difference between t values with and without salt t demonstrates the dominance of thermodynamic effect on membrane structure 38 and higher t results finger like pore structure whereas sponge like structure is obtained for lower t values and given by 3 t t w s a l t t w o s a l t in addition to thermodynamic effect nmp and water exchange rate during phase inversion is also an important factor to determine the membrane morphology while precipitation and calculated by determining the kinetic hindrance effect using the following dimensionless parameter k 38 4 k d m

surface area of casted membrane film 38 the relative effect of salt in cs is defined by the dimensionless kinetic parameter k and higher k favors sponge like pore structure whereas finger like structure is obtained for lower k values and given by 38 6 k k w o s a l t k w s a l t therefore the structure of the synthesized membrane highly depends on the relative dominance of t and k which are mutually conflicting 2 5 characterization of membrane bulk porosity ε of membranes was determined by calculating the weight of dry and wet membrane 19 and given by 7 ε w w e t w d r y v ρ w 100 where

pressure in the cell during experiments each membrane was compacted for 30 min before the uf experiment at a higher pressure 200 kpa than the operating pressure 70 kpa using demineralized water the membrane compaction at higher pressure will ensure that there is no change in membrane structure as well as morphology while uf operation 18 20 pure water flux jw1 l m 2 h 1 and permeability pm l m 2

condition after washing the membrane for 30 min using de mineralized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 salt induced thermodynamics of casting solution and precipitation kinetics the ternary phase diagram of pvc f127 salt nmp water system with different salts like cacl2 kcl mgcl2 nacl and nh4cl in cs are shown in fig 1a e respectively using cloud point data the sum total of pvc f127 and salt is considered as the polymer additive different points in a binodal curve for a given salt loading were obtained by adding nmp in cs for the given membrane it is also mentioned that the loading of f127 is also kept constant at 5 0 g for all binodal curves the value of gnmp additive involving additives is calculated using the hansen solubility parameter in table 2 and the details are illustrated in table 3 hence the thermodynamic parameter t was calculated for using eq 2 for known values of gnmp additive and dsbc table 3 it is observed from fig 1a e that the binodal curve shifted towards polymer nmp axis with the increase in salt loading i e mg value decreases regardless of the nature of salts and consequently dsbc and t increases the increased t value emphases the lowering of thermodynamic stability of the system and the precipitation of cs completes through the instantaneous liquid liquid demixing process which results the membrane with enhanced porosity and permeability it is also observed from table 3 that the maximum t is obtained for kcl in comparison to other salt which is mainly due to the least coagulation value of kcl among the salts used 15 the morphology of the prepared membrane also depends on the demixing rate between nmp and water and quantified by the kinematic parameter k eq 4 which is evaluated by knowing μcs t0 m slope of c t c vs t plot fig 2a c d m d n s β 0 636 c m 100 g and a 450 cm2 the details of μcs t0 m d m d n s and β values for different salt induced membranes are illustrated in table 4 it is observed that d m d n s decreases while μcs and t0 increase with the increase in salt loading in cs regardless of the nature of salts therefore k value reduces with the increase in salt loading table 4 which indicates the slower rate of demixing at higher salt loading forming a dense membrane structure with small pore size on the surface to determine the combined effect of thermodynamics and kinetics on precipitation tʹ and kʹ values are determined using eqs 3 and 6 respectively and the details are shown in fig 3a e for the enhanced membrane performance it is desired to maximize tʹ and minimize kʹ however due to conflicting nature of tʹ and kʹ it is difficult to satisfy both the objectives simultaneously for given salt loading in cs hence the most desirable salt loading in cs is obtained by finding the utopia 44 for which the membrane is expected to deliver better performance the details of utopia for all salt induced cs are also shown in fig 3a e comparing the utopia s in fig 3a e the maximum dominance of tʹ over kʹ is observed for kcl induced cs fig 3b and the corresponding utopia is 25 83 15 08 which is equivalent to 1 32 g kcl in cs and expected to deliver better performing membrane than other salt induced cs 3 2 characterization of uf membranes 3 2 1 effect of salts on porosity average pore size mwco and surface pore density of pvc f127 uf membranes the bulk porosity ε of the membranes is calculated using eq 7 and the details are shown in fig 4 a it is noticed that the presence of salt in cs enhances the porosity of membrane regardless of the nature of the salts and the porosity gradually increases up to 1 0 g salt loading due to the dominance of tʹ over kʹ fig 3a e this is mainly due to the rapid demixing of nmp water and expected to form finger like membrane structure with enhanced porosity the excess of salt decreases the membrane porosity due to the dominance of kʹ over tʹ resulting slowdown of the demixing process and expected to form sponge like membrane structure with reduced porosity the maximum porosity is obtained for kcl induced cs with 1 0 g salt loading and found to be 72 85 the mean bulk pore size of the membranes d p based on bulk porosity involving different salt in cs is calculated using eq 8 and shown in fig 4b it is noticed that d p increases marginally with increasing salt loading up to 1 0 g in the cs and thereafter reduces with the increase in salt loading it is also seen that maximum pore size is noticed for the membrane involving kcl in cs and found to vary from 104 to 152 nm mwco of the pvc f127 membrane involving different salt loading in cs is estimated and reported in table 5a it is observed that mwco of the membranes increases in the presence of salt in the cs and maximum mwco is obtained for the pca1 0 membrane while minimum is obtained for p membrane an identical trend is also obtained for surface pore radius rm eq 10 as it is calculated from mwco hence surface pore density ρs eq 9 of different membranes was calculated knowing rm and the details of rm and ρs are also reported in table 5a it is observed that the presence of salt in cs has a strong effect on ρs and the maximum is achieved for the membrane involving 1 g kcl with 176 98 1020 pores m 2 it is also mentioned that mean surface pore diameter is always less than mean bulk pore diameter 8 1 d p 2 r m 10 4 indicating the efficacy of oil rejection 3 2 2 effect of salts on the hydrophilicity of pvc f127 uf membranes the effect of different salts in cs of pvc f127 nmp system on membrane hydrophilicity is evaluated in terms of static wca and the details of wca are shown in fig 4c it is observed that static wca decreases with increasing salt loading and kcl cs with 1 5 g kcl exhibits maximum hydrophilicity with minimum wca 41 5 corresponding to static wca fig 4c wa was determined using eq 11 and the details are shown in table 5a it is noticed that the wa increases with the increase in salt loading regardless of the nature of salt the enhancement in surface hydrophilicity could be attributed to the increase in ρs table 5a as the maximum ρs is obtained for the cs involving 1 0 g salt table 5a dynamic wca was determined for these membranes and the details are shown in fig 4d comparing dynamic wca pk1 0 exhibits least wca at 60 s 15 7 indicating the fast spreading of water over the membrane surface 3 2 3 effect of salt in cs on membrane morphology cross section and corresponding top fe sem images of pvc f127 membrane without salt in the cs p and membrane containing 1 0 g cacl2 kcl mgcl2 nacl and nh4cl in cs are shown in fig 5a f respectively it is observed from the cross section fe sem image of p membrane fig 5a that an asymmetric structure with undesirable large macrovoids has been formed due to the leaching out of water soluble f127 with fast demixing however the addition of different salts in cs suppressed the formation of large macrovoids in the membrane structure fig 5b f which is mainly due to reduction of k with the increase in viscosity of cs table 4 resulting controlled demixing an almost fully developed finger like structure with suppressed macrovoids underneath the membrane surface is observed for pk1 0 membrane fig 5c which is in accord with the favorable thermodynamics and kinetics of cs precipitation over other membranes fig 5b d f the improved pore density obtained from mwco studies eq 9 in presence of salt in cs is also confirmed by the top fe sem image of the membranes fig 5b f comparing all top fe sem images kcl induced cs results the better membrane with enhanced pore density over others the improvement of the membrane hydrophilicity is mainly due to the salt out effect by addition of salts in the casting solution among the inorganic salts used kcl electrolyte exhibits maximum salt out effect in the lyophobic series 45 due to the dominant salt out effect of kcl there is an increased tendency to orient hydrophilic polyethylene oxide segment of pluronic f127 towards membrane surface during phase inversion leaving hydrophobic polypropylene oxide segments in the membrane bulk phase therefore the increased number of polyethylene oxide segments in membrane surface enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane which may help to reduce water contact angle the mean surface roughness ra of pvc f127 membranes involving without and with 1 0 g salt in cs is calculated using afm images fig 6a f and details are reported in table 5b the variation of ra follows exactly reversed trend to membrane wca fig 3c and the maximum ra is obtained for kcl induced membrane 39 23 nm therefore kcl has a significant role to improve the membrane hydrophilicity 3 3 uf performance 3 3 1 pure water flux pwf of different synthesized uf membranes is measured after carrying out the uf experiment at 70 kpa for 30 min and the detailed variations in pwf are shown in fig 7 a it is observed that the pwf gradually improves with salt loading however pwf declines at higher salt loading in cs irrespective of the nature of the salt it is also observed that the enhancement in pwf with increasing salt loading in cs is marginal for nh4cl and mgcl2 on the other hand a significant improvement is noticed for cacl2 nacl and kcl salts and the maximum pwf was obtained for pk1 0 membrane 607 81 l m 2 h 1 at 70 kpa permeability of membrane pm is determined using eq 13 and shown in table 5a the salt loading enhances pm and the maximum is obtained for pk1 0 membrane with 2 41 10 10 m pa 1 s 1 the enhanced pwf of kcl induced membrane is mainly due to i reduced static and dynamic wca fig 4c and d fully developed narrow figure like structure fig 5c enhanced ρs wa pm table 5a and improved surface roughness fig 6c and table 5b 3 3 2 treatment of opw permeate flux and percentage oil rejection of the synthesized membranes was evaluated using opw at 70 kpa tmp and results are shown in fig 7b and c respectively it is observed that the enhancement in permeate flux of pvc f127 membrane follows the same trend as pwf fig 7a opw permeate flux gradually improves with the increase in salt loading for all salts and flux reduces beyond 1 0 g salt loading among the synthesized membranes pk1 0 membrane delivers the maximum opw permeate flux i e 186 0 l m 2 h 1 at 70 0 kpa tmp which is 264 68 higher than membrane without salt in cs p membrane it is also observed that the maximum oil rejection r is obtained for p membrane and marginally reduced in the presence of salt in cs the oil rejection decreases sharply up to 1 0 g salt loading in cs irrespective of salt used however rejection almost unaffected beyond 1 0 g salt loading the reduction in oil rejection is mainly due to the increase in mean pore size table 5a and rejection varies from 91 to 95 7 for all salt induced membranes usually the standard discharged specification of oil content in wastewater is less than 40 ppm 46 and therefore the above range of oil rejection is sufficient to meet the standard discharge criteria of the produced water with 200 ppm oil concentration 3 3 3 antifouling behavior to evaluate the antifouling performance of the synthesized membranes using 1 0 g salt in the casting solution frr tfr rfr and ifr were calculated and the details are shown in fig 7d the highest frr and rfr are obtained in kcl induced membrane and found to be 71 64 and 41 05 respectively the above values indicate the weak attraction between oil droplets and membrane surface and therefore the deposited oil on the membrane can easily be removed by membrane washing on the other hand kcl induced membrane shows minimum tfr and ifr i e 69 40 and 28 35 respectively and indicates the improved hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the membrane which will help to reduce preferential adsorption of oil droplets on the membrane surface 15 the above studies reveal that kcl induced uf membrane exhibits better performance for the separation of opw among the salt used in the cs 3 4 effect of bentonite in salt induced cs as bentonite is known to improve the membrane performance by enhancing the surface hydrophilicity and roughness 19 20 therefore the performance of kcl induced uf membrane was further attempted to improve by adding bentonite nanoclay in cs and the following cs composition was used pvc 14 0 g f127 5 0 g kcl 1 32 g bentonite 0 6 g and nmp 79 08 g it is mentioned that the quantity of kcl is chosen as per the basis of utopia obtained in fig 3b k 15 25 and t 25 83 whereas bentonite loading is fixed in accordance with the study of ahmad et al 20 an uf membrane was synthesized based on above cs called pkb membrane and characterized as described in section 2 4 the details of membrane characterization are reported in table 6 the details of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in table 6 are evaluated using fig 8a and b in addition cross sectional and top fe sem image and afm image and dynamic wca using pkb membrane are shown in fig 8c f respectively the details of permeation experiment using pkb membrane are also reported in table 6 it is observed that pwf and opw permeation increases significantly in presence of bentonite keeping oil rejection 91 2 the pwf and opw permeate flux using pkb membrane are found to increase by 42 25 and 37 61 over pk1 0 membrane it is also mentioned that the performance of the synthesized pkb membrane in the present study is better than the existing uf membranes prepared using salts in the casting solution 23 29 31 as the pkb membrane is dominated by the increased number of pores per unit surface area reduced water contact angle and the presence of figure like pores with improved capillary effect therefore the enhanced performance of pkb membrane is due to the improved surface pore density membrane hydrophilicity membrane roughness and membrane morphology it is interesting to note that the dynamic wca after 60 s is found to be less than 10 indicating the super hydrophilic character of pkb membrane with the enhancement in surface roughness fig 7e due to evenly distribution of bentonite on the membrane surface 19 it is also observed that porous sub layer of pkb membrane is enriched with finger like pore structure fig 7c over pk1 0 membrane fig 5b due to the increased dominance of the dimensionless t and k parameter the relative dominance of t and k using pkb membrane over pk1 0 membrane is shown in fig 3b a higher value of frr and rfr with the decrease in tfr and ifr values of pkb membrane table 6 indicates the improved fouling resistance over other membranes it is observed that the performance of pkb membrane involving kcl in cs in this study and pvc bentonite mixed matrix membrane synthesized using kcl cb 15 is comparable however the advantage of using kcl in cs over cb is mainly due to the requirement of kcl in cs is very less 1 32 g 100 g cs in comparison to kcl used in cb 37 g l in cb for almost similar uf performance 4 conclusions pvc f127 composite uf membranes are synthesized from salt induced cs and display enhanced performance compared to the membranes without salt in cs the best performing membrane is obtained for 1 0 g kcl loading in cs pk1 0 membrane with enhanced pwf 607 81 l m 2 h 1 opw permeate flux 185 98 l m 2 h 1 oil rejection 92 80 and fouling resistance frr 71 65 at 70 kpa tmp the optimum concentration of kcl loading 1 32 g in cs is determined by fixing utopia which is obtained from thermodynamic and kinetic studies further the addition of bentonite 0 6 g with 1 32 g kcl and 5 0 g f127 in cs enhances the membrane performance by improving morphology with the increase in thermodynamic parameter t and reduction in kinetic parameter k the percent enhancement of pwf and opw permeate flux using pkb membrane with dynamic wca 10 at 60 s are found to be 42 25 and 37 61 respectively with oil rejection 92 10 and improved fouling resistance parameters over pk1 0 membrane however it possible to improve the membrane performance by further increasing the membrane

14086,pluronic f127 blended polyvinyl chloride pvc ultrafiltration uf membranes using different loading of inorganic salts like nacl kcl nh4cl mgcl2 and cacl2 in casting solution involving n methyl

the uf performance and results super hydrophilic membrane with water contact angle 10 an enhancement in pure water and oilfield produced water permeate flux by 42 25 and 37 61 respectively with oil rejection 92 0 is obtained over uf membrane without bentonite keywords pvc ultrafiltration membrane pluronic f127 and bentonite nanoclay salt casting solution thermodynamic and kinetic analysis oilfield produced water purification 1 introduction the increasing volume of oily wastewater generation from petroleum and petrochemicals industries and the frequent oil spill into water with ecotoxicological effects have become nowadays a serious concern to the environment 1 2 though the conventional treatment methods like chemical oxidation ozone treatment gravity separation chemical precipitation mechanical coalescence photocatalytic treatment etc have been used to treat oily wastewater frequently however these methods are ineffective when oil concentration and oil droplet size falls below 400 ppm and 20 μm respectively 3 in this regard different pressure driven rate governed membrane separation techniques which are not limited by the equilibrium like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have got prime importance for the separation of micron and submicron sized oil droplets in the past few decades 4 7 the advantage of using membrane based separating units for the treatment of oily wastewater is mainly due to the i improved separation efficiency ii compact size of the unit iii low capital investment as well as operating cost iv less requirement of chemicals for treatment and v negligible generation of secondary pollutants the details of oily wastewater treatment using conventional and membrane techniques have been reviewed by padaki et al 8 jamaly et al 9 yu et al 10 and aljuboury et al 11 among polymers ultrafiltration uf membranes synthesized using polyvinylidene fluoride 12 polyethersulfone 13 polysulfone 4 polyvinyl alcohol 14 cellulose acetate 14 polyvinyl chloride 15 and polyacrylonitrile 16 have been used for the treatment of oily wastewater though the polymeric uf membranes were used for the treatment of oily wastewater however the limitation on permeate flux is a major concern which results from the deposition of oil droplets within the membrane pores and or on the membrane surface causing membrane fouling 8 9 it has been demonstrated that the fouling can be reduced by increasing the membrane hydrophilicity which improves uf performance to a large extent in this regard numerous studies have been carried out to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity for the separation of oily wastewater mostly by the i blending of inorganic nanoparticles e g mno2 13 al2o3 4 mgo 17 bentonite 15 18 20 caco3 16 sio2 19 zro2 21 etc and polymeric additives e g poly sulfobetaine 12 poly vinyl pyrrolidone 22 poly acrylicacid 23 polyethylene glycol 24 etc with the base polymer ii grafting 18 25 and iii surface modification 12 26 the addition of additives in the casting solution cs enhances the thermodynamic instability which results in the rapid exchange between solvent and non solvent called demixing while precipitation of cs and finger like porous membrane is expected 27 on contrary the viscosity of cs increases by the addition of additives which reduces the demixing rate resulting the sponge like membrane structure 27 therefore the membrane morphology may be manipulated suitably by selecting the best trade off between thermodynamics and kinetics of membrane synthesis several inorganic salts like licl cacl2 mgcl2 zncl2 in membrane casting solution are known to improve the morphology and performance of uf membrane however it is limited to polysulfone 28 polyvinylidene fluoride 29 polyacrylonitrile 30 polyethersulfone 23 and polyethylenimine 31 base polymer only for the separation of saline water and wastewater involving hazards dye materials in this regard there are no studies reported in the open literature to account for the effects of the inorganic salts in casting solution for the synthesis of pvc based uf membranes the use of low cost pvc as a polymeric membrane for the separation of oily wastewater is limited due to its increased fouling tendency however numerous studies have been carried out to improve the anti fouling behavior of pvc membranes by blending additives for the enhancement of hydrophilicity 32 35 in this regard considerable work has been reported in the recent past for the treatment of oily wastewater using uf membrane 4 12 18 20 however it is challenging task to synthesize a super hydrophilic uf membrane with membrane water contact angle 10 using pvc as a base polymer for the treatment of oily wastewater with enhanced permeation and oil rejection therefore the novelty of this study is to synthesize a pvc based super hydrophilic uf membrane for the treatment of oily waster pluronic f127 is triblock amphiphilic copolymer involving hydrophilic polyethylene oxide and hydrophobic polypropylene oxide segments the use of pluronic f127 has been reported as a membrane additive for the improvement of uf membrane performance 32 during phase inversion process polyethylene oxide segment of pluronic f127 prefers to orient towards the membrane surface while polypropylene oxide segment entangles towards the bulk phase of the membrane and improves the hydrophilicity as well as the fouling resistance of the membrane considerably in addition bentonite nanoclay with high cation exchange capacity has a strong tendency to swell in aqueous environment resulting improved membrane hydrophilicity morphology and antifouling characteristics 18 20 in this study pvc and pluronic f127 blended uf membranes were synthesized using n methyl pyrrolidone nmp solvent involving different inorganic in cs the loading of salt in cs was varied and their effect on membrane structure was quantitatively evaluated by estimating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties membrane morphology was determined using the field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem and atomic force microscope afm the hydrophilicity of the synthesized membranes was checked by measuring the membrane water contact angle in addition surface porosity surface pore density molecular weight cut off mwco pure water flux pwf and hydraulic permeability hp were also determined to characterize the synthesized membranes the performance of synthesized membranes was tested by determining permeate flux oil rejection and anti fouling behavior using oilfield produced water opw the effect of bentonite in the salt induced cs involving pvc pluronic f127 and nmp was also studied to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity 2 materials and methods 2 1

light scattering technique was used to measure average oil droplet size and its distribution in opw using zetasizer nano s90 malvern instruments ltd uk oil concentration and oil droplet size were found to be 200 10 ppm and 486 5 18 nm respectively potable multi meter hanna woonsocket ri usa was used to measure total dissolved solids and ph in opw the total dissolved solids and ph of opw were found to be 15 2 ppm and 7 4 0 6 respectively 2 3 synthesis of flat sheet uf membrane pvc based asymmetric uf membranes were synthesized by non solvent induced phase inversion method using nmp solvent and f127 additive in the presence of different inorganic salt in cs 36 the homogeneously mixed cs containing pvc nmp f127 and salt was cast onto a clean glass plate and dipped into water coagulation bath cb at 30 c a known amount of pvc 14 0 g and f127 5 0 g along with the varying amount of salt 0 1 5 g were used in the study whereas a variable amount nmp was added to make cs 100 g and the details are presented in table 1 fixed membrane thickness was obtained by fixing the gap between casting plate and steel rod using doctor blade with 150 μm thick 2 4 thermodynamic study of cs and precipitation kinetics cloud point data is used to generate binodal curve in the ternary phase diagram using pvc additive nmp water system solid liquid equilibrium line which is obtained by titration method at 30 c 32 the position of the binodal curve is influenced by the nature and quantity of additives e g f127 salts and bentonite in cs the degree of shift in binodal curve dsbc using different salts is estimated using the following equation 37 1 d s b c m g w o s a l t m g w s a l t m g w o s a l t 100 where m g w o s a l t and m g w s a l t are the miscibility gap between the polymer solvent axis and binodal line without and with salt in cs respectively the thermodynamic stability enhancement parameter t is also determined by knowing dsbc and given by 38 2 t g n m p a d d i t i v e d s b c where g n m p a d d i t i v e flory huggins interaction parameter between nmp and additive s the positive value of t indicates the instability of the system while zero value indicates the most stable system therefore the difference between t values with and without salt t demonstrates the dominance of thermodynamic effect on membrane structure 38 and higher t results finger like pore structure whereas sponge like structure is obtained for lower t values and given by 3 t t w s a l t t w o s a l t in addition to thermodynamic effect nmp and water exchange rate during phase inversion is also an important factor to determine the membrane morphology while precipitation and calculated by determining the kinetic hindrance effect using the following dimensionless parameter k 38 4 k d m d n s m a μ c s t 0 where dm and dns effective diffusion coefficient of solvent and non solvent in the polymer fixed reference frame m and a mass and surface area of the membrane respectively μcs viscosity of cs t0 time lag for sensing solvent in non solvent cb the term d m d n s is calculated using the following relation 38 5 d m d n s m β where m slope of c t c vs t plot ct and c solvent concentration in cb at time t and the end of precipitation which is measured using total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan and β cm 1 0 636 c for 1000 cm3 of non solvent in cb and 450 cm2 surface area of casted membrane film 38 the relative effect of salt in cs is defined by the dimensionless kinetic parameter k and higher k favors sponge like pore structure whereas finger like structure is obtained for lower k values and given by 38 6 k k w o s a l t k w s a l t therefore the structure of the synthesized membrane highly depends on the relative dominance of t and k which are mutually conflicting 2 5 characterization of membrane bulk porosity ε of membranes was determined by calculating the weight of dry and wet membrane 19 and given by 7 ε w w e t w d r y v ρ w 100 where wwet and wdry wet and dry weight of membrane kg v volume of dry membrane m3 and ρw density of water kg m3 mean bulk membrane pore size d p m was determined using the following guerout elford ferry gef

2 6 uf setup and experiments uf experiment was performed using a dead end filtration unit with a fixed membrane surface area 36 31 cm2 and cell volume 0 5 l nitrogen was used to maintain the desired pressure in the cell during experiments each membrane was compacted for 30 min before the uf experiment at a higher pressure 200 kpa than the operating pressure 70 kpa using demineralized water the membrane compaction at higher pressure will ensure that there is no change in membrane structure as well as morphology while uf operation 18 20 pure water flux jw1 l m 2 h 1 and permeability pm l m 2

condition after washing the membrane for 30 min using de mineralized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 salt induced thermodynamics of casting solution and precipitation kinetics the ternary phase diagram of pvc f127 salt nmp water system with different salts like cacl2 kcl mgcl2 nacl and nh4cl in cs are shown in fig 1a e respectively using cloud point data the sum total of pvc f127 and salt is considered as the polymer additive different points in a binodal curve for a given salt loading were obtained by adding nmp in cs for the given membrane it is also mentioned that the loading of f127 is also kept constant at 5 0 g for all binodal curves the value of gnmp additive involving additives is calculated using the hansen solubility parameter in table 2 and the details are illustrated in table 3 hence the thermodynamic parameter t was calculated for using eq 2 for known values of gnmp additive and dsbc table 3 it is observed from fig 1a e that the binodal curve shifted towards polymer nmp axis with the increase in salt loading i e mg value decreases regardless of the nature of salts and consequently dsbc and t increases the increased t value emphases the lowering of thermodynamic stability of the system and the precipitation of cs completes through the instantaneous liquid liquid demixing process which results the membrane with enhanced porosity and permeability it is also observed from table 3 that the maximum t is obtained for kcl in comparison to other salt which is mainly due to the least coagulation value of kcl among the salts used 15 the morphology of the prepared membrane also depends on the demixing rate between nmp and water and quantified by the kinematic parameter k eq 4 which is evaluated by knowing μcs t0 m slope of c t c vs t plot fig 2a c d m d n s β 0 636 c m 100 g and a 450 cm2 the details of μcs t0 m d m d n s and β values for different salt induced membranes are illustrated in table 4 it is observed that d m d n s decreases while μcs and t0 increase with the increase in salt loading in cs regardless of the nature of salts therefore k value reduces with the increase in salt loading table 4 which indicates the slower rate of demixing at higher salt loading forming a dense membrane structure with small pore size on the surface to determine the combined effect of thermodynamics and kinetics on precipitation tʹ and kʹ values are determined using eqs 3 and 6 respectively and the details are shown in fig 3a e for the enhanced membrane performance it is desired to maximize tʹ and minimize kʹ however due to conflicting nature of tʹ and kʹ it is difficult to satisfy both the objectives simultaneously for given salt loading in cs hence the most desirable salt loading in cs is obtained by finding the utopia 44 for which the membrane is expected to deliver better performance the details of utopia for all salt induced cs are also shown in fig 3a e comparing the utopia s in fig 3a e the maximum dominance of tʹ over kʹ is observed for kcl induced cs fig 3b and the corresponding utopia is 25 83 15 08 which is equivalent to 1 32 g kcl in cs and expected to deliver better performing membrane than other salt induced cs 3 2 characterization of uf membranes 3 2 1 effect of salts on porosity average pore size mwco and surface pore density of pvc f127 uf membranes the bulk porosity ε of the membranes is calculated using eq 7 and the details are shown in fig 4 a it is noticed that the presence of salt in cs enhances the porosity of membrane regardless of the nature of the salts and the porosity gradually increases up to 1 0 g salt loading due to the dominance of tʹ over kʹ fig 3a e this is mainly due to the rapid demixing of nmp water and expected to form finger like membrane structure with enhanced porosity the excess of salt decreases the membrane porosity due to the dominance of kʹ over tʹ resulting slowdown of the demixing process and expected to form sponge like membrane structure with reduced porosity the maximum porosity is obtained for kcl induced cs with 1 0 g salt loading and found to be 72 85 the mean bulk pore size of the membranes d p based on bulk porosity involving different salt in cs is calculated using eq 8 and shown in fig 4b it is noticed that d p increases marginally with increasing salt loading up to 1 0 g in the cs and thereafter reduces with the increase in salt loading it is also seen that maximum pore size is noticed for the membrane involving kcl in cs and found to vary from 104 to 152 nm mwco of the pvc f127 membrane involving different salt loading in cs is estimated and reported in table 5a it is observed that mwco of the membranes increases in the presence of salt in the cs and maximum mwco is obtained for the pca1 0 membrane while minimum is obtained for p membrane an identical trend is also obtained for surface pore radius rm eq 10 as it is calculated from mwco hence surface pore density ρs eq 9 of different membranes was calculated knowing rm and the details of rm and ρs are also reported in table 5a it is observed that the presence of salt in cs has a strong effect on ρs and the maximum is achieved for the membrane involving 1 g kcl with 176 98 1020 pores m 2 it is also mentioned that mean surface pore diameter is always less than mean bulk pore diameter 8 1 d p 2 r m 10 4 indicating the efficacy of oil rejection 3 2 2 effect of salts on the hydrophilicity of pvc f127 uf membranes the effect of different salts in cs of pvc f127 nmp system on membrane hydrophilicity is evaluated in terms of static wca and the details of wca are shown in fig 4c it is observed that static wca decreases with increasing salt loading and kcl cs with 1 5 g kcl exhibits maximum hydrophilicity with minimum wca 41 5 corresponding to static wca fig 4c wa was determined using eq 11 and the details are shown in table 5a it is noticed that the wa increases with the increase in salt loading regardless of the nature of salt the enhancement in surface hydrophilicity could be attributed to the increase in ρs table 5a as the maximum ρs is obtained for the cs involving 1 0 g salt table 5a dynamic wca was determined for these membranes and the details are shown in fig 4d comparing dynamic wca pk1 0 exhibits least wca at 60 s 15 7 indicating the fast spreading of water over the membrane surface 3 2 3 effect of salt in cs on membrane morphology cross section and corresponding top fe sem images of pvc f127 membrane without salt in the cs p and membrane containing 1 0 g cacl2 kcl mgcl2 nacl and nh4cl in cs are shown in fig 5a f respectively it is observed from the cross section fe sem image of p membrane fig 5a that an asymmetric structure with undesirable large macrovoids has been formed due to the leaching out of water soluble f127 with fast demixing however the addition of different salts in cs suppressed the formation of large macrovoids in the membrane structure fig 5b f which is mainly due to reduction of k with the increase in viscosity of cs table 4 resulting controlled demixing an almost fully developed finger like structure with suppressed macrovoids underneath the membrane surface is observed for pk1 0 membrane fig 5c which is in accord with the favorable thermodynamics and kinetics of cs precipitation over other membranes fig 5b d f the improved pore density obtained from mwco studies eq 9 in presence of salt in cs is also confirmed by the top fe sem image of the membranes fig 5b f comparing all top fe sem images kcl induced cs results the better membrane with enhanced pore density over others the improvement of the membrane hydrophilicity is mainly due to the salt out effect by addition of salts in the casting solution among the inorganic salts used kcl electrolyte exhibits maximum salt out effect in the lyophobic series 45 due to the dominant salt out effect of kcl there is an increased tendency to orient hydrophilic polyethylene oxide segment of pluronic f127 towards membrane surface during phase inversion leaving hydrophobic polypropylene oxide segments in the membrane bulk phase therefore the increased number of polyethylene oxide segments in membrane surface enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane which may help to reduce water contact angle the mean surface roughness ra of pvc f127 membranes involving without and with 1 0 g salt in cs is calculated using afm images fig 6a f and details are reported in table 5b the variation of ra follows exactly reversed trend to membrane wca fig 3c and the maximum ra is obtained for kcl induced membrane 39 23 nm therefore kcl has a significant role to improve the membrane hydrophilicity 3 3 uf performance 3 3 1 pure water flux pwf of different synthesized uf membranes is measured after carrying out the uf experiment at 70 kpa for 30 min and the detailed variations in pwf are shown in fig 7 a it is observed that the pwf gradually improves with salt loading however pwf declines at higher salt loading in cs irrespective of the nature of the salt it is also observed that the enhancement in pwf with increasing salt loading in cs is marginal for nh4cl and mgcl2 on the other hand a significant improvement is noticed for cacl2 nacl and kcl salts and the maximum pwf was obtained for pk1 0 membrane 607 81 l m 2 h 1 at 70 kpa permeability of membrane pm is determined using eq 13 and shown in table 5a the salt loading enhances pm and the maximum is obtained for pk1 0 membrane with 2 41 10 10 m pa 1 s 1 the enhanced pwf of kcl induced membrane is mainly due to i reduced static and dynamic wca fig 4c and d fully developed narrow figure like structure fig 5c enhanced ρs wa pm table 5a and improved surface roughness fig 6c and table 5b 3 3 2 treatment of opw permeate flux and percentage oil rejection of the synthesized membranes was evaluated using opw at 70 kpa tmp and results are shown in fig 7b and c respectively it is observed that the enhancement in permeate flux of pvc f127 membrane follows the same trend as pwf fig 7a opw permeate flux gradually improves with the increase in salt loading for all salts and flux reduces beyond 1 0 g salt loading among the synthesized membranes pk1 0 membrane delivers the maximum opw permeate flux i e 186 0 l m 2 h 1 at 70 0 kpa tmp which is 264 68 higher than membrane without salt in cs p membrane it is also observed that the maximum oil rejection r is obtained for p membrane and marginally reduced in the presence of salt in cs the oil rejection decreases sharply up to 1 0 g salt loading in cs irrespective of salt used however rejection almost unaffected beyond 1 0 g salt loading the reduction in oil rejection is mainly due to the increase in mean pore size table 5a and rejection varies from 91 to 95 7 for all salt induced membranes usually the standard discharged specification of oil content in wastewater is less than 40 ppm 46 and therefore the above range of oil rejection is sufficient to meet the standard discharge criteria of the produced water with 200 ppm oil concentration 3 3 3 antifouling behavior to evaluate the antifouling performance of the synthesized membranes using 1 0 g salt in the casting solution frr tfr rfr and ifr were calculated and the details are shown in fig 7d the highest frr and rfr are obtained in kcl induced membrane and found to be 71 64 and 41 05 respectively the above values indicate the weak attraction between oil droplets and membrane surface and therefore the deposited oil on the membrane can easily be removed by membrane washing on the other hand kcl induced membrane shows minimum tfr and ifr i e 69 40 and 28 35 respectively and indicates the improved hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the membrane which will help to reduce preferential adsorption of oil droplets on the membrane surface 15 the above studies reveal that kcl induced uf membrane exhibits better performance for the separation of opw among the salt used in the cs 3 4 effect of bentonite in salt induced cs as bentonite is known to improve the membrane performance by enhancing the surface hydrophilicity and roughness 19 20 therefore the performance of kcl induced uf membrane was further attempted to improve by adding bentonite nanoclay in cs and the following cs composition was used pvc 14 0 g f127 5 0 g kcl 1 32 g bentonite 0 6 g and nmp 79 08 g it is mentioned that the quantity of kcl is chosen as per the basis of utopia obtained in fig 3b k 15 25 and t 25 83 whereas bentonite loading is fixed in accordance with the study of ahmad et al 20 an uf membrane was synthesized based on above cs called pkb membrane and characterized as described in section 2 4 the details of membrane characterization are reported in table 6 the details of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in table 6 are evaluated using fig 8a and b in addition cross sectional and top fe sem image and afm image and dynamic wca using pkb membrane are shown in fig 8c f respectively the details of permeation experiment using pkb membrane are also reported in table 6 it is observed that pwf and opw permeation increases significantly in presence of bentonite keeping oil rejection 91 2 the pwf and opw permeate flux using pkb membrane are found to increase by 42 25 and 37 61 over pk1 0 membrane it is also mentioned that the performance of the synthesized pkb membrane in the present study is better than the existing uf membranes prepared using salts in the casting solution 23 29 31 as the pkb membrane is dominated by the increased number of pores per unit surface area reduced water contact angle and the presence of figure like pores with improved capillary effect therefore the enhanced performance of pkb membrane is due to the improved surface pore density membrane hydrophilicity membrane roughness and membrane morphology it is interesting to note that the dynamic wca after 60 s is found to be less than 10 indicating the super hydrophilic character of pkb membrane with the enhancement in surface roughness fig 7e due to evenly distribution of bentonite on the membrane surface 19 it is also observed that porous sub layer of pkb membrane is enriched with finger like pore structure fig 7c over pk1 0 membrane fig 5b due to the increased dominance of the dimensionless t and k parameter the relative dominance of t and k using pkb membrane over pk1 0 membrane is shown in fig 3b a higher value of frr and rfr with the decrease in tfr and ifr values of pkb membrane table 6 indicates the improved fouling resistance over other membranes it is observed that the performance of pkb membrane involving kcl in cs in this study and pvc bentonite mixed matrix membrane synthesized using kcl cb 15 is comparable however the advantage of using kcl in cs over cb is mainly due to the requirement of kcl in cs is very less 1 32 g 100 g cs in comparison to kcl used in cb 37 g l in cb for almost similar uf performance 4 conclusions pvc f127 composite uf membranes are synthesized from salt induced cs and display enhanced performance compared to the membranes without salt in cs the best performing membrane is obtained for 1 0 g kcl loading in cs pk1 0 membrane with enhanced pwf 607 81 l m 2 h 1 opw permeate flux 185 98 l m 2 h 1 oil rejection 92 80 and fouling resistance frr 71 65 at 70 kpa tmp the optimum concentration of kcl loading 1 32 g in cs is determined by fixing utopia which is obtained from thermodynamic and kinetic studies further the addition of bentonite 0 6 g with 1 32 g kcl and 5 0 g f127 in cs enhances the membrane performance by improving morphology with the increase in thermodynamic parameter t and reduction in kinetic parameter k the percent enhancement of pwf and opw permeate flux using pkb membrane with dynamic wca 10 at 60 s are found to be 42 25 and 37 61 respectively with oil rejection 92 10 and improved fouling resistance parameters over pk1 0 membrane however it possible to improve the membrane performance by further increasing the membrane

14087,in this work the adsorption of cadmium ions cd ii and lead ions pb ii in a single and binary component system with activated carbon were investigated in series of batch laboratories studies the effective operating parameters like initial ph ph0 initial concentration of metal ions contact time and temperature on the adsorption were investigated the validation of the kinetic study shows that the adsorption process is better prediction by the pseudo second order model the extended freundlich and langmuir isotherms were applied to the study of the binary system the results show that the metal ion adsorption capacities of activated carbon have increased with increasing ph and it was found that ph solution about 5 5 6 was the optimal ph value for maximum pb capacity and 7 8 for cd ii response surface methodology rsm was applied to find optimal conditions that were perceived as follows the initial ph 6 3 temperature 56 8 c and shaking speed 308 rpm the order of adsorption capacity values for each metal ions was as follows pb ii 9 30 mg g 1 cd ii 9 26 mg g 1 keywords heavy metal ions binary adsorption activated carbon desorption optimization 1 introduction world pollution with different metal ions is a major issue due to their harmful effects on living organisms particularly on the human it was proven that heavy metals like cadmium lead zinc nickel copper mercury and chromium or their compounds have destructive effects on the environment these metal ions present a notable risk to the organism and humans due to their high toxicity at even low concentrations in soil and water heavy metals have become progressively dangerous with technological development and the increasing need them for various industries for instance in the chemical fertilizers catalysts and petrochemical complexes ore processing and other modern industries 1 the significant sources of lead vary according to the area and include lead recycling industrial use of lead as well as in paints and as an additive in gasoline and lead piping used in water distribution systems 2 cadmium is commonly used in nickel cadmium ni cd batteries and as a coating for iron and steel alloys mining metal finishing textile activities refinery factories solar cells plastic stabilizers and pigments 3 4 cadmium can gradually aggregate in the organisms mainly via the food chain 5 7 exposure of human to cadmium from water can produce harmful effects in organs especially in lung kidney liver immune and cardiovascular and reproductive systems 8 furthermore metal pollutants prompted the organizations concerned with the protection of the environment to define limitations for industrial waste before its release into the environment the restriction value for cd ii and pb ii ions are 0 01 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively in effluents discharging into the inland surface waters according to the european communities 9 there are different methods to the separation of heavy metal ions from wastewaters including precipitation electroplating ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption 10 12 among these processes adsorption has a vast application to remove pollutions using some absorbent by different categories such as natural synthetic organic inorganic activated or modified models 13 22 however as the real effluents containing more than a single heavy metal to industrial application of adsorbents the study of multi component systems are necessary 23 24 only a few researchers have reported on the multi component system modeling and optimizing which deals with the competitive process 25 28 in this work the effect of a mixture including two metal ions solution cd2 and pb2 using the competitive adsorption of activated carbons has been investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbent and adsorbates in this work granular activated carbon 16 50mesh is used as an adsorbent that purchased from indo german wt c830 granule activated carbon washed firstly with deionized water after that dried in a vacuum dryer at 120 c and stored until use in the experiment standard stock solutions of cd ii and pb ii 1000 mg l 1 were provided by dissolving pure grade chemicals cd no3 2 2h2o and pb no3 2 merck germany in deionized water dw the stock solution was diluted to make samples in different concentrations in the range of 0 100 mg l using dw to metals analyze the atomic absorption spectrophotometer varian aa240 australia was applied by using air acetylene flame and the wavelength of 228 8 and 213 9 nm for cd2 and pb2 respectively 2 2 experimental experimental tests have been done in 150 ml conical ﬂasks an aqueous solution 50 ml of known concentrations of cd2 and pb2 was taken in the flasks that containing the pre weighed ac as an adsorbent these ﬂasks were put in a temperature controlled orbital shaker n biotek orbital shaking incubator nb 205 at the shaking rate of 220 rpm removal of pb2 and cd2 on the activated carbon was done using the batch method and effective parameters of ph 2 8 contact time 0 150 min ac dose 2 10 g l 1 and initial metal ion concentration 25 200 mg l 1 were studied 2 3 equilibrium and thermodynamic studies for equilibrium sorption and determination of parameters of different isotherms 0 25 g of ac put into metal solution samples with various concentrations 0 800 mg l 1 and ph fixed on 7 0 the shaking incubator set at 200 rpm and 30 c to reach equilibrium the equilibrium test was repeated at 20 c and 40 c temperature to obtain the thermodynamic parameters the results evaluated by langmuir and freundlich models in the single and multi component system forms of the equations eqs give the models in the multi component used for adsorption systems 1 to 2 1 q i q mi b i c i 1 j 1 k b j c j 2 q i k i c i j 1 k a i j c j m i 1 to take into consideration competitions between the components as well as inhibition effect the extended form of the langmuir isotherm was applied eq 1 29 where the qm and b represent the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 and constant related to the affinity of the binding sites to the adsorbates respectively c mg l 1 is the remaining metal ions in solution and q mg g 1 is the remaining adsorbate on the solid adsorbent at equilibrium the subscript i shows the number of components that equals 2 in this study the form of the freundlich model commonly used for the single component systems is well known where k and n are the adsorption capacity and intensity constants respectively the multi component freundlich isotherm can be expressed as eq 2 30 where mi is the freundlich constant for a multi component system mi 1 ni and aij is the competition coefficient the constant parameters were obtained by non linear calculations using matlab r2018a software in all cases the correlation coefficient r2 was calculated to measure the best fit 2 4 kinetic studies the kinetics of adsorption is essential due to it gives the understanding of reaction pathways and the mechanism of the adsorption the kinetic experiments performed at constant metal ion concentrations 50 100 and mg l 1 for cd2 and pb2 adsorbent dosage 4 g l 1 contact time 3 360 min and were placed in a shaking incubator 30 c 200 rpm the lagergren equation a simple pseudo ﬁrst order kinetic model is represented by 31 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 the pseudo second order model therefore can be applied to obtain the sorption kinetics 32 it calculates by 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe and qt represent the amount of the adsorbed metal ions per unit of adsorbent mass at equilibrium and at the instantaneous time respectively k1 is the reaction rate constant s 1 k2 is the second order reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 k1 k2 and qe calculate by regression of the equations 2 5 optimization the response surface methodology rsm 33 35 and 36 applied to optimize the adsorption process and besides to determine the influences of the initial ph of the solution temperature and shaking speed on the performance of ac the limits and levels of the parameters have been summarized in table 1 the quadratic function was chosen to calculate and make an approximate model eq 5 5 y b 0 i 1 k b i x i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k b ij x i x j i 1 k b ii x i 2 e where k the number of metal ions y is the response xi and xj are the variables b0 is a constant coefficient bi bii and bij are the interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and second order terms respectively to mathematic modeling the central composite design method was applied to validate the quadratic model 34 the design of experiments needs a set of experiments in different operating conditions table 1 to be able to make a prediction model and find an optimal condition model therefore the adsorption tests carried out and the collected results data was used to obtain model coefficients by the least square method 2 6 desorption experiments desorption studies examined to define the reusability of the adsorbent for this aim the unused adsorbent was put in the solution flasks in a single and binary system to saturate with metal ions ac dosage 5 g l 1 initial ph 6 0 agitation speed 250 rpm and shaking time 3 h at the next step the metal saturated ac was separated using filter paper and washed with dw several times to eliminate the remaining unadsorbed metal ions afterwards the saturated ac 0 25 g was treated in 50 ml of extractant solutions including hcl and hno3 extractant concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 m for 3 h desorption percentage calculated by the ratio of the values of the desorbed metal ion per adsorbed metal ions 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph the importance of ph on the system is due to the segregation of functional groups on the active sites of the ac surface therefore ph change can affect the kinetics as well as the equilibrium specification of the adsorption the distributions of metal ions determined by applying visual minteq v 3 1 the proportion of metal ion species was calculated at 0 001 m of ionic strength at 25 c by ph changes the results show that the only ionic species are cd2 or pb2 in the solution for ph 7 besides for ph 7 it is evident that precipitation has the main effect on the elimination of the cd2 or pb2 allocated to the precipitate formation of cd oh 2 s or pb oh 2 s the result also shows that cd oh 2 s the hydrated precipitate of cadmium was formed at ph 9 fig 1 a and this range for pb oh 2 s was around ph 8 9 fig 1b the plenty of cd2 and pb2 was at ph 8 and ph 7 respectively therefore at the present work all tests have been done at ph 7 0 these results also are supported by other previous work 37 the ph of the solution also is essential to the rate of surface reactions fig 2 indicates the effect of ph on the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions onto activated carbon the variation in adsorption capacity in this ph range is mainly due to the inﬂuence of ph on the surface adsorption characteristics of ac 38 the metal ion adsorption capacities of activated carbon increased with increasing ph due to functional groups on the adsorbent surface these groups provided have the potential to form links quickly with the metal ions and improve the surface of the activated carbon accordingly the negatively charged groups were indicating affinity towards the positively charged or neutral metal species because of the electrostatic interaction the possible reactions represent by these following equations that have a significant effect on adsorption 13 39 5 2s co h 2 2 m s co m 2 2 h 6 2s coh m s c o 2 m 2 h where m metal species of pb or cd s activated carbon surface for ph 3 0 the available active sites of the activated carbon are less for metal ions because of the protonation of the active sites at higher h concentration at a ph range of 3 0 6 0 connected h will be free from the active sites and as a result the adsorbed value of the metal ions enhanced in this ph range it assumed that ion exchange and complex formation are the main mechanisms and finally at ph 6 a combination of ion exchange and hydroxide formation may become dominant mechanisms for adsorption of the metal ions 13 40 the sharp increase in the adsorption capacities from a ph of 5 7 attributed to the ph of the point of zero charges phpzc 5 7 at ph phpzc the surface charge of ac would be negative and this promotes the interaction of surface sites and metal cations krishnani et al 2008 in spite of following this overall trend the values of the optimal ph for the adsorption of each metal ion might differ a little and may be related to their limited distribution of species and precipitating conditions 3 2 kinetics of adsorption the experimental data relating to the adsorption processing time of pb2 and cd2 are illustrated in fig 3 the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions have an increase by contact time up to 50 min corresponding to 27 mg g 1 and 25 8 mg g 1 adsorption capacity respectively the kinetic parameters for the adsorption of lead and cadmium ions onto activated carbon have listed in table 2 the results in table 2 indicated the pseudo second order kinetic model had a better prediction than the pseudo ﬁrst order model for the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 3 3 equilibrium the values of isotherm parameters as well as the correlation coefficients of the single and multi component systems are shown in table 3 respectively the values of r2 indicated that both langmuir and freundlich models could predict the adsorption behavior of pb2 and cd2 ions onto the ac however the freundlich isotherm is a slightly better correlation in the single and binary systems the monolayer adsorption capacities qm in the single component and qm i in the binary system demonstrate the affinity of metal ions to being adsorbed on the ac surface follows the sequence cd2 pb2 the data of table 3 as well as the freundlich constant k indicating the multilayer adsorption capacity therefore confirms this trend figs 4 and 5 also show the equilibrium results at 30 c that fitted with freundlich and langmuir models in the single and binary systems the adsorption capacity of ac towards metal ions in the binary mode is lower than the individual system the equilibrium adsorption capacity of pb2 and cd2 decrease from 119 32 and 117 86 in the single system to 97 63 and 94 43 mg g 1 respectively 3 4 effects of temperature the temperature effect on the metal adsorption investigated at the range of 20 c 40 c following equations were applied to obtain of thermodynamics of the process include standard gibbs free energy of adsorption change δg enthalpy of adsorption change δh and entropy of adsorption change δs 41 42 7 δ g 0 rtln k d 8 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 where t r and kd represent absolute temperature k the gas constant 8 314 j kmol 1 and a dimensionless equilibrium constant respectively the results are summarized in table 4 the positive values of δh obtained for all metal ions indicate the adsorption reaction is endothermic 43 44 endothermic mechanisms can be as a result of the film and intraparticle diffusions as well as metal species dehydration and also desorption of solvent molecules to empty the active sites 45 according to the literature the heat of adsorption ranging from 2 1 to 20 9 kj mol 1 represents the physical adsorption 46 47 it verifies by the negative values obtained for gibb s free energy of adsorption change 20 kj mol 1 46 48 50 the negative value of gibb s free energy change is necessary for the spontaneous occurrence of the process the positive values of δs show a more significant disorder at the adsorbent solution interface within the adsorption 46 49 50 3 5 response surface modeling of adsorption table 5 shows the values of the experimental test obtained for the rsm including the total adsorption capacity qtot and the single ones for pb2 qpb cd2 qcd the vast difference between values under the various conditions indicated the variables have a substantial effect in equilibrium adsorption capacities in this work the anova table tables 6 and 7 was applied to evaluate rsm results as the calculated f value fcal 116 24 was much larger than the reference one at the 5 level α 0 05 f0 05 9 10 3 02 the f test the model explains that there is a significant value of the variation in the dependent variables with 95 certainty therefore the probability value is 0 001 that demonstrating the importance and adequacy of the model the results show that the linear variables shaking speed x3 initial ph x1 and adsorption temperature x2 are effective parameters with the ratio of 51 07 34 73 and 9 70 respectively however the proportion of the quadratic and interaction terms that have the higher values of probability was ignorable this behavior repeated for the single metal adsorption capacities that are summarized in table 7 3 5 1 effects of different factors on metal ions adsorption capacity by rsm the main effect plots are illustrated in fig 6 it indicates that an increase in qtot with an increase in the level of agitation speed fig 6a form 2 306 rpm as a result by increasing the agitation speed the total and individual adsorption capacities increase it can be due to the fact that with the increased turbulence there is a decrease in boundary layer thickness around the adsorbent particles in the same way ph has a direct effect on the adsorption capacity fig 6b of metal ions that explained in section 3 1 the positive impact of temperature on qtot by increasing from 23 18 c to 56 82 c fig 6c related to the endothermic reaction of the metal ions onto ac it means that the process needs the energy to proceed more the comparison slope of the main effect plots shows that the effect of the initial ph of the solution and agitation speed on the response values are more significant than the temperature the same trend can be seen for the single component adsorption 3 5 2 optimization studies for maximizing adsorption of metal ions based on the mathematic steps deﬁned for the optimization algorithm the optimal values were obtained as initial ph 6 3 shaking speed 308 rpm and temperature 56 8 c with the corresponding y1 18 73 besides the optimal conditions to reach the highest individual adsorption capacities towards metal ions for the single system were also calculated in table 8 the results show that optimal predicted value is very close to the experimental test in optimal condition and it leads to the adsorption capacities yactual very close to the values predicted by the model yopt so it is confirming the reliability of the model the optimal conditions also show that it happens at the highest speed because of the smaller mass transfer resistance and simplified diffusion of metal ions into the pores 51 the comparison of the metal adsorption between individual adsorption capacities has indicated that the ac sample has a lower affiliation towards cd2 ions it can be due to the sequence of ionic radii which is pb2 1 20 a cd2 0 97 a 52 the preference of the sorbent for the pb2 ions may be due to the fact that the metal ions have the largest atomic weight and paramagnetic the most electronegative pb2 1 80 ev cd2 1 59 ev ion and has the highest standard reduction potential compared to and cd2 ions besides the other reason might be the smaller polarizing power of cd2 ions as a result the carbon cadmium interplay forces are weaker than carbon lead finally the higher ratio of shaking speed factor rather than ph and temperature according to rsm results can be another important reason for the role of physical sorption of metal ions by ac 3 6 desorption study table 9 shows desorption results from activated carbon for metal ions increasing metal ions desorption was the result of an increase in solvent concentration the results show that hno3 with 1 m concentration improved the metal desorption for single and binary systems four successive adsorption desorption cycles were used to investigate the reusability of activated carbon by using the hno3 1 m solution as the extractant table 10 lists the experiments results these results indicated the loss of the adsorption percentage in all cycles was merely 7 for pb2 and cd2 ions in the single component systems it revealed that the surface sites which are occupied by the metal ions could be well recovered by acid treating it is confirmed that the links between metal ions and ac surface sites are relatively weak and physical sorption has a crucial role in metal adsorption by ac as expected the desorption percentage of the metal ions from ac declined in the next cycles this result is due to a decrease in available active sites because they were inactivated in the first cycle thus diffusion of the metal ions into the inner structure of ac occurs in the new places with the lower accessibilities therefore extractant has a weaker ability to recover such occupied sites binary system study shows the adsorption capacity of adsorption as well as desorption ratio is taken place with the more decline in comparison with the single component system in the binary systems a larger part of the surface sites is saturated with metal ions as a result adsorbent exhaustion happens in a shorter time 4 conclusions in this work are used commercial low cost activated carbon to treat wastewater treatment with cd2 and pb2 in the single and the binary system the effective parameters on the adsorption process investigated such as temperature contact time initial ph and initial metal ion concentration the equilibrium time was obtained about 120 min for both metal ions and the ph of solution about 5 5 6 was the optimal ph value for pb2 and 7 8 for cd2 the kinetic study shows that the pseudo second order model can predict the model well the extended langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the binary system equilibrium data and both models fitted well the equilibrium sorption capacity follows the order pb2 cd2 may be related to different polarizing power ionic radii and dehydration energy of the ions the thermodynamic study shows that adsorption is a spontaneous endothermic nature process the positive value of δs shows that increasing randomness within the adsorption process doe by rsm indicates the ratio of essential parameters in the following order shaking speed 51 ph 35 temperature 9 in the adsorption process that can be concluded that the adsorption process significantly controls by physical adsorption mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

chromium or their compounds have destructive effects on the environment these metal ions present a notable risk to the organism and humans due to their high toxicity at even low concentrations in soil and water heavy metals have become progressively dangerous with technological development and the increasing need them for various industries for instance in the chemical fertilizers catalysts and petrochemical complexes ore processing and other modern industries 1 the significant sources of lead vary according to the area and include lead recycling industrial use of lead as well as in paints and as an additive in gasoline and lead piping used in water distribution systems 2 cadmium is commonly used in nickel cadmium ni cd batteries and as a coating for iron and steel alloys mining metal finishing textile activities refinery factories solar cells plastic stabilizers and pigments 3 4 cadmium can gradually aggregate in the organisms mainly via the food chain 5 7 exposure of human to cadmium from water can produce harmful effects in organs especially in lung kidney liver immune and cardiovascular and reproductive systems 8 furthermore metal pollutants prompted the organizations concerned with the protection of the environment to define limitations for industrial waste before its release into the environment the restriction value for cd ii and pb ii ions are 0 01 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively in effluents discharging into the inland surface waters according to the european communities 9 there are different methods to the separation of heavy metal ions from wastewaters including precipitation electroplating ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption 10 12 among these processes adsorption has a vast application to remove pollutions using some absorbent by different categories such as natural synthetic organic inorganic activated or modified models 13 22 however as the real effluents containing more than a single heavy metal to industrial application of adsorbents the study of multi component systems are necessary 23 24 only a few researchers have reported on the multi component system modeling and optimizing which deals with the competitive process 25 28 in this work the effect of a mixture including two metal ions solution cd2 and pb2 using the competitive adsorption of activated carbons has been investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbent and adsorbates in this work granular activated carbon 16 50mesh is used as an adsorbent that purchased from indo german wt c830 granule activated carbon washed firstly with deionized water after that dried in a vacuum dryer at 120 c and stored until use in the experiment standard stock solutions of cd ii and pb ii 1000 mg l 1 were provided by dissolving pure grade chemicals cd no3 2 2h2o and pb no3 2 merck germany in deionized water dw the stock solution was diluted to make samples in different concentrations in the range of 0 100 mg l using dw to metals analyze the atomic absorption spectrophotometer varian aa240 australia was applied by using air acetylene flame and the wavelength of 228 8 and 213 9 nm for cd2 and pb2 respectively 2 2 experimental experimental tests have been done in 150 ml conical ﬂasks an aqueous solution 50 ml of known concentrations of cd2 and pb2 was taken in the flasks that containing the pre weighed ac as an adsorbent these ﬂasks were put in a temperature controlled orbital shaker n biotek orbital shaking incubator nb 205 at the shaking rate of 220 rpm removal of pb2 and cd2 on the activated carbon was done using the batch method and effective parameters of ph 2 8 contact time 0 150 min ac dose 2 10 g l 1 and initial metal ion concentration 25 200 mg l 1 were studied 2 3 equilibrium and thermodynamic studies for equilibrium sorption and determination of parameters of different isotherms 0 25 g of ac put into metal solution samples with various concentrations 0 800 mg l 1 and ph fixed on 7 0 the shaking incubator set at 200 rpm and 30 c to reach equilibrium the equilibrium test was repeated at 20 c and 40 c temperature to obtain the thermodynamic parameters the results evaluated by langmuir and freundlich models in the single and multi component system forms of the equations eqs give the models in the multi component used for adsorption systems 1 to 2 1 q i q mi b i c i 1 j 1 k b j c j 2 q i k i c i j 1 k a i j c j m i 1 to take into consideration competitions between the components as well as inhibition effect the extended form of the langmuir isotherm was applied eq 1 29 where the qm and b represent the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 and constant related to the affinity of the binding sites to the adsorbates respectively c mg l 1 is the remaining metal ions in solution and q mg g 1 is the remaining adsorbate on the solid adsorbent at equilibrium the subscript i shows the number of components that equals 2 in this study the form of the freundlich model commonly used for the single component systems is well known where k and n are the adsorption capacity and intensity constants respectively the multi component freundlich isotherm can be expressed as eq 2 30 where mi is the freundlich constant for a multi component system mi 1 ni and aij is the competition coefficient the constant parameters were obtained by non linear calculations using matlab r2018a software in all cases the correlation coefficient r2 was calculated to measure the best fit 2 4 kinetic studies the kinetics of adsorption is essential due to it gives the understanding of reaction pathways and the mechanism of the adsorption the kinetic experiments performed at constant metal ion concentrations 50 100 and mg l 1 for cd2 and pb2 adsorbent dosage 4 g l 1 contact time 3 360 min and were placed in a shaking incubator 30 c 200 rpm the lagergren equation a simple pseudo ﬁrst order kinetic model is represented by 31 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 the pseudo second order model therefore can be applied to obtain the sorption kinetics 32 it calculates by 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe and qt represent the amount of the adsorbed metal ions per unit of adsorbent mass at equilibrium and at the instantaneous time respectively k1 is the reaction rate constant s 1 k2 is the second order reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 k1 k2 and qe calculate by regression of the equations 2 5 optimization the response surface methodology rsm 33 35 and 36 applied to optimize the adsorption process and besides to determine the influences of the initial ph of the solution temperature and shaking speed on the performance of ac the limits and levels of the parameters have been summarized in table 1 the quadratic function was chosen to calculate and make an approximate model eq 5 5 y b 0 i 1 k b i x i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k b ij x i x j i 1 k b ii x i 2 e where k the number of metal ions y is the response xi and xj are the variables b0 is a constant coefficient bi bii and bij are the interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and second order terms respectively to mathematic modeling the central composite design method was applied to validate the quadratic model 34 the design of experiments needs a set of experiments in different operating conditions table 1 to be able to make a prediction model and find an optimal condition model therefore the adsorption tests carried out and the collected results data was used to obtain model coefficients by the least square method 2 6 desorption experiments desorption studies examined to define the reusability of the adsorbent for this aim the unused adsorbent was put in the solution flasks in a single and binary system to saturate with metal ions ac dosage 5 g l 1 initial ph 6 0 agitation speed 250 rpm and shaking time 3 h at the next step the metal saturated ac was separated using filter paper and washed with dw several times to eliminate the remaining unadsorbed metal ions afterwards the saturated ac 0 25 g was treated in 50 ml of extractant solutions including hcl and hno3 extractant concentrations 0 01 0 1 0 5 and 1 m for 3 h desorption percentage calculated by the ratio of the values of the desorbed metal ion per adsorbed metal ions 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph the importance of ph on the system is due to the segregation of functional groups on the active sites of the ac surface therefore ph change can affect the kinetics as well as the equilibrium specification of the adsorption the distributions of metal ions determined by applying visual minteq v 3 1 the proportion of metal ion species was calculated at 0 001 m of ionic strength at 25 c by ph changes the results show that the only ionic species are cd2 or pb2 in the solution for ph 7 besides for ph 7 it is evident that precipitation has the main effect on the elimination of the cd2 or pb2 allocated to the precipitate formation of cd oh 2 s or pb oh 2 s the result also shows that cd oh 2 s the hydrated precipitate of cadmium was formed at ph 9 fig 1 a and this range for pb oh 2 s was around ph 8 9 fig 1b the plenty of cd2 and pb2 was at ph 8 and ph 7 respectively therefore at the present work all tests have been done at ph 7 0 these results also are supported by other previous work 37 the ph of the solution also is essential to the rate of surface reactions fig 2 indicates the effect of ph on the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 ions onto activated carbon the variation in adsorption capacity in this ph range is mainly due to the inﬂuence of ph on the surface adsorption characteristics of ac 38 the metal ion adsorption capacities of activated carbon increased with increasing ph due to functional groups on the adsorbent surface these groups provided have the potential to form links quickly with the metal ions and improve the surface of the activated carbon accordingly the negatively charged groups were indicating affinity towards the positively charged or neutral metal species because of the electrostatic interaction the possible reactions represent by these following equations that have a significant effect on adsorption 13 39 5 2s co h 2 2 m s co m 2 2 h 6 2s coh m s c o 2 m 2 h where m metal species of pb or cd s activated carbon surface for ph 3 0 the available active sites of the activated carbon are less for metal ions because of the protonation of the active sites at higher h concentration at a ph range of 3 0 6 0 connected h will be free from the active sites and as a result the adsorbed value of the metal ions enhanced in this ph range it assumed that ion exchange and complex formation are the main mechanisms and finally at ph 6 a combination of ion exchange and hydroxide formation may become dominant mechanisms for adsorption of the metal ions 13 40 the sharp increase in the adsorption capacities from a ph of 5 7 attributed to the ph of the point of zero charges phpzc 5 7 at ph phpzc the surface charge of ac would be negative and this promotes the interaction of surface sites and metal cations krishnani et al 2008 in spite of following this overall trend the values of the optimal ph for the adsorption of each metal ion might differ a little and may be related to their limited distribution of species and precipitating conditions 3 2 kinetics of adsorption the experimental data relating to the adsorption processing time of pb2 and cd2 are illustrated in fig 3 the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 ions have an increase by contact time up to 50 min corresponding to 27 mg g 1 and 25 8 mg g 1 adsorption capacity respectively the kinetic parameters for the adsorption of lead and cadmium ions onto activated carbon have listed in table 2 the results in table 2 indicated the pseudo second order kinetic model had a better prediction than the pseudo ﬁrst order model for the adsorption of pb2 and cd2 3 3 equilibrium the values of isotherm parameters as well as the correlation coefficients of the single and multi component systems are shown in table 3 respectively the values of r2 indicated that both langmuir and freundlich models could predict the adsorption behavior of pb2 and cd2 ions onto the ac however the freundlich isotherm is a slightly better correlation in the single and binary systems the monolayer adsorption capacities qm in the single component and qm i in the binary system demonstrate the affinity of metal ions to being adsorbed on the ac surface follows the sequence cd2 pb2 the data of table 3 as well as the freundlich constant k indicating the multilayer adsorption capacity therefore confirms this trend figs 4 and 5 also show the equilibrium results at 30 c that fitted with freundlich and langmuir models in the single and binary systems the adsorption capacity of ac towards metal ions in the binary mode is lower than the individual system the equilibrium adsorption capacity of pb2 and cd2 decrease from 119 32 and 117 86 in the single system to 97 63 and 94 43 mg g 1 respectively 3 4 effects of temperature the temperature effect on the metal adsorption investigated at the range of 20 c 40 c following equations were applied to obtain of thermodynamics of the process include standard gibbs free energy of adsorption change δg enthalpy of adsorption change δh and entropy of adsorption change δs 41 42 7 δ g 0 rtln k d 8 δ g 0 δ h 0 tδ s 0 where t r and kd represent absolute temperature k the gas constant 8 314 j kmol 1 and a dimensionless equilibrium constant respectively the results are summarized in table 4 the positive values of δh obtained for all metal ions indicate the adsorption reaction is endothermic 43 44 endothermic mechanisms can be as a result of the film and intraparticle diffusions as well as metal species dehydration and also desorption of solvent molecules to empty the active sites 45 according to the literature the heat of adsorption ranging from 2 1 to 20 9 kj mol 1 represents the physical adsorption 46 47 it verifies by the negative values obtained for gibb s free energy of adsorption change 20 kj mol 1 46 48 50 the negative value of gibb s free energy change is necessary for the spontaneous occurrence of the process the positive values of δs show a more significant disorder at the adsorbent solution interface within the adsorption 46 49 50 3 5 response surface modeling of adsorption table 5 shows the values of the experimental test obtained for the rsm including the total adsorption capacity qtot and the single ones for pb2 qpb cd2 qcd the vast difference between values under the various conditions indicated the variables have a substantial effect in equilibrium adsorption capacities in this work the anova table tables 6 and 7 was applied to evaluate rsm results as the calculated f value fcal 116 24 was much larger than the reference one at the 5 level α 0 05 f0 05 9 10 3 02 the f test the model explains that there is a significant value of the variation in the dependent variables with 95 certainty therefore the probability value is 0 001 that demonstrating the importance and adequacy of the model the results show that the linear variables shaking speed x3 initial ph x1 and adsorption temperature x2 are effective parameters with the ratio of 51 07 34 73 and 9 70 respectively however the proportion of the quadratic and interaction terms that have the higher values of probability was ignorable this behavior repeated for the single metal adsorption capacities that are summarized in table 7 3 5 1 effects of different factors on metal ions adsorption capacity by rsm the main effect plots are illustrated in fig 6 it indicates that an increase in qtot with an increase in the level of agitation speed fig 6a form 2 306 rpm as a result by increasing the agitation speed the total and individual adsorption capacities increase it can be due to the fact that with the increased turbulence there is a decrease in boundary layer thickness around the adsorbent particles in the same way ph has a direct effect on the adsorption capacity fig 6b of metal ions that explained in section 3 1 the positive impact of temperature on qtot by increasing from 23 18 c to 56 82 c fig 6c related to the endothermic reaction of the metal ions onto ac it means that the process needs the energy to proceed more the comparison slope of the main effect plots shows that the effect of the initial ph of the solution and agitation speed on the response values are more significant than the temperature the same trend can be seen for the single component adsorption 3 5 2 optimization studies for maximizing adsorption of metal ions based on the mathematic steps deﬁned for the optimization algorithm the optimal values were obtained as initial ph 6 3 shaking speed 308 rpm and temperature 56 8 c with the corresponding y1 18 73 besides the optimal conditions to reach the highest individual adsorption capacities towards metal ions for the single system were also calculated in table 8 the results show that optimal predicted value is very close to the experimental test in optimal condition and it leads to the adsorption capacities yactual very close to the values predicted by the model yopt so it is confirming the reliability of the model the optimal conditions also show that it happens at the highest speed because of the smaller mass transfer resistance and simplified diffusion of metal ions into the pores 51 the comparison of the metal adsorption between individual adsorption capacities has indicated that the ac sample has a lower affiliation towards cd2 ions it can be due to the sequence of ionic radii which is pb2 1 20 a cd2 0 97 a 52 the preference of the sorbent for the pb2 ions may be due to the fact that the metal ions have the largest atomic weight and paramagnetic the most electronegative pb2 1 80 ev cd2 1 59 ev ion and has the highest standard reduction potential compared to and cd2 ions besides the other reason might be the smaller polarizing power of cd2 ions as a result the carbon cadmium interplay forces are weaker than carbon lead finally the higher ratio of shaking speed factor rather than ph and temperature according to rsm results can be another important reason for the role of physical sorption of metal ions by ac 3 6 desorption study table 9 shows desorption results from activated carbon for metal ions increasing metal ions desorption was the result of an increase in solvent concentration the results show that hno3 with 1 m concentration improved the metal desorption for single and binary systems four successive adsorption desorption cycles were used to investigate the reusability of activated carbon by using the hno3 1 m solution as the extractant table 10 lists the experiments results these results indicated the loss of the adsorption percentage in all cycles was merely 7 for pb2 and cd2 ions in the single component systems it revealed that the surface sites which are occupied by the metal ions could be well recovered by acid treating it is confirmed that the links between metal ions and ac surface sites are relatively weak and physical sorption has a crucial role in metal adsorption by ac as expected the desorption percentage of the metal ions from ac declined in the next cycles this result is due to a decrease in available active sites because they were inactivated in the first cycle thus diffusion of the metal ions into the inner structure of ac occurs in the new places with the lower accessibilities therefore extractant has a weaker ability to recover such occupied sites binary system study shows the adsorption capacity of adsorption as well as desorption ratio is taken place with the more decline in comparison with the single component system in the binary systems a larger part of the surface sites is saturated with metal ions as a result adsorbent exhaustion happens in a shorter time 4 conclusions in this work are used commercial low cost activated carbon to treat wastewater treatment with cd2 and pb2 in the single and the binary system the effective parameters on the adsorption process investigated such as temperature contact time initial ph and initial metal ion concentration the equilibrium time was obtained about 120 min for both metal ions and the ph of solution about 5 5 6 was the optimal ph value for pb2 and 7 8 for cd2 the kinetic study shows that the pseudo second order model can predict the model well the extended langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the binary system equilibrium data and both models fitted well the equilibrium sorption capacity follows the order pb2 cd2 may be related to different polarizing power ionic radii and dehydration energy of the ions the thermodynamic study shows that adsorption is a spontaneous endothermic nature process the positive value of δs shows that increasing randomness within the adsorption process doe by rsm indicates the ratio of essential parameters in the following order shaking speed 51 ph 35 temperature 9 in the adsorption process that can be concluded that the adsorption process significantly controls by physical adsorption mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14088,re usability of exhausted or spent adsorbent in water treatment plant is became a complicated issue in this regard exhausted bentonite adsorbent has been employed for desorption regeneration using combined effect of heating and solvent regeneration method exhausted adsorbent has been characterized using ftir and sem analyses the results of regeneration study reveal effective desorption of methylene blue mb dye up to seven successive cycles among different solvents aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh significant desorption of mb 70 was achieved using aqueous hcl solution to optimized maximum desorption of mb different physico chemical parameters such as temperature initial dye concentration contact time and lifespan of adsorbent have been studied in addition desorption isotherm and desorption kinetics were also found to be fitted with sips isotherm r2 0 995 and second order kinetics models r2 0 990 respectively moreover chemically treated adsorbent paintosorp can be effectively used up to seven adsorption desorption cycles keywords paintosorp lifespan dye adsorption desorption isotherm kinetic model re generation 1 introduction dye is a type of prevalent contaminant which is extensively used in many industries such as food textile cosmetics printing and paper etc annual production of dyes is found to be 7 105 tons along with huge amount of dye containing water effluents presence of dye molecules in water cease the penetration of solar light which harshly affects the aquatic ecosystem 1 2 textile dyeing industries contribute to 17 20 of industrial water pollution as per the reports of world bank thus huge amount of dye containing water produces from textile manufacturers which severely deteriorates water quality 3 during the last two decades governments of various nations have imposed many laws and regulations to the industries but these laws are regularly violated and their implementation is subject to the abilities of the governments to check such violations 4 on the other hand industries also need a cheap and sustainable solution for treating dye associated water before discharge to the water bodies among all treatment techniques adsorption is found one of the attractive techniques to treat contaminated water which has prevalence in most of the developing countries 5 because of its simplicity in design and low cost effectiveness in treating effluent even in more concentrated forms 6 the interaction of dye with clay based thin coated adsorbent layer to remove dyes from waste water has been studied 7 8 adsorption of dye has been extensively studied for removal of dyes 9 12 however very few studies on the regeneration potential of exhausted adsorbents is available 13 less attention paid to recycle bentonite supported adsorbent in order to make wastewater treatment process feasible and economical it is important to regenerate the adsorbents 14 generally spent adsorbents are discarded to the environment the continuous accumulation of dye pollutant on adsorbents gradually reduces its overall adsorption efficiency it is a serious issue because spent adsorbent contains toxicants which have leaching possibility to environment after dumping 15 the main purpose of regeneration study is the recovery of original adsorption capacity of adsorbent by removing pollutant furthermore regeneration of exhausted adsorbents improves overall cost of treatment alleviates disposal problem of adsorbents and reduce the chance of sludge production most widely used prevalent regeneration techniques for different adsorbents is chemical and thermal regeneration in chemical regeneration different solvents acidic base or salt mixed with spent adsorbents are used to extract adsorbate the regeneration efficiency of exhausted adsorbents in chemically modified regeneration technique basically depend on the solubility of adsorbate in solvents and it may alter the structure of adsorbent whereas in thermal regeneration the regeneration efficiency depends upon heating temperature 16 in regenerating process above cracking temperature bentonite containing carbonaceous material turns into coal which thereby failing to clear the pores of clays 17 in addition to eliminating adsorbents completely the regenerating adsorbent should neither change its porous structure nor cause losses of adsorbent mass for treatment of dye a number of adsorbent coatings have been used however no study has described the regeneration potential of exhausted coating by combining chemical and thermal regeneration technique along with its characterization hence this current study focusses on the regeneration potential of dye exhausted thin coated adsorbent layer using chemical and thermal regeneration technique additionally the effect on dye desorption efficiency was also studied using different parameters of regeneration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions methylene blue dye used as an adsorbate was supplied from merck chemicals malaysia the structure of the molecule of mb c16h18n3sci is shown in fig 1 a the clay based adsorbent bentonite and binder poly vinyl alcohal pva obtained from modern lab sdn bhd malaysia was used without employing any modifications eight solvents namely hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh obtained from r m chemicals pdn malaysia were used for desorption of mb the ph of solutions was adjusted by the addition of aqueous hcl or naoh solution and the ph was measured using a ph meter elico malaysia all solvent and methylene blue 1000 mg l solutions were prepared in distilled water 2 2 fabrication of thin coated adsorbent layer adsorbent coating was prepared by using previously reported simple method 18 in this method a fixed mass of bentonite 0 3 g binder 2 5 g and distilled water were mixed together to form homogeneous paste the mixture was coated on the inner side walls of beaker using paint brush prepared adsorbent coating was then dried in oven at 80 c for 7 h 2 3 characterization the properties of adsorbent surface before and after

analyzer perkinelmer under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c per minute the surface morphology of adsorbents before and after regeneration was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem

uv vis spectrophotometer hash uv vis model dr6000 spectrophotometer 2 4 adsorption study similar adsorption procedure was employed as reported by azha et al 19 it was conducted in 250 ml beaker coated with 2 8 g adsorbent coating paintosorp the coating was dipped with 200 ml of mb dye solution of different initial dye concentrations 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l the dye solution was stirred on magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm 30 c to achieve equilibrium at equilibrium the concentration of mb was measured at λmax 664 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer the adsorption capacity and efficiency of

desorption study desorption study of exhausted paintosorp was performed by using combined effect of thermal and chemical regeneration firstly the spent adsorbent was heated in the temperature range of 150 200 c for 45 min in a furnace the adsorbent was weighed before and after heating heated adsorbent 2 8 g coating beaker was filled with solvents at 30 60 c and solvent temperature was maintained using heating plate in chemical regeneration experiment the solvents including hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 ethanol c2h5oh propanol c3h7oh acetone ch3 2co sodium chloride nacl sodium hydroxide naoh and distilled water h2o were used selection of solvent was carried out on the basis of desorption efficiency to examine the effect of different parameters such as effect of contact time temperature initial dye concentration and lifespan of adsorbent desorption capacity and efficiency of paintosorp was calculated using the following equation 3 q e d e s o r p m g g v c f m 4 q q e d e

filled with different initial concentrations of mb 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l except initial dye concentration for sorption experiment other variables were kept constant and batch desorption study was

coating were performed at constant temperature with selected solvent for different initial dye concentration of 50 200 mg l after every 15 150 min of time interval the dye samples were taken out and absorbance was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer the kinetic data were investigated using intraparticle diffusion kinetic models pseudo second order and pseudo first order 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 surface morphology alternation in the surface morphology of adsorbents after desorption of mb were analyzed by sem analysis the sem imges of paintosorp after desorption of mb using thermo chemical process a and after 7th cycle using by thermo chemical approach b is shown in fig 1 b c bentonite supported adsorbent without dye adsorption has a typical plate like smooth morphology 22 23 paintosorp after mb adsorption showed tightly packed layered pattern with rough surface morphology composed of many platelets which resulted agglomeration of large particles 18 however after dye desorption the roughness of the adsorbent was slightly increased which establihed desorption of mb molecules from the surface of paintosorp moreover the roughness of surface increased after thermo chemical process and adsorbent approaches towards un adsorbed type adsorbent but incompletely similar to fresh adsorbent fig 1b furthermore in seventh cycle of adsorption desorption the nature of adsorbent was completely changed as compared to unadsorbed paintosorp fig 1c the adsorption was not found conducive in last cycle which subsequently reduced the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent after certain adsorption desorption cycles 3 1 2 ftir analysis the samples of paintosorp a after adsorption b after desorption c of mb by thermo chemical process were analysis by ftir analysis as shown in fig 2 in all samples the medium intensity absorption bands at 3630 3440 and 850 cm 1 are attributed to the sioh alohmg bonds and cao h vibrations and other weak band at 788 cm 1 confirmed the preseance of fe3 ohmg bonds mg rich smectite and fe3 depleted 24 the ftir spectra of paintosorp after dye desorption covered an extensive band in the region 3600 3250 cm 1 attributed to the presence of oh group or physically moisture content 25 moreover the ch stretching at 2964 and 2929 cm 1 is observed for alkane group 26 a small change in peaks before and after adsorption in range of 1800 1600 cm 1 attributed to aromatic rings at 1427 cm 1 the ch peak intensity increases after adsorption of dye besides that the peak at 1250 67 cm 1 indicating cn stretching which slightly shifted after adsorption as compared to paintosorp confirmed the existence of mb after adsorption a medium intensity peak at 916 23 cm 1 revealed the presence of alaloh group while another peak at 877 65 cm 1 indicated the presence of almgoh group respectively 26 after adsorption of dye slightly shift in peak intensity are found all samples however a drastic change in peaks shifting is observed in the ftir spectrum of thermo chemical treated paintosorp compared to other samples the stretching bands in between 3690 3620 cm 1 attributed to oh stretching of hydroxyl group the peaks appearing at 1635 cm 1 represented the bending of nh bond due to removal of mb molecule however the peak of ch bending of alkane group at 1427 cm 1 disappeared and shifted to 1396 cm 1 which established the alternation in the properties of adsorbent after desorption using thermo chemical treatment overall no change in the functional groups of bentonite was observed except slightly change on peak position of paintosorp that may be due to the binder after treating with thermo chemical method 3 1 3 tga dta analysis the thermal stability of paintosorp binder and saturated paintosorp after heating were determined by thermogravimetric analysis the tga dta graphs of paintosorp before and after dye desorption are shown in fig 3 the tga dta curve at 110 c not showed any weight loss which may be due to strong bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent that established chemisorption process however after dye adsorption on paintosorp the mass loss around 310 325 c might be as a result of mb decomposition from to the adsorbent 27 this peak was not observed either in case of binder or in paintosorp before adsorption that may be owing to the absence mb in them the second peak near 700 c appeared due to decomposition kinetics of paintosorp calcite reduction of oh andco3 2 resultig formation of metal oxides of si al mg ca and fe etc 28 29 moreover adsorbent coating and binder was found stable up to temperature of 300 c further heating led to breakdown bentonite and binder due to dihydroxylation which reduces surface area for adsorption 30 moreover at 200 c the coating turned brownish which can be due to decomposition of mb accompanied by changes in properties of adsorbent therefore for detailed study the temperature range was chosen as 150 200 c fig s 1 3 2 desorption of mb using thermo chemical method since the interaction between mb and bentonite adsorbent coating is chemisorption phenomenon the solvent and heating methods alone cannot provide sufficient energy to break the bonds between mb and adsorbent coating therefore combination of the thermal and chemical thermo chemical methods might be more useful as compared to individual treatment combined thermo chemical process improves regeneration efficiency and increases the lifespan of adsorbent desorption efficiency of mb using different solvents after heating at 160 c is shown in fig 4 among aqueous solution of eight different solvents hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh hcl showed the highest desorption 70 for mb from the bentonite based coating releasing of h form functional group which present in adsorbent coating depends upon the value of ionization constant ka of different functional groups and follows the order as inorganic acids carboxylic acids alcohols ketones amines alkanes bases higher value of ka establishes more concentration of h3o which increase positive charges on the surface of adsorbent in acidic medium resulting improvement in dye desorption desorption of dye may be occurred due to electrostatic repulsion of cations dye from the adsorbent surface cationic dye molecules attracted towards negatively charged particles on the adsorbent surface a schematic diagram of dye desorption is shown in fig 5 3 3 the effect of temperature temperature is one of the important parameters which plays significant towards dye desorption chemosorbed process shows desorption of dye at evaluate temperature as compared to physiosorbed process therefore combined themo chemical method was studied based on obtained data desorption efficiency was found to be increased with increase in temperature from 30 60 c as shown in fig 6 the desorption efficiency of mb increased due to improvement in solubility and distribution coefficient of adsorbate with respect to temperature 30 60 c however further improvement in temperature reduced dye desorption efficiency according to durling et al an increase in temperature leads to enhancement in extraction desorption efficiency up to certain limit however further increasing temperature results extraction of more inactive compounds which might be due to more diffusion of mb in solid phase 31 3 4 the effect of initial dye concentration and desorption isotherm model the graph related to initial dye concentration for desorption of mb is shown in fig 7 a increment in dye desorption capacity was found with respect to initial dye concentration and temperature at 60 c desorption capacity of 200 mg l becomes doubled as compared to 30 mg l and 50 mg l it might be due to increase in repulsive forces between dye molecules and adsorbents 32 moreover in the presence of solvent dye solubility increases with increasing temperature which results higher desorption capacity for all initial dye concentration 33 enhancement in dye desorption capacity also attributed to high driving force for mass transfer from solid to liquid phase desorption efficiency of mb decreased with increasing initial dye concentration and temperature shown in fig 7 b decline in desorption efficiency with initial dye concentration might be due to strongly adsorbed mb molecules on the surface of adsorbent which cannot be easily removed from adsorbent it may be due the fact of limited reagent solvent hcl may not able to react with excess dye concentration furthermore dye molecules have a tendency to form aggregate during adsorption process which results lower diffusivity with increasing dye concentration 34 thus desorption efficiency decreases with initial dye concentration under diffusion controlled process the effect of initial dye concentration was performed for desorption of mb from exhausted bentonite coating using thermo chemical method adsorbent coating appears as dark blue without desorption as shown in fig s 2 a the adsorbent became light blue as shown in fig s 2 b and c after desorption of mb using initial dye concentration of 30 and 50 mg l desorption capacity of mb from adsorbent at 60 c was found 8 mg g and 20 mg g for 30 mg l and 50 mg l dye solutions respectively fig 7 a however dark blue spots of mb are remined on adsorbent coating when 100 200 mg l initial dye concentration was employed as shown in fig s 2 d f desorption capacities of dye for 100 150 and 200 mg l initial dye concentrations were achieved as 24 mg g 27 mg g and 30 mg g respectively at 60 c fig 7 b obtained results of dye desorption indicated that the amount of dye desorbed increased with increasing initial dye concentration it might be due to high driving forces for mass transfer from adsorbent coating to solvent solution similar results were also reported by daneshvar et al 35 3 5 desorption isotherms desorption isotherm describes the phenomenon of adsorbate transfer from solid phase to liquid phase 36 37 in the present study four isotherm models langmuir freundlich r p and sips model were chosen to fit optimal experimental conditions at equilibrium to understand desorption behaviour of dye from the adsorbent langmuir isotherm model assumes monolayer adsorption and desorption on homogeneous surface of adsorbents without any interaction between adsorbed molecules with neighbouring active sites 35 the freundlich isotherm describes reversible and non ideal adsorption desorption systems 38 redlich peterson r p and sips models are a three parameter hybrid isotherm which composed of characteristics of both model of langmuir and freundlich isotherms 39 to represent adsorption desorption equilibria the versatile nature of these models help to get an idea regarding heterogenous and homogenous nature of surface 38 sips model reduces to freundlich isotherm at low adsorbate concentration while at high adsorbate concentration it behaves like langmuir isotherm model which predict monolayer adsorption isotherm 38 for each temperature 60 30 c linearized form of langmuir freundlich r p and sips isotherms models were studied these curves plotted for each isotherm model and are compared with experimental data as shown in fig s 3 and their data are listed in table 1 it is inferred from the data of table 1 that at each temperature freundlich and sips model were found to be best fitted than langmuir and r p models higher value for r2 and lower rmse value of freundlich showed its best fitness as compared to other isotherm models which indicated heterogeneous nature of adsorbent surface resulting multilayer desorption of dye molecules desorption of dye molecules stops once it reached to saturation the range of slope for freundlich isotherm model was found in between 0 1 indicated the adsorption intensity and surface heterogeneity if 1 n value is closer to zero than surface becomes more heterogenous 40 furthermore if the value of 1 n is lower than unity then process will be chemisorbed process sips model three parameter models also showed better performance than langmuir model two parameter models the term α in three parameter models described the heterogeneity of surface if α value of r p and sips model is close to 1 then model approaches to freundlich isotherm model whereas if α value is close to 0 then model approaches to langmuir isotherm model the reason for better performance of three parameter models than two parameter models probably that the sips model is a combined form of langmuir and freundlich models and also applicable for wide range of dye concentration therefore experimental data for desorption of mb using paintosorp adsorbent followed the order sips freundlich r p langmuir 3 6 the effect of contact time the effect of contact time on desorption of mb dye from adsorbent coating was investigated using 50 200 mg l dye solution at temperature range from 60 c to 40 c it has been observed that desorption efficiency of mb increased with increasing contact time combined effects of heating and solvent treatment revealed 70 dye desorption from adsorbent coating at 60 c as shown in fig s 4 initially the dye desorption was rapid 10 100 min as shown in fig s 5 about 68 for thermo chem method onward 100 120 min dye desorption was continued at a slower rate followed by constant desorption until 150 min the concentration of dye in solid phase was higher in starting of experiment due to purity of solvent furthermore improvement in solubility of dye in solvent resulted increasing driving force of concentration gradient 20 as time passes situation was reversed and dye concentration was started to increase in liquid phase while decreased in solid phase finally dye rate simultaneously decreased until process reached at equilibrium slower dye desorption rate at the end of process may be due to saturation of solvent and decreasing dye concentration in solid phase 25 3 7 kinetics isotherms the experimental data was analyzed with pseudo first order ps1 and pseudo ps2 second order model to have an understanding of kinetics of desorption process fig s 6a the parameters of ps1 and ps2 model are listed in table 2 the ps2 model was more suitable for explanation of desorption of mb from adsorbent in comparison to ps1 the r2 value of ps2 for every temperature and initial dye concentration was found to be higher 0 99 moreover rmse of ps1 was much higher than ps2 the increment in rate constant k2 of ps2 model increased with increasing initial dye concentration might be due to faster rate of desorption of mb from surface of adsorbents at lower initial dye concentration it may be as a results of desorption of dye molecules via electrostatic repulsion moreover other factors such as solubility of mb in solvent as well as concentration gradient are driving parameters to change the rate constant and contributed to the kinetics of the system thus kinetics mechanism of mb desorption can be explained in terms of two step process namely dislocation of dye molecules from solid surface followed by dissolution in solvent in first step mb molecules desorbed from solid phase followed by the dissolution of mb in liquid phase the overall process is thus reflected in terms of pseudo second order kinetics 3 8 intraprticle diffusion model desorption process was also analyzed to understand diffusion mechanisms using intraparticle diffusion model the desorption of dye from paintosorp can be described by five mechanism a interaction on desorption sites via physical and chemical reaction on surface of adsorbent b diffusion of inner particle c intraparticle diffusion pore diffusion d film diffusion e external diffusion 41 42 it is assumed that steps a b c and e are fast according to weber and morris 43 adsorption capacity q mg g varies linearly with square root of time 44 the straight line for q vs t0 5 plot gives slope and intercept as intraparticle rate constant kpi mg g h0 5 and thickness of boundary layer ci if the straight line of q vs t0 5 plot passes through origin c 0 then intraparticle diffusion is sole rate limiting step otherwise different processes are controlling the adsorption desorption rate weber and morris plots for desorption of mb from paintosorp at 60 c 50 c and 40 c not passed through origin and showed trilinear curve fig s 6b initially a sharper region kp1 in fig s 6b completed within 0 5 h shows instantaneous desorption of mb from paintosorp the second region kp2 gradually increases the desorption rate which completed within 2 h confirms that intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step the last region kp3 reveals the final equilibrium stage 45 the plots of kp2 and kp3 are linear but not passed through origin which means that intraparticle diffusion is not only rate limiting step other mechanism also involved in desorption of mb moreover value of rate constant for all region increases with increasing initial dye concentration additionally the value of intercept ci decreases with initial dye concentration which shows decrement in the thickness of boundary layer and a driving force for desorption process third region of boundary layer diffusion which confirms that diffusion of mb through the external surface to the solution of solvent phase fig s 6b 3 9 lifespan of adsorbent the main aim of regeneration study is to determine its adsorption efficiency after several successive adsorption desorption cycles seven successive cycles of adsorption desorption were performed using thermo chemical method as shown in fig 8 in first cycle the adsorption efficiency of dye decreased up to 99 followed by first cycle to 63 in seventh cycle and desorption efficieny decreased from 72 to 52 in seventh cycle using hcl as a solvent decline in adsorption desorption efficiency might be due to the saturation of active sites on the surface of adsorbents moreover heating of spent adsobate before dipping adsorbent coting in solvent may cause the collapse of paintosorp formulation which reduced the surface area and finally decreased dye adsorption desorption efficieny of different dyes using adsorbents have also been studied 35 46 however adsorption efficiency of most of the adsorbents decreased up to less than 60 after third cycle in comparison to previously reported adsorbents paintosorp can be effectively used up to seven cycles with 70 mb desorption using hcl solution 4 conclusion desorption of mb from paintosorp was effectively studied using combined effect of thermal and chemical regeneration method the results of tga dta analysis revealed thermally stable characterstic of paintosorp which can be used in the temperature range from 150 to 200 c among different solvents such as aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh the highest dye desorption efficincy 70 was achieved by hcl solution the effect of different operating variables including solvent temperature initial dye concentration and contact time established improvement in mb desorption efficiency with increasing temperature initial dye concentration and time the adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were found to be best fitted with sips and ps2 model moreover sem and ftir analyses results confirmed that saturated adsorbent can be successfully used up to seven adsorption desorption cycles therefore thermo chemical method can be effectively employed for regeneration of saturated or exhausted paintosorp declaration of

14088,re usability of exhausted or spent adsorbent in water treatment plant is became a complicated issue in this regard exhausted bentonite adsorbent has been employed for desorption regeneration using combined effect of heating and solvent regeneration method exhausted adsorbent has been characterized using ftir and sem analyses the results of regeneration study reveal effective desorption of methylene blue mb dye up to seven successive cycles among different solvents aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh significant desorption of mb 70 was achieved using aqueous hcl solution to optimized maximum desorption of mb different physico chemical parameters such as temperature initial dye concentration contact time and lifespan of adsorbent have been studied in addition desorption isotherm and desorption kinetics were also found to be fitted with sips isotherm r2 0 995 and second order kinetics models r2 0 990 respectively moreover chemically treated adsorbent paintosorp can be effectively used up to seven adsorption desorption cycles keywords paintosorp lifespan dye adsorption desorption isotherm kinetic model re generation 1 introduction dye is a type of prevalent contaminant which is extensively used in many industries such as food textile cosmetics printing and paper etc annual production of dyes is found to be 7 105 tons along with huge amount of dye containing water effluents presence of dye molecules in water cease the penetration of solar light which harshly affects the aquatic ecosystem 1 2 textile dyeing industries contribute to 17 20 of industrial water pollution as per the reports of world bank thus huge amount of dye containing water produces from textile manufacturers which severely deteriorates water quality 3 during the last two decades governments of various nations have imposed many laws and regulations to the industries but these laws are regularly violated and their implementation is subject to the abilities of the governments to check such violations 4 on the other hand industries also need a cheap and sustainable solution for treating dye associated water before discharge to the water bodies among all treatment techniques adsorption is found one of the attractive techniques to treat contaminated water which has prevalence in most of the developing countries 5 because of its simplicity in design and low cost effectiveness in treating effluent even in more concentrated forms 6 the interaction of dye with clay based thin coated adsorbent layer to remove dyes from waste water has been studied 7 8 adsorption of dye has been extensively studied for removal of dyes 9 12 however very few studies on the regeneration potential of exhausted adsorbents is available 13 less attention paid to recycle bentonite supported adsorbent in order to make wastewater treatment process feasible and economical it is important to regenerate the adsorbents 14 generally spent adsorbents are discarded to the environment the continuous accumulation of dye pollutant on adsorbents gradually reduces its overall adsorption efficiency it is a serious issue because spent adsorbent contains toxicants which have leaching possibility to environment after dumping 15 the main purpose of regeneration study is the recovery of original adsorption capacity of adsorbent by removing pollutant furthermore regeneration of exhausted adsorbents improves overall cost of treatment alleviates disposal problem of adsorbents and reduce the chance of sludge production most widely used prevalent regeneration techniques for different adsorbents is chemical and thermal regeneration in chemical regeneration different solvents acidic base or salt mixed with spent adsorbents are used to extract adsorbate the regeneration efficiency of exhausted adsorbents in chemically modified regeneration technique basically depend on the solubility of adsorbate in solvents and it may alter the structure of adsorbent whereas in thermal regeneration the regeneration efficiency depends upon heating temperature 16 in regenerating process above cracking temperature bentonite containing carbonaceous material turns into coal which thereby failing to clear the pores of clays 17 in addition to eliminating adsorbents completely the regenerating adsorbent should neither change its porous structure nor cause losses of adsorbent mass for treatment of dye a number of adsorbent coatings have been used however no study has described the regeneration potential of exhausted coating by combining chemical and thermal regeneration technique along with its characterization hence this current study focusses on the regeneration potential of dye exhausted thin coated adsorbent layer using chemical and thermal regeneration technique additionally the effect on dye desorption efficiency was also studied using different parameters of regeneration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions methylene blue dye used as an adsorbate was supplied from merck chemicals malaysia the structure of the molecule of mb c16h18n3sci is shown in fig 1 a the clay based adsorbent bentonite and binder poly vinyl alcohal pva obtained from modern lab sdn bhd malaysia was used without employing any modifications eight solvents namely hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh obtained from r m chemicals pdn malaysia were used for desorption of mb the ph of solutions was adjusted by the addition of aqueous hcl or naoh solution and the ph was measured using a ph meter elico malaysia all solvent and methylene blue 1000 mg l solutions were prepared in distilled water 2 2 fabrication of thin coated adsorbent layer adsorbent coating was prepared by using previously reported simple method 18 in this method a fixed mass of bentonite 0 3 g binder 2 5 g and distilled water were mixed together to form homogeneous paste the mixture was coated on the inner side walls of beaker using paint brush prepared adsorbent coating was then dried in oven at 80 c for 7 h 2 3 characterization the properties of adsorbent surface before and after regeneration were studied using different techniques thermal stability of adsorbent binder and spent adsorbent was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga dta using sta 6000 thermogravimetric analyzer perkinelmer under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c per minute the surface morphology of adsorbents before and after regeneration was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem changes in functional group of adsorbent was identified by total reflectance fourier transform infrared ftir nicolet is10 in between 4000 400 cm 1 range the concentration of dye was measured by using uv vis spectrophotometer hash uv vis model dr6000 spectrophotometer 2 4 adsorption study similar adsorption procedure was employed as reported by azha et al 19 it was conducted in 250 ml beaker coated with 2 8 g adsorbent coating paintosorp the coating was dipped with 200 ml of mb dye solution of different initial dye concentrations 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l the dye solution was stirred on magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm 30 c to achieve equilibrium at equilibrium the concentration of mb was measured at λmax 664 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer the adsorption capacity and efficiency of adsorbent was calculated by the following equations 1 q e s o r p t i o n m g g v c i c e m 2 q c i c e c i 100 where v is volume of dye solution l m is mass of adsorbent used g ce is final concentration of mb mg l ci is initial concentration of mb mg l the mb loaded adsorbent coating dried in oven for 4 h at 70 c after adsorption of dye and further used for regeneration studies 2 5 desorption study desorption study of exhausted paintosorp was performed by using combined effect of thermal and chemical regeneration firstly the spent adsorbent was heated in the temperature range of 150 200 c for 45 min in a furnace the adsorbent was weighed before and after heating heated adsorbent 2 8 g coating beaker was filled with solvents at 30 60 c and solvent temperature was maintained using heating plate in chemical regeneration experiment the solvents including hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 ethanol c2h5oh propanol c3h7oh acetone ch3 2co sodium chloride nacl sodium hydroxide naoh and distilled water h2o were used selection of solvent was carried out on the basis of desorption efficiency to examine the effect of different parameters such as effect of contact time temperature initial dye concentration and lifespan of adsorbent desorption capacity and efficiency of paintosorp was calculated using the following equation 3 q e d e s o r p m g g v c f m 4 q q e d e

concentration and desorption isotherms thermodynamics and kinetics isotherms batch adsorption study was carried out in 250 ml beaker having 2 8 g paintosorp coated on glass beaker the beaker was filled with different initial concentrations of mb 30 50 100 150 and 200 mg l except initial dye concentration for sorption experiment other variables were kept constant and batch desorption study was conducted as explained in section 2 4 the isotherm data were analyzed using langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson r p isotherm all isotherm equations are given below 5 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 6

coating were performed at constant temperature with selected solvent for different initial dye concentration of 50 200 mg l after every 15 150 min of time interval the dye samples were taken out and absorbance was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer the kinetic data were investigated using intraparticle diffusion kinetic models pseudo second order and pseudo first order 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 surface morphology alternation in the surface morphology of adsorbents after desorption of mb were analyzed by sem analysis the sem imges of paintosorp after desorption of mb using thermo chemical process a and after 7th cycle using by thermo chemical approach b is shown in fig 1 b c bentonite supported adsorbent without dye adsorption has a typical plate like smooth morphology 22 23 paintosorp after mb adsorption showed tightly packed layered pattern with rough surface morphology composed of many platelets which resulted agglomeration of large particles 18 however after dye desorption the roughness of the adsorbent was slightly increased which establihed desorption of mb molecules from the surface of paintosorp moreover the roughness of surface increased after thermo chemical process and adsorbent approaches towards un adsorbed type adsorbent but incompletely similar to fresh adsorbent fig 1b furthermore in seventh cycle of adsorption desorption the nature of adsorbent was completely changed as compared to unadsorbed paintosorp fig 1c the adsorption was not found conducive in last cycle which subsequently reduced the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent after certain adsorption desorption cycles 3 1 2 ftir analysis the samples of paintosorp a after adsorption b after desorption c of mb by thermo chemical process were analysis by ftir analysis as shown in fig 2 in all samples the medium intensity absorption bands at 3630 3440 and 850 cm 1 are attributed to the sioh alohmg bonds and cao h vibrations and other weak band at 788 cm 1 confirmed the preseance of fe3 ohmg bonds mg rich smectite and fe3 depleted 24 the ftir spectra of paintosorp after dye desorption covered an extensive band in the region 3600 3250 cm 1 attributed to the presence of oh group or physically moisture content 25 moreover the ch stretching at 2964 and 2929 cm 1 is observed for alkane group 26 a small change in peaks before and after adsorption in range of 1800 1600 cm 1 attributed to aromatic rings at 1427 cm 1 the ch peak intensity increases after adsorption of dye besides that the peak at 1250 67 cm 1 indicating cn stretching which slightly shifted after adsorption as compared to paintosorp confirmed the existence of mb after adsorption a medium intensity peak at 916 23 cm 1 revealed the presence of alaloh group while another peak at 877 65 cm 1 indicated the presence of almgoh group respectively 26 after adsorption of dye slightly shift in peak intensity are found all samples however a drastic change in peaks shifting is observed in the ftir spectrum of thermo chemical treated paintosorp compared to other samples the stretching bands in between 3690 3620 cm 1 attributed to oh stretching of hydroxyl group the peaks appearing at 1635 cm 1 represented the bending of nh bond due to removal of mb molecule however the peak of ch bending of alkane group at 1427 cm 1 disappeared and shifted to 1396 cm 1 which established the alternation in the properties of adsorbent after desorption using thermo chemical treatment overall no change in the functional groups of bentonite was observed except slightly change on peak position of paintosorp that may be due to the binder after treating with thermo chemical method 3 1 3 tga dta analysis the thermal stability of paintosorp binder and saturated paintosorp after heating were determined by thermogravimetric analysis the tga dta graphs of paintosorp before and after dye desorption are shown in fig 3 the tga dta curve at 110 c not showed any weight loss which may be due to strong bonding between adsorbate and adsorbent that established chemisorption process however after dye adsorption on paintosorp the mass loss around 310 325 c might be as a result of mb decomposition from to the adsorbent 27 this peak was not observed either in case of binder or in paintosorp before adsorption that may be owing to the absence mb in them the second peak near 700 c appeared due to decomposition kinetics of paintosorp calcite reduction of oh andco3 2 resultig formation of metal oxides of si al mg ca and fe etc 28 29 moreover adsorbent coating and binder was found stable up to temperature of 300 c further heating led to breakdown bentonite and binder due to dihydroxylation which reduces surface area for adsorption 30 moreover at 200 c the coating turned brownish which can be due to decomposition of mb accompanied by changes in properties of adsorbent therefore for detailed study the temperature range was chosen as 150 200 c fig s 1 3 2 desorption of mb using thermo chemical method since the interaction between mb and bentonite adsorbent coating is chemisorption phenomenon the solvent and heating methods alone cannot provide sufficient energy to break the bonds between mb and adsorbent coating therefore combination of the thermal and chemical thermo chemical methods might be more useful as compared to individual treatment combined thermo chemical process improves regeneration efficiency and increases the lifespan of adsorbent desorption efficiency of mb using different solvents after heating at 160 c is shown in fig 4 among aqueous solution of eight different solvents hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh hcl showed the highest desorption 70 for mb from the bentonite based coating releasing of h form functional group which present in adsorbent coating depends upon the value of ionization constant ka of different functional groups and follows the order as inorganic acids carboxylic acids alcohols ketones amines alkanes bases higher value of ka establishes more concentration of h3o which increase positive charges on the surface of adsorbent in acidic medium resulting improvement in dye desorption desorption of dye may be occurred due to electrostatic repulsion of cations dye from the adsorbent surface cationic dye molecules attracted towards negatively charged particles on the adsorbent surface a schematic diagram of dye desorption is shown in fig 5 3 3 the effect of temperature temperature is one of the important parameters which plays significant towards dye desorption chemosorbed process shows desorption of dye at evaluate temperature as compared to physiosorbed process therefore combined themo chemical method was studied based on obtained data desorption efficiency was found to be increased with increase in temperature from 30 60 c as shown in fig 6 the desorption efficiency of mb increased due to improvement in solubility and distribution coefficient of adsorbate with respect to temperature 30 60 c however further improvement in temperature reduced dye desorption efficiency according to durling et al an increase in temperature leads to enhancement in extraction desorption efficiency up to certain limit however further increasing temperature results extraction of more inactive compounds which might be due to more diffusion of mb in solid phase 31 3 4 the effect of initial dye concentration and desorption isotherm model the graph related to initial dye concentration for desorption of mb is shown in fig 7 a increment in dye desorption capacity was found with respect to initial dye concentration and temperature at 60 c desorption capacity of 200 mg l becomes doubled as compared to 30 mg l and 50 mg l it might be due to increase in repulsive forces between dye molecules and adsorbents 32 moreover in the presence of solvent dye solubility increases with increasing temperature which results higher desorption capacity for all initial dye concentration 33 enhancement in dye desorption capacity also attributed to high driving force for mass transfer from solid to liquid phase desorption efficiency of mb decreased with increasing initial dye concentration and temperature shown in fig 7 b decline in desorption efficiency with initial dye concentration might be due to strongly adsorbed mb molecules on the surface of adsorbent which cannot be easily removed from adsorbent it may be due the fact of limited reagent solvent hcl may not able to react with excess dye concentration furthermore dye molecules have a tendency to form aggregate during adsorption process which results lower diffusivity with increasing dye concentration 34 thus desorption efficiency decreases with initial dye concentration under diffusion controlled process the effect of initial dye concentration was performed for desorption of mb from exhausted bentonite coating using thermo chemical method adsorbent coating appears as dark blue without desorption as shown in fig s 2 a the adsorbent became light blue as shown in fig s 2 b and c after desorption of mb using initial dye concentration of 30 and 50 mg l desorption capacity of mb from adsorbent at 60 c was found 8 mg g and 20 mg g for 30 mg l and 50 mg l dye solutions respectively fig 7 a however dark blue spots of mb are remined on adsorbent coating when 100 200 mg l initial dye concentration was employed as shown in fig s 2 d f desorption capacities of dye for 100 150 and 200 mg l initial dye concentrations were achieved as 24 mg g 27 mg g and 30 mg g respectively at 60 c fig 7 b obtained results of dye desorption indicated that the amount of dye desorbed increased with increasing initial dye concentration it might be due to high driving forces for mass transfer from adsorbent coating to solvent solution similar results were also reported by daneshvar et al 35 3 5 desorption isotherms desorption isotherm describes the phenomenon of adsorbate transfer from solid phase to liquid phase 36 37 in the present study four isotherm models langmuir freundlich r p and sips model were chosen to fit optimal experimental conditions at equilibrium to understand desorption behaviour of dye from the adsorbent langmuir isotherm model assumes monolayer adsorption and desorption on homogeneous surface of adsorbents without any interaction between adsorbed molecules with neighbouring active sites 35 the freundlich isotherm describes reversible and non ideal adsorption desorption systems 38 redlich peterson r p and sips models are a three parameter hybrid isotherm which composed of characteristics of both model of langmuir and freundlich isotherms 39 to represent adsorption desorption equilibria the versatile nature of these models help to get an idea regarding heterogenous and homogenous nature of surface 38 sips model reduces to freundlich isotherm at low adsorbate concentration while at high adsorbate concentration it behaves like langmuir isotherm model which predict monolayer adsorption isotherm 38 for each temperature 60 30 c linearized form of langmuir freundlich r p and sips isotherms models were studied these curves plotted for each isotherm model and are compared with experimental data as shown in fig s 3 and their data are listed in table 1 it is inferred from the data of table 1 that at each temperature freundlich and sips model were found to be best fitted than langmuir and r p models higher value for r2 and lower rmse value of freundlich showed its best fitness as compared to other isotherm models which indicated heterogeneous nature of adsorbent surface resulting multilayer desorption of dye molecules desorption of dye molecules stops once it reached to saturation the range of slope for freundlich isotherm model was found in between 0 1 indicated the adsorption intensity and surface heterogeneity if 1 n value is closer to zero than surface becomes more heterogenous 40 furthermore if the value of 1 n is lower than unity then process will be chemisorbed process sips model three parameter models also showed better performance than langmuir model two parameter models the term α in three parameter models described the heterogeneity of surface if α value of r p and sips model is close to 1 then model approaches to freundlich isotherm model whereas if α value is close to 0 then model approaches to langmuir isotherm model the reason for better performance of three parameter models than two parameter models probably that the sips model is a combined form of langmuir and freundlich models and also applicable for wide range of dye concentration therefore experimental data for desorption of mb using paintosorp adsorbent followed the order sips freundlich r p langmuir 3 6 the effect of contact time the effect of contact time on desorption of mb dye from adsorbent coating was investigated using 50 200 mg l dye solution at temperature range from 60 c to 40 c it has been observed that desorption efficiency of mb increased with increasing contact time combined effects of heating and solvent treatment revealed 70 dye desorption from adsorbent coating at 60 c as shown in fig s 4 initially the dye desorption was rapid 10 100 min as shown in fig s 5 about 68 for thermo chem method onward 100 120 min dye desorption was continued at a slower rate followed by constant desorption until 150 min the concentration of dye in solid phase was higher in starting of experiment due to purity of solvent furthermore improvement in solubility of dye in solvent resulted increasing driving force of concentration gradient 20 as time passes situation was reversed and dye concentration was started to increase in liquid phase while decreased in solid phase finally dye rate simultaneously decreased until process reached at equilibrium slower dye desorption rate at the end of process may be due to saturation of solvent and decreasing dye concentration in solid phase 25 3 7 kinetics isotherms the experimental data was analyzed with pseudo first order ps1 and pseudo ps2 second order model to have an understanding of kinetics of desorption process fig s 6a the parameters of ps1 and ps2 model are listed in table 2 the ps2 model was more suitable for explanation of desorption of mb from adsorbent in comparison to ps1 the r2 value of ps2 for every temperature and initial dye concentration was found to be higher 0 99 moreover rmse of ps1 was much higher than ps2 the increment in rate constant k2 of ps2 model increased with increasing initial dye concentration might be due to faster rate of desorption of mb from surface of adsorbents at lower initial dye concentration it may be as a results of desorption of dye molecules via electrostatic repulsion moreover other factors such as solubility of mb in solvent as well as concentration gradient are driving parameters to change the rate constant and contributed to the kinetics of the system thus kinetics mechanism of mb desorption can be explained in terms of two step process namely dislocation of dye molecules from solid surface followed by dissolution in solvent in first step mb molecules desorbed from solid phase followed by the dissolution of mb in liquid phase the overall process is thus reflected in terms of pseudo second order kinetics 3 8 intraprticle diffusion model desorption process was also analyzed to understand diffusion mechanisms using intraparticle diffusion model the desorption of dye from paintosorp can be described by five mechanism a interaction on desorption sites via physical and chemical reaction on surface of adsorbent b diffusion of inner particle c intraparticle diffusion pore diffusion d film diffusion e external diffusion 41 42 it is assumed that steps a b c and e are fast according to weber and morris 43 adsorption capacity q mg g varies linearly with square root of time 44 the straight line for q vs t0 5 plot gives slope and intercept as intraparticle rate constant kpi mg g h0 5 and thickness of boundary layer ci if the straight line of q vs t0 5 plot passes through origin c 0 then intraparticle diffusion is sole rate limiting step otherwise different processes are controlling the adsorption desorption rate weber and morris plots for desorption of mb from paintosorp at 60 c 50 c and 40 c not passed through origin and showed trilinear curve fig s 6b initially a sharper region kp1 in fig s 6b completed within 0 5 h shows instantaneous desorption of mb from paintosorp the second region kp2 gradually increases the desorption rate which completed within 2 h confirms that intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step the last region kp3 reveals the final equilibrium stage 45 the plots of kp2 and kp3 are linear but not passed through origin which means that intraparticle diffusion is not only rate limiting step other mechanism also involved in desorption of mb moreover value of rate constant for all region increases with increasing initial dye concentration additionally the value of intercept ci decreases with initial dye concentration which shows decrement in the thickness of boundary layer and a driving force for desorption process third region of boundary layer diffusion which confirms that diffusion of mb through the external surface to the solution of solvent phase fig s 6b 3 9 lifespan of adsorbent the main aim of regeneration study is to determine its adsorption efficiency after several successive adsorption desorption cycles seven successive cycles of adsorption desorption were performed using thermo chemical method as shown in fig 8 in first cycle the adsorption efficiency of dye decreased up to 99 followed by first cycle to 63 in seventh cycle and desorption efficieny decreased from 72 to 52 in seventh cycle using hcl as a solvent decline in adsorption desorption efficiency might be due to the saturation of active sites on the surface of adsorbents moreover heating of spent adsobate before dipping adsorbent coting in solvent may cause the collapse of paintosorp formulation which reduced the surface area and finally decreased dye adsorption desorption efficieny of different dyes using adsorbents have also been studied 35 46 however adsorption efficiency of most of the adsorbents decreased up to less than 60 after third cycle in comparison to previously reported adsorbents paintosorp can be effectively used up to seven cycles with 70 mb desorption using hcl solution 4 conclusion desorption of mb from paintosorp was effectively studied using combined effect of thermal and chemical regeneration method the results of tga dta analysis revealed thermally stable characterstic of paintosorp which can be used in the temperature range from 150 to 200 c among different solvents such as aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid ethanol acetone propanol nitric acid water nacl and naoh the highest dye desorption efficincy 70 was achieved by hcl solution the effect of different operating variables including solvent temperature initial dye concentration and contact time established improvement in mb desorption efficiency with increasing temperature initial dye concentration and time the adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were found to be best fitted with sips and ps2 model moreover sem and ftir analyses results confirmed that saturated adsorbent can be successfully used up to seven adsorption desorption cycles therefore thermo chemical method can be effectively employed for regeneration of saturated or exhausted paintosorp declaration of

14089,zinc ion is a toxic metal mostly contained in industrial effluents to minimize its contamination levels due to the detrimental effect on both human health environment and the eco system developing novel materials is essential for the removal of zinc ions this study focused on the development and utilization of groundwater treatment plant sludge microwave incinerated rice husk ash and derived hybrid biosorbent for the removal of zinc ions from aqueous solution standard methods were adopted for the preparation and characterization of the biosorbents and zinc aqueous solution the biosorption experiments performed in batch systems at room temperature factors that may affect the zinc removal efficiency such as ph reaction time initial concentration counter ions regeneration studies and substrate removal rate were investigated results indicated that the developed biosorbents removed zinc concentration between 84 99 removal efficiencies for derived hybrid biosorbent at different zinc concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l the effluent concentrations were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for groundwater treatment plant sludge microwave incinerated rice husk ash and derived hybrid biosorbent respectively the biosorbents exhibited high affinity to zinc ion in the presence of competing ions biosorbents were regenerated into their initial functionality by hcl acid without significant capacity loss therefore the biosorbents can be viable alternatives for efficient zinc

sulphate 1 introduction portable water is a necessity for safeguarding the environmental ecosystem and human health recent trends in development within the industrial sector have greatly increased portable water demand for human activities however these industrial developments have led to the accumulation of diverse contaminants from industrial waste discharges thus causing water pollution through heavy metal ions 1 2 the neglect of wastewater disposal facilities and environmental regulations in developing countries is another environmental problem by heavy metals 3 water contamination from heavy metals has gained significant attention due to its negative environmental effects and the prevailing health concerns 4 in recent times heavy metal contamination has become an increasingly serious global environmental problem that causes various diseases and disorders 5 heavy metals affect the environment including human animal and plant health as they are harmful carcinogenic non biodegradable and easily stored in living organisms 6 unlike microbial pollutants heavy metals do not degrade they can contaminate the soil and aquatic ecosystems 7 they are lethal contaminants to the environment because they highly affect water quality and pose a significant risk to the ecosystem and human health 8 the presence of these toxic metal ions in water bodies is originated either by natural or anthropogenic origins industrial waste discharges have remained the major source of heavy metals 3 thus compliance with permissible limits before discharging effluents into the environment becomes necessary heavy metals such as copper mercury zinc cobalt lead chromium and cadmium have been causing severe environmental problems 1 zn ii is an essential element for a healthy life however concentration in humans below the limits of sensitivity can cause disorders to the immune system prostate problems diabetes and macular degeneration it is one of the common surface and groundwater contaminants mostly originating from solid and liquid wastes containing high concentration of zinc 9 the removal of this harmful metal from aqueous streams is an important issue posed by the discharge of industrial effluents as excess intake can lead to acute nausea accompanied gastrointestinal disorders some of the major human induced sources of zn ii in waterways are batteries pigments zinc alloys paints canisters anti corrosion coating rubber and chemical industries 4 10 depression lethargy respiratory weakness homeostasis loss of appetite vomiting nausea neurological symptoms and increased thirst are the ill effects of zn ii accumulation by human 11 12 the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa has set the maximum permissible limit for zn ii in drinking water to be 5 mg l while department of environment doe malaysia set 3 mg l as the maximum permissible limit of zn ii ions in drinking water therefore reliable novel materials and techniques are welcome for the detection and removal of trace zn ii ions from aqueous solutions to enhance the cleaner environment reduce negative impacts of the contaminant and avert the occurrence of global warming and climate change researchers have invested in developing reliable efficient cost effective and suitable technologies for heavy metals detection and extraction from aqueous solutions 6 the determination of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution requires several instrumental techniques such as total reflection xrf s icp aes and icp ms 1 13 14 others are neutron activation analysis cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry capillary electrophoresis flow injection chemiluminescence enzyme analysis method optical nano sensors graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry faas ultraviolet visible spectrometry aas spr dispersive liquid liquid microextraction hplc electrode position ion exchange voltammetry on line pre concentration and polarography 15 18 these methods have various advantages such as low detection limits multi elements determination at one time and sensitivity however their disadvantages outweigh the advantages they require large infrastructure trained technicians narrow working concentration range long response time expensive techniques sophisticated and costly instrumentation they consume time and produces matrix interferences they have poor reproducibility low repeatability and ion selectivity they are time consuming unsuitable for field analysis and complex in sample preparation 1 3 13 15 17 18 the detection and removal of zn ii ions are necessary due to its toxic nature 18 therefore developing novel simple accurate systematic versatile specific reliable speedy fruitful and applicable techniques for sensitive and selective detection of zn ii ions in aqueous solutions has great importance in protection of water quality environmental eco system and human health physical biological and chemical technologies have been widely used for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions these include cation surfactant reverse osmosis membrane filtration chemical precipitation solvent extraction coagulation filtration electrolysis electrochemical techniques biological technology flotation ion exchange advanced oxidation biosorption sedimentation distillation electrodialysis ultrafiltration immobilization volatilization etc 1 4 6 8 12 13 15 22 23 unfortunately these technologies have shortcomings ranging from lower efficiencies high initial operational and maintenance cost crud formation lower selectivity and mass transfer rate 13 high toxicity operating complexity 16 large amount of organic solvents harmful to health 18 high energy requirements generation of voluminous sludge low trace metals removal rate 2 3 to negative environmental effects 7 of all the methods highlighted biosorption is the most appropriate for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions because of their availability cost effectiveness ease of processing and high rate of natural affinity to metal ions 6 7 24 biosorption is being widely used due to its operational flexibility extreme efficiency reversibility reusability ease of use fast response selective removal efficient regeneration and reduced toxic sludge generation 1 3 15 according to 22 biosorption is the best because of the automated analytical techniques involved absence of emulsion great enrichment ratio and safety therefore it becomes necessary to develop efficient and sustainable biosorbents for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions these biosorbents should not only be cost effective but should also possess large biosorption capacity high surface area good reusability absence of internal diffusion resistance and be non toxic to the environment adsorbents commonly used for heavy metal removal includes zeolites prussian blue crystalline silicotitanate alumina ferrocyanides and hydrous oxides of multivalent cations pillared clays resorcinol formaldehyde resin 21 carbon nanotubes and nanostructure titanium alumina 2 waste metal sludge bentonite and fe iii hydroxide waste 16 organic chelate resin silica and silica gel titania and molecular imprinted polymers 22 however they are been characterised by low adsorption capacity separation inconvenience 2 non recyclability high preparation cost toxic sludge generation chemical precipitation low yield and very high processing temperatures required for their activation 15 recently environmentalist s focus has been attracted to the use of bio sorbents such as algal biomass ulva sp nipa palm nut rice husk bamboo bone char eggshell palmyra palm nut java plum seed peat water chestnut shell oil palm bagasse corncob tea waste wastewater sludge and pomegranate peel neem leaf etc 12 15 19 25 26 several researchers have explored the use of nano sized solid based biosorbents such as nanoparticles and nanotubes for metal ions removal from water 17 compared with these micro sized particles gtps and mirha offer significantly higher surface area to volume ratio that promises much greater biosorption capacity simple operations 2 chemical functionality with high stability high adsorption rate extreme selectivity at optimum conditions and rapid responses towards trace metals removal they exhibit high number of unsaturated atoms on their surfaces take part in chemical bonding in the case of high biosorption and trace level sensitivity these properties make them more attractive than conventional ion exchange materials 21 they are always superior in selective adsorption of toxic metal ions 3 the use of rice husk as a sustainable biosorbent for metal removal has risen 27 this is due to the properties of rice husk described by 20 28 a study on the use of activated rice husk arh and carbonized rice husk crh as biosorbents in a batch experiment for metal removal revealed that of all the metals evaluated zn ii yielded the best removal with the net uptake of 56 7 and 77 2 respectively 29 at a biosorbent dose of 0 7 g 50 ml and ph 6 using rice husk derived activated carbon 72 34 zn ii removal was attained 30 the effects of rice husk and its quantity contact time ph were studied on zn ii adsorption from an industrial wastewater where the full biosorption potential was found at 19 617 mg g amounting to 70 removal efficiency 31 similarly at an adsorbent dose of 1 g l the temperature of 25 c ph of 4 and at 1 5 h the maximum biosorption capacity of zn ii onto untreated rice husk and naoh treated rice husk achieved were 12 41 mg g and 20 08 mg g respectively 32 to date researchers continue to develop and examine various biosorbents for zn ii removal despite the good performance of most biosorbents it is still a big challenge for the researchers to achieve the best removal sustainably recently hybrid composite materials have received much attention for specific zn ii removal due to their complexation ability and coordination mechanism 22 they are flexible and accommodates most ions within the inner coordination sphere the technique exhibits both thermal and chemical stability due to strong covalent bonding 21 therefore the fabrication of novel solid state materials is welcome for ultra trace zn ii removal from aqueous solutions 1 highly ordered large pore dimensional materials are indigence in the new fabrication of novel composite biosorbent to control the shape and selectivity of molecular recognition which generates the signal transduction as a response to the binding event 18 hence this study focused on evaluating gtps mirha and dhb as biosorbents for zn ii removal from an aqueous solution this is due to their numerous benefits with no detrimental effect on the environment thus the study objectives were to synthesize the aqueous solution determine the solution characteristics collect and prepare biosorbents from organic waste synthesize and characterize the biosorbents fabricate the reactors acclimatize the solution in the reactor evaluate the biosorbents performance determine substrate removal rate and investigate the effects of reaction time and biosorbents dose 2 materials and method 2 1 materials all materials and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification 33 the standard zn ii ions solution 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving zinc nitrate in distilled water the working solutions obtained by diluting the stock solution with distilled water the solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of common inorganic salts nacl nano3 cacl2 and ca no3 2 were prepared by dissolving the specific salts in distilled water the initial solution ph was adjusted to the neutral value using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 or naoh solution before adding the biosorbent 26 2 2 synthetic wastewater preparation dissolved in distilled water purina alpo puppy dog meal produced synthetic wastewater to imitate domestic wastewater with moderate intensity as the baseline wastewater for all reactors the dog food was ground for about 5 min 0 6 g prepared and incorporated into the influent tank for ph stability a specific volume 0 15 ml of phosphate buffer added to the wastewater sample wastewater sample is prepared daily to provide fresh carbonaceous matter to the biomass 34 the use of synthetic wastewater was important to provide coherent organic loading for a stronger evaluation of the reactors 35 the wastewater possesses the c n p ratio of about 100 24 3 meeting the required minimum for a typical medium strength wastewater characteristic 36 table 2 highlights the characteristics of synthetic wastewater in comparison to typical medium strength wastewater specific levels of zn ii measured by adding sufficient amounts of zinc chloride in the wastewater 2 3 preparation of biosorbents rice husk as an abundant agro based waste material 37 in malaysia was obtained from local farmers in perak malaysia to increase the sio2 content and decrease sintering effect usually indicated by a dramatic reduction in the specific surface area heat treating of the rice husk at 800 c and heating rate of 10 c min for 2 h in a microwave furnace became necessary 30 38 the sample was pre cleaned by chemical treatment technique using hcl and naoh solutions it was subsequently washed thoroughly and cleaned with deionized water dried for 2 h at 105 c in an oven 39 40 after cooling at ambient temperature samples were stored in a tight container before the commencement of the experiment and the produced mirha used in this study test results obtained from xrf analysis of mirha showed that important components such as sio2 capable of influencing the biosorption process were present see fig 1 the study used gtps in muddy structure generated from the utp sewage treatment plant for the experiments sample dried according to 41 standard methods as shown in fig 2 converted to powder form by grinding and sieving 11 40 and afterwards stored in a closed container derived hybrid biosorbent dhb gtps mirha consists of an equal mixture of gtps and mirha 2 4 reactor properties fabrication and operation the study adopts the use of thermoplastic material to concoct four 4 identical biological reactors shown in fig 3 for the experimental purpose reactor a was for the control purpose while reactors b c and d contained biomass along with gtps mirha and dhb respectively each reactor possesses the following properties overall dimension 375 mm l x170 mm w x25 mm h aeration compartment 300 mm l x160 mm w x180 mm h freeboard 40 mm and aeration tank capacity 7 5 l two units each of effluent containers ten litre gallons sample containers thermoplastic materials one unit each of masterflex digital peristaltic pumps four meter masterflex tube size 16 an influent tank mixer and forty eight units of tube diffusers were purchased and used during the experiment the purpose of installing horizontal air tube diffusers at the reactor base was to provide oxygen in an up flow pattern thus enabling sufficient aeration to the biomass 42 influent and effluent points positioned at the bottom and top respectively were in opposite directions the study used baffles to prevent washout of biomass into the effluent unit 43 the reactors designed operating parameters were influent flow rate 7 5 m3 d mixed liquor temperature 20 c minimum dissolved oxygen 2 0 mg l sludge age 40 days bcod bod ratio 1 6 f m ratio 0 085 solid retention time 30 days mixed liquor suspended solids 3500 mg l and bod volumetric loading 0 2 kgbod m3d the choice of thirty days as the solid retention time was to encourage the growth of slow growing bacteria in the reactors 34 the continuous flow reactors started operation in the environmental research laboratory erl of utp using seed sludge acquired from the universities sewage treatment plant and medium synthetic wastewater at fixed hrt of 19 2 h each reactor contained seven litres of the synthetic wastewater prepared daily for 125 days 500 mg l stock solution of zn ii is prepared daily with znso4 and diluted to obtain solutions of required concentrations utilized reagents in the study are of analytical grade the experiments were conducted at eight different reference points tagged rp 1 8 rp 1 the primary acclimatization period for biomass stabilization 44 a maximum of 15 days was sufficient for this rp 2 the secondary acclimatization period at which 2000 mg l each of the biosorbents gtps mirha and dhb were added to reactors b c and d respectively as illustrated in table 1 it took ten 10 days for the adsorbents to acclimatize rp 3 to 8 these reference points used different doses of zn ii concentration varying from 0 5 15 0 mg l as influents lastly effluent samples collected daily and all reactors evaluated for the entire sampling duration cleaning of the tank immediately followed to prepare for the next effluent collection 2 5 analysis and analytical methods the surface area of gtps mirha and dhb were measured with a quantachrome version 2 01 autosorb 1 surface area analyser the samples degassed at 300 c and adsorption desorption process with liquid nitrogen at 195 55 c brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bhj techniques were used to determine the surface area pore volume and pore radius of the gtps mirha and dhb samples 45 47 the surface morphology was determined using scanning electron microscopy the samples were platinum coated by a vacuum electrical sputter coater for 3 min before measurements were taken 48 the zn ii ion determination was analyzed using icp aes 49 the matrices effect was not judged as the icp aes has no such effects sample solutions having complicated matrices were not used and no significant interference of matrices observed 46 the initial synthetic wastewater characteristics were analysed according to the standard methods for wastewater effluent discharges 34 41 all parameters related to the efficiency of the reactor mentioned in table 2 including mlss mlvss and sludge volume index svi were measured by methods described in related studies 28 50 51 zn ii concentration sorption capacity was investigated 11 measured and calculated according to 9 all other analyses performed in triplicate 52 except for the microbial population and the findings expressed as mean standard deviation 51 2 6 zn ii detection sorption and elution studies during the detection process 2000 mg l of the biosorbents were added in a mixture of 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l zn ii in three different reactors with the specific volume of 7 5 l the control reactor was also arranged according to the biosorbents they were grounded properly to get smooth in the absorbance spectra by the reactors the limit detection ld of zn ii is determined based on eq 1 below 1 l d k s b m where k is equal to the value of 3 sb is the standard discrepancy and m the slope of the linear plot respectively biosorbents substrate removal rate is a function of zn ii concentration fed into the reactors thus the rate of substrate used expressed by stover kincannon model in eq 2 below 2 d s d t q v s i s e 3 r e c o c f c o x 100 the rate of change for substrate removal is given by ds dt is kg m3 d 53 54 q as the influent flow rate m3 d and the reactor capacity as v m3 55 while si se are the initial and the final concentrations of zn ii a graph of q v s i s e against se as obtained in figs 10 13 illustrates the actual substrate removal rates for all effluents thus eq 3 was used to calculate the removal efficiencies for zn ii ions where re is the metal removal efficiency co cf as the initial and residual metal mg l concentrations at equilibrium 26 to investigate the most efficient eluting agent the biosorbents were equilibrated with fixed zn ii checked for several eluents such as naoh h2so4 and hcl the filtrate was finally relocated to the test tubes 33 the adsorbed zn ii ions onto biosorbent were washed with deionized water several times and transferred into 50 ml beaker to this 5 ml of the eluting agent was added and the mixture stirred for 20 min the concentration of zn ii ions released from the biosorbent into the aqueous solution was analyzed by the icp aes 48 56 according to the experimental protocol the 0 20 m hcl solution was used as an appropriate eluent 57 the biosorbents were reused for several cycles to investigate the reusability 58 2 7 sludge volume index several researchers used different approaches for sludge settleability measurement in wastewater treatment nevertheless the sludge volume index svi is the most prominent method used in recent times 59 svi is the volume occupied by 1 g of sludge after the first 30 min of sedimentation 50 it is presently the most recognised standard unit of measurement used for activated sludge solids characterisation 60 svi index grouped activated sludge into three classes as sludge that is of good quality svi 100 ml g intermediate quality 100 svi 150 ml g weak quality svi 150 ml g eq 4 is used to compute the amount of svi 61 4 s v i m l g s s v m l l s s m g l x 1000 where ss and ssv are the suspended solids and sediment sludge volume respectively 62 this explains that svi is a function of settling speed throughout the settling column where the activated sludge varies from settling height h to time t 59 in this study sludge suspensions were sampled daily from the reactors and svi obtained by settling sludge suspensions in a cylinder of 1000 ml capacity the settled sludge solids volume recorded after 30 min 63 the study adopts standard methods 2710 d40 41 42 for svi determination 3 results and discussion 3 1 influent concentrations of zn ii aqueous solutions containing zn ii with dosage ranging from 0 5 15 0 mg l added to each reactor were prepared to contaminate the water samples four reactors were prepared to contain different materials as biosorbents just like most reactors acclimatization took place all this happened within 130 days fig 4 below shows influent zn ii concentrations and the corresponding sampling days 3 2 effluent concentrations of zn ii fig 5 illustrates the effluent concentrations from the four reactors the performance evaluation of biosorbents tagged effluents a b c and d are reflected most of which at certain points exceeded the malaysian standard a effluent discharge concentration of zn ii from the biosorption studies using zn ii metal synthetic solutions effluent concentrations obtained were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for biosorbents a b c and d respectively least biosorption experienced from effluent a because it is the control containing only biomass serving as a biosorbent 3 2 1 gtps effluent b that used gtps as a biosorbent experienced the highest reduction this is in line with a study by authors 12 where 19 2 mg g was obtained as the maximum quantity of zn ii removed the author further reported that the performance efficiency depended heavily on the initial concentration of metal a standard phenomenon in most experimental studies ghorpade 64 believed that aluminium and iron contents present in gtps play a significant role in enhancing biosorption capacity 3 2 2 mirha at the end of the acclimatisation period for rice husk the solutions tagged effluents received an additional 0 5 mg l of zn ii after some sampling days careful observation revealed that only 0 01 mg l of zn ii was present in the aqueous solution i e 98 of the metal was significantly absorbed the developed sorption process reveals that there is a strong relationship between sorbates sorbents active sites and the environmentally friendly use of the rice husk 65 this is not unconnected to the presence of abundant mesopores and micropores with several nanometres in size of rice husk 27 thus the results correspond to the findings outlined by the authors 29 32 as the scope of the study entails more concentrations of zn ii at given intervals were subsequently added up to 15 mg l at this point 2 31 mg l of the metal were still present in the solution thus signifying 84 6 biosorption efficiency equivalent to 12 69 mg l this achievement could be associated with the emergence and interaction of the ionisable functional groups with zn ii 32 just like every other metal uptake when in contact with a biosorbent at the initial stage this study observed that the metal ion concentration in solution reduced rapidly as so many vacant surface sites for sorption were available this corresponds to the conclusion earlier made that an increase in the initial zn ii concentration results in a corresponding increase in the metal sorption capacity by rice husk 28 however at an increased zn ii concentration and sampling days the rate of metal ion uptake decreased this might be due to the attainment of equilibrium 31 or weakening and saturation of active sorption sites as the reactor ages 66 it could also be due to insufficient surface area to handle much more metal ions present in the solution 28 at different stages before adding zn ii concentration into the reactor the study ensured that the equilibrium condition attainment meaning no significant decrease from metal concentration it is evident from fig 5 that of all the three biosorbents evaluated effluent c had the least performance efficiency increase in unsaturated sorption sites leading to a lower quantity of sorption per unit mass has been identified as the root cause 27 these prevailing unsaturated sorption sites resulted from the difference in surface structural properties of the biosorbent mirha which is responsible for its surface area and sorption capacity 67 3 2 3 dhb after acclimatisation in the derived hybrid biosorbent comprising of gtps and mirha the reactor received different concentrations of zn ii at every dose application in the solution rapid sorption takes place the result indicated that removal efficiencies at different zn ii concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l the sorption rate fluctuates over the sampling period and later stabilises with less sorption despite the sorption rate fluctuations due to incremental zn ii dose the study observed weakening of the biosorbent due to increased sampling days the interactive impact of several metals in this reactor working simultaneously as different compositions arising from gtps and mirha in the mixture is more hazardous than in a static sorption process the sorption rate was still quite significant this proves that ions in the hybrid biosorbent responsible for the sorption are still active 68 3 3 mlss mlss is the total quantity of organic and inorganic solids in contaminated water 69 it would be observed from fig 6 that in the earlier sampling days the mlss values obtained for effluents c and d 5346 mg l and 5289 mg l were slower compared to a and b 5934 mg l and 5801 mg l as time goes by the trend changed and effluent a later had the least value for mlss as 5041 mg l fluctuations in the mlss values were experienced as sampling days increases and later stabilized within a given phase of zn ii metal concentrations this could be due to the presence of additional zn ii concentrations which in turn affects the concentration of biomass as the change always reflects immediately after the addition the mlss value suddenly increases or decreases and later stabilized within this range this coincides with the results earlier reported by zou 62 the decrease experienced in most reactors results from the limitation of biomass growth by carbon present in reactor feeds the decrease is per the observation in a study 70 where mlss increases as concentrations of carbon source feeds were decreased on the increase of mlss values some studies have reported that higher mlss has explicit advantages in rising volumetric loading or the solids retention time and membrane bio fouling rate while the particle size decreases as mlss concentrations are increasing 71 72 at optimised conditions for longer sampling durations and increased zn ii concentration all effluents had final mlss values higher than the mlss values obtained at initial sampling days except effluent a control having final mlss value as 4982 mg l 5934 mg l of the initial value the values are 6347 mg l 5801 mg l 6221 mg l 5346 mg l and 6653 mg l 5289 mg l for effluents b c and d respectively this increase in the mlss values obtained in the present study yielding effluents with lower viscosity bod cod suitable filterability and improved permeability is consistent with the previous studies 62 72 74 nevertheless increased concentrations of mlss exacerbate settlement due to rapid development and deposition of the sludge layer on the membrane at high concentrations of mlss thereby affecting suitable filterability concentrations 73 viscosity increases when mlss increased 75 several studies proved it as a mechanism offering a higher removal degree of suspended solids and turbidity at low mlss concentrations the mean flux value of the process became higher at low concentrations of mlss than at high concentrations 74 the rapid increase in mlss value negatively affects system operation as normalized permeability declines with increasing mlss concentrations 71 3 4 mlvss according to the mlvss growth for zn ii contaminated wastewater concerning gtps mirha dhb and sampling durations illustrated in fig 7 it can be observed that mlvss value of the control sample effluent a was higher than in effluents b c and d during the treatment period the reduction in mlvss values was due to the decrease in biomass concentration as a consequence of the sorbents reactivity and sudden toxicity increase 76 this contradicts the findings by hurley et al 77 where the addition of kenaf powder as bio sorbent increased biomass and mlvss concentration although mlvss concentrations did not show significant variations there was an increase in the concentration of all effluents from day 2 until day 50 this proves that environmental adaptation has taken place between the bacterial population and sorbents in the reactors 78 at day two mlvss values obtained for effluents a b c and d were 3400 mg l 2598 mg l 3089 mg l and 2765 mg l respectively variations observed in mlvss concentration were influenced by sorbent properties ph biomass concentration sludge volume after 30 min of settling temperature and svi respectively 79 as sampling days go by the values kept increasing until 4802 mg l 4586 mg l 4809 mg l and 4861 mg l were attained at day 50 for effluents a b c and d respectively the findings of this present study are in agreement with the deductions made in a study 80 that the increase in mlss concentration within reactors may be attributed to the aggregation of precipitated metals thus decreasing the mlvss mlss ratio as illustrated in fig 8 effect of heavy metal is more prevalent when mlvss concentration is 2000 mg l 34 it was also reported that the accumulation of these metals in reactors would affect system operation and economics 81 however mlvss concentration began to decline from day 52 up to the last sampling day with 3069 mg l 3659 mg l 3735 mg l and 4501 mg l this significant decline in mlvss reveals that the biomass in the reactor could not survive due to massive mlss 82 the decrease can be due to the lag phase experienced by sludge from all the reactors 76 78 possessing the highest value for mlvss 4501 mg l towards the end of the sampling duration proves that the dhb has achieved nearly 100 tss removal 83 thus the optimal condition for bacterial growth this coincides with a study as earlier reported 69 3 5 mlvss mlss ratio to analyse sludge behaviour determination of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ratio to mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mlss is required 84 fig 8 illustrates the variations of mlvss mlss ratio to sampling days in the four reactors during the treatment process results obtained for effluents a b c and d at day 2 were 0 58 0 62 0 58 and 0 52 respectively these rates are consistent with those found when palm oil wastewater was evaluated 83 these ratios kept increasing until day 14 when sudden decrease occur up to 0 59 0 50 0 47 and 0 40 for the effluents a b c and d this confirms the accumulation of more mineral substances in the reactors during wastewater treatment by activated sludge 51 the minimal ratios for effluents b c and d were 0 48 0 42 and 0 38 while the maximal ratios were 0 75 0 68 0 67 and 0 68 for effluents a b c and d the maximal ratios for effluents b c and d were similar despite variation in sorbents characteristics biomass generation and variable operating conditions 85 this proves the effectiveness of the sorbents for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions surprisingly the maximal ratio for effluent a control coincides with that often believed for municipal wastewater treatment plants 86 3 6 svi the profiles showing variations of svi s over the sampling days for the four effluents a b c and d illustrated in fig 9 exhibits a similar pattern although biosorbents gtps mirha and dhb differently added in three reactors before acclimatization svi effects observed during the treatment period at different dose of zn ii metal concentration were similar this indicates that the svi values for all effluents did not differ significantly due to the rapid increase in flocs formation and collision between them similarly there was no much difference in terms of flocs development this implies that activated sludge settleability was not sensitive 77 to gtps mirha and dhb used in this study at the beginning of the sampling the study recorded 58 ml g 54 ml g 55 ml g and 54 ml g as svi values for effluents a b c and d respectively on day 2 therefore sludge in all effluents evaluated can be classified as good quality sludge since svi 100 ml g 50 as the zn ii metal concentration gradually increases from 0 5 15 mg l the svi values rise this proves that adding zn ii metal concentration significantly affect settling ability of all the reactors 62 the values suddenly rose to 67 ml g 63 ml g 52 ml g and 64 ml g respectively at day 4 and dropped at day 14 47 ml g 32 ml g 30 ml g and 28 ml g respectively this drop continues for all effluents until approaching the end of sampling days at day 77 svi 26 ml g for a day 84 svi 16 ml g for b day 89 svi 23 ml g for c and day 80 svi 19 ml g for d this contradicts findings by 50 62 where svi values decreased the sudden increase of svi values decreases the settling velocity which eventually leads to poor settleability 87 it is an indication of floc diffusion and interference during settling it has earlier been reported that the degree of generated sludge compaction is highly affected by the rise of svi values 88 3 7 substrate removal rate the removal of zn ii by the continuous flow reactor was accomplished by the gradual accumulation and subsequent sorption of microbial processes 25 89 the significant removal from effluent a demonstrates that the addition of gtps material significantly improved microbial activities for zn ii metal removal 90 a study compared the efficiency of gtps in a bioreactor to that of a suspended bioreactor for zn ii sorption the findings showed that adding microorganisms with specific materials will further boost the build up of metals 91 for sorption by forming functional groups on any of their cell facets this could be attributed to the growth matrix structure 92 according to results for the steady rate of zn ii concentrations illustrated in figs 10 13 most of the biosorbents used including the control sample showed a linear relationship this proves that biological sorption process occurred this is similar to the findings earlier reported by 30 the results confirmed the prediction that the adsorbents enhance the aggregation of heavy metal in microorganisms the straight lines seen in the figures reflect the occurrence of zn ii removal from the evaluated samples the study revealed r2 values obtained from the effluents for control gtps mirha and dhb to be 0 9430 0 6857 0 9856 and 0 7936 it also generated and found r values to be 0 971081871 0 828070045 0 992773892 and 0 890842298 for effluents a b c and d respectively therefore zn ii sorption is favourable at all operation conditions studied this is in line with the study by elham 31 where r values were found to be within 0 085 0 993 representing the suitability of the biosorbents under set experimental conditions implemented in the study the r values for effluents a and c are very close to 1 or 1 this proves that there is a strong linear relationship between ds dt and se for the said effluents 3 8 statistical analysis the study utilised a one way factor analysis of variance to verify the effect of different biosorbents at various sampling days 85 for the normally distributed dataset the study statistically compared variables with t test by spss version 18 93 the results expressed as mean standard deviation while statistical differences observed for all reactors at reference points 1 8 of the study possess 95 confidence level p 0 05 as reflected in table 3 thus the test results considered statistically significant 4 conclusion the potential sources of zn ii contamination in water bodies are the diverse use of zinc oxide by industries before discharge wastewater contaminated by zn ii must undergo appropriate treatment due to its hazardous nature associated health risks and environmental impact as the use of chemical products in sorption processes is receiving considerable attention in recent times environmental regulations regarding wastewater have become too strict this research article focused on the evaluation of gtps mirha and dhb for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions by a continuous flow activated sludge system this is to explore the sustainable use of these agro industrial waste derived materials as potential bio sorbents for zn ii contaminated synthetic solutions findings revealed that effluent concentrations obtained were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for reactors a b c and d respectively the dhb result indicated that removal efficiencies at different zn ii concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l at optimised conditions for longer sampling durations and increased zn ii concentration all effluents had final mlss values higher than the mlss values obtained at initial sampling days except effluent a control having final mlss value as 4982 mg l 5934 mg l of the initial value mlvss concentration for effluents b c and d reduced because of the decrease in biomass concentration the maximal mlvss mlss ratios for effluents b c and d were similar the study classified sludge in all effluents evaluated as good quality sludge since svi 100 ml g statistical differences observed for all reactors possess 95 confidence level p 0 05 thus the test results considered statistically significant r2 values obtained from effluents ranged between 0 69 0 005 to 0 99 0 005 the r values for effluents a and c are very close to 1 or 1 this proves that there is a strong linear relationship between ds dt and se for the said effluents this study thus concludes that gtps mirha and dhb can be good sorption mediums for zn ii metal in synthetic aqueous solutions acknowledgement the study enjoyed the support of universiti

14089,zinc ion is a toxic metal mostly contained in industrial effluents to minimize its contamination levels due to the detrimental effect on both human health environment and the eco system developing novel materials is essential for the removal of zinc ions this study focused on the development and utilization of groundwater treatment plant sludge microwave incinerated rice husk ash and derived hybrid biosorbent for the removal of zinc ions from aqueous solution standard methods were adopted for the preparation and characterization of the biosorbents and zinc aqueous solution the biosorption experiments performed in batch systems at room temperature factors that may affect the zinc removal efficiency such as ph reaction time initial concentration counter ions regeneration studies and substrate removal rate were investigated results indicated that the developed biosorbents removed zinc concentration between 84 99 removal efficiencies for derived hybrid biosorbent at different zinc concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l the effluent concentrations were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for groundwater treatment plant sludge microwave incinerated rice husk ash and derived hybrid biosorbent respectively the biosorbents exhibited high affinity to zinc ion in the presence of competing ions biosorbents were regenerated into their initial functionality by hcl acid without significant capacity loss therefore the biosorbents can be viable alternatives for efficient zinc

sulphate 1 introduction portable water is a necessity for safeguarding the environmental ecosystem and human health recent trends in development within the industrial sector have greatly increased portable water demand for human activities however these industrial developments have led to the accumulation of diverse contaminants from industrial waste discharges thus causing water pollution through heavy metal ions 1 2 the neglect of wastewater disposal facilities and environmental regulations in developing countries is another environmental problem by heavy metals 3 water contamination from heavy metals has gained significant attention due to its negative environmental effects and the prevailing health concerns 4 in recent times heavy metal contamination has become an increasingly serious global environmental problem that causes various diseases and disorders 5 heavy metals affect the environment including human animal and plant health as they are harmful carcinogenic non biodegradable and easily stored in living organisms 6 unlike microbial pollutants heavy metals do not degrade they can contaminate the soil and aquatic ecosystems 7 they are lethal contaminants to the environment because they highly affect water quality and pose a significant risk to the ecosystem and human health 8 the presence of these toxic metal ions in water bodies is originated either by natural or anthropogenic origins industrial waste discharges have remained the major source of heavy metals 3 thus compliance with permissible limits before discharging effluents into the environment becomes necessary heavy metals such as copper mercury zinc cobalt lead chromium and cadmium have been causing severe environmental problems 1 zn ii is an essential element for a healthy life however concentration in humans below the limits of sensitivity can cause disorders to the immune system prostate problems diabetes and macular degeneration it is one of the common surface and groundwater contaminants mostly originating from solid and liquid wastes containing high concentration of zinc 9 the removal of this harmful metal from aqueous streams is an important issue posed by the discharge of industrial effluents as excess intake can lead to acute nausea accompanied gastrointestinal disorders some of the major human induced sources of zn ii in waterways are batteries pigments zinc alloys paints canisters anti corrosion coating rubber and chemical industries 4 10 depression lethargy respiratory weakness homeostasis loss of appetite vomiting nausea neurological symptoms and increased thirst are the ill effects of zn ii accumulation by human 11 12 the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa has set the maximum permissible limit for zn ii in drinking water to be 5 mg l while department of environment doe malaysia set 3 mg l as the maximum permissible limit of zn ii ions in drinking water therefore reliable novel materials and techniques are welcome for the detection and removal of trace zn ii ions from aqueous solutions to enhance the cleaner environment reduce negative impacts of the contaminant and avert the occurrence of global warming and climate change researchers have invested in developing reliable efficient cost effective and suitable technologies for heavy metals detection and extraction from aqueous solutions 6 the determination of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution requires several instrumental techniques such as total reflection xrf s icp aes and icp ms 1 13 14 others are neutron activation analysis cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry capillary electrophoresis flow injection chemiluminescence enzyme analysis method optical nano sensors graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry faas ultraviolet visible spectrometry aas spr dispersive liquid liquid microextraction hplc electrode position ion exchange voltammetry on line pre concentration and polarography 15 18 these methods have various advantages such as low detection limits multi elements determination at one time and sensitivity however their disadvantages outweigh the advantages they require large infrastructure trained technicians narrow working concentration range long response time expensive techniques sophisticated and costly instrumentation they consume time and produces matrix interferences they have poor reproducibility low repeatability and ion selectivity they are time consuming unsuitable for field analysis and complex in sample preparation 1 3 13 15 17 18 the detection and removal of zn ii ions are necessary due to its toxic nature 18 therefore developing novel simple accurate systematic versatile specific reliable speedy fruitful and applicable techniques for sensitive and selective detection of zn ii ions in aqueous solutions has great importance in protection of water quality environmental eco system and human health physical biological and chemical technologies have been widely used for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions these include cation surfactant reverse osmosis membrane filtration chemical precipitation solvent extraction coagulation filtration electrolysis electrochemical techniques biological technology flotation ion exchange advanced oxidation biosorption sedimentation distillation electrodialysis ultrafiltration immobilization volatilization etc 1 4 6 8 12 13 15 22 23 unfortunately these technologies have shortcomings ranging from lower efficiencies high initial operational and maintenance cost crud formation lower selectivity and mass transfer rate 13 high toxicity operating complexity 16 large amount of organic solvents harmful to health 18 high energy requirements generation of voluminous sludge low trace metals removal rate 2 3 to negative environmental effects 7 of all the methods highlighted biosorption is the most appropriate for heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions because of their availability cost effectiveness ease of processing and high rate of natural affinity to metal ions 6 7 24 biosorption is being widely used due to its operational flexibility extreme efficiency reversibility reusability ease of use fast response selective removal efficient regeneration and reduced toxic sludge generation 1 3 15 according to 22 biosorption is the best because of the automated analytical techniques involved absence of emulsion great enrichment ratio and safety therefore it becomes necessary to develop efficient and sustainable biosorbents for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions these biosorbents should not only be cost effective but should also possess large biosorption capacity high surface area good reusability absence of internal diffusion resistance and be non toxic to the environment adsorbents commonly used for heavy metal removal includes zeolites prussian blue crystalline silicotitanate alumina ferrocyanides and hydrous oxides of multivalent cations pillared clays resorcinol formaldehyde resin 21 carbon nanotubes and nanostructure titanium alumina 2 waste metal sludge bentonite and fe iii hydroxide waste 16 organic chelate resin silica and silica gel titania and molecular imprinted polymers 22 however they are been characterised by low adsorption capacity separation inconvenience 2 non recyclability high preparation cost toxic sludge generation chemical precipitation low yield and very high processing temperatures required for their activation 15 recently environmentalist s focus has been attracted to the use of bio sorbents such as algal biomass ulva sp nipa palm nut rice husk bamboo bone char eggshell palmyra palm nut java plum seed peat water chestnut shell oil palm bagasse corncob tea waste wastewater sludge and pomegranate peel neem leaf etc 12 15 19 25 26 several researchers have explored the use of nano sized solid based biosorbents such as nanoparticles and nanotubes for metal ions removal from water 17 compared with these micro sized particles gtps and mirha offer significantly higher surface area to volume ratio that promises much greater biosorption capacity simple operations 2 chemical functionality with high stability high adsorption rate extreme selectivity at optimum conditions and rapid responses towards trace metals removal they exhibit high number of unsaturated atoms on their surfaces take part in chemical bonding in the case of high biosorption and trace level sensitivity these properties make them more attractive than conventional ion exchange materials 21 they are always superior in selective adsorption of toxic metal ions 3 the use of rice husk as a sustainable biosorbent for metal removal has risen 27 this is due to the properties of rice husk described by 20 28 a study on the use of activated rice husk arh and carbonized rice husk crh as biosorbents in a batch experiment for metal removal revealed that of all the metals evaluated zn ii yielded the best removal with the net uptake of 56 7 and 77 2 respectively 29 at a biosorbent dose of 0 7 g 50 ml and ph 6 using rice husk derived activated carbon 72 34 zn ii removal was attained 30 the effects of rice husk and its quantity contact time ph were studied on zn ii adsorption from an industrial wastewater where the full biosorption potential was found at 19 617 mg g amounting to 70 removal efficiency 31 similarly at an adsorbent dose of 1 g l the temperature of 25 c ph of 4 and at 1 5 h the maximum biosorption capacity of zn ii onto untreated rice husk and naoh treated rice husk achieved were 12 41 mg g and 20 08 mg g respectively 32 to date researchers continue to develop and examine various biosorbents for zn ii removal despite the good performance of most biosorbents it is still a big challenge for the researchers to achieve the best removal sustainably recently hybrid composite materials have received much attention for specific zn ii removal due to their complexation ability and coordination mechanism 22 they are flexible and accommodates most ions within the inner coordination sphere the technique exhibits both thermal and chemical stability due to strong covalent bonding 21 therefore the fabrication of novel solid state materials is welcome for ultra trace zn ii removal from aqueous solutions 1 highly ordered large pore dimensional materials are indigence in the new fabrication of novel composite biosorbent to control the shape and selectivity of molecular recognition which generates the signal transduction as a response to the binding event 18 hence this study focused on evaluating gtps mirha and dhb as biosorbents for zn ii removal from an aqueous solution this is due to their numerous benefits with no detrimental effect on the environment thus the study objectives were to synthesize the aqueous solution determine the solution characteristics collect and prepare biosorbents from organic waste synthesize and characterize the biosorbents fabricate the reactors acclimatize the solution in the reactor evaluate the biosorbents performance determine substrate removal rate and investigate the effects of reaction time and biosorbents dose 2 materials and method 2 1 materials all materials and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased without further purification 33 the standard zn ii ions solution 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving zinc nitrate in distilled water the working solutions obtained by diluting the stock solution with distilled water the solutions of 0 1 mol l 1 of common inorganic salts nacl nano3 cacl2 and ca no3 2 were prepared by dissolving the specific salts in distilled water the initial solution ph was adjusted to the neutral value using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 or naoh solution before adding the biosorbent 26 2 2 synthetic wastewater preparation dissolved in distilled water purina alpo puppy dog meal produced synthetic wastewater to imitate domestic wastewater with moderate intensity as the baseline wastewater for all reactors the dog food was ground for about 5 min 0 6 g prepared and incorporated into the influent tank for ph stability a specific volume 0 15 ml of phosphate buffer added to the wastewater sample wastewater sample is prepared daily to provide fresh carbonaceous matter to the biomass 34 the use of synthetic wastewater was important to provide coherent organic loading for a stronger evaluation of the reactors 35 the wastewater possesses the c n p ratio of about 100 24 3 meeting the required minimum for a typical medium strength wastewater characteristic 36 table 2 highlights the characteristics of synthetic wastewater in comparison to typical medium strength wastewater specific levels of zn ii measured by adding sufficient amounts of zinc chloride in the wastewater 2 3 preparation of biosorbents rice husk as an abundant agro based waste material 37 in malaysia was obtained from local farmers in perak malaysia to increase the sio2 content and decrease sintering effect usually indicated by a dramatic reduction in the specific surface area heat treating of the rice husk at 800 c and heating rate of 10 c min for 2 h in a microwave furnace became necessary 30 38 the sample was pre cleaned by chemical treatment technique using hcl and naoh solutions it was subsequently washed thoroughly and cleaned with deionized water dried for 2 h at 105 c in an oven 39 40 after cooling at ambient temperature samples were stored in a tight container before the commencement of the experiment and the produced mirha used in this study test results obtained from xrf analysis of mirha showed that important components such as sio2 capable of influencing the biosorption process were present see fig 1 the study used gtps in muddy structure generated from the utp sewage treatment plant for the experiments sample dried according to 41 standard methods as shown in fig 2 converted to powder form by grinding and sieving 11 40 and afterwards stored in a closed container derived hybrid biosorbent dhb gtps mirha consists of an equal mixture of gtps and mirha 2 4 reactor properties fabrication and operation the study adopts the use of thermoplastic material to concoct four 4 identical biological reactors shown in fig 3 for the experimental purpose reactor a was for the control purpose while reactors b c and d contained biomass along with gtps mirha and dhb respectively each reactor possesses the following properties overall dimension 375 mm l x170 mm w x25 mm h aeration compartment 300 mm l x160 mm w x180 mm h freeboard 40 mm and aeration tank capacity 7 5 l two units each of effluent containers ten litre gallons sample containers thermoplastic materials one unit each of masterflex digital peristaltic pumps four meter masterflex tube size 16 an influent tank mixer and forty eight units of tube diffusers were purchased and used during the experiment the purpose of installing horizontal air tube diffusers at the reactor base was to provide oxygen in an up flow pattern thus enabling sufficient aeration to the biomass 42 influent and effluent points positioned at the bottom and top respectively were in opposite directions the study used baffles to prevent washout of biomass into the effluent unit 43 the reactors designed operating parameters were influent flow rate 7 5 m3 d mixed liquor temperature 20 c minimum dissolved oxygen 2 0 mg l sludge age 40 days bcod bod ratio 1 6 f m ratio 0 085 solid retention time 30 days mixed liquor suspended solids 3500 mg l and bod volumetric loading 0 2 kgbod m3d the choice of thirty days as the solid retention time was to encourage the growth of slow growing bacteria in the reactors 34 the continuous flow reactors started operation in the environmental research laboratory erl of utp using seed sludge acquired from the universities sewage treatment plant and medium synthetic wastewater at fixed hrt of 19 2 h each reactor contained seven litres of the synthetic wastewater prepared daily for 125 days 500 mg l stock solution of zn ii is prepared daily with znso4 and diluted to obtain solutions of required concentrations utilized reagents in the study are of analytical grade the experiments were conducted at eight different reference points tagged rp 1 8 rp 1 the primary acclimatization period for biomass stabilization 44 a maximum of 15 days was sufficient for this rp 2 the secondary acclimatization period at which 2000 mg l each of the biosorbents gtps mirha and dhb were added to reactors b c and d respectively as illustrated in table 1 it took ten 10 days for the adsorbents to acclimatize rp 3 to 8 these reference points used different doses of zn ii concentration varying from 0 5 15 0 mg l as influents lastly effluent samples collected daily and all reactors evaluated for the entire sampling duration cleaning of the tank immediately followed to prepare for the next effluent collection 2 5 analysis and analytical methods the surface area of gtps mirha and dhb were measured with a quantachrome version 2 01 autosorb 1 surface area analyser the samples degassed at 300 c and adsorption desorption process with liquid nitrogen at 195 55 c brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bhj techniques were used to determine the surface area pore volume and pore radius of the gtps mirha and dhb samples 45 47 the surface morphology was determined using scanning electron microscopy the samples were platinum coated by a vacuum electrical sputter coater for 3 min before measurements were taken 48 the zn ii ion determination was analyzed using icp aes 49 the matrices effect was not judged as the icp aes has no such effects sample solutions having complicated matrices were not used and no significant interference of matrices observed 46 the initial synthetic wastewater characteristics were analysed according to the standard methods for wastewater effluent discharges 34 41 all parameters related to the efficiency of the reactor mentioned in table 2 including mlss mlvss and sludge volume index svi were measured by methods described in related studies 28 50 51 zn ii concentration sorption capacity was investigated 11 measured and calculated according to 9 all other analyses performed in triplicate 52 except for the microbial population and the findings expressed as mean standard deviation 51 2 6 zn ii detection sorption and elution studies during the detection process 2000 mg l of the biosorbents were added in a mixture of 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l zn ii in three different reactors with the specific volume of 7 5 l the control reactor was also arranged according to the biosorbents they were grounded properly to get smooth in the absorbance spectra by the reactors the limit detection ld of zn ii is determined based on eq 1 below 1 l d k s b m where k is equal to the value of 3 sb is the standard discrepancy and m the slope of the linear plot respectively biosorbents substrate removal rate is a function of zn ii concentration fed into the reactors thus the rate of substrate used expressed by stover kincannon model in eq 2 below 2 d s d t q v s i s e 3 r e c o c f c o x 100 the rate of change for substrate removal is given by ds dt is kg m3 d 53 54 q as the influent flow rate m3 d and the reactor capacity as v m3 55 while si se are the initial and the final concentrations of zn ii a graph of q v s i s e against se as obtained in figs 10 13 illustrates the actual substrate removal rates for all effluents thus eq 3 was used to calculate the removal efficiencies for zn ii ions where re is the metal removal efficiency co cf as the initial and residual metal mg l concentrations at equilibrium 26 to investigate the most efficient eluting agent the biosorbents were equilibrated with fixed zn ii checked for several eluents such as naoh h2so4 and hcl the filtrate was finally relocated to the test tubes 33 the adsorbed zn ii ions onto biosorbent were washed with deionized water several times and transferred into 50 ml beaker to this 5 ml of the eluting agent was added and the mixture stirred for 20 min the concentration of zn ii ions released from the biosorbent into the aqueous solution was analyzed by the icp aes 48 56 according to the experimental protocol the 0 20 m hcl solution was used as an appropriate eluent 57 the biosorbents were reused for several cycles to investigate the reusability 58 2 7 sludge volume index several researchers used different approaches for sludge settleability measurement in wastewater treatment nevertheless the sludge volume index svi is the most prominent method used in recent times 59 svi is the volume occupied by 1 g of sludge after the first 30 min of sedimentation 50 it is presently the most recognised standard unit of measurement used for activated sludge solids characterisation 60 svi index grouped activated sludge into three classes as sludge that is of good quality svi 100 ml g intermediate quality 100 svi 150 ml g weak quality svi 150 ml g eq 4 is used to compute the amount of svi 61 4 s v i m l g s s v m l l s s m g l x 1000 where ss and ssv are the suspended solids and sediment sludge volume respectively 62 this explains that svi is a function of settling speed throughout the settling column where the activated sludge varies from settling height h to time t 59 in this study sludge suspensions were sampled daily from the reactors and svi obtained by settling sludge suspensions in a cylinder of 1000 ml capacity the settled sludge solids volume recorded after 30 min 63 the study adopts standard methods 2710 d40 41 42 for svi determination 3 results and discussion 3 1 influent concentrations of zn ii aqueous solutions containing zn ii with dosage ranging from 0 5 15 0 mg l added to each reactor were prepared to contaminate the water samples four reactors were prepared to contain different materials as biosorbents just like most reactors acclimatization took place all this happened within 130 days fig 4 below shows influent zn ii concentrations and the corresponding sampling days 3 2 effluent concentrations of zn ii fig 5 illustrates the effluent concentrations from the four reactors the performance evaluation of biosorbents tagged effluents a b c and d are reflected most of which at certain points exceeded the malaysian standard a effluent discharge concentration of zn ii from the biosorption studies using zn ii metal synthetic solutions effluent concentrations obtained were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for biosorbents a b c and d respectively least biosorption experienced from effluent a because it is the control containing only biomass serving as a biosorbent 3 2 1 gtps effluent b that used gtps as a biosorbent experienced the highest reduction this is in line with a study by authors 12 where 19 2 mg g was obtained as the maximum quantity of zn ii removed the author further reported that the performance efficiency depended heavily on the initial concentration of metal a standard phenomenon in most experimental studies ghorpade 64 believed that aluminium and iron contents present in gtps play a significant role in enhancing biosorption capacity 3 2 2 mirha at the end of the acclimatisation period for rice husk the solutions tagged effluents received an additional 0 5 mg l of zn ii after some sampling days careful observation revealed that only 0 01 mg l of zn ii was present in the aqueous solution i e 98 of the metal was significantly absorbed the developed sorption process reveals that there is a strong relationship between sorbates sorbents active sites and the environmentally friendly use of the rice husk 65 this is not unconnected to the presence of abundant mesopores and micropores with several nanometres in size of rice husk 27 thus the results correspond to the findings outlined by the authors 29 32 as the scope of the study entails more concentrations of zn ii at given intervals were subsequently added up to 15 mg l at this point 2 31 mg l of the metal were still present in the solution thus signifying 84 6 biosorption efficiency equivalent to 12 69 mg l this achievement could be associated with the emergence and interaction of the ionisable functional groups with zn ii 32 just like every other metal uptake when in contact with a biosorbent at the initial stage this study observed that the metal ion concentration in solution reduced rapidly as so many vacant surface sites for sorption were available this corresponds to the conclusion earlier made that an increase in the initial zn ii concentration results in a corresponding increase in the metal sorption capacity by rice husk 28 however at an increased zn ii concentration and sampling days the rate of metal ion uptake decreased this might be due to the attainment of equilibrium 31 or weakening and saturation of active sorption sites as the reactor ages 66 it could also be due to insufficient surface area to handle much more metal ions present in the solution 28 at different stages before adding zn ii concentration into the reactor the study ensured that the equilibrium condition attainment meaning no significant decrease from metal concentration it is evident from fig 5 that of all the three biosorbents evaluated effluent c had the least performance efficiency increase in unsaturated sorption sites leading to a lower quantity of sorption per unit mass has been identified as the root cause 27 these prevailing unsaturated sorption sites resulted from the difference in surface structural properties of the biosorbent mirha which is responsible for its surface area and sorption capacity 67 3 2 3 dhb after acclimatisation in the derived hybrid biosorbent comprising of gtps and mirha the reactor received different concentrations of zn ii at every dose application in the solution rapid sorption takes place the result indicated that removal efficiencies at different zn ii concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l the sorption rate fluctuates over the sampling period and later stabilises with less sorption despite the sorption rate fluctuations due to incremental zn ii dose the study observed weakening of the biosorbent due to increased sampling days the interactive impact of several metals in this reactor working simultaneously as different compositions arising from gtps and mirha in the mixture is more hazardous than in a static sorption process the sorption rate was still quite significant this proves that ions in the hybrid biosorbent responsible for the sorption are still active 68 3 3 mlss mlss is the total quantity of organic and inorganic solids in contaminated water 69 it would be observed from fig 6 that in the earlier sampling days the mlss values obtained for effluents c and d 5346 mg l and 5289 mg l were slower compared to a and b 5934 mg l and 5801 mg l as time goes by the trend changed and effluent a later had the least value for mlss as 5041 mg l fluctuations in the mlss values were experienced as sampling days increases and later stabilized within a given phase of zn ii metal concentrations this could be due to the presence of additional zn ii concentrations which in turn affects the concentration of biomass as the change always reflects immediately after the addition the mlss value suddenly increases or decreases and later stabilized within this range this coincides with the results earlier reported by zou 62 the decrease experienced in most reactors results from the limitation of biomass growth by carbon present in reactor feeds the decrease is per the observation in a study 70 where mlss increases as concentrations of carbon source feeds were decreased on the increase of mlss values some studies have reported that higher mlss has explicit advantages in rising volumetric loading or the solids retention time and membrane bio fouling rate while the particle size decreases as mlss concentrations are increasing 71 72 at optimised conditions for longer sampling durations and increased zn ii concentration all effluents had final mlss values higher than the mlss values obtained at initial sampling days except effluent a control having final mlss value as 4982 mg l 5934 mg l of the initial value the values are 6347 mg l 5801 mg l 6221 mg l 5346 mg l and 6653 mg l 5289 mg l for effluents b c and d respectively this increase in the mlss values obtained in the present study yielding effluents with lower viscosity bod cod suitable filterability and improved permeability is consistent with the previous studies 62 72 74 nevertheless increased concentrations of mlss exacerbate settlement due to rapid development and deposition of the sludge layer on the membrane at high concentrations of mlss thereby affecting suitable filterability concentrations 73 viscosity increases when mlss increased 75 several studies proved it as a mechanism offering a higher removal degree of suspended solids and turbidity at low mlss concentrations the mean flux value of the process became higher at low concentrations of mlss than at high concentrations 74 the rapid increase in mlss value negatively affects system operation as normalized permeability declines with increasing mlss concentrations 71 3 4 mlvss according to the mlvss growth for zn ii contaminated wastewater concerning gtps mirha dhb and sampling durations illustrated in fig 7 it can be observed that mlvss value of the control sample effluent a was higher than in effluents b c and d during the treatment period the reduction in mlvss values was due to the decrease in biomass concentration as a consequence of the sorbents reactivity and sudden toxicity increase 76 this contradicts the findings by hurley et al 77 where the addition of kenaf powder as bio sorbent increased biomass and mlvss concentration although mlvss concentrations did not show significant variations there was an increase in the concentration of all effluents from day 2 until day 50 this proves that environmental adaptation has taken place between the bacterial population and sorbents in the reactors 78 at day two mlvss values obtained for effluents a b c and d were 3400 mg l 2598 mg l 3089 mg l and 2765 mg l respectively variations observed in mlvss concentration were influenced by sorbent properties ph biomass concentration sludge volume after 30 min of settling temperature and svi respectively 79 as sampling days go by the values kept increasing until 4802 mg l 4586 mg l 4809 mg l and 4861 mg l were attained at day 50 for effluents a b c and d respectively the findings of this present study are in agreement with the deductions made in a study 80 that the increase in mlss concentration within reactors may be attributed to the aggregation of precipitated metals thus decreasing the mlvss mlss ratio as illustrated in fig 8 effect of heavy metal is more prevalent when mlvss concentration is 2000 mg l 34 it was also reported that the accumulation of these metals in reactors would affect system operation and economics 81 however mlvss concentration began to decline from day 52 up to the last sampling day with 3069 mg l 3659 mg l 3735 mg l and 4501 mg l this significant decline in mlvss reveals that the biomass in the reactor could not survive due to massive mlss 82 the decrease can be due to the lag phase experienced by sludge from all the reactors 76 78 possessing the highest value for mlvss 4501 mg l towards the end of the sampling duration proves that the dhb has achieved nearly 100 tss removal 83 thus the optimal condition for bacterial growth this coincides with a study as earlier reported 69 3 5 mlvss mlss ratio to analyse sludge behaviour determination of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ratio to mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mlss is required 84 fig 8 illustrates the variations of mlvss mlss ratio to sampling days in the four reactors during the treatment process results obtained for effluents a b c and d at day 2 were 0 58 0 62 0 58 and 0 52 respectively these rates are consistent with those found when palm oil wastewater was evaluated 83 these ratios kept increasing until day 14 when sudden decrease occur up to 0 59 0 50 0 47 and 0 40 for the effluents a b c and d this confirms the accumulation of more mineral substances in the reactors during wastewater treatment by activated sludge 51 the minimal ratios for effluents b c and d were 0 48 0 42 and 0 38 while the maximal ratios were 0 75 0 68 0 67 and 0 68 for effluents a b c and d the maximal ratios for effluents b c and d were similar despite variation in sorbents characteristics biomass generation and variable operating conditions 85 this proves the effectiveness of the sorbents for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions surprisingly the maximal ratio for effluent a control coincides with that often believed for municipal wastewater treatment plants 86 3 6 svi the profiles showing variations of svi s over the sampling days for the four effluents a b c and d illustrated in fig 9 exhibits a similar pattern although biosorbents gtps mirha and dhb differently added in three reactors before acclimatization svi effects observed during the treatment period at different dose of zn ii metal concentration were similar this indicates that the svi values for all effluents did not differ significantly due to the rapid increase in flocs formation and collision between them similarly there was no much difference in terms of flocs development this implies that activated sludge settleability was not sensitive 77 to gtps mirha and dhb used in this study at the beginning of the sampling the study recorded 58 ml g 54 ml g 55 ml g and 54 ml g as svi values for effluents a b c and d respectively on day 2 therefore sludge in all effluents evaluated can be classified as good quality sludge since svi 100 ml g 50 as the zn ii metal concentration gradually increases from 0 5 15 mg l the svi values rise this proves that adding zn ii metal concentration significantly affect settling ability of all the reactors 62 the values suddenly rose to 67 ml g 63 ml g 52 ml g and 64 ml g respectively at day 4 and dropped at day 14 47 ml g 32 ml g 30 ml g and 28 ml g respectively this drop continues for all effluents until approaching the end of sampling days at day 77 svi 26 ml g for a day 84 svi 16 ml g for b day 89 svi 23 ml g for c and day 80 svi 19 ml g for d this contradicts findings by 50 62 where svi values decreased the sudden increase of svi values decreases the settling velocity which eventually leads to poor settleability 87 it is an indication of floc diffusion and interference during settling it has earlier been reported that the degree of generated sludge compaction is highly affected by the rise of svi values 88 3 7 substrate removal rate the removal of zn ii by the continuous flow reactor was accomplished by the gradual accumulation and subsequent sorption of microbial processes 25 89 the significant removal from effluent a demonstrates that the addition of gtps material significantly improved microbial activities for zn ii metal removal 90 a study compared the efficiency of gtps in a bioreactor to that of a suspended bioreactor for zn ii sorption the findings showed that adding microorganisms with specific materials will further boost the build up of metals 91 for sorption by forming functional groups on any of their cell facets this could be attributed to the growth matrix structure 92 according to results for the steady rate of zn ii concentrations illustrated in figs 10 13 most of the biosorbents used including the control sample showed a linear relationship this proves that biological sorption process occurred this is similar to the findings earlier reported by 30 the results confirmed the prediction that the adsorbents enhance the aggregation of heavy metal in microorganisms the straight lines seen in the figures reflect the occurrence of zn ii removal from the evaluated samples the study revealed r2 values obtained from the effluents for control gtps mirha and dhb to be 0 9430 0 6857 0 9856 and 0 7936 it also generated and found r values to be 0 971081871 0 828070045 0 992773892 and 0 890842298 for effluents a b c and d respectively therefore zn ii sorption is favourable at all operation conditions studied this is in line with the study by elham 31 where r values were found to be within 0 085 0 993 representing the suitability of the biosorbents under set experimental conditions implemented in the study the r values for effluents a and c are very close to 1 or 1 this proves that there is a strong linear relationship between ds dt and se for the said effluents 3 8 statistical analysis the study utilised a one way factor analysis of variance to verify the effect of different biosorbents at various sampling days 85 for the normally distributed dataset the study statistically compared variables with t test by spss version 18 93 the results expressed as mean standard deviation while statistical differences observed for all reactors at reference points 1 8 of the study possess 95 confidence level p 0 05 as reflected in table 3 thus the test results considered statistically significant 4 conclusion the potential sources of zn ii contamination in water bodies are the diverse use of zinc oxide by industries before discharge wastewater contaminated by zn ii must undergo appropriate treatment due to its hazardous nature associated health risks and environmental impact as the use of chemical products in sorption processes is receiving considerable attention in recent times environmental regulations regarding wastewater have become too strict this research article focused on the evaluation of gtps mirha and dhb for zn ii removal from aqueous solutions by a continuous flow activated sludge system this is to explore the sustainable use of these agro industrial waste derived materials as potential bio sorbents for zn ii contaminated synthetic solutions findings revealed that effluent concentrations obtained were between 0 01 3 52 mg l 0 01 1 27 mg l 0 01 2 31 mg l and 0 01 2 01 mg l for reactors a b c and d respectively the dhb result indicated that removal efficiencies at different zn ii concentrations were in the order 0 5 m l 1 0 mg l 5 0 mg l 2 0 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l at optimised conditions for longer sampling durations and increased zn ii concentration all effluents had final mlss values higher than the mlss values obtained at initial sampling days except effluent a control having final mlss value as 4982 mg l 5934 mg l of the initial value mlvss concentration for effluents b c and d reduced because of the decrease in biomass concentration the maximal mlvss mlss ratios for effluents b c and d were similar the study classified sludge in all effluents evaluated as good quality sludge since svi 100 ml g statistical differences observed for all reactors possess 95 confidence level p 0 05 thus the test results considered statistically significant r2 values obtained from effluents ranged between 0 69 0 005 to 0 99 0 005 the r values for effluents a and c are very close to 1 or 1 this proves that there is a strong linear relationship between ds dt and se for the said effluents this study thus concludes that gtps mirha and dhb can be good sorption mediums for zn ii metal in synthetic aqueous solutions acknowledgement the study enjoyed the support of universiti
