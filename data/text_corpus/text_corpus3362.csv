16810,hydrocarbon and salt contamination of surface and groundwater resources often co occur from oil production activities however salt is often considered as a potential inhibitor of microbial activity the feasibility of microbiome based biotechnologies to treat the hydrocarbon contamination is contingent on the ability of the indigenous community to adapt to saline conditions here we demonstrate enhanced hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil slurries under saline conditions of up to 1 m 5 compared to non saline systems and the underlying causes the mineralization extent of hexadecane was enhanced by salinity in the absence of nutrients salinity similar to nutrients enhanced the mineralization but through ecological selection microbial community analysis indicated a significant enrichment of actinobacteria phylum and an increase in the absolute abundance of the hydrocarbon degrading dietzia genus but a decrease in the total population size with salinity moreover the in situ expression of alkane hydroxylases genes of dietzia was generally increased with salinity the data demonstrate that indigenous halotolerant hydrocarbon degraders were enriched and their hydrocarbon degradation genes upregulated under saline conditions these findings have positive implications for engineered biotreatment approaches for hydrocarbons in saline environments such as those affected with produced waters and oil sands tailing ponds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oil spill groundwater produced water microbial community mineralization dietzia halotolerant 1 introduction the release of produced waters in oil and gas production sites often lead to groundwater co contaimantion with salt and hydrocarbons salinities in the range of 0 2 4 m 1 20 have been reported in pore waters of shale formations waldron et al 2007 oil sands hum et al 2006 shale oil fields an et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 strong et al 2014 and in flowback waters from shale gas fields daly et al 2016 despite efforts for water recycling a large portion of process affected waters end up in tailing ponds and evaporation pits reuse of process affected waters without treatment leads to adverse environmental effects for example untreated diluted saline produced water used for irrigation resulted in decreased crop yield and reduced soil health and microbial diversity miller et al 2020 efficient and sustainable management of significant volumes of process affected waters and clay rich fine tailings co contaminated with high salt and hydrocarbon is challenging foght et al 2017 heyob et al 2017 but is necessary to prevent further surface and groundwater contamination moreover the natural migration of formation brines to shallow aquifers warner et al 2012 saline oil and gas wastewater spills shrestha et al 2017 and leaking oil wells also lead to surface and groundwater contamination by salts and hydrocarbons biotechnology that uses hydrocarbon degrading microbial populations has the potential to provide sustainable treatment solutions if their metabolic activity under high salinity conditions can be maintained salinity can alter biodegradation rates of hydrocarbons and organic matter and influence the biogeochemical cycles of carbon in natural or engineered systems it is well known that salt can adversely affect microbial life for example by disrupting the cell membrane or denaturation of enzymes polonenko et al 1981 lozupone and knight demonstrated that salinity is generally the most significant factor in shaping microbial communities as compared to other ecologically determinant environmental factors such as temperature or ph lozupone and knight 2007 microbial adaptation to salt stress is regulated by the amount of energy required and the mode of osmotic adaptation oren 2011 halophilic and halotolerant bacteria may maintain their osmotic equilibrium by accumulating high concentrations of compatible organic solutes such as glycine betaine to adapt to a wide range of salinities fathepure 2014 hu et al 2020 oren 2011 various pathways of encoding glycine betaine were identified in the microbial genome from fracking effluents glycine betaine itself was also detected in those samples daly et al 2016 low levels of salt maintained in the cytoplasm in the presence of compatible solutes enable halophilic and halotolerant bacteria to still perform some metabolic processes at least under moderate salinities 0 1 2 m 0 5 11 however there is limited literature to assess if hydrocarbon degraders in indigenous communities of contaminated saline environments can thrive and maintain their metabolic activity through adaptations using observations of metabolic behaviour or predictions from genomics previous studies have identified halotolerant hydrocarbon degrading bacterial strains daly et al 2016 fang et al 2017 however no study has evaluated the degradation activity and transcriptomic response of indigenous halotolerant hydrocarbon degrading species in natural low salinity environments once exposed to high salt levels high concentrations of salt in oil contaminated environments provide an ecological niche for halotolerant hydrocarbon degrading bacteria identifying conditions to stimulate the metabolic activity of halotolerant hydrocarbon degraders and thorough characterization of their growth and metabolic activity in their natural communities may provide new remediation strategies for saline hydrocarbon contaminated sites in this study we compared the effect of salt addition 2 5 and 5 wt 0 4 0 9 m added nacl which corresponds to the more frequently detected salinities in sites and no salt addition on the mineralization extent of 14c labelled hexadecane in hexadecane and diesel spiked into historically oil contaminated soils in slurry bioreactors hexadecane is representative of the poorly soluble non volatile but biodegradable fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons chang et al 2011 moreover the dynamics of the microbial community and biodegradation activity over time were characterized in microcosms containing pure liquid hexadecane or diesel this allowed examination of how the multitude of more soluble and thus readily bioavailable substrates in diesel affects the diversity and activity of microbial communities moreover the population size and the absolute abundance of the indigenous halotolerant hydrocarbon degrading dietzia maris were determined using droplet digital pcr also the in situ activity of the strain in the microbial community in terms of the expression of alkane hydroxylase genes was assessed with quantitative reverse transcription pcr qrt pcr 2 material and methods 2 1 mineralization experiments soil slurry microcosms were prepared with the addition of 5 g of weathered hydrocarbon contaminated soils from a production site in the northwestern territories canada and 35 ml of an aqueous solution described below to 175 ml microcosms sealed and capped with teflon laminated septa liners the detailed characterization of background contamination is reported elsewhere total petroleum hydrocarbon tph concentration of 1500 mg c kg akbari and ghoshal 2014 to increase the hydrocarbon concentrations from those low levels the slurries were freshly spiked with either i a mixture of 2 μl radiolabeled hexadecane and 68 μl of cold hexadecane having a total activity of 925 000 disintegrations per minute dpm or ii a mixture of 2 μl radiolabeled hexadecane and 68 μl of arctic diesel 1500 mg l slurry 10 000 mg kg soil the representative chromatogram of background contamination and the rationale for hexadecane mineralization assay is provided in section s1 1 supplementary materials a sub set of systems was amended with bushnell haas nutrient medium at a dose adjusted from preliminary experiments microcosms were placed in a shaker at 20 c and 175 rpm the factorial design included salt concentrations of 0 2 5 and 5 w v with or without nutrient amendment with diesel or hexadecane added microcosms were set up in triplicate six or nine replicates for various salt and nutrient conditions as detailed in supplementary materials section s1 2 mineralization of 14c hexadecane was measured from the radioactivity of a 5 m naoh solution placed in a trap for collecting the 14c co2 evolved at each sampling time 200 μl of the trap basic solution was collected and added to a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of ultimagold scintillation cocktail perkinelmer health sciences akbari et al 2016 sampling intervals from bioreactors were every 3 to 5 days in the first month and was longer in second month for diesel systems every 3 to 6 days and 9 to13 days in hexadecane systems triplicate samples from each microcosm were kept in the dark overnight prior to measurements the activity of 14c labelled hexadecane was counted on a beckman multi purpose scintillation counter ls 6500 using a correction factor for quenching the average of three measurements was used after correcting for background activity the activity was measured as dpm and the 2σ error in dpm was less than 1 the frequent sampling of basic traps and opening of bioreactors ensured that aerobic conditions were maintained in the systems contact angle of the aqueous extracts of the slurries on glass substrates were also measured at room temperature using an oca 30 goniometer future digital scientific corp equipped with a microliter syringe the angle between the substrate surface and the tangent to the drop profile at its intersection with the substrate surface was measured the method is detailed elsewhere asadishad et al 2011 2 2 microbial community analysis at day 0 and two sampling times day 11 and 19 for hexadecane spiked and days 9 and 28 for diesel spiked systems two samples from each slurry bioreactor were obtained and after centrifugation the pellets were stored at 80 c until dna extraction a comparative survey of community dynamics of different environmental settings with oil contamination by head et al previously suggested a major shift in community of oil contaminated environments occurs by day 10 head et al 2006 the second sampling day was at the beginning or in the mineralization stationary phase dna extraction was performed with the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc according to the protocol provided sequencing was performed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing platform illumina raw reads and sequencing processing were performed using mothur platform and according to methods described elsewhere akbari et al 2021 asadishad et al 2018 kozich et al 2013 primers used for miseq sequencing are listed as ir6100 in table s2 supplementary materials the raw sequence data have been submitted to the high throughput dna sequence read archive under accession number prjna643567 at the ncbi 2 3 gene expression qpcr and droplet digital pcr ddpcr to assess the alkb and cyp153 gene expression by dietzia as an indicator of its in situ hydrocarbon degradation activity three slurry samples were acquired on day 30 from each treatment details of qpcr primer specification reactions data and statistical analysis are presented in section s1 3 supplementary materials for droplet digital pcr three different samples were acquired on day 30 from the bioreactors dna was extracted using qiagen dneasy powersoil kit qiagen prior to dna quantification qx200 droplet digital pcr bio rad and ddpcr evagreen supermix bio rad samples were subjected to droplet generation by an automated droplet generator and end point pcr was performed details of reactions are presented in section s1 3 supplementary materials droplets were read on a droplet reader and data were analyzed using quantasoft software which determines the numbers of droplets that were positive and negative for each fluorophore in each sample the fraction of positive droplets was then fitted to a poisson distribution in quantasoft software to determine the absolute copy numbers μl pure culture of d maris was used as the positive control with control samples from a pure culture of d maris it was verified that nacl in the range of 0 10 had no effect on dna extraction efficiency primers are listed in table s2 supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 mineralization under saline conditions the hexadecane mineralization profiles over time from the diesel or hexadecane amended hydrocarbon contaminated soil slurry bioreactors are presented in fig 1 in diesel amended systems without any added nutrient the addition of salinity significantly more than two times fig 1 and table s3 supplementary materials enhanced the mineralization rate constant of hexadecane at the end of the 55 day experiment the mineralization extent was 48 7 0 9 and 43 6 1 4 in 2 5 and 5 salt systems versus 19 4 0 5 in no salt systems salinity slightly suppressed the mineralization extent in nutrient amended systems 45 7 2 8 and 36 5 1 7 in 2 5 and 5 salt added systems compared to 52 9 2 8 in no salt systems over 55 days but the mineralization rate constants were similar table s3 supplementary materials the biodegradation extents after one month in diesel systems without nutrient at 2 5 or 5 salinity were comparable to those in diesel systems with nutrient added the data suggest that salinity significantly influences hydrocarbon degradation rates and extents over time especially in the absence of nutrients likely because of the selection of halotolerant species that are effectively able to degrade hydrocarbons nutrient amendment also led to an increase in mineralization rate table s3 supplementary materials a qualitatively similar pattern of hexadecane mineralization was observed in the systems amended with pure phase hexadecane fig 1b however the effect of salinity in systems with no nutrient was more significant in diesel systems than in pure hexadecane systems 3 2 shift in microbial community with salinity the amplicon sequencing results at the phyla level from two sampling times of days 9 and 28 for diesel and days 11 and 19 for hexadecane spiked systems are presented in fig 2 the results for day 0 sample versus background uncontaminated sample is presented in section 3 supplementary materials actinobacteria and proteobacteria were major phyla constituting more than 90 of the total community in all slurry systems there is a prominent pattern across all samples with increasing salinity the relative abundance of actinobacteria was significantly increased and that was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria class was significantly increased with the addition of nutrients under non saline conditions but not under saline conditions the enrichment of betaproteobacteria upon nutrient addition in non saline diesel contaminated environments was also observed elsewhere bell et al 2013 the oil type significantly affected the diversity of microbial communities and there was generally lower diversity in diesel systems than hexadecane systems fig s3 section 4 supplementary materials moreover in hexadecane systems nutrient amendment led to a significant decrease in diversity correlation factor 0 73 p 10 4 non metric multi dimensional scale nmds analyses of microbial communities at the otu level for diesel and hexadecane systems are shown in fig 3 there were shifts in the microbial community composition in systems with salt and nutrient addition the spearman correlation of relative abundances of most abundant otus as well as independent variables with nmds axes are shown in fig 3 acidovorax and polaromonas from betaproteobacteria class were significantly enriched in non saline nutrient amended diesel systems compared to non saline systems without nutrients both genera are known to degrade petroleum hydrocarbon compounds jeon et al 2006 singleton et al 2009 the relative abundance of polaromonas was 31 5 in non saline nutrient amended diesel systems compared to 1 1 in all the other systems the significant enrichment of these genera under nutrient amended conditions indicates that these genera are well adapted to compete for nutrient uptake in nutrient rich environments brevundimonas and xanthomonadaceae were enriched in systems with no nutrients and no salt xanthomonadaceae was the dominant genus in day 0 samples the significantly diminished relative abundance of the xanthomonadaceae family under saline conditions or nutrient amended systems indicates the limited adaptability of the taxa to those environmental pressures the gammaproteobacteria affiliated xanthomonadaceae has been reported in high abundance in environmental samples with weathered hydrocarbon contamination akbari and ghoshal 2015 beazley et al 2012 the shift in the microbial community with salinity in various systems was at least partly related to the selective enrichment of dietzia genus the relative abundance of dietzia was significantly enriched in systems amended with salt correlation factor 0 7 p 10 3 as a case in point the relative abundance of the genus was as high as 47 5 6 6 in hexadecane nutrient amended systems at 5 salt as compared to 1 9 1 1 in hexadecane nutrient amended systems without salt and compared to the original weathered contaminated samples at 1 5 1 4 day 0 samples fig s4 supplementary materials no other hydrocarbon degrading genus was identified at such high abundance under saline conditions the amplicon sequencing data provides insights about the relative abundances of various taxa in the community but that alone is not sufficient to characterize the dynamics of changes in the community with experimental conditions for example the increase in the relative abundance of dietzia could be due to an increase in the abundance of the genus a decrease in abundance of other taxa or both thus we conducted droplet digital pcr for 16s rrna to determine the population size the results shown in fig 4 indicated that salt nutrient and oil significantly affected the total population size three way anova analysis p values 10 7 10 6 10 2 respectively a clear trend of the decrease in the microbial population with salinity was observed the data as expected also indicated a significant increase in the population with the nutrients 3 3 dietzia maris is the major salt tolerant hydrocarbon degrader in the indigenous microbial community using primers specific to dietzia ir6307 2 designed based on consensus in reads and verified from amplicon sequences we further determined its absolute abundance despite the general decrease in the population size with salinity the absolute abundance of the target population was increased with salinity fig 4 salt and nutrient significantly affected the size of dietzia maris population p 10 4 anova analysis and means comparison with sidakholm tests while oil type exhibited a relatively less significant effect p 0 05 mean comparison among various salinities indicated significant differences between 0 and 2 5 and 0 and 5 salinities but no statistically significant differences between 2 5 and 5 salinity moreover the abundance of dietzia at 2 5 salinity was comparable in diesel systems with and without nutrients and significantly higher abundance of the genus was detected in diesel systems with no nutrient and with salt compared to corresponding hexadecane systems to further assess the hydrocarbon degradation activity in the microbial community we evaluated the expression of alkb and cyp153 genes responsible for coding alkane monooxygenase and alkane hydroxylase involved in the first steps in the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons the primers are from a previous study by wang et al with a strain of d maris wang et al 2011 the expression of both genes in d maris isolated in our laboratory from the samples used in this study and grown on hexadecane as the sole carbon source was confirmed with qpcr ct values of 20 49 0 07 27 14 0 0 vs 36 1 for alkb and cyp153 and nort respectively the specific and relative expression of these two hydrocarbon degrading genes normalized to 16s rrna copy numbers of dietzia targeted with designed primers and relative to the sample from corresponding systems with no salt is illustrated in fig 4 generally there was a statistically significant increase in hydrocarbon degrading gene expression under saline conditions however there were no significant differences between 2 5 and 5 salinities p 0 05 in diesel systems without nutrient the higher the salt level the higher cyp153 expression similarly in hexadecane systems without nutrient the higher the salt level the higher alkb expression we further performed anova to assess the effect of oil type and nutrient across all treatments for a meaningful comparison and statistical analysis diesel with no salt no nutrient was considered as the calibrator system note that in the fig 4 systems with 0 salinity were used as calibrator for three systems presented in each subplot in addition to salt diesel enhanced the cyp 153 expression as compared to hexadecane the expression of cyp153 in diesel systems with no nutrient and with salt was significantly higher than corresponding systems with nutrient on the other hand the type of amended oil had no significant effects on alkb expression whereas statistically significant different alkb expressions were determined between nutrient amended and no nutrient systems the d maris strain isolated from our samples 99 similarity to d maris dsm 43672t chang et al 2018 in pure cultures produced biosurfactant and the surface tension in pure cultures incubated with hexadecane as the sole carbon source decreased to 34 6 0 4 dyne cm over 10 days the expression of genes involved in biosurfactant production such as rhla rhlc rhlg was detected in the pure culture moreover microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons math test warne zoueki et al 2010 results indicated that the cells were hydrophobic and attached readily to a pure hexadecane layer 82 15 of cells attached to the oil layer in pure culture the growth of d maris was not hindered in the presence of salinities up to 5 0 9 m whereas there was lower and delayed growth at 12 2 1 m salt and no growth at 20 3 5 m therefore the strain survives a large range of typical salinities in contaminated environments from oil extraction activities but not the higher end of reported salinities e g 4 m 4 discussion the microbial community composition and activity analysis confirmed that salinity plays a significant role in the selection and stimulation of the hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant bacteria the relatively higher similarities in community compositions under saline conditions in systems with and without nutrients as compared to non saline conditions fig 3 suggests that salinity at least for the range studied in this study is likely a more stringent ecological selection factor for community composition than nutrients moreover our gene expression results suggest an enhanced expression of hydrocarbon degradation related genes under saline conditions at 2 5 and 5 salt this is in contrast to previous studies conducted in pure cultures for example badejo et al reported delayed and generally lower expression of phdf phdi pcag and pcah genes involved in aromatic ring cleaving dioxygenases during degradation of pyrene by mycobacterium gilvum pyr gck at salinities up to 5 8 the gene expression was correlated with residual pyrene in the systems under different salinity levels badejo et al 2013 the trends of the increase in absolute abundance of dietzia and enhanced gene expressions with salinity in our study are generally consistent with the mineralization data fig 1 high mineralization but lower abundance and activity of dietzia at 0 salinity nutrient amended systems suggest other hydrocarbon degraders enriched in those systems are likely responsible for biodegradation systems with nutrient showed higher mineralization rates than no nutrient systems with an exponential mineralization profile and reached up to 40 60 in mineralization extents the maximum attainable mineralization based on an assumed 40 60 aerobic biomass yield indicating that neither nutrient nor oxygen was limited in contrast the mineralization pattern was linear in systems without nutrients suggesting a rate limiting factor in latter systems a similar pattern was reported by ulrich et al in slurries of subsurface sediments collected from a former oil well flare pit site ulrich et al 2008 the limited availability of nutrients may impact the growth and or metabolic rate of the hydrocarbon degrading community and thus the mineralization profile the exponential mineralization pattern in nutrient amended systems can be attributed to the rapid increase in the population size of hydrocarbon degraders and or higher activity of microbes a higher biosurfactant production leading to pseudo solubilization of poorly soluble hydrocarbons such as hexadecane and higher bioavailability may have also contributed to the observed higher growth rates and higher mineralization rate fig 1 bernardez and ghoshal 2004 posada baquero et al 2019 tejeda agredano et al 2011 the higher surfactant production in nutrient amended systems was confirmed by the decreased air water contact angle in those systems 59 averaged in diesel and hexadecane systems amended with nutrient versus 23 in the systems with no nutrient the presence of salt at the doses employed in this study showed no statistically significant effect on surface tension table s4 supplementary materials the increase in total population size in the presence of readily available sources of nitrogen and phosphorus and trace elements without salt stress is more evident in diesel systems than hexadecane this is likely due to that diesel is mainly composed of alkanes with shorter chain lengths than hexadecane thomassin lacroix et al 2002 under aerobic conditions short chain alkanes are the preferred carbon source for bacteria compared to longer chain alkanes such as hexadecane whyte et al 1998 similarly the generally lower diversity in diesel systems than hexadecane systems suggests that diesel acted as a selection factor this could be related to the higher solubility and bioavailability of diesel components than hexadecane the expression of cyp153 was generally higher in diesel systems this could be explained by previous findings indicating relatively higher expression of alkb genes with c16 c24 normal alkanes and cyp153 with c10 c20 alkanes as the carbon source in a pure culture of amycolicicoccus nie et al 2013 an interesting finding from this study is that the presence of readily bioavailable petroleum hydrocarbons leads to an increase in the population size and enhanced mineralization rate of poorly soluble hydrocarbons such as hexadecane the physiological genomic and ecological evidence suggests that dietzia degrades hydrocarbons tolerates salt and additionally employs different tactics to enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble fractions of oil wang et al reported emulsification activity and production of glycolipids phospholipids and lipopeptides by dietzia dq12 45 1b upon growth on alkanes in the case of higher molecular weight alkanes with very low aqueous solubility emulsification activity was decreased while higher attachment of bacterial cells to a hexadecane layer was observed wang et al 2013 the presence of genes involved in the metabolism of alkanes and biosynthesis of di rhamnolipid in the genome of d maris as 13 3 isolated from the deep sea has also been reported wang et al 2014 chen et al reported that the biodegradation rate of saturated hydrocarbons of crude oil in pure cultures of a dietzia strain dietzia sp cn 3 slightly decreased from 92 to 85 with an increase in salinity from 0 or 2 5 to 8 5 chen et al 2017 fang et al also reported that another strain of dietzia dietzia timorensis id05 a0528 could grow at salt levels in the range of 7 16 and ph of 5 10 fang et al 2018 the genome of dietzia timorensis id05 a0528 is reported to include genes encoding choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase choline glycine betaine transporter and other genes encoding proteins functioning as mono valent cation proton antiporters fang et al 2017 draft genome sequence of dietzia maris indicated the encoding of sodium abc transporter permease and the presence of a sodium proton antiporter and exchanger ganguly et al 2016 outward sodium transporters are important in lowering the intercellular ion concentrations equilibrium it is also plausible that mycolic acids which are present in the cell wall of dietzia perform as a barrier against the transport of solutes ganguly et al 2016 in our study the delayed growth at 12 after about one month suggests that d maris employs adaptation mechanisms to survive upon environmental stressors similar patterns of evolutionary adaptation to salt stress for yeasts have been reported bell and gonzalez 2011 samani and bell 2010 therefore the dietzia genus has a suite of tools at its disposal to adapt to salinity further it has been shown that the inoculation of strains of dieztia can promote the expression of genes encoding transcripts essential for salt stress tolerance in plants barnawal et al 2017 therefore dietzia could also stimulate plant tolerance against salt stress as a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr dietzia has been frequently detected in geographically distinct locations and diverse environments including cold climates such as oil contaminated sediments chen et al 2017 oil fields bødtker et al 2009 production waters wang et al 2011 sub arctic soils chang et al 2018 antarctica abdel mageed et al 2020 saline and or saline alkaline environments fang et al 2018 fig s5 supplementary materials therefore these findings are relevant to a diverse range of environments moreover a significant number of other hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant taxa have been already reported in the literature fathepure 2014 future studies are needed to assess if other hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant taxa are enriched in saline oil contaminated sites and to verify if such ecological responses translate to higher mineralisation rates as identified in this study 5 conclusions this is the first demonstration of the upregulation of hydrocarbon degradation genes up to 16 times higher in a microbial community under saline conditions and was associated with up to 4 8 times increase in the absolute abundance of a hydrocarbon degrading species and up to 2 2 times enhancement in mineralization rate constants at the same time population size decreased up to 5 2 times in saline systems salinity acted as a selection factor for hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and similar to the common biostimulation strategy of nutrient amendment enhanced the mineralization while the underlying causes were different these results have significant implications in the treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated salt impacted aqueous and soil environments and for treatment and re use of process affected waters our results suggest that under saline conditions efficient biostimulation strategies can be achieved without nutrient amendment provided that salt tolerant microbial taxa with desired function are present in the environment an alternative strategy would be to develop cultures such as d maris for microbial augmentation in saline hydrocarbon contaminated environments declaration of competing interest the

bushnell haas nutrient medium at a dose adjusted from preliminary experiments microcosms were placed in a shaker at 20 c and 175 rpm the factorial design included salt concentrations of 0 2 5 and 5 w v with or without nutrient amendment with diesel or hexadecane added microcosms were set up in triplicate six or nine replicates for various salt and nutrient conditions as detailed in supplementary materials section s1 2 mineralization of 14c hexadecane was measured from the radioactivity of a 5 m naoh solution placed in a trap for collecting the 14c co2 evolved at each sampling time 200 μl of the trap basic solution was collected and added to a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of ultimagold scintillation cocktail perkinelmer health sciences akbari et al 2016 sampling intervals from bioreactors were every 3 to 5 days in the first month and was longer in second month for diesel systems every 3 to 6 days and 9 to13 days in hexadecane systems triplicate samples from each microcosm were kept in the dark overnight prior to measurements the activity of 14c labelled hexadecane was counted on a beckman multi purpose scintillation counter ls 6500 using a correction factor for quenching the average of three measurements was used after correcting for background activity the activity was measured as dpm and the 2σ error in dpm was less than 1 the frequent sampling of basic traps and opening of bioreactors ensured that aerobic conditions were maintained in the systems contact angle of the aqueous extracts of the slurries on glass substrates were also measured at room temperature using an oca 30 goniometer future digital scientific corp equipped with a microliter syringe the angle between the substrate surface and the tangent to the drop profile at its intersection with the substrate surface was measured the method is detailed elsewhere asadishad et al 2011 2 2 microbial community analysis at day 0 and two sampling times day 11 and 19 for hexadecane spiked and days 9 and 28 for diesel spiked systems two samples from each slurry bioreactor were obtained and after centrifugation the pellets were stored at 80 c until dna extraction a comparative survey of community dynamics of different environmental settings with oil contamination by head et al previously suggested a major shift in community of oil contaminated environments occurs by day 10 head et al 2006 the second sampling day was at the beginning or in the mineralization stationary phase dna extraction was performed with the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc according to the protocol provided sequencing was performed by illumina miseq high throughput sequencing platform illumina raw reads and sequencing processing were performed using mothur platform and according to methods described elsewhere akbari et al 2021 asadishad et al 2018 kozich et al 2013 primers used for miseq sequencing are listed as ir6100 in table s2 supplementary materials the raw sequence data have been submitted to the high throughput dna sequence read archive under accession number prjna643567 at the ncbi 2 3 gene expression qpcr and droplet digital pcr ddpcr to assess the alkb and cyp153 gene expression by dietzia as an indicator of its in situ hydrocarbon degradation activity three slurry samples were acquired on day 30 from each treatment details of qpcr primer specification reactions data and statistical analysis are presented in section s1 3 supplementary materials for droplet digital pcr three different samples were acquired on day 30 from the bioreactors dna was extracted using qiagen dneasy powersoil kit qiagen prior to dna quantification qx200 droplet digital pcr bio rad and ddpcr evagreen supermix bio rad samples were subjected to droplet generation by an automated droplet generator and end point pcr was performed details of reactions are presented in section s1 3 supplementary materials droplets were read on a droplet reader and data were analyzed using quantasoft software which determines the numbers of droplets that were positive and negative for each fluorophore in each sample the fraction of positive droplets was then fitted to a poisson distribution in quantasoft software to determine the absolute copy numbers μl pure culture of d maris was used as the positive control with control samples from a pure culture of d maris it was verified that nacl in the range of 0 10 had no effect on dna extraction efficiency primers are listed in table s2 supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 mineralization under saline conditions the hexadecane mineralization profiles over time from the diesel or hexadecane amended hydrocarbon contaminated soil slurry bioreactors are presented in fig 1 in diesel amended systems without any added nutrient the addition of salinity significantly more than two times fig 1 and table s3 supplementary materials enhanced the mineralization rate constant of hexadecane at the end of the 55 day experiment the mineralization extent was 48 7 0 9 and 43 6 1 4 in 2 5 and 5 salt systems versus 19 4 0 5 in no salt systems salinity slightly suppressed the mineralization extent in nutrient amended systems 45 7 2 8 and 36 5 1 7 in 2 5 and 5 salt added systems compared to 52 9 2 8 in no salt systems over 55 days but the mineralization rate constants were similar table s3 supplementary materials the biodegradation extents after one month in diesel systems without nutrient at 2 5 or 5 salinity were comparable to those in diesel systems with nutrient added the data suggest that salinity significantly influences hydrocarbon degradation rates and extents over time especially in the absence of nutrients likely because of the selection of halotolerant species that are effectively able to degrade hydrocarbons nutrient amendment also led to an increase in mineralization rate table s3 supplementary materials a qualitatively similar pattern of hexadecane mineralization was observed in the systems amended with pure phase hexadecane fig 1b however the effect of salinity in systems with no nutrient was more significant in diesel systems than in pure hexadecane systems 3 2 shift in microbial community with salinity the amplicon sequencing results at the phyla level from two sampling times of days 9 and 28 for diesel and days 11 and 19 for hexadecane spiked systems are presented in fig 2 the results for day 0 sample versus background uncontaminated sample is presented in section 3 supplementary materials actinobacteria and proteobacteria were major phyla constituting more than 90 of the total community in all slurry systems there is a prominent pattern across all samples with increasing salinity the relative abundance of actinobacteria was significantly increased and that was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria class was significantly increased with the addition of nutrients under non saline conditions but not under saline conditions the enrichment of betaproteobacteria upon nutrient addition in non saline diesel contaminated environments was also observed elsewhere bell et al 2013 the oil type significantly affected the diversity of microbial communities and there was generally lower diversity in diesel systems than hexadecane systems fig s3 section 4 supplementary materials moreover in hexadecane systems nutrient amendment led to a significant decrease in diversity correlation factor 0 73 p 10 4 non metric multi dimensional scale nmds analyses of microbial communities at the otu level for diesel and hexadecane systems are shown in fig 3 there were shifts in the microbial community composition in systems with salt and nutrient addition the spearman correlation of relative abundances of most abundant otus as well as independent variables with nmds axes are shown in fig 3 acidovorax and polaromonas from betaproteobacteria class were significantly enriched in non saline nutrient amended diesel systems compared to non saline systems without nutrients both genera are known to degrade petroleum hydrocarbon compounds jeon et al 2006 singleton et al 2009 the relative abundance of polaromonas was 31 5 in non saline nutrient amended diesel systems compared to 1 1 in all the other systems the significant enrichment of these genera under nutrient amended conditions indicates that these genera are well adapted to compete for nutrient uptake in nutrient rich environments brevundimonas and xanthomonadaceae were enriched in systems with no nutrients and no salt xanthomonadaceae was the dominant genus in day 0 samples the significantly diminished relative abundance of the xanthomonadaceae family under saline conditions or nutrient amended systems indicates the limited adaptability of the taxa to those environmental pressures the gammaproteobacteria affiliated xanthomonadaceae has been reported in high abundance in environmental samples with weathered hydrocarbon contamination akbari and ghoshal 2015 beazley et al 2012 the shift in the microbial community with salinity in various systems was at least partly related to the selective enrichment of dietzia genus the relative abundance of dietzia was significantly enriched in systems amended with salt correlation factor 0 7 p 10 3 as a case in point the relative abundance of the genus was as high as 47 5 6 6 in hexadecane nutrient amended systems at 5 salt as compared to 1 9 1 1 in hexadecane nutrient amended systems without salt and compared to the original weathered contaminated samples at 1 5 1 4 day 0 samples fig s4 supplementary materials no other hydrocarbon degrading genus was identified at such high abundance under saline conditions the amplicon sequencing data provides insights about the relative abundances of various taxa in the community but that alone is not sufficient to characterize the dynamics of changes in the community with experimental conditions for example the increase in the relative abundance of dietzia could be due to an increase in the abundance of the genus a decrease in abundance of other taxa or both thus we conducted droplet digital pcr for 16s rrna to determine the population size the results shown in fig 4 indicated that salt nutrient and oil significantly affected the total population size three way anova analysis p values 10 7 10 6 10 2 respectively a clear trend of the decrease in the microbial population with salinity was observed the data as expected also indicated a significant increase in the population with the nutrients 3 3 dietzia maris is the major salt tolerant hydrocarbon degrader in the indigenous microbial community using primers specific to dietzia ir6307 2 designed based on consensus in reads and verified from amplicon sequences we further determined its absolute abundance despite the general decrease in the population size with salinity the absolute abundance of the target population was increased with salinity fig 4 salt and nutrient significantly affected the size of dietzia maris population p 10 4 anova analysis and means comparison with sidakholm tests while oil type exhibited a relatively less significant effect p 0 05 mean comparison among various salinities indicated significant differences between 0 and 2 5 and 0 and 5 salinities but no statistically significant differences between 2 5 and 5 salinity moreover the abundance of dietzia at 2 5 salinity was comparable in diesel systems with and without nutrients and significantly higher abundance of the genus was detected in diesel systems with no nutrient and with salt compared to corresponding hexadecane systems to further assess the hydrocarbon degradation activity in the microbial community we evaluated the expression of alkb and cyp153 genes responsible for coding alkane monooxygenase and alkane hydroxylase involved in the first steps in the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons the primers are from a previous study by wang et al with a strain of d maris wang et al 2011 the expression of both genes in d maris isolated in our laboratory from the samples used in this study and grown on hexadecane as the sole carbon source was confirmed with qpcr ct values of 20 49 0 07 27 14 0 0 vs 36 1 for alkb and cyp153 and nort respectively the specific and relative expression of these two hydrocarbon degrading genes normalized to 16s rrna copy numbers of dietzia targeted with designed primers and relative to the sample from corresponding systems with no salt is illustrated in fig 4 generally there was a statistically significant increase in hydrocarbon degrading gene expression under saline conditions however there were no significant differences between 2 5 and 5 salinities p 0 05 in diesel systems without nutrient the higher the salt level the higher cyp153 expression similarly in hexadecane systems without nutrient the higher the salt level the higher alkb expression we further performed anova to assess the effect of oil type and nutrient across all treatments for a meaningful comparison and statistical analysis diesel with no salt no nutrient was considered as the calibrator system note that in the fig 4 systems with 0 salinity were used as calibrator for three systems presented in each subplot in addition to salt diesel enhanced the cyp 153 expression as compared to hexadecane the expression of cyp153 in diesel systems with no nutrient and with salt was significantly higher than corresponding systems with nutrient on the other hand the type of amended oil had no significant effects on alkb expression whereas statistically significant different alkb expressions were determined between nutrient amended and no nutrient systems the d maris strain isolated from our samples 99 similarity to d maris dsm 43672t chang et al 2018 in pure cultures produced biosurfactant and the surface tension in pure cultures incubated with hexadecane as the sole carbon source decreased to 34 6 0 4 dyne cm over 10 days the expression of genes involved in biosurfactant production such as rhla rhlc rhlg was detected in the pure culture moreover microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons math test warne zoueki et al 2010 results indicated that the cells were hydrophobic and attached readily to a pure hexadecane layer 82 15 of cells attached to the oil layer in pure culture the growth of d maris was not hindered in the presence of salinities up to 5 0 9 m whereas there was lower and delayed growth at 12 2 1 m salt and no growth at 20 3 5 m therefore the strain survives a large range of typical salinities in contaminated environments from oil extraction activities but not the higher end of reported salinities e g 4 m 4 discussion the microbial community composition and activity analysis confirmed that salinity plays a significant role in the selection and stimulation of the hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant bacteria the relatively higher similarities in community compositions under saline conditions in systems with and without nutrients as compared to non saline conditions fig 3 suggests that salinity at least for the range studied in this study is likely a more stringent ecological selection factor for community composition than nutrients moreover our gene expression results suggest an enhanced expression of hydrocarbon degradation related genes under saline conditions at 2 5 and 5 salt this is in contrast to previous studies conducted in pure cultures for example badejo et al reported delayed and generally lower expression of phdf phdi pcag and pcah genes involved in aromatic ring cleaving dioxygenases during degradation of pyrene by mycobacterium gilvum pyr gck at salinities up to 5 8 the gene expression was correlated with residual pyrene in the systems under different salinity levels badejo et al 2013 the trends of the increase in absolute abundance of dietzia and enhanced gene expressions with salinity in our study are generally consistent with the mineralization data fig 1 high mineralization but lower abundance and activity of dietzia at 0 salinity nutrient amended systems suggest other hydrocarbon degraders enriched in those systems are likely responsible for biodegradation systems with nutrient showed higher mineralization rates than no nutrient systems with an exponential mineralization profile and reached up to 40 60 in mineralization extents the maximum attainable mineralization based on an assumed 40 60 aerobic biomass yield indicating that neither nutrient nor oxygen was limited in contrast the mineralization pattern was linear in systems without nutrients suggesting a rate limiting factor in latter systems a similar pattern was reported by ulrich et al in slurries of subsurface sediments collected from a former oil well flare pit site ulrich et al 2008 the limited availability of nutrients may impact the growth and or metabolic rate of the hydrocarbon degrading community and thus the mineralization profile the exponential mineralization pattern in nutrient amended systems can be attributed to the rapid increase in the population size of hydrocarbon degraders and or higher activity of microbes a higher biosurfactant production leading to pseudo solubilization of poorly soluble hydrocarbons such as hexadecane and higher bioavailability may have also contributed to the observed higher growth rates and higher mineralization rate fig 1 bernardez and ghoshal 2004 posada baquero et al 2019 tejeda agredano et al 2011 the higher surfactant production in nutrient amended systems was confirmed by the decreased air water contact angle in those systems 59 averaged in diesel and hexadecane systems amended with nutrient versus 23 in the systems with no nutrient the presence of salt at the doses employed in this study showed no statistically significant effect on surface tension table s4 supplementary materials the increase in total population size in the presence of readily available sources of nitrogen and phosphorus and trace elements without salt stress is more evident in diesel systems than hexadecane this is likely due to that diesel is mainly composed of alkanes with shorter chain lengths than hexadecane thomassin lacroix et al 2002 under aerobic conditions short chain alkanes are the preferred carbon source for bacteria compared to longer chain alkanes such as hexadecane whyte et al 1998 similarly the generally lower diversity in diesel systems than hexadecane systems suggests that diesel acted as a selection factor this could be related to the higher solubility and bioavailability of diesel components than hexadecane the expression of cyp153 was generally higher in diesel systems this could be explained by previous findings indicating relatively higher expression of alkb genes with c16 c24 normal alkanes and cyp153 with c10 c20 alkanes as the carbon source in a pure culture of amycolicicoccus nie et al 2013 an interesting finding from this study is that the presence of readily bioavailable petroleum hydrocarbons leads to an increase in the population size and enhanced mineralization rate of poorly soluble hydrocarbons such as hexadecane the physiological genomic and ecological evidence suggests that dietzia degrades hydrocarbons tolerates salt and additionally employs different tactics to enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble fractions of oil wang et al reported emulsification activity and production of glycolipids phospholipids and lipopeptides by dietzia dq12 45 1b upon growth on alkanes in the case of higher molecular weight alkanes with very low aqueous solubility emulsification activity was decreased while higher attachment of bacterial cells to a hexadecane layer was observed wang et al 2013 the presence of genes involved in the metabolism of alkanes and biosynthesis of di rhamnolipid in the genome of d maris as 13 3 isolated from the deep sea has also been reported wang et al 2014 chen et al reported that the biodegradation rate of saturated hydrocarbons of crude oil in pure cultures of a dietzia strain dietzia sp cn 3 slightly decreased from 92 to 85 with an increase in salinity from 0 or 2 5 to 8 5 chen et al 2017 fang et al also reported that another strain of dietzia dietzia timorensis id05 a0528 could grow at salt levels in the range of 7 16 and ph of 5 10 fang et al 2018 the genome of dietzia timorensis id05 a0528 is reported to include genes encoding choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase choline glycine betaine transporter and other genes encoding proteins functioning as mono valent cation proton antiporters fang et al 2017 draft genome sequence of dietzia maris indicated the encoding of sodium abc transporter permease and the presence of a sodium proton antiporter and exchanger ganguly et al 2016 outward sodium transporters are important in lowering the intercellular ion concentrations equilibrium it is also plausible that mycolic acids which are present in the cell wall of dietzia perform as a barrier against the transport of solutes ganguly et al 2016 in our study the delayed growth at 12 after about one month suggests that d maris employs adaptation mechanisms to survive upon environmental stressors similar patterns of evolutionary adaptation to salt stress for yeasts have been reported bell and gonzalez 2011 samani and bell 2010 therefore the dietzia genus has a suite of tools at its disposal to adapt to salinity further it has been shown that the inoculation of strains of dieztia can promote the expression of genes encoding transcripts essential for salt stress tolerance in plants barnawal et al 2017 therefore dietzia could also stimulate plant tolerance against salt stress as a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr dietzia has been frequently detected in geographically distinct locations and diverse environments including cold climates such as oil contaminated sediments chen et al 2017 oil fields bødtker et al 2009 production waters wang et al 2011 sub arctic soils chang et al 2018 antarctica abdel mageed et al 2020 saline and or saline alkaline environments fang et al 2018 fig s5 supplementary materials therefore these findings are relevant to a diverse range of environments moreover a significant number of other hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant taxa have been already reported in the literature fathepure 2014 future studies are needed to assess if other hydrocarbon degrading halotolerant taxa are enriched in saline oil contaminated sites and to verify if such ecological responses translate to higher mineralisation rates as identified in this study 5 conclusions this is the first demonstration of the upregulation of hydrocarbon degradation genes up to 16 times higher in a microbial community under saline conditions and was associated with up to 4 8 times increase in the absolute abundance of a hydrocarbon degrading species and up to 2 2 times enhancement in mineralization rate constants at the same time population size decreased up to 5 2 times in saline systems salinity acted as a selection factor for hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and similar to the common biostimulation strategy of nutrient amendment enhanced the mineralization while the underlying causes were different these results have significant implications in the treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated salt impacted aqueous and soil environments and for treatment and re use of process affected waters our results suggest that under saline conditions efficient biostimulation strategies can be achieved without nutrient amendment provided that salt tolerant microbial taxa with desired function are present in the environment an alternative strategy would be to develop cultures such as d maris for microbial augmentation in saline hydrocarbon contaminated environments declaration of competing interest the

16811,the highly hydrated colloidal structure of waste activated sludge was is the main obstacle of enhanced dewatering for sludge volume minimization extracellular polymeric substances eps maintain the colloidal stability of bio flocs in a three dimensional matrix due to bindings with bivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 and hydrophobic interactions however few studies specifically focused on the quantitative relationships among spatial distribution of eps microstructure of bio flocs and fractions of bound water e g vicinal water and interstitial water thus there may be still some debates on whether and what extent of the lysis or flocculation of sludge flocs is optimal for the dewaterability improvement this study applied the gradient addition of cation exchange resin cer to remove eps complexed cations and loosen the spatial distribution of eps consequently how the spatial extension of eps layers with relief of complex cations influenced the particle size distribution fractal dimension interfacial free energy and water occurrence states of was was systematically investigated the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d was also applied to analyze the water eps interactions with and without the presence of ca2 and mg2 all the results confirmed that the dispersed eps adhering layers led to the higher fractal dimension df but the lower space filling degree of bio flocs also the 4 fold reduction in the polar acid based interfacial free energy could be induced by the removal of cations from eps matrix which indicated the significant increase in hydrophobicity predictably the fractions of vicinal water and interstitial water were dominated by the polar acid based interfacial free energy and pore structure of microbial aggregates respectively which were confirmed by the strong pearson correlation rp 0 80 p value 0 04 these findings are expected to provide the improved mechanistic insights into the relationship between water occurrence states and colloidal structure of was and can serve as the basis for the optimal combination of various sludge conditioning approaches towards regulating aggregation states of bio flocs graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering eps interfacial free energy 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the microbial residue generated by pollutant metabolism during biological wastewater treatment processes as it contains pathogens hazardous metals and persistent organic pollutants the safe disposal of was plays a core role in reducing the secondary pollution of wastewater treatment system feng et al 2015 on the other hand was can be also considered as a valuable source of both energy and nutrients the energy recovery from was may also partially offset the energy consumption of wastewater treatment facility yu et al 2016 which leads to a more sustainable urban water cycle dewatering is the essential step for energy utilization and safe disposal of was as it can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation increase the calorific value and even reduce the leachate production in sludge landfill sites wu et al 2020 the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and the organics trapped water behaves very differently from the bulk water catalano 1970 lee 1996 which is defined as bound water according to the interactions between water and solid compositions the bound water could be further refined as the vicinal or interfacial water interstitial water and water of hydration vesilind 1994 wu et al 2018 some fractions of bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical dewatering means due to the steric hindrance caused by colloidal microbial aggregates and the solid water affinity caused by highly hydrated solid compositions christensen et al 2015 the highly efficient dewatering process remains a great challenge for managing sludge byproducts many efforts have been devoted to improving sludge dewaterability by various techniques extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major structural components inducing the microbial adhesion and maintaining the colloidal stability of bio flocs higgins and novak 1997 li et al 2019 therefore regardless of reaction types and operation conditions the effective approaches including sonication khanal et al 2007 freezing thawing franceschini 2010 coagulation flocculation guo et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 enhanced sludge dewatering as their excellent performance in disrupting rigid cell membranes and eps matrix however some studies also found that loosening bio flocs or promoting the spatial extension of eps layers may deteriorate the sludge dewaterability for example the increasing loosely bound eps lb eps has a negative effect on bio flocculation li and yang 2007 but the tightly bound eps tb eps and soluble eps s eps have limited effects on the sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2012 therefore there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of the lysis or flocculation of sludge flocs is optimal for the dewaterability improvement the existing sludge conditioning approaches e g aops affect both the composition and spatial distribution of eps in sludge flocs xiao et al 2017 thus further studies specifically focusing on how the micro spatial distribution of eps influences the dewaterability and water occurrence states of was are still demanded the quantitative relationships among spatial distribution of eps microstructure of sludge flocs and different fractions of bound water e g vicinal water and interstitial water remains unexplored in addition as eps keeps the bio flocs together in a three dimensional matrix due to bindings with bivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 and hydrophobic interactions bo et al 1996 the bivalent cations are believed to play crucial roles in the micro spatial distribution of eps however it is still necessary to deeply understand the mechanism for complex cations to maintain the colloidal stability especially from the perspective of cations dominated surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity through the gradient removal of bivalent cations by different dosages of cation exchange resin cer this study specifically investigated how the eps migration and eps complexed cations were related to the water occurrence states of was the cer induced spatial extension of eps was characterized by visual and quantitative means the corresponding changes in physical properties of colloidal particles with shifting stratification structure of eps were tracked in terms of particle size distribution fractal dimension and interfacial free energy furthermore the water states of bio flocs were quantitatively analyzed through the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution measured by low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the correlative analysis among the micro spatial distribution of eps the geometric parameters of sludge colloidal particles the solid liquid interfacial interactions and the water fractions were conducted as a result the specific relationship between the spatial distribution of water holding compositions eps and the water occurrence states in was can be unveiled the finding is expected to determine whether bio floc loosening or molecular structure denaturation of eps is crucial for sludge dewaterability improvement which will lay a direction for the development of novel sludge conditioning technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 was the was samples were collected from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china which adopts anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process the sampling interval for the triplicate samples was 24 h higgins and novak 1997 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 ph 6 85 0 05 of the as collected sludge was measured by electrode

by the weight loss of the dry matter of was at 600 c for 2 h apha 2009 the major organic element compositions on dry basis were measured by element analyzer vario el iii elementar germany and shown in table s1 of supplementary materials the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g eps extracts were stored at 4 c the analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 5 d in order to eliminate any possible change of physiochemical properties higgins and novak 1997 yu et al 2020 2 2 regulating eps aggregation states through cation removal by cer generally ca2 mg2 and fe3 are crucial in the sludge floc stabilization flemming and wingender 2010 due to the formation of cross linked gel among adjacent molecular units e g alginate complexing with ca2 mg2 egg box structure mo et al 2008 similarly it was reported that the specific removal of fe3 from activated sludge flocs weakened the floc strength resulting in the release of particles to bulk water dissolution of eps and partial floc disintegration nielsen and keiding 1998 therefore this study applied cer 732 cation exchange resins in sodium form sinoreagent shanghai china with different dosages to loosen the aggregation states of eps layer the cer with the predetermined dosages 0 1 0 5 1 5 10 and 25 g g dry matter dm were added into sludge samples following the mechanical agitation for 3 h at room temperature after that the cer was removed by screen mesh 50 mesh and the cer pretreated sludge was subjected to the analysis on physiochemical properties and water occurrence states 2 3 eps extraction and compositional analysis since the eps matrix was shearing sensitive the different layers of eps soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps were separately extracted by using different centrifugation speed and ultrasonication power wu et al 2016a the details can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials polysaccharide and protein levels of the extracted eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 respectively the duplicate experiments were conducted on the mixture sample of the as collected triplicate samples 2 4 visualization of eps spatial distribution the microstructure of was particularly the distribution

the fractal dimension and interfacial energy were measured according to the methods described in the previous literatures li et al 2020 liu et al 2007 the zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential meter zeta sizer nano z malvern uk the dewaterability of was was evaluated in terms of capillary suction time cst according to the standard method apha 2009 2 6 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d analysis to characterize the water eps interactions with and without ca2 mg2 complexations the viscoelastic acoustic response of adhering eps layers with and without the presence of ca2 mg2 was monitored in qcm d analysis was was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c then the sludge pellets were resuspended and diluted to their original volume by adding 0 05 nacl solution afterwards 60 g g dm cer was added and the suspension was stirred at 300 rpm and 4 c for 12 h to remove ca2 and mg2 bound to eps ni et al 2009 the bound eps were harvested in the supernatant by centrifugation for 20 min at 20000 g and 4 c and then subjected to qcm d analysis the detailed methods for qcm d analysis are described in text s3 of supplementary materials 2 7 water state analysis by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr the was samples treated by different dosages of cer were further concentrated by gravity settling until the solid liquid interface didn t drop within 15 min the supernatant was then discarded so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the refined bound water states e g vicinal water and interstitial water could be prominent next the concentrated sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and subjected to the measurement of transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing can be referred to our previous study wu et al

confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification and visualization of spatial extension of eps 3 1 1 quantifying components in eps stratification structure the levels of protein and polysaccharide in different spatial scales of sludge flocs were considered fig 1 tightly bound eps tb eps accounted for the major part of bound eps in sludge flocs protein and polysaccharide concentrations in tb eps of raw sludge were 56 8 mg casein equivalent g vs and from 16 9 mg glucose equivalent g vs respectively however the contents of proteins and polysaccharides in loosely bound eps lb eps of raw sludge were measured as only 5 2 mg casein equivalent g vs and 0 7 mg glucose equivalent g vs respectively it was found that the increasing addition of cer constantly decreased the contents of ca mg in solid compositions but slightly reduced the fe contents fig s1 of supplementary materials however the cer based treatment still led to the cleavage of sludge flocs effectively which was reflected by the consistently increasing protein contents in s eps but the decreasing protein levels of lb eps and tb eps with the increasing dosage of cer fig 1 generally the polysaccharide contents also exhibited the decreasing trends for both lb eps and tb eps however the fluctuation of polysaccharide contents in sonication extracted tb eps with the increasing cer usage may reflect that the complex cations i e ca2 and mg2 had the few effects on polysaccharide accumulation in eps matrix than that of proteins the similar result was also obtained by the enzyme induced bio floc lysis in previous studies wu et al 2016b the increase in levels of s eps and lb eps should closely correlated with the solubilization of tb eps which was confirmed by pearson coefficients of 0 83 0 96 and p value 0 05 table 1 that indicated the effectiveness of cer for the spatial extension of eps in this study 3 1 2 visualizing micro spatial distribution of eps fig 2 a g shows the micromorphology of sludge flocs treated by cer similar with the previous reports mcswain et al 2005 eps distributed both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates but always acted as the most exterior layers of solid phase interacting with water molecules as displayed in the most left column of optical microscopy photographs the sludge flocs became looser with the increasing dosage of cer the dense accumulation zoogloeal could be observed in raw sludge which was featured by the red bright points of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides stained with concanavalin a and the green highlighted points of proteins fluorescently marked by fitc on contrary the cer induced migration of eps would lead to the lysis of sludge flocs as a result the fragmented flocs were the prominent features of sludge treated by 10 25 g g dm cer accordingly since the excessive fluorescent dye in aqueous phase was removed by pbs washing the fluorescence intensities of stained α d glucopyranose polysaccharides proteins and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides on the internal external surfaces surface of sludge flocs all decreased with the increasing cer addition fig 2c h this phenomenon was in accordance with the solubilization of eps but it is worth noting that the clsm images were just taken in a small imaging area 250 μm 250 μm thus the local enrichment of proteins could also be observed as the bright points fig 2h 3 2 evolution of micro physical properties of colloidal particles with spatial extension of eps the spatial extension of eps inevitably influenced the aggregation states of bio flocs which could be reflected by particle size distribution and micro morphological parameters accordingly the changes in micro structure of bio flocs would affect the steric hindrance of solid to water that could be used to partially explain the transformation of water occurrence states accompanied with the spatial extension of eps 3 2 1 surface charge properties and particle size distribution it was previously reported that the addition of multivalent metal salts e g fecl3 with 0 3 g g dm could decrease the absolute value of zeta potential of sludge colloidal particles from 20 mv to 10 mv pang et al 2020 accordingly the cer treatment enhanced the electronegativity of sludge flocs by removing the complex cations the zeta potentials of sludge particles decreased from 13 6 mv to 28 1 mv with the dosage of cer increasing from 0 to 25 g g dm fig 3 the increase in absolute value of zeta potential would enhance the electrical repulsive force of sludge particles which resulted in the cleavage of microbial colloidal aggregates and generated the small particles the mean surface diameter d 3 2 tended to be smaller with the increasing addition of cer especially from 5 to 25 g cer g dm d 3 2 and zeta potential had pearson coefficient of 0 79 with p value of 0 06 table 1 also the particle size distribution may simultaneously influence the surface area and the porosity among microbial colloidal particles which was further characterized by fractal dimension in the following section 23 2 2 fractal dimension fractal dimension df reflects the structural properties of an aggregate about space filling ability surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form zhang et al 2018 in this study df closely correlated with both zeta potential and d 3 2 table 1 which confirmed that the surface electricity determined the aggregation state of particles and would further affect the micromorphology of bio flocs with the increasing addition of cer fig 4 df constantly increased generally a higher fractal dimension means a lower space filling degree li et al 2020 moussas and zouboulis 2009 therefore the higher the fractal dimension the looser and smaller the bio flocs of was were which corresponded to the micro spatial distribution of eps observed in clsm images additionally the higher fractal dimension may stand for the greater porosity of bio flocs which should provide the more occurrence space for sterically hindered bound water e g interstitial water wu et al 2019 the effects of micro structure of bio flocs on water occurrence states are further discussed in section 3 4 3 3 evolution of solid water interactions with spatial extension of eps the cer based treatment led to the spatial extension of eps through the capture of free cations which inevitably influenced the surface properties of sludge particles accordingly the changes in surface properties of bio flocs would affect the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity that could be also used to explain the transformation of chemically bound water accompanied with the cer induced spatial extension of eps 3 3 1 solid water interfacial free energy the interfacial free energy was analyzed to characterize the water solid interactions of cer treated sludge according to derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the total interfacial free energy can be divided into two components i e an apolar van der waals based interfacial free energy and a polar or acid based interfacial free energy liu et al 2007 the apolar van der waals based interaction is caused by interatomic or intermolecular attraction among neutral atoms or molecules van oss et al 1988 based on the electron donor and electron acceptor interactions the polar or acid based interfacial free energy is closely related to hydrogen bonding interactions and structural effects i e hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure van oss 1997 also the polar interfacial free energy originates from molecules or particles with the opposite sign of charge in a polar liquid which is strongly dependent on the ionic strength near particle s surface grasso et al 2002 the cer based treatment extracted ca2 and mg2 complexing with eps but would not change the types of functional groups of eps macromolecules therefore there was no obvious variation in the apolar van der waals based interfacial free energy fig 5 on the contrary the polar or acid based interfacial free energy substantially decreased which indicated that the affinity between solid compositions and water molecules was eliminated hermansson 1999 the typical hydrophilic functional groups e g amino group nh2 and carboxylic group cooh are also the polar groups with the lone electron pair mondal and hu 2006 sterpone et al 2010 and thus could be occupied by cations as the complexing sites through coordinate covalent bonds sterpone et al 2010 cations complexed with surface functional groups could raise the osmotic pressure gradient between bulk aqueous phase and near surface area which may increase the driving force for water molecules to diffuse to hydrophilic surface and thicken the hydration layer of colloidal sludge particles fenter and lee 2014 sinha et al 2008 therefore due to the relief of the complexation between eps and metal ions the water affinity of sludge particles was weakened with the correlative analysis of fig 5 and fig s1 it could be found that the removal of 69 6 0 7 ca and 21 0 3 6 mg in eps matrix caused more than 4 fold decrease in the polar or acid based interfacial free energy the close correlations between ca mg contents and polar or acid based interfacial free energy could be also verified with pearson coefficient of 0 82 0 86 p value 0 028 0 045 those both confirmed that the complex cations played significant roles in the formation of hydration layer of eps however the fractal dimension of bio flocs should be dominated by the interactions among sludge particles instead of solid water interactions therefore there was no clear correlation among fractal dimension and solid water interfacial free energy table 1 3 3 2 viscoelastic acoustic response of water eps interactions as eps act as the most exterior layers of microbial aggregates interacting with water molecules the eps water interactions can be applied to further characterize the water holding capacities of was bio flocs in this study the spatial extension of eps matrix was mainly due to the cer removed ca2 mg2 thus the viscoelastic acoustic response of eps with and without the presence of ca2 mg2 was monitored in qcm d analysis the effect of complex cations on the water holding water repelling properties of eps matrix could be elucidated as shown in fig s2 and fig 6 a the higher shift of frequency δf and dissipation δd should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal ying et al 2010 with the prolonged injection time the gradual stabilization of frequency and dissipation indicated the saturation of crystal surface coverage by adhering eps layers the subsequent injections of ca2 and mg2 solution induced a sharp variation in both frequency and dissipation fig 6a suggesting that the added cations interacted with the eps layer formed on the crystal surface it is likely that the increased ca2 mg2 contents or positive charge density shielded the charges of the aurum surface and eps macromolecules wu et al 2018 due to the electric double layer compression and charge screening the electrostatic repulsion between the silica crystal surface and adsorbed eps layer could be decreased ying et al 2010 therefore the addition of ca2 and mg2 would lead to the denser and thicker eps layer fig 6b plotting the change in dissipation versus the change in frequency makes it possible to compare the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass gutman et al 2013 a lower δf δd value indicates buildup of a dissipative soft and fluid film on the qcm d sensor on the other hand a higher δf δd value stands for a more rigid layer gutman et al 2013 in another word due to the intermolecular interactions among water molecules and macromolecules adsorbed on sensor crystals the unit mass of hydrophilic crystal adsorbed layer could cause more energy dissipation than that of the hydrophobic crystal adsorbed layer höök et al 1998 this information may thus help elucidate the water holding capacity of eps matrix for instance an increase in the viscosity of eps layer indicated a solid water fusion system while an increase in the rigidity was suggested to be a sign of a dense water repelling system as shown in fig 6b the values of δf δd below 0 corresponded to a positive δf δd slope in the initial 90 min eps adsorption stage which stood for a gradually thickening layer of insoluble macromolecules at the injection stage of ca2 and mg2 solution the values of δf δd rose substantially which further reflected the higher elasticity of the adhering layer the above results were in accordance with the viscosity and shearing capacity calculated by voigt model as shown in fig 6c d the addition of ca2 and mg2 decreased the viscosity but increased the shearing capacity of eps adhering layers which also corresponded to the looser eps aggregation states with the increasing removal of cations by cer fig 2 3 4 mechanism insights into water state transformation resulted from spatial extension of eps due to the different affinities with the surrounding environment the transverse relaxation time t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr the water states in bio floc is based on the different binding strengths among water molecules and solid compositions therefore nmr relaxometry can be a nondestructive method that enables probing the mobility of protons in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 as shown in fig 7 the two dominant vicinal peaks and one or two minor peaks are identified in the t2 distribution spectra suggesting the existence of two major states of protons in sludge the quantification of water states was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 distribution spectra the proportion of each peak area in the total peak area represents the relative amount of corresponding water state gummerson et al 1979 according to the previous studies gussoni et al 2007 wu et al 2019 t21 should be assigned as the protons at solid state which had the extremely lower content than the protons of water molecules and had no substantial variation with the varying cer addition t22 and t23 should correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through hydrogen bound vicinal water and the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance interstitial water respectively gussoni et al 2007 vesilind 1994 wu et al 2019 the vicinal water fraction a22 fluctuated around 5 5 with cer dosage increasing from 0 to 5 g g dm however a22 decreased to 4 89 and 4 32 at the cer dosages of 10 g g dm and 25 g g dm respectively which reflected the reduction of vicinal water induced by cer enhanced surface hydrophobicity and corresponded to the decrease of polar or acid based interfacial energy measured in the above sections the interstitial water is certainly governed by the micro and macro capillary structure of bio floc water cheng et al 2018 therefore the slightly increasing trend of a23 was identified due to the more porous structure induced by cer fragmentized sludge flocs which also corresponded to the results in qcm d analysis i e the increasing water holding capacity of eps matrix could be realized without the presence of cations accordingly d 3 2 had the negative correlation with the interstitial water fraction represented by peak 3 of t2 spectra pearson correlation 0 84 and p value 0 04 table 2 also it was reasonable that df had the significant correlation pearson coefficient 0 83 p value 0 04 with the interstitial water fraction represented by peak 3 of t2 spectra table 2 because the complexity or roughness of micromorphology was just quantitatively characterized by df li et al 2020 in this study the most mobile water state was assigned to the transverse relaxation time t24 of 1000 3000 ms the relative content of t24 water fraction a24 was also extremely low 0 2 and decreased substantially with the addition of cer increasing to 0 5 g g dm that may reflect the non existence of absolutely free water in bio flocs of was lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 the mobility of the most mobile water fractions could be also influenced by the aggregation states of sludge particles or water solid interactions wu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 therefore the significant correlations among a24 total interfacial free energy polar or acid based interfacial free energy and zeta potential were determined with pearson coefficient 0 88 and p value 0 02 the slightly increasing trend of a23 was accompanied with the poorer sludge dewaterability in term of cst pearson coefficient 0 89 p value 0 02 the fragmentation of sludge flocs induced by cer based treatment increased cst from 34 4 to 187 2 s fig s3 this finding was inconsistent with the conventional cognition obtained from the previous studies working on the aops induced fragmentation of sludge flocs the radical oxidation could significantly influence the molecular compositions of eps xiao et al 2018 zhen et al 2012 therefore it was hard to determine whether the lysis of microbial colloidal aggregates or the oxidized eps dominantly contributed to the dewaterability improvement in the aops based processes according to the analysis in this study the coagulation effect of cations on sludge flocs decreased the interstitial water through the porosity reduction however on the other hand the complexation of cations with extracellular macromolecules enhanced the surface hydrophilicity through raising the polar or acid based interfacial free energy this contradictory may limit the technical efficiency of coagulation based sludge conditioning processes also the findings presented here corresponded to the dewaterability deterioration caused by anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2021 wu et al 2016b which should be attributed to loosening bio flocs of was although the fermentation may facilitate the high value re utilization of was the potential negative effects of fermentation led bio floc lysis on solid liquid separation cannot be ignored regarding the sludge dewaterability through eps modification more attention should be paid to the molecular structure denaturation for the reduction of surface hydrophilicity e g exposure of hydrophobic functional groups or oxidation removal of hydrophilic functional groups instead the excessive lysis of bio flocs should be avoided to reduce the bio floc porosity accordingly the water retaining capacity can be minimized for sludge dewaterability improvement 4 conclusion this study specifically focused on the effect of micro spatial distribution of eps on the water occurrence states of was the cer capture of cations e g ca2 and mg2 dispersed eps adhering layers and made the microbial aggregates much looser accordingly the higher df and the lower space filling degree of bio flocs could be obtained also the spatial extension of eps was accompanied with the decrease in the interfacial free energy the removal of nearly 70 ca mg in eps matrix induced 4 fold reduction in the polar or acid based interfacial free energy which reflected the significant elimination of surface hydrophilicity however the viscoelastic acoustic response of water eps interactions in qcm d analysis indicated that the water holding capacity of eps matrix could be weakened with the coagulation effect of ca2 mg2 which was supported by the decreased viscosity and the increased shearing capacity of crystal adsorbed eps layers the strong correlations rp 0 80 p value 0 04 among the interfacial free energy the particle size distribution and the different bound water fractions confirmed that the vicinal water and interstitial water were dominated by the solid water interfacial free energy and pore structure of microbial aggregates respectively the complex cations could reduce the interstitial water by coagulation of bio flocs but may also enhance the surface hydrophilicity through ionic hydration effect this contradictory may limit the technical efficiency of coagulation based sludge conditioning processes therefore more attention should be paid to the development of novel approaches that can simultaneously reduce the bio floc porosity and surface hydrophilicity for sludge dewaterability improvement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16811,the highly hydrated colloidal structure of waste activated sludge was is the main obstacle of enhanced dewatering for sludge volume minimization extracellular polymeric substances eps maintain the colloidal stability of bio flocs in a three dimensional matrix due to bindings with bivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 and hydrophobic interactions however few studies specifically focused on the quantitative relationships among spatial distribution of eps microstructure of bio flocs and fractions of bound water e g vicinal water and interstitial water thus there may be still some debates on whether and what extent of the lysis or flocculation of sludge flocs is optimal for the dewaterability improvement this study applied the gradient addition of cation exchange resin cer to remove eps complexed cations and loosen the spatial distribution of eps consequently how the spatial extension of eps layers with relief of complex cations influenced the particle size distribution fractal dimension interfacial free energy and water occurrence states of was was systematically investigated the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d was also applied to analyze the water eps interactions with and without the presence of ca2 and mg2 all the results confirmed that the dispersed eps adhering layers led to the higher fractal dimension df but the lower space filling degree of bio flocs also the 4 fold reduction in the polar acid based interfacial free energy could be induced by the removal of cations from eps matrix which indicated the significant increase in hydrophobicity predictably the fractions of vicinal water and interstitial water were dominated by the polar acid based interfacial free energy and pore structure of microbial aggregates respectively which were confirmed by the strong pearson correlation rp 0 80 p value 0 04 these findings are expected to provide the improved mechanistic insights into the relationship between water occurrence states and colloidal structure of was and can serve as the basis for the optimal combination of various sludge conditioning approaches towards regulating aggregation states of bio flocs graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering eps interfacial free energy 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the microbial residue generated by pollutant metabolism during biological wastewater treatment processes as it contains pathogens hazardous metals and persistent organic pollutants the safe disposal of was plays a core role in reducing the secondary pollution of wastewater treatment system feng et al 2015 on the other hand was can be also considered as a valuable source of both energy and nutrients the energy recovery from was may also partially offset the energy consumption of wastewater treatment facility yu et al 2016 which leads to a more sustainable urban water cycle dewatering is the essential step for energy utilization and safe disposal of was as it can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation increase the calorific value and even reduce the leachate production in sludge landfill sites wu et al 2020 the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and the organics trapped water behaves very differently from the bulk water catalano 1970 lee 1996 which is defined as bound water according to the interactions between water and solid compositions the bound water could be further refined as the vicinal or interfacial water interstitial water and water of hydration vesilind 1994 wu et al 2018 some fractions of bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical dewatering means due to the steric hindrance caused by colloidal microbial aggregates and the solid water affinity caused by highly hydrated solid compositions christensen et al 2015 the highly efficient dewatering process remains a great challenge for managing sludge byproducts many efforts have been devoted to improving sludge dewaterability by various techniques extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major structural components inducing the microbial adhesion and maintaining the colloidal stability of bio flocs higgins and novak 1997 li et al 2019 therefore regardless of reaction types and operation conditions the effective approaches including sonication khanal et al 2007 freezing thawing franceschini 2010 coagulation flocculation guo et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and advanced oxidation processes aops xiao et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 enhanced sludge dewatering as their excellent performance in disrupting rigid cell membranes and eps matrix however some studies also found that loosening bio flocs or promoting the spatial extension of eps layers may deteriorate the sludge dewaterability for example the increasing loosely bound eps lb eps has a negative effect on bio flocculation li and yang 2007 but the tightly bound eps tb eps and soluble eps s eps have limited effects on the sludge dewaterability zhen et al 2012 therefore there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of the lysis or flocculation of sludge flocs is optimal for the dewaterability improvement the existing sludge conditioning approaches e g aops affect both the composition and spatial distribution of eps in sludge flocs xiao et al 2017 thus further studies specifically focusing on how the micro spatial distribution of eps influences the dewaterability and water occurrence states of was are still demanded the quantitative relationships among spatial distribution of eps microstructure of sludge flocs and different fractions of bound water e g vicinal water and interstitial water remains unexplored in addition as eps keeps the bio flocs together in a three dimensional matrix due to bindings with bivalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 and hydrophobic interactions bo et al 1996 the bivalent cations are believed to play crucial roles in the micro spatial distribution of eps however it is still necessary to deeply understand the mechanism for complex cations to maintain the colloidal stability especially from the perspective of cations dominated surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity through the gradient removal of bivalent cations by different dosages of cation exchange resin cer this study specifically investigated how the eps migration and eps complexed cations were related to the water occurrence states of was the cer induced spatial extension of eps was characterized by visual and quantitative means the corresponding changes in physical properties of colloidal particles with shifting stratification structure of eps were tracked in terms of particle size distribution fractal dimension and interfacial free energy furthermore the water states of bio flocs were quantitatively analyzed through the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution measured by low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the correlative analysis among the micro spatial distribution of eps the geometric parameters of sludge colloidal particles the solid liquid interfacial interactions and the water fractions were conducted as a result the specific relationship between the spatial distribution of water holding compositions eps and the water occurrence states in was can be unveiled the finding is expected to determine whether bio floc loosening or molecular structure denaturation of eps is crucial for sludge dewaterability improvement which will lay a direction for the development of novel sludge conditioning technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 was the was samples were collected from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant located at shanghai china which adopts anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process the sampling interval for the triplicate samples was 24 h higgins and novak 1997 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 ph 6 85 0 05 of the as collected sludge was measured by electrode method water content 99 00 0 03 wt 10 47 0 30 g l dry matter was calculated by the weight loss after dried to the constant weight at 105 c volatile solid vs 6 54 0 10 g l was subsequently determined by the weight loss of the dry matter of was at 600 c for 2 h apha 2009 the major organic element compositions on dry basis were measured by element analyzer vario el iii elementar germany and shown in table s1 of supplementary materials the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g eps extracts were stored at 4 c the analytical experiments were finished within the subsequent 5 d in order to eliminate any possible change of physiochemical properties higgins and novak 1997 yu et al 2020 2 2 regulating eps aggregation states through cation removal by cer generally ca2 mg2 and fe3 are crucial in the sludge floc stabilization flemming and wingender 2010 due to the formation of cross linked gel among adjacent molecular units e g alginate complexing with ca2 mg2 egg box structure mo et al 2008 similarly it was reported that the specific removal of fe3 from activated sludge flocs weakened the floc strength resulting in the release of particles to bulk water dissolution of eps and partial floc disintegration nielsen and keiding 1998 therefore this study applied cer 732 cation exchange resins in sodium form sinoreagent shanghai china with different dosages to loosen the aggregation states of eps layer the cer with the predetermined dosages 0 1 0 5 1 5 10 and 25 g g dry matter dm were added into sludge samples following the mechanical agitation for 3 h at room temperature after that the cer was removed by screen mesh 50 mesh and the cer pretreated sludge was subjected to the analysis on physiochemical properties and water occurrence states 2 3 eps extraction and compositional analysis since the eps matrix was shearing sensitive the different layers of eps soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps were separately extracted by using different centrifugation speed and ultrasonication power wu et al 2016a the details can be found in text s1 of supplementary materials polysaccharide and protein levels of the extracted eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 respectively the duplicate experiments were conducted on the mixture sample of the as collected triplicate samples 2 4 visualization of eps spatial distribution the microstructure of was particularly the distribution of microbial cells and eps was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm tcs sp8 sted 3x leica germany calcofluor white excitation 400 nm emission 410 480 nm blue fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc probe excitation 488 nm emission 500 540 nm green and fluorescently labeled lectins concanavalin a excitation 543 nm emission 550 600 nm red sigma st louis usa were utilized to stain the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides proteins and α mannopyranosyl α glucopyranosyl sugar residues respectively chen et al 2007 the detailed staining scheme is described in text s2 of supplementary materials 2 5 physical properties of sludge colloidal particles the particle size distributions of sludge particles were measured by dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern uk the fractal dimension and interfacial energy were measured according to the methods described in the previous literatures li et al 2020 liu et al 2007 the zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential meter zeta sizer nano z malvern uk the dewaterability of was was evaluated in terms of capillary suction time cst according to the standard method apha 2009 2 6 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d analysis to characterize the water eps interactions with and without ca2 mg2 complexations the viscoelastic acoustic response of adhering eps layers with and without the presence of ca2 mg2 was monitored in qcm d analysis was was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c then the sludge pellets were resuspended and diluted to their original volume by adding 0 05 nacl solution afterwards 60 g g dm cer was added and the suspension was stirred at 300 rpm and 4 c for 12 h to remove ca2 and mg2 bound to eps ni et al 2009 the bound eps were harvested in the supernatant by centrifugation for 20 min at 20000 g and 4 c and then subjected to qcm d analysis the detailed methods for qcm d analysis are described in text s3 of supplementary materials 2 7 water state analysis by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr the was samples treated by different dosages of cer were further concentrated by gravity settling until the solid liquid interface didn t drop within 15 min the supernatant was then discarded so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the refined bound water states e g vicinal water and interstitial water could be prominent next the concentrated sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and subjected to the measurement of transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing can be referred to our previous study wu et al 2019 the area under each peak of t2 spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of water molecule protons with different mobility 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the software originpro 9 0 64bit originpro lab corp usa pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the potential relationships among eps contents at stratification structure physical properties of bio floc particle size fractal dimension and interfacial energy water fractions and sludge dewaterability pearson coefficient is always between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification and visualization of spatial extension of eps 3 1 1 quantifying components in eps stratification structure the levels of protein and polysaccharide in different spatial scales of sludge flocs were considered fig 1 tightly bound eps tb eps accounted for the major part of bound eps in sludge flocs protein and polysaccharide concentrations in tb eps of raw sludge were 56 8 mg casein equivalent g vs and from 16 9 mg glucose equivalent g vs respectively however the contents of proteins and polysaccharides in loosely bound eps lb eps of raw sludge were measured as only 5 2 mg casein equivalent g vs and 0 7 mg glucose equivalent g vs respectively it was found that the increasing addition of cer constantly decreased the contents of ca mg in solid compositions but slightly reduced the fe contents fig s1 of supplementary materials however the cer based treatment still led to the cleavage of sludge flocs effectively which was reflected by the consistently increasing protein contents in s eps but the decreasing protein levels of lb eps and tb eps with the increasing dosage of cer fig 1 generally the polysaccharide contents also exhibited the decreasing trends for both lb eps and tb eps however the fluctuation of polysaccharide contents in sonication extracted tb eps with the increasing cer usage may reflect that the complex cations i e ca2 and mg2 had the few effects on polysaccharide accumulation in eps matrix than that of proteins the similar result was also obtained by the enzyme induced bio floc lysis in previous studies wu et al 2016b the increase in levels of s eps and lb eps should closely correlated with the solubilization of tb eps which was confirmed by pearson coefficients of 0 83 0 96 and p value 0 05 table 1 that indicated the effectiveness of cer for the spatial extension of eps in this study 3 1 2 visualizing micro spatial distribution of eps fig 2 a g shows the micromorphology of sludge flocs treated by cer similar with the previous reports mcswain et al 2005 eps distributed both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates but always acted as the most exterior layers of solid phase interacting with water molecules as displayed in the most left column of optical microscopy photographs the sludge flocs became looser with the increasing dosage of cer the dense accumulation zoogloeal could be observed in raw sludge which was featured by the red bright points of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides stained with concanavalin a and the green highlighted points of proteins fluorescently marked by fitc on contrary the cer induced migration of eps would lead to the lysis of sludge flocs as a result the fragmented flocs were the prominent features of sludge treated by 10 25 g g dm cer accordingly since the excessive fluorescent dye in aqueous phase was removed by pbs washing the fluorescence intensities of stained α d glucopyranose polysaccharides proteins and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides on the internal external surfaces surface of sludge flocs all decreased with the increasing cer addition fig 2c h this phenomenon was in accordance with the solubilization of eps but it is worth noting that the clsm images were just taken in a small imaging area 250 μm 250 μm thus the local enrichment of proteins could also be observed as the bright points fig 2h 3 2 evolution of micro physical properties of colloidal particles with spatial extension of eps the spatial extension of eps inevitably influenced the aggregation states of bio flocs which could be reflected by particle size distribution and micro morphological parameters accordingly the changes in micro structure of bio flocs would affect the steric hindrance of solid to water that could be used to partially explain the transformation of water occurrence states accompanied with the spatial extension of eps 3 2 1 surface charge properties and particle size distribution it was previously reported that the addition of multivalent metal salts e g fecl3 with 0 3 g g dm could decrease the absolute value of zeta potential of sludge colloidal particles from 20 mv to 10 mv pang et al 2020 accordingly the cer treatment enhanced the electronegativity of sludge flocs by removing the complex cations the zeta potentials of sludge particles decreased from 13 6 mv to 28 1 mv with the dosage of cer increasing from 0 to 25 g g dm fig 3 the increase in absolute value of zeta potential would enhance the electrical repulsive force of sludge particles which resulted in the cleavage of microbial colloidal aggregates and generated the small particles the mean surface diameter d 3 2 tended to be smaller with the increasing addition of cer especially from 5 to 25 g cer g dm d 3 2 and zeta potential had pearson coefficient of 0 79 with p value of 0 06 table 1 also the particle size distribution may simultaneously influence the surface area and the porosity among microbial colloidal particles which was further characterized by fractal dimension in the following section 23 2 2 fractal dimension fractal dimension df reflects the structural properties of an aggregate about space filling ability surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form zhang et al 2018 in this study df closely correlated with both zeta potential and d 3 2 table 1 which confirmed that the surface electricity determined the aggregation state of particles and would further affect the micromorphology of bio flocs with the increasing addition of cer fig 4 df constantly increased generally a higher fractal dimension means a lower space filling degree li et al 2020 moussas and zouboulis 2009 therefore the higher the fractal dimension the looser and smaller the bio flocs of was were which corresponded to the micro spatial distribution of eps observed in clsm images additionally the higher fractal dimension may stand for the greater porosity of bio flocs which should provide the more occurrence space for sterically hindered bound water e g interstitial water wu et al 2019 the effects of micro structure of bio flocs on water occurrence states are further discussed in section 3 4 3 3 evolution of solid water interactions with spatial extension of eps the cer based treatment led to the spatial extension of eps through the capture of free cations which inevitably influenced the surface properties of sludge particles accordingly the changes in surface properties of bio flocs would affect the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity that could be also used to explain the transformation of chemically bound water accompanied with the cer induced spatial extension of eps 3 3 1 solid water interfacial free energy the interfacial free energy was analyzed to characterize the water solid interactions of cer treated sludge according to derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the total interfacial free energy can be divided into two components i e an apolar van der waals based interfacial free energy and a polar or acid based interfacial free energy liu et al 2007 the apolar van der waals based interaction is caused by interatomic or intermolecular attraction among neutral atoms or molecules van oss et al 1988 based on the electron donor and electron acceptor interactions the polar or acid based interfacial free energy is closely related to hydrogen bonding interactions and structural effects i e hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure van oss 1997 also the polar interfacial free energy originates from molecules or particles with the opposite sign of charge in a polar liquid which is strongly dependent on the ionic strength near particle s surface grasso et al 2002 the cer based treatment extracted ca2 and mg2 complexing with eps but would not change the types of functional groups of eps macromolecules therefore there was no obvious variation in the apolar van der waals based interfacial free energy fig 5 on the contrary the polar or acid based interfacial free energy substantially decreased which indicated that the affinity between solid compositions and water molecules was eliminated hermansson 1999 the typical hydrophilic functional groups e g amino group nh2 and carboxylic group cooh are also the polar groups with the lone electron pair mondal and hu 2006 sterpone et al 2010 and thus could be occupied by cations as the complexing sites through coordinate covalent bonds sterpone et al 2010 cations complexed with surface functional groups could raise the osmotic pressure gradient between bulk aqueous phase and near surface area which may increase the driving force for water molecules to diffuse to hydrophilic surface and thicken the hydration layer of colloidal sludge particles fenter and lee 2014 sinha et al 2008 therefore due to the relief of the complexation between eps and metal ions the water affinity of sludge particles was weakened with the correlative analysis of fig 5 and fig s1 it could be found that the removal of 69 6 0 7 ca and 21 0 3 6 mg in eps matrix caused more than 4 fold decrease in the polar or acid based interfacial free energy the close correlations between ca mg contents and polar or acid based interfacial free energy could be also verified with pearson coefficient of 0 82 0 86 p value 0 028 0 045 those both confirmed that the complex cations played significant roles in the formation of hydration layer of eps however the fractal dimension of bio flocs should be dominated by the interactions among sludge particles instead of solid water interactions therefore there was no clear correlation among fractal dimension and solid water interfacial free energy table 1 3 3 2 viscoelastic acoustic response of water eps interactions as eps act as the most exterior layers of microbial aggregates interacting with water molecules the eps water interactions can be applied to further characterize the water holding capacities of was bio flocs in this study the spatial extension of eps matrix was mainly due to the cer removed ca2 mg2 thus the viscoelastic acoustic response of eps with and without the presence of ca2 mg2 was monitored in qcm d analysis the effect of complex cations on the water holding water repelling properties of eps matrix could be elucidated as shown in fig s2 and fig 6 a the higher shift of frequency δf and dissipation δd should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal ying et al 2010 with the prolonged injection time the gradual stabilization of frequency and dissipation indicated the saturation of crystal surface coverage by adhering eps layers the subsequent injections of ca2 and mg2 solution induced a sharp variation in both frequency and dissipation fig 6a suggesting that the added cations interacted with the eps layer formed on the crystal surface it is likely that the increased ca2 mg2 contents or positive charge density shielded the charges of the aurum surface and eps macromolecules wu et al 2018 due to the electric double layer compression and charge screening the electrostatic repulsion between the silica crystal surface and adsorbed eps layer could be decreased ying et al 2010 therefore the addition of ca2 and mg2 would lead to the denser and thicker eps layer fig 6b plotting the change in dissipation versus the change in frequency makes it possible to compare the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass gutman et al 2013 a lower δf δd value indicates buildup of a dissipative soft and fluid film on the qcm d sensor on the other hand a higher δf δd value stands for a more rigid layer gutman et al 2013 in another word due to the intermolecular interactions among water molecules and macromolecules adsorbed on sensor crystals the unit mass of hydrophilic crystal adsorbed layer could cause more energy dissipation than that of the hydrophobic crystal adsorbed layer höök et al 1998 this information may thus help elucidate the water holding capacity of eps matrix for instance an increase in the viscosity of eps layer indicated a solid water fusion system while an increase in the rigidity was suggested to be a sign of a dense water repelling system as shown in fig 6b the values of δf δd below 0 corresponded to a positive δf δd slope in the initial 90 min eps adsorption stage which stood for a gradually thickening layer of insoluble macromolecules at the injection stage of ca2 and mg2 solution the values of δf δd rose substantially which further reflected the higher elasticity of the adhering layer the above results were in accordance with the viscosity and shearing capacity calculated by voigt model as shown in fig 6c d the addition of ca2 and mg2 decreased the viscosity but increased the shearing capacity of eps adhering layers which also corresponded to the looser eps aggregation states with the increasing removal of cations by cer fig 2 3 4 mechanism insights into water state transformation resulted from spatial extension of eps due to the different affinities with the surrounding environment the transverse relaxation time t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr the water states in bio floc is based on the different binding strengths among water molecules and solid compositions therefore nmr relaxometry can be a nondestructive method that enables probing the mobility of protons in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 as shown in fig 7 the two dominant vicinal peaks and one or two minor peaks are identified in the t2 distribution spectra suggesting the existence of two major states of protons in sludge the quantification of water states was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 distribution spectra the proportion of each peak area in the total peak area represents the relative amount of corresponding water state gummerson et al 1979 according to the previous studies gussoni et al 2007 wu et al 2019 t21 should be assigned as the protons at solid state which had the extremely lower content than the protons of water molecules and had no substantial variation with the varying cer addition t22 and t23 should correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through hydrogen bound vicinal water and the water physically trapped in bio floc by steric hindrance interstitial water respectively gussoni et al 2007 vesilind 1994 wu et al 2019 the vicinal water fraction a22 fluctuated around 5 5 with cer dosage increasing from 0 to 5 g g dm however a22 decreased to 4 89 and 4 32 at the cer dosages of 10 g g dm and 25 g g dm respectively which reflected the reduction of vicinal water induced by cer enhanced surface hydrophobicity and corresponded to the decrease of polar or acid based interfacial energy measured in the above sections the interstitial water is certainly governed by the micro and macro capillary structure of bio floc water cheng et al 2018 therefore the slightly increasing trend of a23 was identified due to the more porous structure induced by cer fragmentized sludge flocs which also corresponded to the results in qcm d analysis i e the increasing water holding capacity of eps matrix could be realized without the presence of cations accordingly d 3 2 had the negative correlation with the interstitial water fraction represented by peak 3 of t2 spectra pearson correlation 0 84 and p value 0 04 table 2 also it was reasonable that df had the significant correlation pearson coefficient 0 83 p value 0 04 with the interstitial water fraction represented by peak 3 of t2 spectra table 2 because the complexity or roughness of micromorphology was just quantitatively characterized by df li et al 2020 in this study the most mobile water state was assigned to the transverse relaxation time t24 of 1000 3000 ms the relative content of t24 water fraction a24 was also extremely low 0 2 and decreased substantially with the addition of cer increasing to 0 5 g g dm that may reflect the non existence of absolutely free water in bio flocs of was lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 the mobility of the most mobile water fractions could be also influenced by the aggregation states of sludge particles or water solid interactions wu et al 2019 wu et al 2018 therefore the significant correlations among a24 total interfacial free energy polar or acid based interfacial free energy and zeta potential were determined with pearson coefficient 0 88 and p value 0 02 the slightly increasing trend of a23 was accompanied with the poorer sludge dewaterability in term of cst pearson coefficient 0 89 p value 0 02 the fragmentation of sludge flocs induced by cer based treatment increased cst from 34 4 to 187 2 s fig s3 this finding was inconsistent with the conventional cognition obtained from the previous studies working on the aops induced fragmentation of sludge flocs the radical oxidation could significantly influence the molecular compositions of eps xiao et al 2018 zhen et al 2012 therefore it was hard to determine whether the lysis of microbial colloidal aggregates or the oxidized eps dominantly contributed to the dewaterability improvement in the aops based processes according to the analysis in this study the coagulation effect of cations on sludge flocs decreased the interstitial water through the porosity reduction however on the other hand the complexation of cations with extracellular macromolecules enhanced the surface hydrophilicity through raising the polar or acid based interfacial free energy this contradictory may limit the technical efficiency of coagulation based sludge conditioning processes also the findings presented here corresponded to the dewaterability deterioration caused by anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2021 wu et al 2016b which should be attributed to loosening bio flocs of was although the fermentation may facilitate the high value re utilization of was the potential negative effects of fermentation led bio floc lysis on solid liquid separation cannot be ignored regarding the sludge dewaterability through eps modification more attention should be paid to the molecular structure denaturation for the reduction of surface hydrophilicity e g exposure of hydrophobic functional groups or oxidation removal of hydrophilic functional groups instead the excessive lysis of bio flocs should be avoided to reduce the bio floc porosity accordingly the water retaining capacity can be minimized for sludge dewaterability improvement 4 conclusion this study specifically focused on the effect of micro spatial distribution of eps on the water occurrence states of was the cer capture of cations e g ca2 and mg2 dispersed eps adhering layers and made the microbial aggregates much looser accordingly the higher df and the lower space filling degree of bio flocs could be obtained also the spatial extension of eps was accompanied with the decrease in the interfacial free energy the removal of nearly 70 ca mg in eps matrix induced 4 fold reduction in the polar or acid based interfacial free energy which reflected the significant elimination of surface hydrophilicity however the viscoelastic acoustic response of water eps interactions in qcm d analysis indicated that the water holding capacity of eps matrix could be weakened with the coagulation effect of ca2 mg2 which was supported by the decreased viscosity and the increased shearing capacity of crystal adsorbed eps layers the strong correlations rp 0 80 p value 0 04 among the interfacial free energy the particle size distribution and the different bound water fractions confirmed that the vicinal water and interstitial water were dominated by the solid water interfacial free energy and pore structure of microbial aggregates respectively the complex cations could reduce the interstitial water by coagulation of bio flocs but may also enhance the surface hydrophilicity through ionic hydration effect this contradictory may limit the technical efficiency of coagulation based sludge conditioning processes therefore more attention should be paid to the development of novel approaches that can simultaneously reduce the bio floc porosity and surface hydrophilicity for sludge dewaterability improvement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16812,substituted para benzoquinones and hydroquinones are ubiquitous transformation products that arise during oxidative water treatment of phenolic precursors for example through ozonation or chlorination the benzoquinone structural motive is associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity and also with induction of the oxidative stress response through the nrf2 pathway for either endpoint toxicological data for differently substituted compounds are scarce in this study oxidative stress response as indicated by the arec32 in vitro bioassay was induced by differently substituted para benzoquinones but also by the corresponding hydroquinones bioassays that indicate defense against genotoxicity p53re bla and dna repair activity umuc were not activated by these compounds stability tests conducted under incubation conditions but in the absence of cell lines showed that tested para benzoquinones reacted rapidly with constituents of the incubation medium compounds were abated already in phosphate buffer but even faster in biological media with reactions attributed to amino and thiol groups of peptides proteins and free amino acids the products of these reactions were often the corresponding substituted hydroquinones conversely differently substituted hydroquinones were quantitatively oxidized to p benzoquinones over the course of the incubation the observed induction of the oxidative stress response was attributed to hydroquinones that are presumably oxidized to benzoquinones inside the cells despite the instability of the tested compounds in the incubation medium the arec32 in vitro bioassay could be used as an unspecific sum parameter to detect para benzoquinones and hydroquinones in oxidatively treated waters keywords oxidative stress genotoxicity carcinogenicity electrophiles oxidation quinones 1 introduction oxidative treatment steps are applied in both drinking water and wastewater treatment with the goal of disinfection and or the abatement of organic micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 von gunten 2018 the most commonly applied oxidants in water treatment are chlorine and ozone von gunten 2018 chlorine and chloramine are among the cheapest and most widely applied chemicals for drinking water disinfection deborde and von gunten 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 but are also used for wastewater disinfection either before discharge into surface waters or in the context of water reuse winward et al 2008 ozone o3 has been applied as a disinfectant oxidant for drinking water treatment for the last 100 years von gunten and von sonntag 2012 and ozonation has been recently considered and implemented for the abatement of organic micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 lee et al 2013 2014 oxidants react with different compounds in solution including biomolecules dissolved organic matter or xenobiotic organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products these reactions do not lead to a mineralization of the targeted or non targeted reaction partners but yield oxidized transformation products deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2010 plewa and richardson 2017 richardson 2017 the latter may be a health concern as the treated waters are used for drinking water or may affect the ecosystem health in receiving freshwater bodies in this context it is unlikely that new compounds are formed that exhibit specific modes of toxicity such as estrogenicity or antibiotic activity on the contrary such specific effects are usually removed from the treated waters upon oxidation huber et al 2004 lee et al 2008 however one concern is the formation of electrophiles reactive chemicals that could eventually act in a genotoxic and consequently carcinogenic manner our recent study on the ozonation of phenolic compounds showed that substituted electrophilic p benzoquinones p bqs should be ubiquitous ozonation transformation products of phenolic precursor compounds arising from both organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom tentscher et al 2018 other products of the reactions of ozone with phenols are catechols α β unstaturated ketones and to some extent also substituted hydroquinones hqs chlorination of drinking water supplies typically yields chlorinated compounds that are of toxicological concern such as halomethanes or haloacetic acids richardson et al 2007 a recently discovered class of electrophilic disinfection byproducts are halobenzoquinones and α β unsaturated c4 dicarbonyl ring cleavage products diana et al 2019 du et al 2013 hung et al 2019 prasse et al 2020 also halobenzoquinones were found to be formed from phenolic precursor compounds wane et al 2015 as the precursors for these types of transformation products are structurally diverse the formation of an equally diverse mix of substituted p bqs hqs catechols and other α β unsaturated dienones can be expected from ozonation and chlorination these compound classes have been generally recognized as cytotoxic as well as mutagenic or carcinogenic benigni and bossa 2011 monks et al 1992 o brien 1991 no clear relationship between structure and mutagenicity or carcinogenicity can be observed mutagenicity of p bqs has been found in different salmonella strains and carcinogenicity data is scarce table s2 some hqs and catechols other possible transformation products of phenol ozonation were previously found to be weak carcinogens table s3 however other compounds in these classes did not trigger such toxicological responses both 1 2 ortho and 1 4 para quinones are listed as carcinogenic structural alerts sa by benigni and bossa 2011 this classification is based on the isscan database which lists ames mutagenicity and rodent carcinogenicity data for 11 p anthraquinones 2 p naphthoquinones and 3 p bqs unsubstituted bq bq mitomycin c and trenimon all contained in table s2 the sa is thus based chiefly on anthraquinone data and its generality is not clear along with other halogenated disinfection byproducts halogenated p bqs are suspected to cause bladder cancer diana et al 2019 dichloro and dibromobenzoquinone were shown to induce the oxidative stress response through the nrf2 pathway as well as tumor suppression activity li et al 2018 prochazka et al 2015 and thus oxidative stress might be a cause for the possible carcinogenicity of these compounds also unsubstituted p bq is known to induce the nrf2 pathway as are some diphenols tables s2 and s3 the detection of potentially mutagenic p bqs in treated water by chemical analyses is complicated by the structural diversity of this class of compounds as an alternative a sum parameter directly related to toxic effects such as in vitro bioassays is more promising the arec32 wang et al 2006 and nrf2 calux van der linden et al 2014 bioassays can be used to evaluate the toxicity of drinking water disinfection byproducts stalter et al 2016 these rather general tests rely on the cell s antioxidant response nrf2 pathway to oxidants that could eventually lead to mutagenic effects but also to any indirect activation of oxidative stress response even though this response seems quite promising for oxidative water treatment the change in nrf2 response upon ozonation of wastewater has not been explicitly studied so far volker et al 2019 nrf2 is activated by oxidation of keap1 or electrophilic attack addition on keap1 which leads to dissolution of the keap1 nrf2 complex once free nrf2 migrates to the nucleus to induce the antioxidant response element are that triggers the formation of cytoprotective enzymes in the arec32 assay a reporter gene is coupled to the are that expresses luciferase which can be detected photometrically two mechanisms are possible for the toxic effects of p bqs o brien 1991 1 arylation of e g peptides or dna direct induction of toxicity and 2 formation of reactive oxygen species ros through autooxidation and redox cycling indirect induction of toxicity both arylation of keap1 abiko and kumagai 2013 dunlap et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and oxidation of keap1 through ros such as h2o2 can activate the nrf2 covas et al 2013 erlank et al 2011 fourquet et al 2010 some structurally simple p bqs have been shown to activate nrf2 table s2 abiko and kumagai 2013 abiko et al 2011 erlank et al 2011 rubio et al 2011 from general chemical considerations p bqs are α β unsaturated ketones a structural motive known to react with nucleophiles through michael addition addition reactions of unsubstituted bq have been shown for amines thiols and related biomolecules such as amino acids and proteins morrison et al 1969 e g albumin in blood serum ghosh et al 2012 cytochrome fisher et al 2007 human topoisomerase iialpha bender et al 2007 or dna nucleobases gaskell et al 2004 xie et al 2005 the result of these reductive addition reactions are substituted hqs urano et al 1994 also found for less electrophilic compounds such as t butyl p bq hqs can be oxidized to p bqs and undergo further addition reactions e g a bq monothioether can still bind to cytochrome person et al 2005 under oxic conditions autooxidation of hqs and subsequent additions to the resulting p bqs leads to increasingly substituted p bqs hqs in the case of glutathione gsh as a nucleophile eventually four gsh molecules can be added to one bq baigi et al 2008 hqs are not electrophilic per se however structurally simple diphenols hqs and catechols dinkova kostova and wang 2011 erlank et al 2011 rubio et al 2011 or complex marjan et al 2021 na and surh 2008 patel and maru 2013 polyphenols that contain diphenolic moieties are also known to activate the nrf2 pathway table s3 considering that diphenols such as hq can auto oxidize to p bqs the observed toxicity could be ascribed to p bqs formed in situ the finding that oxidation of differently substituted hqs by cu ii wang et al 2010 enhances the nrf2 arec32 activity supports this argument both hq and catechol were found to bind to guanine and thymine in the presence of cu ii attributed to their oxidation to the corresponding p o bqs hirakawa et al 2002 also dna adducts from dosed hqs have been found tozlovanu et al 2006 and were attributed to addition after auto oxidation of hqs other studies found similar are luc a bioassay also testing the nrf2 pathway activity for hq and bq in human bronchial epithelial cells rubio et al 2011 a result that might be explained by oxidation of dosed hqs to p bqs a second indirect toxic mode of action is constituted by ros such as h2o2 and superoxide radical anion these can be formed from redox processes involving p bqs and hqs as a redox couple also possible for o bq catechol and can in turn induce an oxidative stress response the autooxidation of hqs to p bqs yields h2o2 as a ros futile redox cycling through reduction by the two electron quinone oxidoreductase nqo1 can transform quinones to their diphenolic form shown for menadione ross et al 2000 or through the reaction with ascorbate morrison et al 1969 which reduces p bqs back to their hq forms leading to more h2o2 upon re oxidation semiquinone radicals ho ph o can be formed through the con proportionation of a hq p bq redox couple hq p bq 2 ho ph o eyer 1991 or through an enzymatic one electron reduction of a p bq o brien 1991 and the radical can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide radical anion as an additional ros concurrent modes of action are possible direct and indirect induction of toxicity as shown for menadione a naphthoquinone that causes cytotoxicity through both arylation and redox cycling chung et al 1999 seung et al 1998 cytotoxicity was found to increase when menadione was allowed to react with plasma proteins in the incubation medium which was attributed to more efficient redox cycling of the conjugated species and prompted the development of a medium free protocol seung et al 1998 there is little data on the toxic potency and reactivity of differently substituted hqs and p bqs here a variety of commercially available model compounds comprising both p bqs and hqs were tested for the response of the arec32 bioassay this is a rather unspecific test for oxidative stress probing the activation of the nrf2 pathway which can be an initial cause for carcinogenicity robertson et al 2020 for selected compounds we also tested for effects that are more closely related to eventual carcinogenic effects that might follow from oxidative stress the umuc dna repair activity and the p53re bla tumor suppression bioassays since p bqs are also reactive towards nucleophiles that may be present in biological media we investigated the abatement of p bqs and hqs in different reaction media phosphate buffered saline pbs amino acids and fetal bovine serum fbs mimicking incubation conditions such reactions may lead to products that have different toxicological properties compared to the parent compounds it has been shown for 2 6 dicl p benzoquinone that pre incubation in buffer or in amino acids reduces the cytotoxicity towards human colon epithelial cells and liver carcinoma cells hung et al 2019 an effect attributed to the conjugation of the parent compound to molecules in the medium for structurally diverse p bqs it is so far unclear which role such reactions play during incubation conditions of in vitro bioassays such as the arec32 bioassay and what type of reaction products are prevalent under these conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 list of chemicals a list of p bqs and hqs used as test compounds in this study is provided in fig 1 a complete list of chemicals suppliers and purities is given in the supporting information si table s1 and the physicochemical properties are given in table s4 2 2 in vitro bioassays 2 2 1 arec32 in vitro bioassay the arec32 reporter cell line is based on the mcf7 breast cancer cell line with a gene encoding for luciferase attached wang et al 2006 and was obtained by courtesy of c roland wolf cancer research uk the arec32 assay was performed in dmem glutamax with 10 fbs standard protocol or 1 fbs escher et al 2012 brought to a 384 well plate format neale et al 2017 all p bqs hqs were weighted in brown vials and stored under argon if indicated on the packaging on the day of the experiment the compounds were directly dissolved in the bioassay medium to a concentration four times higher than the highest concentration in the bioassay in a so called dosing vial that was vortexed to facilitate dissolution the resulting compound concentration in this stock solution was 40 µm the preparation of the dosing vials took up to 30 min fourteen dosing vials were then stacked on a robot tray together with two vials of positive control tbu hq and used to prepare serial or linear dilutions in medium in a dosing plate using a pipetting robot hamilton microlab star bonaduz switzerland that subsequently transferred 10 µl of the dosing plate into a cell plate containing cells and 30 µl medium using a 96 tip pipet head the workflow of dosing is described in escher et al 2019a and lasts approximately 20 to 25 min hence the dosed chemicals were in contact with the medium for up to 1 h before incubation with cells started the initial experiments using medium with 10 fbs were range finders for the activation of are and these experiments were only used to derive the cytotoxicity ic10 inhibitory concentrations causing 10 of reduction of cell viability quantified by the presto blue thermo fisher scientific a13261 according to neale et al 2017 because the activation of are proved to be too variable data not shown the ic50 were derived from a plot of logarithmic concentrations against cell viability using a log logistic concentration response model eq 1 with the conversion from the fitted ic50 to ic10 by eq 2 1 cytotoxicity

non cytotoxic concentrations two sets of experiments were run with 10 standard conditions and 1 fbs each in two independent repeats the ecir1 5 is the concentration of a compound at which the induction of the reporter cell line was 50 higher than that of the unexposed cells escher et al 2012 the ecir1 5 and its standard error se ecir1 5 were deduced with eqs 3 and 4 from slopes of the

the arec32 assay the commercially available cellsensor p53re bla hct 116 cell based assay developed by invitrogen was used in this project to measure the p53 activation according to the protocol provided by invitrogen with an extended incubation period of 48 h stalter et al 2016 none of the tested compounds were found to induce p53 activity the results of initial dosing experiments were used to derive cytotoxicity ic10 values since there was no activation of p53 detected no linear repeats were run 2 2 3 umuc umuc nm8001 in vitro bioassay umuc and umuc nm8001 takamura enya et al 2011 more sensitive to oxidative dna damage obtained by courtesy of prof yoshimitsu oda were tested for unsubstituted umuc and also substituted umuc nm8001 hqs and p bqs in the absence of the s9 enzyme mix no activation was observed below cytotoxic concentrations text s1 si 2 3 stability experiments in the components of the incubation medium the incubation medium used for the arec32 bioassay consists of dulbecco s modified eagle medium dmem and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs in a carbonate buffer system ph 7 4 maintained by a co2 atmosphere in this medium nucleophiles that can potentially react with p bqs are ho amino acids contained in dmem and protein bound thiol groups in fbs to evaluate their respective influence on p bq and hq stability abatement experiments were performed without reporter cell lines in pbs ho dmem in carbonate buffer amino acids and fbs buffered in pbs thiol groups mimicking the incubation conditions the different approaches are sketched in fig 2 after spiking p bqs into pbs fig 2a or dmem fig 2b samples were taken over the course of 24 h and stabilized by acidification for the reactions with thiols contained in fbs the kinetic timeframe for the abatement of three selected p bqs bq me bq 2 6 dime bq was established with an on line photometric experiment fig 2c based on these results batch experiments were performed by adding p bqs to either fbs or gsh as a substitute source of thiols sampled over 60 min fig 2d residual concentrations of p bqs and hqs were measured by hplc dad all experimental details are described in text s2 si the photostability of p bqs and hqs is briefly discussed in text s5 si 2 4 quantification of reactive sulfide groups in fbs p bqs can react with thiol groups stemming from cysteine moieties in fbs for a meaningful comparison to gsh concentrations the concentrations of sulfide groups in fbs were quantified photometrically in a quartz cuvette fbs solutions 5 and 10 were prepared in 70 mm pbs ph 7 4 containing 1 mm edta to a final volume of 3 ml 100 µl of a 2 mm solution of ellman s reagent dtnb 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid were spiked into the stirred cuvette absorption was monitored at 412 nm and an extinction coefficient of 14 150 m 1 cm 1 was used to quantify tnb2 the monomeric form of dtnb which is formed from its reaction with thiols after subtracting a background spectrum of fbs as the absorption at 412 nm kept increasing time series of 60 min were recorded the concentration of tnb2 monomer was equated to the concentration of reactive sulfide groups in solution control experiments with gsh as a source of free sulfides were also performed 2 5 hplc analysis of p bqs and hqs bqs and hqs were quantified by hplc dad agilent 1100 using external standards the compounds were separated with two different setups 1 on a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii 3 0 100 mm 5 μm hplc column at 30 c with a flux of 600 µl min and 2 on a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii 3 0 150 mm 5 µm at 30 c with a flux of 800 µl min depending on the analytes isocratic conditions 10 meoh 90 h2o or 90 0 1 h3po4 were maintained for up to 4 min then the meoh concentration was increased to 50 or 75 within 3 5 min injection volumes were 40 100 µl 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of p bqs and hqs in medium limited reproducibility of arec32 test results was observed together with similar cyto toxicity for p bqs and their corresponding hqs since functional groups amine thiol are potentially reacting with p bqs this prompted us to test the stability of p bqs and hqs in the incubation media mimicking incubation conditions three degradation modes hydrolysis pbs reaction with amines dmem reaction with thiols fbs gsh can be proposed and were tested according to fig 2 an additional experiment determined the concentration of accessible reactive thiols in fbs 3 1 1 pbs and dmem concentration profiles for the selected p bqs and hqs determined by hplc are shown in fig 3 in pbs compounds behave differently depending on substitution pattern and compound type all hqs were readily abated and formation of the corresponding p bq was observed in most cases conversely alkyl p bqs were relatively stable in pbs whereas other p bqs were abated over the course of hours down to few minutes cl bq with dicl bq no longer detectable minutes after spiking and dibr bq degrading even faster preventing meaningful quantification no time series shown for these compounds for these highly unstable p bqs the corresponding hqs were detected dicl bq or presumed dibr bq based on hplc retention time and optical spectrum products of these reactions in dmem hqs were abated similarly as in pbs however there was less formation of corresponding p bqs as a product the reason for this can be seen in the concentration profiles when p bqs were spiked the abatement of p bqs in dmem was more rapid compared to pbs and some of them mostly degraded in the first minutes of incubation in contrast to pbs alkylated p bqs were readily degraded in dmem with the exception of 2 6 dime bq the observed transformations of hqs and p bqs can be explained by their known patterns of reactivity unsubstituted hq can auto oxidize to form bq and h2o2 eyer 1991 la mer and rideal 1924 monks et al 1992 song and buettner 2010 shown in fig 4a this reaction is ph dependent and in the presence of bq it proceeds through a semiquinone radical anion pathway eyer 1991 song and buettner 2010 leading to overall complex kinetics for holding times of 24 h the substituted hqs were generally consumed to 100 and only the unsubstituted hq remained at about 50 fig 3a the product of these reactions is the corresponding p bq which is stable in buffer only in some cases as discussed below p bqs are electrophilic α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds which are susceptible to michael addition of nucleophiles to the c c bond this reductive addition yields a hq with the nucleophile as an additional substituent fig 4b pairs of hqs and p bqs but also catechols and the corresponding 1 2 benzoquinones can undergo redox cross reactions to reach a thermodynamically more stable redox state fig 4c uchimiya and stone 2006 a reductive addition to a p bq can always be followed by a redox cross reaction the resulting substituted hq is more electron rich than the hq that bears the same substituents as the parent p bq consequently it is thermodynamically favorable to oxidize the substituted hq to a substituted p bq and in turn to reduce a parent p bq to a correspondingly substituted hq fig 5 the expected stoichiometry for these reactions is that for each parent p bq reacting with a nucleophile an additional p bq is reduced to a hq hence two parent p bq molecules react to one additionally substituted p bq and one hq with the same substitution pattern as the parent i e the yield of each of the two products is 0 5 in terms of consumed p bq the different tested solutions pbs dmem fbs contain nucleophiles of different strength in different concentrations in phosphate buffer the only considerable nucleophile is ho we interpret that this species is responsible for the abatement of p bqs in phosphate buffered solutions reductive hydrolysis for the unsubstituted compounds some kinetic details are known at room temperature such as the second order rate constant of the initial attack of the hydroxide ion to p bq eigen and matthies 1961 and the second order rate constant of the redox cross reaction between the resulting trihydroxybenzene anion and p bq uchimiya and stone 2006 von sonntag et al 2004 from the known kinetic data at room temperature and omitting the resulting hydroxybenzoquinone as a nucleophile we can estimate the half life of unsubstituted bq at ph 7 4 to be 7 days this reaction appears to be greatly accelerated at 37 c to a half life of about 10 h fig 3b a higher reactivity of a p bq with electron withdrawing substituents can be expected with a nucleophile in contrast alkylation should slow down reductive hydrolysis through an inductive effect i but potentially also through steric hindrance this seems to be the case for reaction with ho as the alkylated p bqs me bq tbu bq 2 6 dime bq are at most slightly degraded over the reaction time of about 20 h fig 3n p r the opposite effect faster reaction can be expected in the presence of electron withdrawing substituents cl bq degrades more quickly in phosphate buffer compared to unsubstituted bq this is even more pronounced for 2 6 dicl bq which vanishes completely within minutes following this argument meo bq should be more stable compared to bq owing to a mesomeric electron donation m effect of the methoxy group but was found less stable instead the increased reactivity of meo bq is supported by a quantum chemical analysis text s3 dmem contains high concentrations mm range of different amino acids these amino groups react as nucleophiles with p bqs a reaction that is exploited with unsubstituted bq as a colorimetric assay for the presence of amino groups benson and spillane 1976 hikosaka 1970 moxon and slifkin 1972 neutral amines are stronger nucleophiles than ho and are able to also react with the alkylated p bqs the exception was 2 6 dime bq which was also mostly stable under these conditions possibly owing to a stronger i effect or increased steric hindrance reductive addition to amines consumed most of the tested p bqs rapidly within few minutes to one hour the auto oxidation of hqs should not be affected by dmem the slightly faster abatement of hqs in dmem compared to pbs can be attributed to slight variations in ph ph measurements of dmem taken out of the incubator yielded ph values of up to 7 6 compared to the target ph of 7 4 that was maintained in experiments employing phosphate buffer in dmem the auto oxidation of hqs did not lead to a build up of p bqs as these are consumed rapidly by their reactions with amino groups 3 1 2 kinetic experiments in fbs experiments were performed with unsubstituted mono and dimethylated p bqs to cover a wide range of reactivity in 5 fbs solution in pbs these compounds were selected since they had lower reactivities in dmem with 2 6 dime bq being mostly stable in dmem these compounds can indicate whether compounds which are stable in dmem can still be abated in the presence of fbs overall the decrease of measured absorption was rapid fig 6 after 10 min it had decreased by 40 bq 25 me bq and 15 dime bq if the loss of absorption was directly proportional to the loss in concentration of the p bqs this would correspond to drops in concentrations between 6 and 15 µm but the observation might be masked by interference of products discussed below nevertheless these experiments established a time range of the initial reactions with some very high reactivity in the first 15 min an instantaneous concentration drop for bq followed by slower reactions thereafter both getting less important with substitution we noted that also h2o2 a potential product of redox cycling in the presence of reporter cells degrades in an fbs solution with 50 degradation of a 40 μm solution in 5 fbs in 100 min data not shown 3 1 3 quantification of reactive sulfides in fbs to compare the degradation of p bqs to the content of accessible sulfides in fbs solutions fbs solutions in phosphate buffer were tested with ellman s reagent there were approximately 20 µm of fast reacting sulfide groups in a 10 fbs solution typically used for arec32 incubation fig s3 for the determination of e g gsh with ellman s reagent the concentration of tnb2 is usually determined after a reaction time of 10 min however fbs contains a mix of several proteins it can be hypothesized that the reaction kinetics are determined by the accessibility of the individual thiol groups the cysteine units at the different proteins surfaces react immediately whereas those further inside the protein require diffusion of dtnb to these reactive sites as dtnb is roughly twice the size of a p bq it can be expected that benzoquinones react faster in comparison as cysteine moieties hard to access by dtnb are reached more easily by a smaller p bq 3 1 4 batch experiments to test the abatement of p bqs in presence of fbs or gsh batch experiments were conducted in pbs control experiment and in 5 fbs or in 10 µm gsh the results are shown as time series in fig 7 the abatement of p bqs was clearly more rapid during the first 15 min the first sampling point for both fbs and gsh hq formation was observed when gsh was spiked the yield of hq was around 0 5 mol mol of the consumed parent p bq while the consumption of the parent p bq was 1 7 2 0 mol mol of added gsh expected value of 2 0 for fbs addition the measured hq yields were 0 4 0 6 mol mol of consumed parent p bq for unsubstituted p bq and me p bq expected yield of 0 5 for 2 6 dime bq the hq yield was reduced to 0 2 when measured within 24 h of the experiment however when the acidified samples were re measured 30 h after the experiment an increased hq yield of 0 4 was found conversely in the experiments conducted with a higher fbs p bq ratio 10 fbs 10 µm p bq no residual parent p bq could be detected and only for 2 6 dime bq the corresponding hq could be detected with a molar yield of 0 05 for unsubstituted bq hq co eluted in the hplc with chromophoric elements of the fbs matrix and a yield of 0 05 could have gone undetected compared to the amino acids in dmem e g 1 h to decrease the concentration of me bq by 50 these reactions are very fast few minutes redox cross reactions should also happen after the reaction of p bqs with thiol groups and lead to substituted hqs in batch experiments where an excess of p bqs was dosed however in batch experiments where p bqs were dosed under stoichiometrically no or only little formation of hqs was observed we interpret that the reductive addition to p bqs kinetically outcompetes the redox cross reaction in these cases which is not the case for amino acids the continued degradation of unsubstituted bq after 15 min fig 7a could be caused either by the reaction of bq with the amino groups of free amino acids contained in fbs or by continued reaction with cysteine groups that are more difficult to access but are still accessible especially to the smaller unsubstituted bq the fact that the hq yield for 2 6 dime bq is initially very low likely indicates that redox cross reactions are sterically hindered we interpret the increase of the 2 6 dime hq yield in the samples after an additional holding time as continued redox cross reactions a preliminary run of this experiment yielded comparable data but lacks the artefactual increase of the me bq concentration in the control experiment of fig 7b si text s4 fig s4 1 3 2 in vitro bioassays different in vitro bioassays were probed for their response to commercially available substituted hqs and p bqs under standard incubation conditions the main focus was on the arec32 bioassay for oxidative stress which was induced by almost all compounds tested other bioassays targeting genotoxicity p53 geneblazer and umuc umuc nm8001 were not responding to the tested compounds before cytotoxic concentrations were reached 3 2 1 cytotoxicity inhibitory concentrations for 10 cytotoxicity ic10 were derived from initial concentration response experiments performed for the arec32 and p53re bla bioassays table s5 and were found to be within 10 5 10 4 m for most compounds and fairly similar between the arec32 and the p53 cell lines fig 8a the ratios of ic10 of p bqs and corresponding hqs ranged from 0 23 to 3 4 for arec32 and 0 16 to 3 2 for p53 fig 8b with the geometric mean close to 1 indicating that there are no clear sensitivity differences between the p bqs and hqs despite the fast degradation and loss of the parent compound the cytotoxicity was higher than predicted by the baseline toxicity qsar escher et al 2019b for the parent compound based on the partition constant between membrane lipids and water k lipw fig s4a the excess toxicity can be described by the toxic ratio tr maeder et al 2004 verhaar et al 1996 for meo bq the tr was over 300 fig s4b and tr decreased with increasing k lipw indicating that despite degradation the cytotoxicity was highly specific as expected for reactive chemicals stalter et al 2016 3 2 2 arec32 activation ecir1 5 values ranged from 10 6 to 3 10 5 m fig 9a table s5 and a number of chemicals tbu bq 2 6 di tbu bq meo hq did not show any activity in the range finders up to ic10 and were therefore not tested in the linear concentration response curve the reproducibility of experiments was not as good as for more stable compounds that we have tested in other projects or environmental samples escher et al 2013 the low repeatability of the presently investigated hqs and p bqs is most likely not caused by the performance of the bioassay but rather by some variability in the time required for sample preparation and dosing this hypothesis is supported by the high reproducibility that was achieved for tbu hq which is regularly used as reference compound in the arec32 reporter cell line it was always diluted as the last sample just before starting the automated preparation of the dose response curves followed by the transfer of the dilutions to the cell plate therefore the holding time was the shortest in this case from previous experiments we know that the ecir1 5 for tbu hq is much more variable if the handling of tbu hq during sample preparation is varied in the present study the ecir1 5 of tbu hq was 1 56 µm and in 40 independent experiments over two years the ecir1 5 varied between 1 27 and 3 43 µm with a mean of 2 22 and a coefficient of variation of 30 since h2o2 is formed during autoxidation of hqs to p bq we also determined the ecir1 5 of h2o2 which was 0 24 0 02 mm in presence of 10 fbs and 0 27 0 03 mm in presence of 1 fbs 3 3 impacts of reactions with the medium on the activation of arec32 the likely route of activation of the arec32 bioassay by substituted p bqs is the reaction with a thiol group of the keap1 protein that activates the nrf2 pathway in turn hqs are not electrophilic but are electron rich compounds and should not react as electrophiles and should thus not directly induce the arec32 assay since we showed that in experiments mimicking incubation conditions hqs are quantitatively oxidized to p bqs and since hqs have been previously reported to auto oxidize to p bqs and h2o2 eyer 1991 la mer and rideal 1924 monks et al 1992 song and buettner 2010 both p bqs and h2o2 could be responsible for the observed arec32 activation conversely we showed that in 10 fbs dosed p bqs were rapidly consumed and the same has to be expected for p bqs formed in situ from auto oxidation of hqs when the dosed p bqs were initially diluted in the dosing vials containing 10 fbs compounds 40 μm are in excess of thiol groups 20 30 μm a fast reaction leading to conjugated hqs and parent hqs with a yield of up to 0 5 has to be expected in 1 fbs p bqs are in large excess of thiol groups in the dosing vial and the main sink are slower reactions with free amino acids the timescale of these reactions depended strongly on the compound fig 3 fig 7 however these reactions will continue to produce hqs with a yield of 0 5 as the dilution procedure and the incubation progresses these hqs with or without s r or nh r substitution can enter the reporter cells however it should be considered that binding to a voluminous protein may prevent passing the cell membrane for more hydrophobic neutral and charged chemicals uptake kinetics into arec32 were previously found to depend on the fbs concentration and completed for neutral chemicals within 4 h and were slower for charged organic molecules fischer et al 2018 while arec32 has very little constitutively expressed cyp1a1 and accordingly no p450 cyp1 activity cyp1a1 can be activated by chemical exposure as has been shown with benzo a pyrene fischer et al 2020 we showed that during the first 1 and 2 h of the incubation most hqs are quantitatively auto oxidized to the corresponding p bqs fig 3 as the timescales of auto oxidation and cellular uptake are similar we propose that a fraction hqs could enter the cells unchanged and could be auto oxidized there whereas another fraction undergoes extracellular auto oxidation this should be followed by a rapid quantitative reaction with thiol groups of fbs which are in large excess when a final dilution around the ecir1 5 concentration is reached in 10 fbs no redox cross reactions are expected in this case fig 9b shows that the ratio of ecir1 5 bq ecir1 5 hq was around 1 5 2 5 for four hq p bq pairs that is the dosed hqs induced a stronger antioxidant response because they had a lower ecir1 5 this is compatible with the above interpretation that p bqs resulting from oxidation inside the cell are ultimately responsible for the toxic effects dosed p bqs are rapidly consumed to yield either hqs at a lower concentration or additionally substituted p bqs or hqs in contrast dosed hqs auto oxidize on a slower time scale compared to the reaction of p bqs with the medium and can diffuse into the cells without prior reaction with the incubation medium intracellular hqs can then autoxidize or be transformed to p bqs and can activate the nrf2 pathway by arylation or react with other intracellular nucleophiles such as gsh in a scenario where a p bq was dosed and underwent reductive addition with the formation of a substituted hq the parent hq yield is maximally 0 5 and thus the concentration of toxicologically active compound is reduced also substituted hqs that result from the reductive addition of thiols or amines to parent p bqs can be oxidized to substituted p bqs owing to the electron donating nature of the s r and nh r substituents these should be less electrophilic compared to the parent p bqs both effects offer an explanation as to why hqs yield lower ecir1 5 although these effects were only minor when comparing experiments in 10 fbs to 1 fbs we can consider that these contain 20 µm and 2 µm of fast reacting sh groups respectively the effect of fbs content on ecir1 5 concentrations was most pronounced for 2 6 dime bq 2 6 dime hq fig 9 the only tested compound that was mostly stable in dmem while all other p bqs were also abated by amino acids 2 6 dime bq reacted only with sh groups in fbs in experiments with 1 fbs a larger fraction of 2 6 dime bq can enter the cell before undergoing reductive addition and react with the thiol group of keap1 3 4 validity of bioassay results and implications for the toxicity of bqs and hqs our interpretation of the degradation experiments is that using the standard incubation condition 10 fbs only hqs are stable enough to enter the reporter cells and are auto oxidized inside the cell on a timescale of few hours the arec32 activation experienced when dosing hqs is thus that of corresponding p bqs it is tempting to integrate over the hq degradation to arrive at an effective exposure of the reporter cells to the p bqs however as the p bqs resulting from auto oxidation outside and inside the cells or enzymatic oxidation inside the cells should be consumed rapidly it is unclear how the actual exposure concentration time to these chemicals should be defined in terms of toxic potency the derived ecir1 5 for hqs could be interpreted as lower limits to the ecir1 5 values of the corresponding p bqs however also substituted hqs and substituted p bqs through autooxidation can contribute to the observed toxicity in case of dosed p bqs the identity of the active molecules is less clear as the products of reductive additions are likely the source of electrophiles auto oxidation of hqs always yields h2o2 as a byproduct 40 μm h2o2 reached 50 abatement after 100 min in a 5 fbs solution data not shown and was 1 2 orders of magnitude less potent than the tested p bqs hqs fig 9a if h2o2 were responsible for the observed arec32 activation it would have to be produced with a yield of 10 100 mol mol of the dosed parent compounds which appears unlikely for unsubstituted hq one could go through four stages of increasingly substituted hqs and the molar yield of h2o2 could be 5 at most assuming that increasingly substituted p bqs remain susceptible to further reductive addition also if h2o2 was the active species the pronounced effect of fbs concentration on the ecir1 5 of 2 6 dime hq 2 6 dime bq could not be explained the ecir1 5 of the hq was lower by a factor of 2 compared to the p bq fig 9b this is compatible with the hq formed through reductive addition and a redox cross reaction with a yield of 0 5 being the reactive species in case of redox cycling as the dominant mode of action no pronounced differences in ecir1 5 of a p bq hq pair should be expected this notion is supported by a study that reports the generation of h2o2 by tbu hq in the growth medium dmem with 10 fbs in the absence of cells erlank et al 2011 within one hour h2o2 was found to be present in about the same stoichiometry as the dosed tbu hq in the presence of astrocytes the h2o2 yield in the medium was reduced to 25 of the dosed tbu hq concentration which the authors attributed to detoxification mechanisms of the astrocytes p bqs dosed directly or created in situ can also be expected to add rapidly to gsh or similar cell constituents in contrast h2o2 formation inside the cell should cause the formation of gssg no increased gssg levels were found upon the treatment with unsubstituted bq in a medium free dosing on blood cell platelets seung et al 1998 for dimethylnaphthoquinone a pure redox cycler and thus intracellular producer of h2o2 increased gssg levels were reported however in vivo the xenobiotics will have to travel through biological medium e g blood cytoplasma potentially leading to conjugates before entering a cell overall the question of the importance of redox cycling in the toxic mechanisms of substituted p bqs cannot be answered in a general manner based on the present data and may be compound specific in the case of halobenzoquinones the reactions with amino acids may be so rapid and nonselective that only conjugated species are toxicologically relevant and even unsubstituted p bq is degraded within minutes in dmem while alkylation protects the p bq to some extent this may indicate that in many cases conjugated p bqs are the active species that were assessed by the arec32 bioassay as these are still capable of michael reactions as well as redox cycling invoking this argument and assuming that arylation is the toxic mechanism the toxicity gradient bq cl bq dicl bq can be rationalized the more electrophilic species readily react to less electrophilic monoconjugates which then are weaker electrophiles than the parent compound 3 5 toxicity of hqs and bqs assessed by different bioassays in addition to the arec32 bioassay which tests the antioxidant stress response we also performed bioassays that should be more specific to genotoxicity and dna damage however the compounds did not induce a response in the p53 bioassay or the umuc nm8001 bioassay in this variant of the umuc assay dna repair activity certain detoxification mechanisms have been removed making it more sensitive to oxidative stress the incubation media of both the umuc and p53 bioassays contain nucleophiles capable of reacting with p bqs the umuc bioassay employs a casein digest a protein mix and tryptone amino acids the p53 bioassay was carried out in mccoys 5a medium which contains gsh as well as an fbs supplement although no p53 or umuc activation was found potential activity below cytotoxic concentrations may have been masked by reaction of p bqs with the incubation medium the situation would be similar in real water samples that are freeze dried and resuspended in incubation medium prior to toxicological tests 4 conclusions in oxidative water treatment p bqs and hqs are ubiquitous transformation products arising from phenolic precursors in vitro bioassays are a potential tool for the detection of these compound classes in treated waters here different bioassays were tested for their response to a structurally diverse set of model compounds along with the substances stability in typically used incubation media components out of the tested standard bioassays only the arec32 bioassay responded to almost all model compounds with ecir1 5 around 10 4 to 10 6 m all tested compounds were found to be unstable during standard incubation conditions of the arec32 bioassay this was attributed to the autooxidation of hqs to p bqs and to the reductive addition of nucleophiles amino and thiol groups to p bqs reactions with the incubation medium lead to a structurally diverse mix of additionally substituted p bqs and hqs the observed ecir1 5 values do not necessarily indicate the toxic potency of the different target substances virtually all p bqs and hqs yielded high toxic ratios for cytotoxicity and ecir1 5 meaning that this bioassay still responds specifically to these compound classes for applications in water quality it should be kept in mind that the arec32 bioassay is a rather general test of the oxidative stress response and will respond to other types of compounds as well although the rapid reactions of p bqs with biomolecules were observed at the elevated temperature of the bioassay incubation these reactions are likely also happening in a biological post filtration step leading to an abatement of initially formed p bqs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16812,substituted para benzoquinones and hydroquinones are ubiquitous transformation products that arise during oxidative water treatment of phenolic precursors for example through ozonation or chlorination the benzoquinone structural motive is associated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity and also with induction of the oxidative stress response through the nrf2 pathway for either endpoint toxicological data for differently substituted compounds are scarce in this study oxidative stress response as indicated by the arec32 in vitro bioassay was induced by differently substituted para benzoquinones but also by the corresponding hydroquinones bioassays that indicate defense against genotoxicity p53re bla and dna repair activity umuc were not activated by these compounds stability tests conducted under incubation conditions but in the absence of cell lines showed that tested para benzoquinones reacted rapidly with constituents of the incubation medium compounds were abated already in phosphate buffer but even faster in biological media with reactions attributed to amino and thiol groups of peptides proteins and free amino acids the products of these reactions were often the corresponding substituted hydroquinones conversely differently substituted hydroquinones were quantitatively oxidized to p benzoquinones over the course of the incubation the observed induction of the oxidative stress response was attributed to hydroquinones that are presumably oxidized to benzoquinones inside the cells despite the instability of the tested compounds in the incubation medium the arec32 in vitro bioassay could be used as an unspecific sum parameter to detect para benzoquinones and hydroquinones in oxidatively treated waters keywords oxidative stress genotoxicity carcinogenicity electrophiles oxidation quinones 1 introduction oxidative treatment steps are applied in both drinking water and wastewater treatment with the goal of disinfection and or the abatement of organic micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 von gunten 2018 the most commonly applied oxidants in water treatment are chlorine and ozone von gunten 2018 chlorine and chloramine are among the cheapest and most widely applied chemicals for drinking water disinfection deborde and von gunten 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 but are also used for wastewater disinfection either before discharge into surface waters or in the context of water reuse winward et al 2008 ozone o3 has been applied as a disinfectant oxidant for drinking water treatment for the last 100 years von gunten and von sonntag 2012 and ozonation has been recently considered and implemented for the abatement of organic micropollutants in secondary wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 lee et al 2013 2014 oxidants react with different compounds in solution including biomolecules dissolved organic matter or xenobiotic organic compounds such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products these reactions do not lead to a mineralization of the targeted or non targeted reaction partners but yield oxidized transformation products deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2010 plewa and richardson 2017 richardson 2017 the latter may be a health concern as the treated waters are used for drinking water or may affect the ecosystem health in receiving freshwater bodies in this context it is unlikely that new compounds are formed that exhibit specific modes of toxicity such as estrogenicity or antibiotic activity on the contrary such specific effects are usually removed from the treated waters upon oxidation huber et al 2004 lee et al 2008 however one concern is the formation of electrophiles reactive chemicals that could eventually act in a genotoxic and consequently carcinogenic manner our recent study on the ozonation of phenolic compounds showed that substituted electrophilic p benzoquinones p bqs should be ubiquitous ozonation transformation products of phenolic precursor compounds arising from both organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom tentscher et al 2018 other products of the reactions of ozone with phenols are catechols α β unstaturated ketones and to some extent also substituted hydroquinones hqs chlorination of drinking water supplies typically yields chlorinated compounds that are of toxicological concern such as halomethanes or haloacetic acids richardson et al 2007 a recently discovered class of electrophilic disinfection byproducts are halobenzoquinones and α β unsaturated c4 dicarbonyl ring cleavage products diana et al 2019 du et al 2013 hung et al 2019 prasse et al 2020 also halobenzoquinones were found to be formed from phenolic precursor compounds wane et al 2015 as the precursors for these types of transformation products are structurally diverse the formation of an equally diverse mix of substituted p bqs hqs catechols and other α β unsaturated dienones can be expected from ozonation and chlorination these compound classes have been generally recognized as cytotoxic as well as mutagenic or carcinogenic benigni and bossa 2011 monks et al 1992 o brien 1991 no clear relationship between structure and mutagenicity or carcinogenicity can be observed mutagenicity of p bqs has been found in different salmonella strains and carcinogenicity data is scarce table s2 some hqs and catechols other possible transformation products of phenol ozonation were previously found to be weak carcinogens table s3 however other compounds in these classes did not trigger such toxicological responses both 1 2 ortho and 1 4 para quinones are listed as carcinogenic structural alerts sa by benigni and bossa 2011 this classification is based on the isscan database which lists ames mutagenicity and rodent carcinogenicity data for 11 p anthraquinones 2 p naphthoquinones and 3 p bqs unsubstituted bq bq mitomycin c and trenimon all contained in table s2 the sa is thus based chiefly on anthraquinone data and its generality is not clear along with other halogenated disinfection byproducts halogenated p bqs are suspected to cause bladder cancer diana et al 2019 dichloro and dibromobenzoquinone were shown to induce the oxidative stress response through the nrf2 pathway as well as tumor suppression activity li et al 2018 prochazka et al 2015 and thus oxidative stress might be a cause for the possible carcinogenicity of these compounds also unsubstituted p bq is known to induce the nrf2 pathway as are some diphenols tables s2 and s3 the detection of potentially mutagenic p bqs in treated water by chemical analyses is complicated by the structural diversity of this class of compounds as an alternative a sum parameter directly related to toxic effects such as in vitro bioassays is more promising the arec32 wang et al 2006 and nrf2 calux van der linden et al 2014 bioassays can be used to evaluate the toxicity of drinking water disinfection byproducts stalter et al 2016 these rather general tests rely on the cell s antioxidant response nrf2 pathway to oxidants that could eventually lead to mutagenic effects but also to any indirect activation of oxidative stress response even though this response seems quite promising for oxidative water treatment the change in nrf2 response upon ozonation of wastewater has not been explicitly studied so far volker et al 2019 nrf2 is activated by oxidation of keap1 or electrophilic attack addition on keap1 which leads to dissolution of the keap1 nrf2 complex once free nrf2 migrates to the nucleus to induce the antioxidant response element are that triggers the formation of cytoprotective enzymes in the arec32 assay a reporter gene is coupled to the are that expresses luciferase which can be detected photometrically two mechanisms are possible for the toxic effects of p bqs o brien 1991 1 arylation of e g peptides or dna direct induction of toxicity and 2 formation of reactive oxygen species ros through autooxidation and redox cycling indirect induction of toxicity both arylation of keap1 abiko and kumagai 2013 dunlap et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and oxidation of keap1 through ros such as h2o2 can activate the nrf2 covas et al 2013 erlank et al 2011 fourquet et al 2010 some structurally simple p bqs have been shown to activate nrf2 table s2 abiko and kumagai 2013 abiko et al 2011 erlank et al 2011 rubio et al 2011 from general chemical considerations p bqs are α β unsaturated ketones a structural motive known to react with nucleophiles through michael addition addition reactions of unsubstituted bq have been shown for amines thiols and related biomolecules such as amino acids and proteins morrison et al 1969 e g albumin in blood serum ghosh et al 2012 cytochrome fisher et al 2007 human topoisomerase iialpha bender et al 2007 or dna nucleobases gaskell et al 2004 xie et al 2005 the result of these reductive addition reactions are substituted hqs urano et al 1994 also found for less electrophilic compounds such as t butyl p bq hqs can be oxidized to p bqs and undergo further addition reactions e g a bq monothioether can still bind to cytochrome person et al 2005 under oxic conditions autooxidation of hqs and subsequent additions to the resulting p bqs leads to increasingly substituted p bqs hqs in the case of glutathione gsh as a nucleophile eventually four gsh molecules can be added to one bq baigi et al 2008 hqs are not electrophilic per se however structurally simple diphenols hqs and catechols dinkova kostova and wang 2011 erlank et al 2011 rubio et al 2011 or complex marjan et al 2021 na and surh 2008 patel and maru 2013 polyphenols that contain diphenolic moieties are also known to activate the nrf2 pathway table s3 considering that diphenols such as hq can auto oxidize to p bqs the observed toxicity could be ascribed to p bqs formed in situ the finding that oxidation of differently substituted hqs by cu ii wang et al 2010 enhances the nrf2 arec32 activity supports this argument both hq and catechol were found to bind to guanine and thymine in the presence of cu ii attributed to their oxidation to the corresponding p o bqs hirakawa et al 2002 also dna adducts from dosed hqs have been found tozlovanu et al 2006 and were attributed to addition after auto oxidation of hqs other studies found similar are luc a bioassay also testing the nrf2 pathway activity for hq and bq in human bronchial epithelial cells rubio et al 2011 a result that might be explained by oxidation of dosed hqs to p bqs a second indirect toxic mode of action is constituted by ros such as h2o2 and superoxide radical anion these can be formed from redox processes involving p bqs and hqs as a redox couple also possible for o bq catechol and can in turn induce an oxidative stress response the autooxidation of hqs to p bqs yields h2o2 as a ros futile redox cycling through reduction by the two electron quinone oxidoreductase nqo1 can transform quinones to their diphenolic form shown for menadione ross et al 2000 or through the reaction with ascorbate morrison et al 1969 which reduces p bqs back to their hq forms leading to more h2o2 upon re oxidation semiquinone radicals ho ph o can be formed through the con proportionation of a hq p bq redox couple hq p bq 2 ho ph o eyer 1991 or through an enzymatic one electron reduction of a p bq o brien 1991 and the radical can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide radical anion as an additional ros concurrent modes of action are possible direct and indirect induction of toxicity as shown for menadione a naphthoquinone that causes cytotoxicity through both arylation and redox cycling chung et al 1999 seung et al 1998 cytotoxicity was found to increase when menadione was allowed to react with plasma proteins in the incubation medium which was attributed to more efficient redox cycling of the conjugated species and prompted the development of a medium free protocol seung et al 1998 there is little data on the toxic potency and reactivity of differently substituted hqs and p bqs here a variety of commercially available model compounds comprising both p bqs and hqs were tested for the response of the arec32 bioassay this is a rather unspecific test for oxidative stress probing the activation of the nrf2 pathway which can be an initial cause for carcinogenicity robertson et al 2020 for selected compounds we also tested for effects that are more closely related to eventual carcinogenic effects that might follow from oxidative stress the umuc dna repair activity and the p53re bla tumor suppression bioassays since p bqs are also reactive towards nucleophiles that may be present in biological media we investigated the abatement of p bqs and hqs in different reaction media phosphate buffered saline pbs amino acids and fetal bovine serum fbs mimicking incubation conditions such reactions may lead to products that have different toxicological properties compared to the parent compounds it has been shown for 2 6 dicl p benzoquinone that pre incubation in buffer or in amino acids reduces the cytotoxicity towards human colon epithelial cells and liver carcinoma cells hung et al 2019 an effect attributed to the conjugation of the parent compound to molecules in the medium for structurally diverse p bqs it is so far unclear which role such reactions play during incubation conditions of in vitro bioassays such as the arec32 bioassay and what type of reaction products are prevalent under these conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 list of chemicals a list of p bqs and hqs used as test compounds in this study is provided in fig 1 a complete list of chemicals suppliers and purities is given in the supporting information si table s1 and the physicochemical properties are given in table s4 2 2 in vitro bioassays 2 2 1 arec32 in vitro bioassay the arec32 reporter cell line is based on the mcf7 breast cancer cell line with a gene encoding for luciferase attached wang et al 2006 and was obtained by courtesy of c roland wolf cancer research uk the arec32 assay was performed in dmem glutamax with 10 fbs standard protocol or 1 fbs escher et al 2012 brought to a 384 well plate format neale et al 2017 all p bqs hqs were weighted in brown vials and stored under argon if indicated on the packaging on the day of the experiment the compounds were directly dissolved in the bioassay medium to a concentration four times higher than the highest concentration in the bioassay in a so called dosing vial that was vortexed to facilitate dissolution the resulting compound concentration in this stock solution was 40 µm the preparation of the dosing vials took up to 30 min fourteen dosing vials were then stacked on a robot tray together with two vials of positive control tbu hq and used to prepare serial or linear dilutions in medium in a dosing plate using a pipetting robot hamilton microlab star bonaduz switzerland that subsequently transferred 10 µl of the dosing plate into a cell plate containing cells and 30 µl medium using a 96 tip pipet head the workflow of dosing is described in escher et al 2019a and lasts approximately 20 to 25 min hence the dosed chemicals were in contact with the medium for up to 1 h before incubation with cells started the initial experiments using medium with 10 fbs were range finders for the activation of are and these experiments were only used to derive the cytotoxicity ic10 inhibitory concentrations causing 10 of reduction of cell viability quantified by the presto blue thermo fisher scientific a13261 according to neale et al 2017 because the activation of are proved to be too variable data not shown the ic50 were derived from a plot of logarithmic concentrations against cell viability using a log logistic concentration response model eq 1 with the conversion from the fitted ic50 to ic10 by eq 2 1 cytotoxicity 100 1 1 0 log i c 50 concentration slope 2 log i c 10 log i c 50 log 1 9 slope the main experiments were performed under stricter time control for the dosing experiment applying linear dilutions at non cytotoxic concentrations two sets of experiments were run with 10 standard conditions and 1 fbs each in two independent repeats the ecir1 5 is the concentration of a compound at which the induction of the reporter cell line was 50 higher than that of the unexposed cells escher et al 2012 the ecir1 5 and its standard error se ecir1 5 were deduced with eqs 3 and 4 from slopes of the linear concentration ir induction ratio curves escher et al 2018 3 e c ir 1 5 0 5 slope 4 se e c ir 1 5 0 5 slop e 2 se slope 2 2 2 p53 in vitro bioassay the p53 bioassay was performed analogously to the arec32 assay the commercially available cellsensor p53re bla hct 116 cell based assay developed by invitrogen was used in this project to measure the p53 activation according to the protocol provided by invitrogen with an extended incubation period of 48 h stalter et al 2016 none of the tested compounds were found to induce p53 activity the results of initial dosing experiments were used to derive cytotoxicity ic10 values since there was no activation of p53 detected no linear repeats were run 2 2 3 umuc umuc nm8001 in vitro bioassay umuc and umuc nm8001 takamura enya et al 2011 more sensitive to oxidative dna damage obtained by courtesy of prof yoshimitsu oda were tested for unsubstituted umuc and also substituted umuc nm8001 hqs and p bqs in the absence of the s9 enzyme mix no activation was observed below cytotoxic concentrations text s1 si 2 3 stability experiments in the components of the incubation medium the incubation medium used for the arec32 bioassay consists of dulbecco s modified eagle medium dmem and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs in a carbonate buffer system ph 7 4 maintained by a co2 atmosphere in this medium nucleophiles that can potentially react with p bqs are ho amino acids contained in dmem and protein bound thiol groups in fbs to evaluate their respective influence on p bq and hq stability abatement experiments were performed without reporter cell lines in pbs ho dmem in carbonate buffer amino acids and fbs buffered in pbs thiol groups mimicking the incubation conditions the different approaches are sketched in fig 2 after spiking p bqs into pbs fig 2a or dmem fig 2b samples were taken over the course of 24 h and stabilized by acidification for the reactions with thiols contained in fbs the kinetic timeframe for the abatement of three selected p bqs bq me bq 2 6 dime bq was established with an on line photometric experiment fig 2c based on these results batch experiments were performed by adding p bqs to either fbs or gsh as a substitute source of thiols sampled over 60 min fig 2d residual concentrations of p bqs and hqs were measured by hplc dad all experimental details are described in text s2 si the photostability of p bqs and hqs is briefly discussed in text s5 si 2 4 quantification of reactive sulfide groups in fbs p bqs can react with thiol groups stemming from cysteine moieties in fbs for a meaningful comparison to gsh concentrations the concentrations of sulfide groups in fbs were quantified photometrically in a quartz cuvette fbs solutions 5 and 10 were prepared in 70 mm pbs ph 7 4 containing 1 mm edta to a final volume of 3 ml 100 µl of a 2 mm solution of ellman s reagent dtnb 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid were spiked into the stirred cuvette absorption was monitored at 412 nm and an extinction coefficient of 14 150 m 1 cm 1 was used to quantify tnb2 the monomeric form of dtnb which is formed from its reaction with thiols after subtracting a background spectrum of fbs as the absorption at 412 nm kept increasing time series of 60 min were recorded the concentration of tnb2 monomer was equated to the concentration of reactive sulfide groups in solution control experiments with gsh as a source of free sulfides were also performed 2 5 hplc analysis of p bqs and hqs bqs and hqs were quantified by hplc dad agilent 1100 using external standards the compounds were separated with two different setups 1 on a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii 3 0 100 mm 5 μm hplc column at 30 c with a flux of 600 µl min and 2 on a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii 3 0 150 mm 5 µm at 30 c with a flux of 800 µl min depending on the analytes isocratic conditions 10 meoh 90 h2o or 90 0 1 h3po4 were maintained for up to 4 min then the meoh concentration was increased to 50 or 75 within 3 5 min injection volumes were 40 100 µl 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability of p bqs and hqs in medium limited reproducibility of arec32 test results was observed together with similar cyto toxicity for p bqs and their corresponding hqs since functional groups amine thiol are potentially reacting with p bqs this prompted us to test the stability of p bqs and hqs in the incubation media mimicking incubation conditions three degradation modes hydrolysis pbs reaction with amines dmem reaction with thiols fbs gsh can be proposed and were tested according to fig 2 an additional experiment determined the concentration of accessible reactive thiols in fbs 3 1 1 pbs and dmem concentration profiles for the selected p bqs and hqs determined by hplc are shown in fig 3 in pbs compounds behave differently depending on substitution pattern and compound type all hqs were readily abated and formation of the corresponding p bq was observed in most cases conversely alkyl p bqs were relatively stable in pbs whereas other p bqs were abated over the course of hours down to few minutes cl bq with dicl bq no longer detectable minutes after spiking and dibr bq degrading even faster preventing meaningful quantification no time series shown for these compounds for these highly unstable p bqs the corresponding hqs were detected dicl bq or presumed dibr bq based on hplc retention time and optical spectrum products of these reactions in dmem hqs were abated similarly as in pbs however there was less formation of corresponding p bqs as a product the reason for this can be seen in the concentration profiles when p bqs were spiked the abatement of p bqs in dmem was more rapid compared to pbs and some of them mostly degraded in the first minutes of incubation in contrast to pbs alkylated p bqs were readily degraded in dmem with the exception of 2 6 dime bq the observed transformations of hqs and p bqs can be explained by their known patterns of reactivity unsubstituted hq can auto oxidize to form bq and h2o2 eyer 1991 la mer and rideal 1924 monks et al 1992 song and buettner 2010 shown in fig 4a this reaction is ph dependent and in the presence of bq it proceeds through a semiquinone radical anion pathway eyer 1991 song and buettner 2010 leading to overall complex kinetics for holding times of 24 h the substituted hqs were generally consumed to 100 and only the unsubstituted hq remained at about 50 fig 3a the product of these reactions is the corresponding p bq which is stable in buffer only in some cases as discussed below p bqs are electrophilic α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds which are susceptible to michael addition of nucleophiles to the c c bond this reductive addition yields a hq with the nucleophile as an additional substituent fig 4b pairs of hqs and p bqs but also catechols and the corresponding 1 2 benzoquinones can undergo redox cross reactions to reach a thermodynamically more stable redox state fig 4c uchimiya and stone 2006 a reductive addition to a p bq can always be followed by a redox cross reaction the resulting substituted hq is more electron rich than the hq that bears the same substituents as the parent p bq consequently it is thermodynamically favorable to oxidize the substituted hq to a substituted p bq and in turn to reduce a parent p bq to a correspondingly substituted hq fig 5 the expected stoichiometry for these reactions is that for each parent p bq reacting with a nucleophile an additional p bq is reduced to a hq hence two parent p bq molecules react to one additionally substituted p bq and one hq with the same substitution pattern as the parent i e the yield of each of the two products is 0 5 in terms of consumed p bq the different tested solutions pbs dmem fbs contain nucleophiles of different strength in different concentrations in phosphate buffer the only considerable nucleophile is ho we interpret that this species is responsible for the abatement of p bqs in phosphate buffered solutions reductive hydrolysis for the unsubstituted compounds some kinetic details are known at room temperature such as the second order rate constant of the initial attack of the hydroxide ion to p bq eigen and matthies 1961 and the second order rate constant of the redox cross reaction between the resulting trihydroxybenzene anion and p bq uchimiya and stone 2006 von sonntag et al 2004 from the known kinetic data at room temperature and omitting the resulting hydroxybenzoquinone as a nucleophile we can estimate the half life of unsubstituted bq at ph 7 4 to be 7 days this reaction appears to be greatly accelerated at 37 c to a half life of about 10 h fig 3b a higher reactivity of a p bq with electron withdrawing substituents can be expected with a nucleophile in contrast alkylation should slow down reductive hydrolysis through an inductive effect i but potentially also through steric hindrance this seems to be the case for reaction with ho as the alkylated p bqs me bq tbu bq 2 6 dime bq are at most slightly degraded over the reaction time of about 20 h fig 3n p r the opposite effect faster reaction can be expected in the presence of electron withdrawing substituents cl bq degrades more quickly in phosphate buffer compared to unsubstituted bq this is even more pronounced for 2 6 dicl bq which vanishes completely within minutes following this argument meo bq should be more stable compared to bq owing to a mesomeric electron donation m effect of the methoxy group but was found less stable instead the increased reactivity of meo bq is supported by a quantum chemical analysis text s3 dmem contains high concentrations mm range of different amino acids these amino groups react as nucleophiles with p bqs a reaction that is exploited with unsubstituted bq as a colorimetric assay for the presence of amino groups benson and spillane 1976 hikosaka 1970 moxon and slifkin 1972 neutral amines are stronger nucleophiles than ho and are able to also react with the alkylated p bqs the exception was 2 6 dime bq which was also mostly stable under these conditions possibly owing to a stronger i effect or increased steric hindrance reductive addition to amines consumed most of the tested p bqs rapidly within few minutes to one hour the auto oxidation of hqs should not be affected by dmem the slightly faster abatement of hqs in dmem compared to pbs can be attributed to slight variations in ph ph measurements of dmem taken out of the incubator yielded ph values of up to 7 6 compared to the target ph of 7 4 that was maintained in experiments employing phosphate buffer in dmem the auto oxidation of hqs did not lead to a build up of p bqs as these are consumed rapidly by their reactions with amino groups 3 1 2 kinetic experiments in fbs experiments were performed with unsubstituted mono and dimethylated p bqs to cover a wide range of reactivity in 5 fbs solution in pbs these compounds were selected since they had lower reactivities in dmem with 2 6 dime bq being mostly stable in dmem these compounds can indicate whether compounds which are stable in dmem can still be abated in the presence of fbs overall the decrease of measured absorption was rapid fig 6 after 10 min it had decreased by 40 bq 25 me bq and 15 dime bq if the loss of absorption was directly proportional to the loss in concentration of the p bqs this would correspond to drops in concentrations between 6 and 15 µm but the observation might be masked by interference of products discussed below nevertheless these experiments established a time range of the initial reactions with some very high reactivity in the first 15 min an instantaneous concentration drop for bq followed by slower reactions thereafter both getting less important with substitution we noted that also h2o2 a potential product of redox cycling in the presence of reporter cells degrades in an fbs solution with 50 degradation of a 40 μm solution in 5 fbs in 100 min data not shown 3 1 3 quantification of reactive sulfides in fbs to compare the degradation of p bqs to the content of accessible sulfides in fbs solutions fbs solutions in phosphate buffer were tested with ellman s reagent there were approximately 20 µm of fast reacting sulfide groups in a 10 fbs solution typically used for arec32 incubation fig s3 for the determination of e g gsh with ellman s reagent the concentration of tnb2 is usually determined after a reaction time of 10 min however fbs contains a mix of several proteins it can be hypothesized that the reaction kinetics are determined by the accessibility of the individual thiol groups the cysteine units at the different proteins surfaces react immediately whereas those further inside the protein require diffusion of dtnb to these reactive sites as dtnb is roughly twice the size of a p bq it can be expected that benzoquinones react faster in comparison as cysteine moieties hard to access by dtnb are reached more easily by a smaller p bq 3 1 4 batch experiments to test the abatement of p bqs in presence of fbs or gsh batch experiments were conducted in pbs control experiment and in 5 fbs or in 10 µm gsh the results are shown as time series in fig 7 the abatement of p bqs was clearly more rapid during the first 15 min the first sampling point for both fbs and gsh hq formation was observed when gsh was spiked the yield of hq was around 0 5 mol mol of the consumed parent p bq while the consumption of the parent p bq was 1 7 2 0 mol mol of added gsh expected value of 2 0 for fbs addition the measured hq yields were 0 4 0 6 mol mol of consumed parent p bq for unsubstituted p bq and me p bq expected yield of 0 5 for 2 6 dime bq the hq yield was reduced to 0 2 when measured within 24 h of the experiment however when the acidified samples were re measured 30 h after the experiment an increased hq yield of 0 4 was found conversely in the experiments conducted with a higher fbs p bq ratio 10 fbs 10 µm p bq no residual parent p bq could be detected and only for 2 6 dime bq the corresponding hq could be detected with a molar yield of 0 05 for unsubstituted bq hq co eluted in the hplc with chromophoric elements of the fbs matrix and a yield of 0 05 could have gone undetected compared to the amino acids in dmem e g 1 h to decrease the concentration of me bq by 50 these reactions are very fast few minutes redox cross reactions should also happen after the reaction of p bqs with thiol groups and lead to substituted hqs in batch experiments where an excess of p bqs was dosed however in batch experiments where p bqs were dosed under stoichiometrically no or only little formation of hqs was observed we interpret that the reductive addition to p bqs kinetically outcompetes the redox cross reaction in these cases which is not the case for amino acids the continued degradation of unsubstituted bq after 15 min fig 7a could be caused either by the reaction of bq with the amino groups of free amino acids contained in fbs or by continued reaction with cysteine groups that are more difficult to access but are still accessible especially to the smaller unsubstituted bq the fact that the hq yield for 2 6 dime bq is initially very low likely indicates that redox cross reactions are sterically hindered we interpret the increase of the 2 6 dime hq yield in the samples after an additional holding time as continued redox cross reactions a preliminary run of this experiment yielded comparable data but lacks the artefactual increase of the me bq concentration in the control experiment of fig 7b si text s4 fig s4 1 3 2 in vitro bioassays different in vitro bioassays were probed for their response to commercially available substituted hqs and p bqs under standard incubation conditions the main focus was on the arec32 bioassay for oxidative stress which was induced by almost all compounds tested other bioassays targeting genotoxicity p53 geneblazer and umuc umuc nm8001 were not responding to the tested compounds before cytotoxic concentrations were reached 3 2 1 cytotoxicity inhibitory concentrations for 10 cytotoxicity ic10 were derived from initial concentration response experiments performed for the arec32 and p53re bla bioassays table s5 and were found to be within 10 5 10 4 m for most compounds and fairly similar between the arec32 and the p53 cell lines fig 8a the ratios of ic10 of p bqs and corresponding hqs ranged from 0 23 to 3 4 for arec32 and 0 16 to 3 2 for p53 fig 8b with the geometric mean close to 1 indicating that there are no clear sensitivity differences between the p bqs and hqs despite the fast degradation and loss of the parent compound the cytotoxicity was higher than predicted by the baseline toxicity qsar escher et al 2019b for the parent compound based on the partition constant between membrane lipids and water k lipw fig s4a the excess toxicity can be described by the toxic ratio tr maeder et al 2004 verhaar et al 1996 for meo bq the tr was over 300 fig s4b and tr decreased with increasing k lipw indicating that despite degradation the cytotoxicity was highly specific as expected for reactive chemicals stalter et al 2016 3 2 2 arec32 activation ecir1 5 values ranged from 10 6 to 3 10 5 m fig 9a table s5 and a number of chemicals tbu bq 2 6 di tbu bq meo hq did not show any activity in the range finders up to ic10 and were therefore not tested in the linear concentration response curve the reproducibility of experiments was not as good as for more stable compounds that we have tested in other projects or environmental samples escher et al 2013 the low repeatability of the presently investigated hqs and p bqs is most likely not caused by the performance of the bioassay but rather by some variability in the time required for sample preparation and dosing this hypothesis is supported by the high reproducibility that was achieved for tbu hq which is regularly used as reference compound in the arec32 reporter cell line it was always diluted as the last sample just before starting the automated preparation of the dose response curves followed by the transfer of the dilutions to the cell plate therefore the holding time was the shortest in this case from previous experiments we know that the ecir1 5 for tbu hq is much more variable if the handling of tbu hq during sample preparation is varied in the present study the ecir1 5 of tbu hq was 1 56 µm and in 40 independent experiments over two years the ecir1 5 varied between 1 27 and 3 43 µm with a mean of 2 22 and a coefficient of variation of 30 since h2o2 is formed during autoxidation of hqs to p bq we also determined the ecir1 5 of h2o2 which was 0 24 0 02 mm in presence of 10 fbs and 0 27 0 03 mm in presence of 1 fbs 3 3 impacts of reactions with the medium on the activation of arec32 the likely route of activation of the arec32 bioassay by substituted p bqs is the reaction with a thiol group of the keap1 protein that activates the nrf2 pathway in turn hqs are not electrophilic but are electron rich compounds and should not react as electrophiles and should thus not directly induce the arec32 assay since we showed that in experiments mimicking incubation conditions hqs are quantitatively oxidized to p bqs and since hqs have been previously reported to auto oxidize to p bqs and h2o2 eyer 1991 la mer and rideal 1924 monks et al 1992 song and buettner 2010 both p bqs and h2o2 could be responsible for the observed arec32 activation conversely we showed that in 10 fbs dosed p bqs were rapidly consumed and the same has to be expected for p bqs formed in situ from auto oxidation of hqs when the dosed p bqs were initially diluted in the dosing vials containing 10 fbs compounds 40 μm are in excess of thiol groups 20 30 μm a fast reaction leading to conjugated hqs and parent hqs with a yield of up to 0 5 has to be expected in 1 fbs p bqs are in large excess of thiol groups in the dosing vial and the main sink are slower reactions with free amino acids the timescale of these reactions depended strongly on the compound fig 3 fig 7 however these reactions will continue to produce hqs with a yield of 0 5 as the dilution procedure and the incubation progresses these hqs with or without s r or nh r substitution can enter the reporter cells however it should be considered that binding to a voluminous protein may prevent passing the cell membrane for more hydrophobic neutral and charged chemicals uptake kinetics into arec32 were previously found to depend on the fbs concentration and completed for neutral chemicals within 4 h and were slower for charged organic molecules fischer et al 2018 while arec32 has very little constitutively expressed cyp1a1 and accordingly no p450 cyp1 activity cyp1a1 can be activated by chemical exposure as has been shown with benzo a pyrene fischer et al 2020 we showed that during the first 1 and 2 h of the incubation most hqs are quantitatively auto oxidized to the corresponding p bqs fig 3 as the timescales of auto oxidation and cellular uptake are similar we propose that a fraction hqs could enter the cells unchanged and could be auto oxidized there whereas another fraction undergoes extracellular auto oxidation this should be followed by a rapid quantitative reaction with thiol groups of fbs which are in large excess when a final dilution around the ecir1 5 concentration is reached in 10 fbs no redox cross reactions are expected in this case fig 9b shows that the ratio of ecir1 5 bq ecir1 5 hq was around 1 5 2 5 for four hq p bq pairs that is the dosed hqs induced a stronger antioxidant response because they had a lower ecir1 5 this is compatible with the above interpretation that p bqs resulting from oxidation inside the cell are ultimately responsible for the toxic effects dosed p bqs are rapidly consumed to yield either hqs at a lower concentration or additionally substituted p bqs or hqs in contrast dosed hqs auto oxidize on a slower time scale compared to the reaction of p bqs with the medium and can diffuse into the cells without prior reaction with the incubation medium intracellular hqs can then autoxidize or be transformed to p bqs and can activate the nrf2 pathway by arylation or react with other intracellular nucleophiles such as gsh in a scenario where a p bq was dosed and underwent reductive addition with the formation of a substituted hq the parent hq yield is maximally 0 5 and thus the concentration of toxicologically active compound is reduced also substituted hqs that result from the reductive addition of thiols or amines to parent p bqs can be oxidized to substituted p bqs owing to the electron donating nature of the s r and nh r substituents these should be less electrophilic compared to the parent p bqs both effects offer an explanation as to why hqs yield lower ecir1 5 although these effects were only minor when comparing experiments in 10 fbs to 1 fbs we can consider that these contain 20 µm and 2 µm of fast reacting sh groups respectively the effect of fbs content on ecir1 5 concentrations was most pronounced for 2 6 dime bq 2 6 dime hq fig 9 the only tested compound that was mostly stable in dmem while all other p bqs were also abated by amino acids 2 6 dime bq reacted only with sh groups in fbs in experiments with 1 fbs a larger fraction of 2 6 dime bq can enter the cell before undergoing reductive addition and react with the thiol group of keap1 3 4 validity of bioassay results and implications for the toxicity of bqs and hqs our interpretation of the degradation experiments is that using the standard incubation condition 10 fbs only hqs are stable enough to enter the reporter cells and are auto oxidized inside the cell on a timescale of few hours the arec32 activation experienced when dosing hqs is thus that of corresponding p bqs it is tempting to integrate over the hq degradation to arrive at an effective exposure of the reporter cells to the p bqs however as the p bqs resulting from auto oxidation outside and inside the cells or enzymatic oxidation inside the cells should be consumed rapidly it is unclear how the actual exposure concentration time to these chemicals should be defined in terms of toxic potency the derived ecir1 5 for hqs could be interpreted as lower limits to the ecir1 5 values of the corresponding p bqs however also substituted hqs and substituted p bqs through autooxidation can contribute to the observed toxicity in case of dosed p bqs the identity of the active molecules is less clear as the products of reductive additions are likely the source of electrophiles auto oxidation of hqs always yields h2o2 as a byproduct 40 μm h2o2 reached 50 abatement after 100 min in a 5 fbs solution data not shown and was 1 2 orders of magnitude less potent than the tested p bqs hqs fig 9a if h2o2 were responsible for the observed arec32 activation it would have to be produced with a yield of 10 100 mol mol of the dosed parent compounds which appears unlikely for unsubstituted hq one could go through four stages of increasingly substituted hqs and the molar yield of h2o2 could be 5 at most assuming that increasingly substituted p bqs remain susceptible to further reductive addition also if h2o2 was the active species the pronounced effect of fbs concentration on the ecir1 5 of 2 6 dime hq 2 6 dime bq could not be explained the ecir1 5 of the hq was lower by a factor of 2 compared to the p bq fig 9b this is compatible with the hq formed through reductive addition and a redox cross reaction with a yield of 0 5 being the reactive species in case of redox cycling as the dominant mode of action no pronounced differences in ecir1 5 of a p bq hq pair should be expected this notion is supported by a study that reports the generation of h2o2 by tbu hq in the growth medium dmem with 10 fbs in the absence of cells erlank et al 2011 within one hour h2o2 was found to be present in about the same stoichiometry as the dosed tbu hq in the presence of astrocytes the h2o2 yield in the medium was reduced to 25 of the dosed tbu hq concentration which the authors attributed to detoxification mechanisms of the astrocytes p bqs dosed directly or created in situ can also be expected to add rapidly to gsh or similar cell constituents in contrast h2o2 formation inside the cell should cause the formation of gssg no increased gssg levels were found upon the treatment with unsubstituted bq in a medium free dosing on blood cell platelets seung et al 1998 for dimethylnaphthoquinone a pure redox cycler and thus intracellular producer of h2o2 increased gssg levels were reported however in vivo the xenobiotics will have to travel through biological medium e g blood cytoplasma potentially leading to conjugates before entering a cell overall the question of the importance of redox cycling in the toxic mechanisms of substituted p bqs cannot be answered in a general manner based on the present data and may be compound specific in the case of halobenzoquinones the reactions with amino acids may be so rapid and nonselective that only conjugated species are toxicologically relevant and even unsubstituted p bq is degraded within minutes in dmem while alkylation protects the p bq to some extent this may indicate that in many cases conjugated p bqs are the active species that were assessed by the arec32 bioassay as these are still capable of michael reactions as well as redox cycling invoking this argument and assuming that arylation is the toxic mechanism the toxicity gradient bq cl bq dicl bq can be rationalized the more electrophilic species readily react to less electrophilic monoconjugates which then are weaker electrophiles than the parent compound 3 5 toxicity of hqs and bqs assessed by different bioassays in addition to the arec32 bioassay which tests the antioxidant stress response we also performed bioassays that should be more specific to genotoxicity and dna damage however the compounds did not induce a response in the p53 bioassay or the umuc nm8001 bioassay in this variant of the umuc assay dna repair activity certain detoxification mechanisms have been removed making it more sensitive to oxidative stress the incubation media of both the umuc and p53 bioassays contain nucleophiles capable of reacting with p bqs the umuc bioassay employs a casein digest a protein mix and tryptone amino acids the p53 bioassay was carried out in mccoys 5a medium which contains gsh as well as an fbs supplement although no p53 or umuc activation was found potential activity below cytotoxic concentrations may have been masked by reaction of p bqs with the incubation medium the situation would be similar in real water samples that are freeze dried and resuspended in incubation medium prior to toxicological tests 4 conclusions in oxidative water treatment p bqs and hqs are ubiquitous transformation products arising from phenolic precursors in vitro bioassays are a potential tool for the detection of these compound classes in treated waters here different bioassays were tested for their response to a structurally diverse set of model compounds along with the substances stability in typically used incubation media components out of the tested standard bioassays only the arec32 bioassay responded to almost all model compounds with ecir1 5 around 10 4 to 10 6 m all tested compounds were found to be unstable during standard incubation conditions of the arec32 bioassay this was attributed to the autooxidation of hqs to p bqs and to the reductive addition of nucleophiles amino and thiol groups to p bqs reactions with the incubation medium lead to a structurally diverse mix of additionally substituted p bqs and hqs the observed ecir1 5 values do not necessarily indicate the toxic potency of the different target substances virtually all p bqs and hqs yielded high toxic ratios for cytotoxicity and ecir1 5 meaning that this bioassay still responds specifically to these compound classes for applications in water quality it should be kept in mind that the arec32 bioassay is a rather general test of the oxidative stress response and will respond to other types of compounds as well although the rapid reactions of p bqs with biomolecules were observed at the elevated temperature of the bioassay incubation these reactions are likely also happening in a biological post filtration step leading to an abatement of initially formed p bqs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16813,understanding microbial metacommunity assembly and the underlying methanisms are fundamental objectives of aquatic ecology however little is known about how eutrophication the primary water quality issue of aquatic ecosystems regulates bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly at a regional scale in reservoirs in this study we applied a metacommunity framework to study bacterioplankton communities in 210 samples collected from 42 tropical coastal reservoirs in the wet summer season we found that the spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community compositions bccs at a regional scale was shaped mainly by species sorting the reservoir trophic state index tsi was the key determinant of bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly bcc turnover increased significantly with the tsi differences between sites tsi when tsi was 20 but remained at a level of about 80 when tsi was 20 compared to oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs increased heterogeneity of co occurrence bacterioplankton networks and bacterioplankton β diversity were observed across eutrophic reservoirs we propose that larger variation in phytoplankton community assembly may play directly or indirectly deterministic processes in controlling the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and became the potential mechanisms behind the observed higher bcc heterogeneity across the eutrophic reservoirs our research contributes to a broader understanding of the ecological effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems and provides clues to the management of the tropical coastal reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterioplankton community metacommunity approach species sorting eutrophication co occurrence network eutrophic reservoirs 1 introduction determining the processes underlying community assembly across aquatic ecosystems is a major research topic in aquatic ecology newton et al 2011 paver et al 2013 leboucher et al 2020 increasing evidence suggests that the spatial distribution of aquatic biological community compositions can be addressed by niche related deterministic and neutral stochastic processes chase and myers 2011 stegen et al 2012 dini andreote et al 2015 these two views are not mutually exclusive and their relative importance in determining the assembly of communities can be regulated by local environmental factors and regional spatial effects pavoine and bonsall 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 morrison whittle and goddard 2015 thompson et al 2020 to explain the interaction between local factors and regional processes the metacommunity concept leibold et al 2004 considers four major paradigms i species sorting assuming that dispersal is high enough to allow immigration to all patches but that local environmental conditions primarily influence community compositions ii patch dynamics assuming that community stucture is a result of colonization extinction dynamics among homogeneous patches iii mass effects assuming that massive immigration can rescue species from competitive exclusion and iv the neutral perspective assuming that community assembly are regulated by random colonization speciation dispersal and extinction events hubbell 2001 bacterioplankton are ubiquitous and essential to virtually all biogeochemical cycling processes in aquatic ecosystem processes because of high dispersal rates large population sizes fast growth rates and a propensity for dormancy the traditional hypothesis everything is everywhere but the environment selects baas becking 1934 presumes that the spatical distributions of aquatic bacterioplankton at a regional scale are not affected by dispersal barriers or historical events but by local interactions baas becking 1934 langenheder and ragnarsson 2007 van der gucht et al 2007 environmental factors characterizing local contemporary habitat conditions such as productivity chase 2010 environmental heterogeneity huber et al 2020 and spatical connectivity among patches mouquet and loreau 2003 declerck et al 2013 are the main determinant in the control of the spatial patterns of bacterioplankton at regional scals however recent studies suggest that also regional factors such as mass effect and dispersal limitation are important for the assembly of local bacterioplankton communities lindström and langenheder 2012 leboucher et al 2020 wan et al 2021 there are many studies of bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly at regional scales in natural lakes rivers as well as seawater haggerty and dinsdale 2017 ren et al 2019 chen et al 2019 huber et al 2020 ortiz álvarez et al 2020 however the knowledge of reservoir ecosystems is far from comprehensive xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 their response may differ as they occupy an intermediate position between rivers and natural lakes in terms of morphological and hydrological features nutrient inputs and internal nutrient cycling jones et al 2019 aguirrezabala campano et al 2021 in contrast to natural lake ecosystems reservoirs are moreover hydrologically managed and often interconnected systems straškraba et al 1993 zarfl et al 2015 hu et al 2017 water flows between reservoirs might reduce or mask the effect of species sorting in structuring bacterioplankton metacommunities since the high dispersal rate of organisms can result in source sink dynamics lindström and langenheder 2012 leboucher et al 2020 liu et al 2020 the allied influences of water flows local environmental factors and regional spatial effects need to be further investigated to elucidate whether these factors can affect the assembly of bacterioplankton metacommunities at regional scale which might benefit the protection and management of reservoir ecosystems to investigate the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and the underlying mechanisms in reservoir ecosystems at a regional scale we sampled a set of coastal reservoirs located in the same geographical area around the coastal city zhuhai located in the guangdong province china because of the increasing demand for water sources many reservoirs were built in the areas during the 1950s as natural lakes are rare han and dumont 2011 anthropogenic nutrient loading i e point and nonpoint input of phosphorus and nitrogen to reservoir ecosystems owing to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production typically led to increases in eutrophication han and dumont 2011 tang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 this eutrophication has seriously affected the water quality aquatic food webs and occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the reservoirs shao et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 such changes may have many direct and indirect effects on the assembly of bacterioplankton metacommunities at a regional scale where dispersal may not be spatially limited local interactions are therefore expected to be dominant in shaping bacterioplankton metacommunity patterns as predicted by the species sorting metacommunity model lindström and langenheder 2012 thompson et al 2020 moreover eutrophication might increase the deterministic processes of the bacterioplankton community assembly across reservoirs resulting in larger variation in bacterioplankton communnity compositions bccs however the effect of species sorting on structuring the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly might be reduced or masked by bacterioplankton dispersal between coastal reservoirs especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal through water flows might be much more frequent in water interconnected reservoirs or by rain dust and seepage in this study we 1 elucidated which of the four metacommunity models that best predicted the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in tropical coastal reservoir ecosystems at a regional scale 2 tested whether eutrophication acts as a key determinant in shaping bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and causes shifts in bccs across the reservoirs at a regional scale to answer these questions we used a metacommunity appoach to study bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and the underlying determining mechanisms based on 16s rrna high throughput sequencing of the 210 samples collected from 42 tropical coastal reservoirs located in the same geographical area around the coastal city zhuhai guangdong province china sampled in a wet summer season 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample collection and measurement of environmental factors during july and august 2018 we collected water samples from reservoirs located around the city of zhuhai located in the guangdong province china fig 1 in each reservoir bacterial samples 1 to 2 l water were collected from surface waters the top 50 cm at 5 sampling points and filtered through 0 2 μm pore size isopore filters millipore billerica ma usa the filters were stored at 20 c for further analyses water environmental factors including ph temperature t salinity sali conductivity cond and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ at each sampling point using a ysi multi probe meter yellow springs oh usa and transparency sd was also determined in the field using a secchi disk a 1 l water sample was collected under the surface for chemical analyses including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonium nh4 n phosphate po4 3 p and chlorophyll a chla all chemical analyses were performed according to standard methods greenberg et al 1992 additionally historical data on the area and the capacity of the studied reservoirs were obtained water samples for phytoplankton community analysis were preserved with 1 lugol s solution phytoplankton was counted using an utermöhl chamber and an inverted microscope and biomass were estimated from geometrical shapes utermöhl 1958 furthermore a trophic state index tsi inspired from carlson 1977 was calculated for each reservoir based on the concentration of tp tn chla and sd based on the tsi values 42 reservoirs covering a trophic gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions were chosen to analyze bacterioplankton community structure these selected reservoirs included 14 oligo mesotrophic reservoirs 27 tsi 40 omrs 14 mesotrophic reservoirs 40 tsi 50 mrs and 14 eutrophic reservoirs tsi 50 ers the three trophic reservoir categories i e omrs mrs and ers have similar spatial distribution with pairwise distances between the reservoirs 56 km 2 2 dna extraction amplification sequencing and data processing genomic dna was extracted using dna isolation kits mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa and was purified using dna clean up kits mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa the v4 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified with primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and r806 3 taatctwtgggvhcatcag 5 in order to pool hundreds of samples in one illumina sequencing run a unique 12 mer tag was added to the 5 end of each primer for each dna sample three replicates of each sample were pcr amplified in a 50 μl reaction mixture which contained 25 μl 2x pcr premix taq 10 mm primer 60 ng of genomic dna and 20 μl of nuclease free water cycling conditions included 94 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 52 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the positive amplicons were quantified using the picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa and were purified with zymo s genomic dna clean concentrator kit zymo research corporation irvine ca usa finally amplicons were sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform miseq standard operating procedure kozich et al 2013 was applied to perform the analyses of raw reads of the 16s rrna gene sequences using the mothur software package v 1 36 1 http www mothur org briefly 1 the two sets of raw reads were combined 2 the sequences whose length inconsistent with the target region and the sequences containing any ambiguous bases pairs were eliminated 3 duplicate sequences were merged pre clustered and aligned to the silva v132 databases quast et al 2013 4 the chimeric sequences were removed by uchime algorithm 5 the clean sequences was classified using the silva v132 databases at the recommended bootstrap threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 6 lineages belonging to chloroplasts mitochondria archaea or eukaryotes were removed 7 the high quality sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level 8 otus occurring in less than 3 samples were excluded from the otu table to minimize bias caused by sequencing depth walters et al 2016 9 to correct for differences in sequencing depth the minimum number of sequences in the whole sample was subsampled for the further analyses kozich et al 2013 2 3 null model analysis and co occurrence network construction to uncover potential mechanisms underlying bacterioplankton metacommunity assemblages null model analyses were performed in our study the surveyed 42 reservoirs are located in the same geographical area the maximum pairwise distance between the reservoirs is less than 56 km and there is no geographic isolation fig 1 the bacterioplankton are therefore supposed to be able to disperse between any two reservoirs in the studied region and share the same species pool especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal is much more frequent through water flows lindström and östman 2011 according to chase et al 2011 null model analysis based on raup crick dissimilarity metric can be applied when comparisons are made among communities that share the same regional species pool chase et al 2011 therefore in our study the first null model analysis was performed based on the method proposed by chase et al 2011 the randomized process in the null model analysis was carried out by holding the otu richness at each sampling site alpha diversity and across all sites gamma diversity constant and replicated 999 times to obtain 999 null communities the modified raup crick dissimilarity metric was calculated and further visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds in primer 6 in the plot the communities that are closer together deviate more from the null expectation whereas the communities that are farther apart deviate less from the null expectations zhou et al 2014 to quantitatively assess the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in determining the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly a general null model based framework was further applied to calculate the modified stochasticity ratio mst and the normalized stochasticity ratio nst based on jaccard s similarity of bacterioplankton metacommunity structure by using the nst command in the nst package in r ning et al 2019 permutational multivariate anova tests were carried out to analyze the significant differences in mst and nst in different trophic categories i e omrs mrs and ers using the nst package in r ning et al 2019 in each of the three trophic categories i e omrs mrs and ers the 500 most abundant otus which accounted for 97 4 of the total omr sequences 97 8 of the total mr sequences and 96 1 of the total er sequences were selected for co occurrence network construction an ensemble approach that combined five different measures bray curtis and kullback leibler dissimilarities pearson and spearman correlations and mutual information was used to identify significant positive and negative interactions in the use of the cytoscape plugin conet http psbweb05 psb ugent be conet faust and raes 2016 this is the special strength of conet that combines multiple measures the reason behind this ensemble approach is because of the fact that different methods may cause different mistakes in this ensemble approach of multiple measures when erroneous edges made by one method are not supported by the others they can be filtered out and the number of false positives is thus reduced we calculated the 1 000 top positive and negative edges in the threshold setting menu for each network faust and raes 2016 p values were further computed from method and edge specific permutations and bootstrap score distributions with 1 000 iterations each measure specific p values were merged using brown s method and corrected for multiple testing by the benjamini hochberg method unstable edges with scores outside the 0 95 range of their bootstrap distribution were removed the obtained co occurrence networks were further visualized by cytoscape version 3 6 1 the topology of the resulting undirected network was calculated by the use of the tool network analyzer cytoscape and compared to an erdös rényi random network of similar size which was calculated by the tool network randomizer version 1 1 3 assenov et al 2008 because of the complexity of the overall networks the links between the otus nodes whose connectivity ranked in the top five of each network were chosen for display the distributions of the top five ranked otus across all reservoirs were further displayed in heat maps using the phyloseq package in r 2 4 statistical analyses the correlations between pairwise environmental factors and between tsi and phytoplankton community compositions were carried out using the function rcorr of the hmisc package in r the pcnm principal coordinates of neighborhood matrix method was used to transform geographical distances between any pair of sampling sites into rectangular data that were suitable for constrained ordination in the pcnm method the geographical distances were computed from the geodetic cartesian coordinates which were derived from latitude and longitude data using the function geoxy of the soda package a partial redundancy analysis rda based variance partitioning analysis vpa was performed to partition the variations in bccs into purely environment related purely geographical distance related and purely environment related and unexplained components van der gucht et al 2007 prior to vpa multicollinearity between environmental variables was performed using the variation inflation factor vif by the function vif cca in the vegan package only variables with vif 10 were included in further analyses borcard et al 2018 best subset of the variations with maximum correlation with bacterioplankton community dissimilarities was chosen by the bioenv procedure by the function bioenv in the vegan package borcard et al 2018 furthermore the vpa results were confirmed by rda based partial permutation tests canonical correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationships between bccs and environmental factors by an automatic stepwise model using permutation tests in the r vegan package a detrended correspondence analysis dca and permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices permanova were carried out to test the significant differences in the bccs of the studied reservoirs using the vegan package in r the distribution of the top abundant 30 otus across all reservoirs were shown on heat maps using the phyloseq package in r 2 5 accession number s the sequence data were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under accession number prjna721590 taxid 449393 3 results we investigated 42 reservoirs in a tropical coastal area the trophic state index tsi ranged from 27 to 83 covering a gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions the concentrations of nh4 po4 3 conductivity and salinity were significantly positively correlated with the tsi pearson correlation r 0 51 p 0 01 fig s1 phytoplankton community compositions pccs in the 42 reservoirs revealed that 24 of the phytoplankton biomass derived from bacillariophyta 40 from dinophyta 27 from chlorophyta 6 from cyanobacteria and the remaining 3 from chrysophyta euglenophyta and cryptophyta fig s2 in all oligo mesotrophic and half of the mesotrophic reservoirs the phytoplankton communities were mostly composed of dinophyta however in the eutrophic reservoirs phytoplankton communities were mainly composed of bacillariophyta dinophyta and cyanobacteria in 5 reservoirs by bacillariophyta dinophyta and chlorophyta in 4 reservoirs and by bacillariophyta chlorophyta and euglenophyta in 2 reservoirs fig s2 in addition among the detected phytoplankton bacillariophyta biomass had the highest correlation with tsi pearson correlation r 0 75 p 0 01 fig s3 followed by euglenophyta and cryptophyta pearson correlation r 0 51 p 0 01 fig s3 from the entire sample set totally 210 samples from the 42 reservoirs we obtained 9 057 665 quality sequences ranging from 18 508 to 90 089 per sample after quality control we retained 7 945 otus 97 of which were classifiable at phylum level a total of 48 phyla subphyla were identified including actinobacteria 21 1 of total sequences bacteroidetes 5 4 cyanobacteria 15 4 alphaproteobacteria 9 8 and gammaproteobacteria 28 0 in addition chloroflexi 3 4 planctomycetes 6 3 verrucomicrobia 5 9 patescibacteria 1 7 and deltaproteobacteria 0 6 were present in most sites but at relatively low abundances fig 2 when relating the best subset of water abiotic environmental factors tsi and do pccs bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria and geographical parameters pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm13 to the bccs fig s4a we found that pure abiotic environmental variables explained 11 8 of the variation in bccs whereas pure phytoplankton community compositions and pure geographical distances accounted for 5 6 and 3 5 respectively fig s4a rda based anova test showed that the pure effects of these three sets of variables were all significant p 0 01 among the best subset of abiotic environmental factors pccs and geographical parameters to the bccs tsi was found to be the best predictor of bccs followed by bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria biomass as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis cca fig s4b and partial mantel tests table s1 between the pairwise studied sites bcc dissimilarities and tsi differences followed a cubic binomial equation r 0 524 p 0 001 fig 3 a bcc turnover dissimilarities between pairwise sampling sites increased significantly with increasing tsi differences if tsi differences between sites were 20 however when tsi differences between sites were 20 bcc turnover retained an average value of 80 linear distance decay relationships were observed both between bcc similarities and pcc similarities r 0 434 p 0 001 fig 3b and between bcc similarities and geographical distance at a rate of 0 3 bcc dissimilarity per km r 0 251 p 0 001 fig 3c bacterioplankton metacommunity structure did not show any obvious geographical patterns fig 4 a but was arranged according to the trophic categories as oligo mesotrophic 27 tsi 40 omrs mesotrophic 40 tsi 50 mrs and eutrophic reservoirs tsi 50 ers fig 4b significant differences in bacterioplankton community structure were observed among these three trophic categories permanova f 17 479 p 0 001 table 1 and between all pairwise trophic categories permanova f 10 653 p 0 001 table 1 there were also significant differences in the β diversity of bacterioplankton communities among the trophic categories permutation anova f 640 52 p 0 01 fig 4c compared to those in oligo mesotrophic reservoirs significantly higher β diversity values of bacterioplankton communities were observed in eutrophic reservoirs in pairwise comparisons of bccs between sites pairwise permutation t tests p 0 05 fig 4c at phylum level we observed higher coefficients of variation cv of relative abundance for cyanobacteria gammaproteobacteria planctomycetes and other raw phyla in the eutrophic reservoirs than in the lower trophic categories fig s5 in addition half of the top 30 otus such as cyanobium from cyanobacteria limnobacter and polynucleobacter from gammaproteobacteria and pirellulaceae from planctomycetes also had higher cv of relative abundance in the eutrophic category fig s6 null model analysis based on the modified raup crick dissimilarity metric revealed that bacterioplankton communities in both the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic categories were less similar fig 5 a indicating that they were less deviant from the null expectation however the communities in the eutrophic category were less deviant fig 5a and differed markedly from the null expectation to further quantify the relative importance of deterministic vs stochastic processes in shaping the bacterioplankton community structure the modified stochasticity ratio mst was calculated the stochastic processes contributed on average 55 2 of the community variations in the oligo mesotrophic category however the roles of stochastic processes in controlling the community compositions decreased as eutrophication increased mst 45 6 for mrs and 27 1 for ers fig 5b because the results from the null model analyses are sensitive to the models approaches and algorithms used the normalized stochasticity ratio nst was also calculated and showed that the bacterioplankton community assembly was stochastic in both oligo mesotrophic nst 0 75 and mesotrophic nst 0 67 categories whereas it was more deterministic in the eutrophic reservoirs nst 0 29 permutational anova test f 547 91 p 0 01 fig 5c otu co occurrence patterns in each of the trophic categories were investigated by co occurrence network analysis table 2 there were a network of 381 nodes and 1 706 links for bccs in the oligo mesotrophic reservoirs a network of 396 nodes and 2 211 links in the mesotrophic reservoirs and a network of 423 nodes and 2 744 links in the eutrophic reservoirs table 2 the three networks fitted the power law model well r2 0 8 and were therefore scale free table 2 the clustering coefficients and characteristic path length were significantly different from those of the corresponding random networks with the same network size and average number of links table 2 indicating that the networks obtained in the different trophic categories showed small world characteristics in the three trophic categories we found that the co occurrence networks in the higher trophic categories tended to have more nodes and more links for both positive and negative correlations table 2 in comparison with the oligo mesotrophic reservoirs the co occurrence network in the higher trophic categories generally had a higher connectivity higher clustering coefficient higher closeness centrality higher degree higher centralization higher density higher heterogeneity and shorter path length table 2 fig 6 a b and c moreover the top ranked five nodes otus in the three co occurrence networks were completely different from each other fig 6d 4 discussion we investigated 210 samples collected at regional scale from 42 tropical reservoirs in a coastal area covering a trophic gradient from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions we found that the spatial pattern of bccs was dominantly shaped by species sorting rather than by mass effects or dispersal limitation among the environmental factors tsi was the key determinant of the bcc spatial pattern compared to the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs a significantly higher relative importance of deterministic processes and a higher heterogeneity of bacterioplankton communities were observed in the eutrophic tropical reservoirs 4 1 the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was dominantly shaped by species sorting in metacommunity theory dispersal plays an important role in determining the bacterioplankton community assembly among aquatic habitat patches leibold et al 2004 2010 high dispersal rates of bacterioplankton may lead to presence of bacterioplankton taxa in aquatic habitats that are less suitable for them and the bacterioplankton community assembly may thus show massive effects across habitat patches in contrast low dispersal rates of bacterioplankton may result in dispersal limitation leading to obvious spatial variations lindström and langenheder 2012 juračka et al 2016 different from mass effects and dispersal limitation species sorting of the bacterioplankton community assembly is the result of intermediate dispersal rates which provide the best conditions for environmental factors to determine the community compositions as there is a sufficient supply of taxa from the regional species pool to support species sorting viana et al 2016 in our regional study the reservoirs habitat patches were located within the same geographical area and some were inter connected temporarily or permanently the bacterioplankton are therefore able to disperse between the reservoirs especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal might be much more frequent through water flows between water interconnected reservoirs or by rain dust as well as seepage lindström and östman 2011 the dispersal among reservoirs however did not homogenize spatial patterns by mass effect in addition the bacterioplankton metacommunity structure did not show obvious dispersal limitation resulting in purely spatial patterns fig 4a in contrast significant heterogeneity of bccs was found across the three trophic categories omrs mrs and ers indicating that bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in the tropical coastal reservoirs complied with the scenario of species sorting that is selection of taxa by the prevailing environmental conditions this finding suggests that dispersal rates across the tropical reservoirs at a scale of 56 km were not high enough to have strong mass effects on the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly but high enough for most bacterial taxa to allow clear association between bccs and environmental variation yannarell et al 2003 the bacterial dispersal rates in our study sites might provide sufficient bacterial taxa from the same regional species pool to support species sorting in the local reservoirs van der gucht et al 2007 the high efficiency of species sorting in the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was probably due to the high population growth rates of bacteria van der gucht et al 2007 lindström and langenheder 2012 our results are inconsistent with that of reche et al 2005 who found that the spatial pattern of bccs was shaped by the location of water bodies in the sierra nevada compared with their lakes our reservoirs had stronger gradients in nutrients more importance of environmental filters and some were interconnected 4 2 tsi was the key determinant of the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly anthropogenic nutrient loading to reservoir from both point and nonpoint sources typically leads to reduced water quality and increased eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 wan et al 2021 changes in water environmental conditions and aquatic food webs and eutrophication induced occurrence of algal blooms in reservoir ecosystems shao et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 may influence the spatial pattern of bacterioplankton communities at regional scale where dispersal is not spatially limited in our study the trophic state index tsi was found to be the key determinant of bacterioplankton community structure across the 42 tropical reservoirs in the wet summer season greater nutrient and substrate demand of the bacterioplankton communities at high water temperatures average temperature during the sampling period ranged from 26 c to 32 c may lead to intense competition in substrate acquisition among the different bacterial populations moreover ultramicrobacteria that have a large specific surface area and thus possibly an advantage in substrate acquisition are believed to have a highly passive but successful lifestyle in highly dynamic and eutrophic freshwater environments boenigk et al 2004 in our study the relative abundance of taxa of the typical freshwater ultramicrobacteria including polynucleobacter gammaproteobacteria wu and hahn 2006 hahn et al 2012 the hgci clade actinobacteria tarao et al 2009 as well as picocyanobacteria cyanobium jezberová and komárková 2007 clearly increased in some of the eutrophic reservoirs fig s7 the phytoplankton communities were mostly composed of dinophyta in the totally oligo mesotrophic reservoirs as well as in half of the mesotrophic reservoirs however in the eutrophic reservoirs different assemblages occurred in some of those the assembly was mainly composed of bacillariophyta dinophyta and cyanobacteria in others it was dominated by bacillariophyta dinophyta and chlorophyta or bacillariophyta chlorophyta and euglenophyta fig s2 these between habitat differences in phytoplankton community compositions may lead to high variability in both ecosystem structure and environmental conditions and thus contribute to the heterogeneity in the bacterioplankton communities in the eutrophic environments yannarell et al 2003 accordingly we found a higher heterogeneity β diversity of bacterioplankton communities in the eutrophic reservoirs ers than in the two other trophic categories omrs and mrs 4 3 increased contribution by deterministic processes to the higher heterogeneity of bacterioplankton community across the eutrophic reservoirs higher bcc heterogeneity observed across the eutrophic reservoirs may be caused by community assembly mechanisms involving i purely stochastic processes including dispersal ecological drift and differential colonization extinction dynamics across localities i e reservoirs ii purely deterministic processes including environmental selection established by both abiotic and biotic factors this determines both the compositions and the relative abundance of bacterioplankton taxa and iii the interaction between stochastic and deterministic processes when stochastic variation in the history of colonization results in deterministic priority effects that vary across localities chase 2010 these factors can be integrated into the metacommunity framework that includes species sorting patch dynamics mass effects and neutral processes leibold et al 2004 in our study besides the deterministic species sorting neutral stochastic processes also contributed to the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in these tropical reservoirs null model analyses based on raup crick dissimilarity metric the modified stochasticity ratio as well as the normalized stochasticity ratio all revealed that the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was stochastic in both the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs and more deterministic in the eutrophic category increased heterogeneity with eutrophication probably reflects purely deterministic processes or be a result of interactions between stochastic and deterministic processes due to the higher heterogeneity in both abiotic and biotic factors in the eutrophic reservoirs higher variability in environmental conditions and phytoplankton compositions might also increase stochasticity in colonization history which can lead to priority effects deterministically resulting in high heterogeneity of bacterioplankton community structure as seen in other studies nemergut et al 2013 segre et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the dominance of deterministic processes in the eutrophic reservoirs was further confirmed by network analysis the co occurrence network had higher clustering coefficient higher degree and higher centralization in eutrophic reservoirs than in the oligo mesotrophic or mesotrophic reservoirs indicating a stronger effect of environmental filtering on the bacterioplankton community assembly in eutrophic reservoirs moreover in correspondence with higher bcc heterogeneity in more eutrophic categories higher heterogeneity of the co occurrence networks was also observed in the eutrophic category than in the oligo mesotrophic or mesotrophic categories 5 conclusion our results suggest that the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in the regional studied tropical reservoirs complied with the scenario of species sorting that is selection of taxa by the prevailing environmental conditions compared to oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs increased heterogeneity of co occurrence bacterioplankton networks and β diversity were observed across eutrophic reservoirs we propose that larger variation in phytoplankton community assembly across the eutrophic reservoirs may contribute to the deterministic processes in controlling the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and became the potential mechanisms behind the observed higher bacterioplankton heterogeneity in eutrophic reservoirs than those in reservoirs with lower tsi our research contributes to a broader understanding of the ecological effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems and benefits the

16813,understanding microbial metacommunity assembly and the underlying methanisms are fundamental objectives of aquatic ecology however little is known about how eutrophication the primary water quality issue of aquatic ecosystems regulates bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly at a regional scale in reservoirs in this study we applied a metacommunity framework to study bacterioplankton communities in 210 samples collected from 42 tropical coastal reservoirs in the wet summer season we found that the spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community compositions bccs at a regional scale was shaped mainly by species sorting the reservoir trophic state index tsi was the key determinant of bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly bcc turnover increased significantly with the tsi differences between sites tsi when tsi was 20 but remained at a level of about 80 when tsi was 20 compared to oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs increased heterogeneity of co occurrence bacterioplankton networks and bacterioplankton β diversity were observed across eutrophic reservoirs we propose that larger variation in phytoplankton community assembly may play directly or indirectly deterministic processes in controlling the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and became the potential mechanisms behind the observed higher bcc heterogeneity across the eutrophic reservoirs our research contributes to a broader understanding of the ecological effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems and provides clues to the management of the tropical coastal reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bacterioplankton community metacommunity approach species sorting eutrophication co occurrence network eutrophic reservoirs 1 introduction determining the processes underlying community assembly across aquatic ecosystems is a major research topic in aquatic ecology newton et al 2011 paver et al 2013 leboucher et al 2020 increasing evidence suggests that the spatial distribution of aquatic biological community compositions can be addressed by niche related deterministic and neutral stochastic processes chase and myers 2011 stegen et al 2012 dini andreote et al 2015 these two views are not mutually exclusive and their relative importance in determining the assembly of communities can be regulated by local environmental factors and regional spatial effects pavoine and bonsall 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 morrison whittle and goddard 2015 thompson et al 2020 to explain the interaction between local factors and regional processes the metacommunity concept leibold et al 2004 considers four major paradigms i species sorting assuming that dispersal is high enough to allow immigration to all patches but that local environmental conditions primarily influence community compositions ii patch dynamics assuming that community stucture is a result of colonization extinction dynamics among homogeneous patches iii mass effects assuming that massive immigration can rescue species from competitive exclusion and iv the neutral perspective assuming that community assembly are regulated by random colonization speciation dispersal and extinction events hubbell 2001 bacterioplankton are ubiquitous and essential to virtually all biogeochemical cycling processes in aquatic ecosystem processes because of high dispersal rates large population sizes fast growth rates and a propensity for dormancy the traditional hypothesis everything is everywhere but the environment selects baas becking 1934 presumes that the spatical distributions of aquatic bacterioplankton at a regional scale are not affected by dispersal barriers or historical events but by local interactions baas becking 1934 langenheder and ragnarsson 2007 van der gucht et al 2007 environmental factors characterizing local contemporary habitat conditions such as productivity chase 2010 environmental heterogeneity huber et al 2020 and spatical connectivity among patches mouquet and loreau 2003 declerck et al 2013 are the main determinant in the control of the spatial patterns of bacterioplankton at regional scals however recent studies suggest that also regional factors such as mass effect and dispersal limitation are important for the assembly of local bacterioplankton communities lindström and langenheder 2012 leboucher et al 2020 wan et al 2021 there are many studies of bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly at regional scales in natural lakes rivers as well as seawater haggerty and dinsdale 2017 ren et al 2019 chen et al 2019 huber et al 2020 ortiz álvarez et al 2020 however the knowledge of reservoir ecosystems is far from comprehensive xue et al 2018 liu et al 2019 their response may differ as they occupy an intermediate position between rivers and natural lakes in terms of morphological and hydrological features nutrient inputs and internal nutrient cycling jones et al 2019 aguirrezabala campano et al 2021 in contrast to natural lake ecosystems reservoirs are moreover hydrologically managed and often interconnected systems straškraba et al 1993 zarfl et al 2015 hu et al 2017 water flows between reservoirs might reduce or mask the effect of species sorting in structuring bacterioplankton metacommunities since the high dispersal rate of organisms can result in source sink dynamics lindström and langenheder 2012 leboucher et al 2020 liu et al 2020 the allied influences of water flows local environmental factors and regional spatial effects need to be further investigated to elucidate whether these factors can affect the assembly of bacterioplankton metacommunities at regional scale which might benefit the protection and management of reservoir ecosystems to investigate the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and the underlying mechanisms in reservoir ecosystems at a regional scale we sampled a set of coastal reservoirs located in the same geographical area around the coastal city zhuhai located in the guangdong province china because of the increasing demand for water sources many reservoirs were built in the areas during the 1950s as natural lakes are rare han and dumont 2011 anthropogenic nutrient loading i e point and nonpoint input of phosphorus and nitrogen to reservoir ecosystems owing to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production typically led to increases in eutrophication han and dumont 2011 tang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 this eutrophication has seriously affected the water quality aquatic food webs and occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the reservoirs shao et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 such changes may have many direct and indirect effects on the assembly of bacterioplankton metacommunities at a regional scale where dispersal may not be spatially limited local interactions are therefore expected to be dominant in shaping bacterioplankton metacommunity patterns as predicted by the species sorting metacommunity model lindström and langenheder 2012 thompson et al 2020 moreover eutrophication might increase the deterministic processes of the bacterioplankton community assembly across reservoirs resulting in larger variation in bacterioplankton communnity compositions bccs however the effect of species sorting on structuring the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly might be reduced or masked by bacterioplankton dispersal between coastal reservoirs especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal through water flows might be much more frequent in water interconnected reservoirs or by rain dust and seepage in this study we 1 elucidated which of the four metacommunity models that best predicted the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in tropical coastal reservoir ecosystems at a regional scale 2 tested whether eutrophication acts as a key determinant in shaping bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and causes shifts in bccs across the reservoirs at a regional scale to answer these questions we used a metacommunity appoach to study bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and the underlying determining mechanisms based on 16s rrna high throughput sequencing of the 210 samples collected from 42 tropical coastal reservoirs located in the same geographical area around the coastal city zhuhai guangdong province china sampled in a wet summer season 2 methods and materials 2 1 sample collection and measurement of environmental factors during july and august 2018 we collected water samples from reservoirs located around the city of zhuhai located in the guangdong province china fig 1 in each reservoir bacterial samples 1 to 2 l water were collected from surface waters the top 50 cm at 5 sampling points and filtered through 0 2 μm pore size isopore filters millipore billerica ma usa the filters were stored at 20 c for further analyses water environmental factors including ph temperature t salinity sali conductivity cond and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ at each sampling point using a ysi multi probe meter yellow springs oh usa and transparency sd was also determined in the field using a secchi disk a 1 l water sample was collected under the surface for chemical analyses including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonium nh4 n phosphate po4 3 p and chlorophyll a chla all chemical analyses were performed according to standard methods greenberg et al 1992 additionally historical data on the area and the capacity of the studied reservoirs were obtained water samples for phytoplankton community analysis were preserved with 1 lugol s solution phytoplankton was counted using an utermöhl chamber and an inverted microscope and biomass were estimated from geometrical shapes utermöhl 1958 furthermore a trophic state index tsi inspired from carlson 1977 was calculated for each reservoir based on the concentration of tp tn chla and sd based on the tsi values 42 reservoirs covering a trophic gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions were chosen to analyze bacterioplankton community structure these selected reservoirs included 14 oligo mesotrophic reservoirs 27 tsi 40 omrs 14 mesotrophic reservoirs 40 tsi 50 mrs and 14 eutrophic reservoirs tsi 50 ers the three trophic reservoir categories i e omrs mrs and ers have similar spatial distribution with pairwise distances between the reservoirs 56 km 2 2 dna extraction amplification sequencing and data processing genomic dna was extracted using dna isolation kits mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa and was purified using dna clean up kits mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa the v4 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified with primers f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and r806 3 taatctwtgggvhcatcag 5 in order to pool hundreds of samples in one illumina sequencing run a unique 12 mer tag was added to the 5 end of each primer for each dna sample three replicates of each sample were pcr amplified in a 50 μl reaction mixture which contained 25 μl 2x pcr premix taq 10 mm primer 60 ng of genomic dna and 20 μl of nuclease free water cycling conditions included 94 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 52 c for 30 s extension at 72 c for 30 s and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the positive amplicons were quantified using the picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa and were purified with zymo s genomic dna clean concentrator kit zymo research corporation irvine ca usa finally amplicons were sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform miseq standard operating procedure kozich et al 2013 was applied to perform the analyses of raw reads of the 16s rrna gene sequences using the mothur software package v 1 36 1 http www mothur org briefly 1 the two sets of raw reads were combined 2 the sequences whose length inconsistent with the target region and the sequences containing any ambiguous bases pairs were eliminated 3 duplicate sequences were merged pre clustered and aligned to the silva v132 databases quast et al 2013 4 the chimeric sequences were removed by uchime algorithm 5 the clean sequences was classified using the silva v132 databases at the recommended bootstrap threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 6 lineages belonging to chloroplasts mitochondria archaea or eukaryotes were removed 7 the high quality sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level 8 otus occurring in less than 3 samples were excluded from the otu table to minimize bias caused by sequencing depth walters et al 2016 9 to correct for differences in sequencing depth the minimum number of sequences in the whole sample was subsampled for the further analyses kozich et al 2013 2 3 null model analysis and co occurrence network construction to uncover potential mechanisms underlying bacterioplankton metacommunity assemblages null model analyses were performed in our study the surveyed 42 reservoirs are located in the same geographical area the maximum pairwise distance between the reservoirs is less than 56 km and there is no geographic isolation fig 1 the bacterioplankton are therefore supposed to be able to disperse between any two reservoirs in the studied region and share the same species pool especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal is much more frequent through water flows lindström and östman 2011 according to chase et al 2011 null model analysis based on raup crick dissimilarity metric can be applied when comparisons are made among communities that share the same regional species pool chase et al 2011 therefore in our study the first null model analysis was performed based on the method proposed by chase et al 2011 the randomized process in the null model analysis was carried out by holding the otu richness at each sampling site alpha diversity and across all sites gamma diversity constant and replicated 999 times to obtain 999 null communities the modified raup crick dissimilarity metric was calculated and further visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds in primer 6 in the plot the communities that are closer together deviate more from the null expectation whereas the communities that are farther apart deviate less from the null expectations zhou et al 2014 to quantitatively assess the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in determining the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly a general null model based framework was further applied to calculate the modified stochasticity ratio mst and the normalized stochasticity ratio nst based on jaccard s similarity of bacterioplankton metacommunity structure by using the nst command in the nst package in r ning et al 2019 permutational multivariate anova tests were carried out to analyze the significant differences in mst and nst in different trophic categories i e omrs mrs and ers using the nst package in r ning et al 2019 in each of the three trophic categories i e omrs mrs and ers the 500 most abundant otus which accounted for 97 4 of the total omr sequences 97 8 of the total mr sequences and 96 1 of the total er sequences were selected for co occurrence network construction an ensemble approach that combined five different measures bray curtis and kullback leibler dissimilarities pearson and spearman correlations and mutual information was used to identify significant positive and negative interactions in the use of the cytoscape plugin conet http psbweb05 psb ugent be conet faust and raes 2016 this is the special strength of conet that combines multiple measures the reason behind this ensemble approach is because of the fact that different methods may cause different mistakes in this ensemble approach of multiple measures when erroneous edges made by one method are not supported by the others they can be filtered out and the number of false positives is thus reduced we calculated the 1 000 top positive and negative edges in the threshold setting menu for each network faust and raes 2016 p values were further computed from method and edge specific permutations and bootstrap score distributions with 1 000 iterations each measure specific p values were merged using brown s method and corrected for multiple testing by the benjamini hochberg method unstable edges with scores outside the 0 95 range of their bootstrap distribution were removed the obtained co occurrence networks were further visualized by cytoscape version 3 6 1 the topology of the resulting undirected network was calculated by the use of the tool network analyzer cytoscape and compared to an erdös rényi random network of similar size which was calculated by the tool network randomizer version 1 1 3 assenov et al 2008 because of the complexity of the overall networks the links between the otus nodes whose connectivity ranked in the top five of each network were chosen for display the distributions of the top five ranked otus across all reservoirs were further displayed in heat maps using the phyloseq package in r 2 4 statistical analyses the correlations between pairwise environmental factors and between tsi and phytoplankton community compositions were carried out using the function rcorr of the hmisc package in r the pcnm principal coordinates of neighborhood matrix method was used to transform geographical distances between any pair of sampling sites into rectangular data that were suitable for constrained ordination in the pcnm method the geographical distances were computed from the geodetic cartesian coordinates which were derived from latitude and longitude data using the function geoxy of the soda package a partial redundancy analysis rda based variance partitioning analysis vpa was performed to partition the variations in bccs into purely environment related purely geographical distance related and purely environment related and unexplained components van der gucht et al 2007 prior to vpa multicollinearity between environmental variables was performed using the variation inflation factor vif by the function vif cca in the vegan package only variables with vif 10 were included in further analyses borcard et al 2018 best subset of the variations with maximum correlation with bacterioplankton community dissimilarities was chosen by the bioenv procedure by the function bioenv in the vegan package borcard et al 2018 furthermore the vpa results were confirmed by rda based partial permutation tests canonical correlation analysis was performed to analyze the relationships between bccs and environmental factors by an automatic stepwise model using permutation tests in the r vegan package a detrended correspondence analysis dca and permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices permanova were carried out to test the significant differences in the bccs of the studied reservoirs using the vegan package in r the distribution of the top abundant 30 otus across all reservoirs were shown on heat maps using the phyloseq package in r 2 5 accession number s the sequence data were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra under accession number prjna721590 taxid 449393 3 results we investigated 42 reservoirs in a tropical coastal area the trophic state index tsi ranged from 27 to 83 covering a gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions the concentrations of nh4 po4 3 conductivity and salinity were significantly positively correlated with the tsi pearson correlation r 0 51 p 0 01 fig s1 phytoplankton community compositions pccs in the 42 reservoirs revealed that 24 of the phytoplankton biomass derived from bacillariophyta 40 from dinophyta 27 from chlorophyta 6 from cyanobacteria and the remaining 3 from chrysophyta euglenophyta and cryptophyta fig s2 in all oligo mesotrophic and half of the mesotrophic reservoirs the phytoplankton communities were mostly composed of dinophyta however in the eutrophic reservoirs phytoplankton communities were mainly composed of bacillariophyta dinophyta and cyanobacteria in 5 reservoirs by bacillariophyta dinophyta and chlorophyta in 4 reservoirs and by bacillariophyta chlorophyta and euglenophyta in 2 reservoirs fig s2 in addition among the detected phytoplankton bacillariophyta biomass had the highest correlation with tsi pearson correlation r 0 75 p 0 01 fig s3 followed by euglenophyta and cryptophyta pearson correlation r 0 51 p 0 01 fig s3 from the entire sample set totally 210 samples from the 42 reservoirs we obtained 9 057 665 quality sequences ranging from 18 508 to 90 089 per sample after quality control we retained 7 945 otus 97 of which were classifiable at phylum level a total of 48 phyla subphyla were identified including actinobacteria 21 1 of total sequences bacteroidetes 5 4 cyanobacteria 15 4 alphaproteobacteria 9 8 and gammaproteobacteria 28 0 in addition chloroflexi 3 4 planctomycetes 6 3 verrucomicrobia 5 9 patescibacteria 1 7 and deltaproteobacteria 0 6 were present in most sites but at relatively low abundances fig 2 when relating the best subset of water abiotic environmental factors tsi and do pccs bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria and geographical parameters pcnm1 pcnm2 pcnm13 to the bccs fig s4a we found that pure abiotic environmental variables explained 11 8 of the variation in bccs whereas pure phytoplankton community compositions and pure geographical distances accounted for 5 6 and 3 5 respectively fig s4a rda based anova test showed that the pure effects of these three sets of variables were all significant p 0 01 among the best subset of abiotic environmental factors pccs and geographical parameters to the bccs tsi was found to be the best predictor of bccs followed by bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria biomass as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis cca fig s4b and partial mantel tests table s1 between the pairwise studied sites bcc dissimilarities and tsi differences followed a cubic binomial equation r 0 524 p 0 001 fig 3 a bcc turnover dissimilarities between pairwise sampling sites increased significantly with increasing tsi differences if tsi differences between sites were 20 however when tsi differences between sites were 20 bcc turnover retained an average value of 80 linear distance decay relationships were observed both between bcc similarities and pcc similarities r 0 434 p 0 001 fig 3b and between bcc similarities and geographical distance at a rate of 0 3 bcc dissimilarity per km r 0 251 p 0 001 fig 3c bacterioplankton metacommunity structure did not show any obvious geographical patterns fig 4 a but was arranged according to the trophic categories as oligo mesotrophic 27 tsi 40 omrs mesotrophic 40 tsi 50 mrs and eutrophic reservoirs tsi 50 ers fig 4b significant differences in bacterioplankton community structure were observed among these three trophic categories permanova f 17 479 p 0 001 table 1 and between all pairwise trophic categories permanova f 10 653 p 0 001 table 1 there were also significant differences in the β diversity of bacterioplankton communities among the trophic categories permutation anova f 640 52 p 0 01 fig 4c compared to those in oligo mesotrophic reservoirs significantly higher β diversity values of bacterioplankton communities were observed in eutrophic reservoirs in pairwise comparisons of bccs between sites pairwise permutation t tests p 0 05 fig 4c at phylum level we observed higher coefficients of variation cv of relative abundance for cyanobacteria gammaproteobacteria planctomycetes and other raw phyla in the eutrophic reservoirs than in the lower trophic categories fig s5 in addition half of the top 30 otus such as cyanobium from cyanobacteria limnobacter and polynucleobacter from gammaproteobacteria and pirellulaceae from planctomycetes also had higher cv of relative abundance in the eutrophic category fig s6 null model analysis based on the modified raup crick dissimilarity metric revealed that bacterioplankton communities in both the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic categories were less similar fig 5 a indicating that they were less deviant from the null expectation however the communities in the eutrophic category were less deviant fig 5a and differed markedly from the null expectation to further quantify the relative importance of deterministic vs stochastic processes in shaping the bacterioplankton community structure the modified stochasticity ratio mst was calculated the stochastic processes contributed on average 55 2 of the community variations in the oligo mesotrophic category however the roles of stochastic processes in controlling the community compositions decreased as eutrophication increased mst 45 6 for mrs and 27 1 for ers fig 5b because the results from the null model analyses are sensitive to the models approaches and algorithms used the normalized stochasticity ratio nst was also calculated and showed that the bacterioplankton community assembly was stochastic in both oligo mesotrophic nst 0 75 and mesotrophic nst 0 67 categories whereas it was more deterministic in the eutrophic reservoirs nst 0 29 permutational anova test f 547 91 p 0 01 fig 5c otu co occurrence patterns in each of the trophic categories were investigated by co occurrence network analysis table 2 there were a network of 381 nodes and 1 706 links for bccs in the oligo mesotrophic reservoirs a network of 396 nodes and 2 211 links in the mesotrophic reservoirs and a network of 423 nodes and 2 744 links in the eutrophic reservoirs table 2 the three networks fitted the power law model well r2 0 8 and were therefore scale free table 2 the clustering coefficients and characteristic path length were significantly different from those of the corresponding random networks with the same network size and average number of links table 2 indicating that the networks obtained in the different trophic categories showed small world characteristics in the three trophic categories we found that the co occurrence networks in the higher trophic categories tended to have more nodes and more links for both positive and negative correlations table 2 in comparison with the oligo mesotrophic reservoirs the co occurrence network in the higher trophic categories generally had a higher connectivity higher clustering coefficient higher closeness centrality higher degree higher centralization higher density higher heterogeneity and shorter path length table 2 fig 6 a b and c moreover the top ranked five nodes otus in the three co occurrence networks were completely different from each other fig 6d 4 discussion we investigated 210 samples collected at regional scale from 42 tropical reservoirs in a coastal area covering a trophic gradient from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions we found that the spatial pattern of bccs was dominantly shaped by species sorting rather than by mass effects or dispersal limitation among the environmental factors tsi was the key determinant of the bcc spatial pattern compared to the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs a significantly higher relative importance of deterministic processes and a higher heterogeneity of bacterioplankton communities were observed in the eutrophic tropical reservoirs 4 1 the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was dominantly shaped by species sorting in metacommunity theory dispersal plays an important role in determining the bacterioplankton community assembly among aquatic habitat patches leibold et al 2004 2010 high dispersal rates of bacterioplankton may lead to presence of bacterioplankton taxa in aquatic habitats that are less suitable for them and the bacterioplankton community assembly may thus show massive effects across habitat patches in contrast low dispersal rates of bacterioplankton may result in dispersal limitation leading to obvious spatial variations lindström and langenheder 2012 juračka et al 2016 different from mass effects and dispersal limitation species sorting of the bacterioplankton community assembly is the result of intermediate dispersal rates which provide the best conditions for environmental factors to determine the community compositions as there is a sufficient supply of taxa from the regional species pool to support species sorting viana et al 2016 in our regional study the reservoirs habitat patches were located within the same geographical area and some were inter connected temporarily or permanently the bacterioplankton are therefore able to disperse between the reservoirs especially in the tropical wet season when dispersal might be much more frequent through water flows between water interconnected reservoirs or by rain dust as well as seepage lindström and östman 2011 the dispersal among reservoirs however did not homogenize spatial patterns by mass effect in addition the bacterioplankton metacommunity structure did not show obvious dispersal limitation resulting in purely spatial patterns fig 4a in contrast significant heterogeneity of bccs was found across the three trophic categories omrs mrs and ers indicating that bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in the tropical coastal reservoirs complied with the scenario of species sorting that is selection of taxa by the prevailing environmental conditions this finding suggests that dispersal rates across the tropical reservoirs at a scale of 56 km were not high enough to have strong mass effects on the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly but high enough for most bacterial taxa to allow clear association between bccs and environmental variation yannarell et al 2003 the bacterial dispersal rates in our study sites might provide sufficient bacterial taxa from the same regional species pool to support species sorting in the local reservoirs van der gucht et al 2007 the high efficiency of species sorting in the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was probably due to the high population growth rates of bacteria van der gucht et al 2007 lindström and langenheder 2012 our results are inconsistent with that of reche et al 2005 who found that the spatial pattern of bccs was shaped by the location of water bodies in the sierra nevada compared with their lakes our reservoirs had stronger gradients in nutrients more importance of environmental filters and some were interconnected 4 2 tsi was the key determinant of the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly anthropogenic nutrient loading to reservoir from both point and nonpoint sources typically leads to reduced water quality and increased eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 wan et al 2021 changes in water environmental conditions and aquatic food webs and eutrophication induced occurrence of algal blooms in reservoir ecosystems shao et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 may influence the spatial pattern of bacterioplankton communities at regional scale where dispersal is not spatially limited in our study the trophic state index tsi was found to be the key determinant of bacterioplankton community structure across the 42 tropical reservoirs in the wet summer season greater nutrient and substrate demand of the bacterioplankton communities at high water temperatures average temperature during the sampling period ranged from 26 c to 32 c may lead to intense competition in substrate acquisition among the different bacterial populations moreover ultramicrobacteria that have a large specific surface area and thus possibly an advantage in substrate acquisition are believed to have a highly passive but successful lifestyle in highly dynamic and eutrophic freshwater environments boenigk et al 2004 in our study the relative abundance of taxa of the typical freshwater ultramicrobacteria including polynucleobacter gammaproteobacteria wu and hahn 2006 hahn et al 2012 the hgci clade actinobacteria tarao et al 2009 as well as picocyanobacteria cyanobium jezberová and komárková 2007 clearly increased in some of the eutrophic reservoirs fig s7 the phytoplankton communities were mostly composed of dinophyta in the totally oligo mesotrophic reservoirs as well as in half of the mesotrophic reservoirs however in the eutrophic reservoirs different assemblages occurred in some of those the assembly was mainly composed of bacillariophyta dinophyta and cyanobacteria in others it was dominated by bacillariophyta dinophyta and chlorophyta or bacillariophyta chlorophyta and euglenophyta fig s2 these between habitat differences in phytoplankton community compositions may lead to high variability in both ecosystem structure and environmental conditions and thus contribute to the heterogeneity in the bacterioplankton communities in the eutrophic environments yannarell et al 2003 accordingly we found a higher heterogeneity β diversity of bacterioplankton communities in the eutrophic reservoirs ers than in the two other trophic categories omrs and mrs 4 3 increased contribution by deterministic processes to the higher heterogeneity of bacterioplankton community across the eutrophic reservoirs higher bcc heterogeneity observed across the eutrophic reservoirs may be caused by community assembly mechanisms involving i purely stochastic processes including dispersal ecological drift and differential colonization extinction dynamics across localities i e reservoirs ii purely deterministic processes including environmental selection established by both abiotic and biotic factors this determines both the compositions and the relative abundance of bacterioplankton taxa and iii the interaction between stochastic and deterministic processes when stochastic variation in the history of colonization results in deterministic priority effects that vary across localities chase 2010 these factors can be integrated into the metacommunity framework that includes species sorting patch dynamics mass effects and neutral processes leibold et al 2004 in our study besides the deterministic species sorting neutral stochastic processes also contributed to the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in these tropical reservoirs null model analyses based on raup crick dissimilarity metric the modified stochasticity ratio as well as the normalized stochasticity ratio all revealed that the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly was stochastic in both the oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs and more deterministic in the eutrophic category increased heterogeneity with eutrophication probably reflects purely deterministic processes or be a result of interactions between stochastic and deterministic processes due to the higher heterogeneity in both abiotic and biotic factors in the eutrophic reservoirs higher variability in environmental conditions and phytoplankton compositions might also increase stochasticity in colonization history which can lead to priority effects deterministically resulting in high heterogeneity of bacterioplankton community structure as seen in other studies nemergut et al 2013 segre et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 the dominance of deterministic processes in the eutrophic reservoirs was further confirmed by network analysis the co occurrence network had higher clustering coefficient higher degree and higher centralization in eutrophic reservoirs than in the oligo mesotrophic or mesotrophic reservoirs indicating a stronger effect of environmental filtering on the bacterioplankton community assembly in eutrophic reservoirs moreover in correspondence with higher bcc heterogeneity in more eutrophic categories higher heterogeneity of the co occurrence networks was also observed in the eutrophic category than in the oligo mesotrophic or mesotrophic categories 5 conclusion our results suggest that the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly in the regional studied tropical reservoirs complied with the scenario of species sorting that is selection of taxa by the prevailing environmental conditions compared to oligo mesotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs increased heterogeneity of co occurrence bacterioplankton networks and β diversity were observed across eutrophic reservoirs we propose that larger variation in phytoplankton community assembly across the eutrophic reservoirs may contribute to the deterministic processes in controlling the bacterioplankton metacommunity assembly and became the potential mechanisms behind the observed higher bacterioplankton heterogeneity in eutrophic reservoirs than those in reservoirs with lower tsi our research contributes to a broader understanding of the ecological effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems and benefits the management of the tropical eutrophic reservoirs during which the local conditions should be considered since the reservoir heterogeneity and their strong deterministic effects in structuring aquatic biological communities supplementary information mmc1 docx author contribution lijuan ren bo ping han erik jeppesen conceived the study analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript jiexiang zhang

nitrogen from the low covalence state organic compound and ammonium to nitrate reduce nitrate to nitrite and eventually detect total nitrite using a colorimetric assay there are many ways of nitrogen digestion including kjeldahl method bremner et al 1996 microwave method colina and gardiner 1999 johnes and heathwaite 1992 uvc thermal oxidation hong 1999 kroon 1993 and high temperature catalytic combustion tingvall 1978 walsh 1989 among them uvc thermal digestion is the most effective and eco friendly method it relies on mild chemicals with less toxicity consumes fewer reagents but can oxidize organics thoroughly and quickly bronk et al 2000 frankovich and jones 1998 roig et al 1999 thomas et al 1997 herein we designed a fully integrated analytical system based on the uvc thermal digestion and colorimetric determination for quantitative analysis of tn fig 2 shows the portable tn analytical system which is composed of a reaction chamber for nitrogen digestion and reduction and an optical detection chamber for total nitrite determination in the chambers the cases holders and holding slots were designed using solidworks solidworks corporation out sourced by a 3d printer i3 prusa and assembled with electronic components as a miniaturized uvc thermal digestion method this reaction chamber consists of a uvc illumination lamp and a temperature controlling system fig 2 a before the uvc thermal digestion the sample solutions were prepared in two 4 well strips which were split from a standard 8 well strip fig 2 b shows that each 4 well strip employs three reservoirs for the tn measurement thus allowing the testing of six samples in total on the two 4 well strips one reservoir nearest to the fan was filled with water as the control group and can also help maintain the humidity and reduce solution loss in high temperature and ventilation the uvc illumination unit u shaped dual lamps has peak radiation at 254 nm and can act as an effective nitrogen digestion source in an aqueous environment a voltage power inverter was coupled with the lamp to convert the supply voltage from 5 v to 675 v which could ignite the mercury in the uvc lamp and help reveal ultraviolet at a peak wavelength of 254 nm fig 2 a shows that two sample holding slots were created to fit two standard 4 well strips and radially arrange them at a 1 cm distance to the uvc bulb center the u shaped dual lamp design of this uvc bulb ensures equal and sufficient digestion of organic nitrogen in each 4 well strip within a short reaction time the heat was produced from uvc illumination and a heating pad a temperature sensor and an electronic fan were integrated to precisely control the temperature the temperature control system was designed by integrating a low voltage heating pad a temperature sensor and an electronic ventilation fan the heating pad 5 cm 10 cm is wrapped around the 3d printed holder with a radius of 4 cm fig 2 a and the ventilation fan is placed at the end of the holder center the temperature is precisely monitored by the arduino microcontroller and temperature sensor forming negative feedback regulation of the heating by heating pad and cooling by ventilation fan at 3 c precision such design considerations were made to maintain a uniform temperature environment and ensure reaction repeatability of the uvc thermal method the detection chamber was designed according to the shape and size of the 4 well strip fig 2 a shows the main components of the nitrite detection chamber three sets of led photodetector couples were utilized to accommodate three reaction reservoirs each led photodetector couple consists of four small leds and one integrated photodetector placed in the center of four leds the leds have four independent illumination spectra with the wavelength peak lying at 470 nm blue led 520 nm green led 580 nm yellow led and 630 nm red led these spectra cover absorbance peaks of typical colorimetrical assays chen et al 2014 czugala et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 the photodetectors integrate rgb sensors covering the whole visible light spectrum and are able to quantify light intensity through the solution rapidly and simultaneously by reading and differentiating the signals from these leds the microcontroller helps select the most sensitive wavelength for a particular colorimetric assay to better assist on site tn measurement a smartphone application app was created which features bluetooth communication data collection and analysis and mapping of testing locations on google map through the mobile network this app can also transmit testing data through text messaging which ensures tele transmission capabilities in rural areas and developing countries lacking communication facilities internet the material cost of this system is cad 95 2 3 assay protocols the principle of tn detection is to first convert organic nitrogen and ammonium to nitrate reduce the nitrate to nitrite and finally perform colorimetric measurement on the nitrite in a typical experiment a solution was prepared in each reservoir 3 reservoirs used in the 4 well strip by adding 20 µl of nitrogen sample solution 2 µl of potassium persulfate 175 mm 3 µl of naoh solution 100 mm into high performance liquid chromatography hplc water to obtain a final volume of 120 µl 120 µl of water was filled into the fourth reservoir to maintain the humidity during oxidation this preparation was repeated for another 4 well strip two strips were then slid into the holding slots of the reaction chamber which was pre heated at 35 c the oxidation was started by the ignition of the uvc lamp irradiation of 20 min was conducted for nitrogen oxidation nitrogen samples were oxidized by potassium persulfate under uvc irradiation eqs 1 4 illustrate the oxidation mechanism in the equations oh represents a hydroxyl radical which is the neutral form of the hydroxide ion oh hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive which could act as a strong oxidizer in this study hydroxyl radicals were utilized to oxidize the nitrogen at low covalence status to nitrate ions during the uvc illumination persulfate was first decomposed to two sulfate ion radicals and simultaneously a water molecule was decomposed and generated one hydroxyl radical the sulfate ion radical was then converted to sulfate ion and one hydroxyl radical next nitrogen at low covalence status was oxidized to nitrate ions with the aid of abundant hydroxyl radicals 1 s 2 o 8 h v 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o h v h oh 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ohâ h 4 ohâ r 2 n r 1 n o 3 after the digestion total nitrogen and ammonium had all been turned into nitrate ions thus the water sample remained nitrate and nitrite as the final forms of nitrogen simultaneously the uvc lamp was turned off to create a dark environment and the fan was turned on for 2 min to lower the temperature of the reaction chamber the reaction chamber would later be used for the incubation of nitrate reduction to determine the total nitrate and nitrite a modified epa standard method was adopted for nitrate nitrite determination fig 3 a shows the reaction mechanism of this assay protocol in brief a reductant solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of reagent a 0 14 mm of cuso4 and 5 mm of znso4 reagent b 1 m of naoh and reagent c 4 mm of hydrazine sulfate this kind of mixing is to further reduce the assay time and pipetting procedure without sacrificing the reaction efficiency 60 µl of the mixed reductant solution was added in each reaction reservoir and allowed for 5 min incubation afterward 75 µl of sulfanilamide hcl solution 10 g l sulfanilamide in 3 5 m hcl was added to neutralize the reduction reaction followed by adding 20 µl of nedd 1 g l the final solution was incubated in the dark environment for 5 min for color development with the aid of nedd it generated a product of azo dye of which the peak wavelength absorption lies at 538 nm fig 3 b the absorbance for each reaction reservoir was then collected by the optical detection chamber in fig 2 a 3 results and discussion the determination of total nitrogen involves nitrogen oxidation nitrate reduction and total nitrite colorimetric reaction thorough experiments were performed to optimize the assay protocol to achieve satisfactory sensitivity and accuracy in the miniaturized environment 3 1 optimization of nitrogen digestion the digestion efficiency is the key factor to accurately monitor low covalence nitrogen organic nitrogen and ammonium among total nitrogen to improve the digestion rate it is necessary to optimize the oxidation parameters including oxidation time reaction temperature oxidizer concentration ph level and substrate buffer 15 30 µl of glycine solution 600 µm was used as a model to analyze the oxidation effect under varied reaction environment and oxidizer concentrations the temperature values of 30 c 35 c 40 c 50 c and 60 c were investigated in this miniaturized uvc thermal method fig 4 a shows the experimental results of temperature optimization within those temperatures the corresponding absorbance was relatively constant at around 0 92 no significant change was found in the oxidation effect with increasing incubation temperature uvc illumination can generate heat it was noted that the temperature of the reaction chamber was stabilized at 35 c after uvc illumination for 5 min as this temperature provided the optimal condition no further temperature control was needed in the digestion reaction here fig 4 b illustrates the digestion rate reflected by absorbance under various oxidation time the optimal duration was found to be 20 min with an absorbance of 1 4 that was much higher than the values with shorter or longer incubation time shorter oxidation time may cause incomplete oxidation reaction however the absorbance decreases to 1 25 at a longer reaction time e g 32 min the reason may lie in the large evaporation of sample solution after a long time exposure which led to less volume less light absorption during colorimetric determination afterward the substrate effect was investigated between the borate buffer and water fig 4 c shows that no significant difference was found within them borate buffer was preferred as it could help eliminate the ph effect from analyzed samples from eqs 1 and 2 hydroxyl radicals oh generated from water molecules h2o and persulfate s2o8 are the main oxidizer in the nitrogen redox reaction thus it is crucial to monitor the contents of ph and persulfate and provide adequate oh for the oxidation of low covalence nitrogen eqs 3 and 4 naoh 100 mm was added to the oxidation solution as a ph regulator its volume was tuned from 0 to 12 µl to find the optimal value fig 4 d shows the ph adjustment results during the digestion process reflected by absorbance at the volume of 3 µl the absorbance reached as high as 1 1 and decreased at a lower or higher volume thus it can be concluded that 3 µl of naoh 100 mm provided the optimum ph environment for the best oxidation rate after fixing the naoh concentration the content of potassium persulfate 175 mm was tested under a series of volumes from 0 to 6 µl fig 4 e reflected by absorbance the optimum oxidation rate was found at the volume of 2 µl it was noted that lower concentrated persulfate provided inadequate oxidizer while higher concentrated persulfate would suppress the reaction rate thus with the above experiments the following oxidation condition was adopted in the subsequent experiments temperature 35 c oxidation time 20 min substrate borate buffer ph 3 µl 100 mm naoh and oxidizer 2 µl 175 mm potassium persulfate 3 2 colorimetric assay optimization after nitrogen digestion organic nitrogen and ammonium had been converted to nitrate and nitrite as the remaining format of nitrogen the nitrogen products were then processed with standard epa nitrate nitrite colorimetric reaction fig 3 a shows that nitrate will firstly be reduced to nitrite under the assistance of cuso4 znso4 hydrazine sulfate will be added to neutralize the reduction solution total nitrite will transform to diazonium salt and further and is then converted to azo product after the addition of nedd the azo product has a peak absorbance at 538 nm which will be determined optically as the last step the working scenario of in situ water monitoring requires the assay protocol to be fast and convenient without sacrificing the analytical performance the reaction time in nitrate reduction and colorimetric development poses an indelible effect on the final sensitivity and limit of detection thus it is critical and necessary to investigate the time factor in both procedures to monitor the conditions experiments were conducted on the reaction durations from 0 to 30 min for nitrate reduction and 0 to 16 min for colorimetric development fig 5 a shows that the reduction rate reflected by absorbance from nitrate to nitrite increased with time passing by and reached a plateau after 15 min however it already achieved 80 of the maximum reduction efficiency at 5 min to facilitate the on site detection a 5 min reduction time was adopted to ensure short assay time but also satisfactory performance fig 5 b shows that the colorimetric reaction was fast and the absorbance reached a plateau within 5 min it was observed that this absorbance was stable afterward even overnight thus the following reaction durations are confirmed for the final protocol 5 min for nitrate reduction and 5 min for colorimetric development next the reagent stability was tested over time at 4 c fig 6 a illustrates the oxidizer stability of persulfate naoh in the range of 0 to 24 h an acceptable absorbance level with a value over 1 was observed from 0 1 to 24 h with slight fluctuations it could be concluded that the oxidizer solution should be used between 6 min and 24 h after preparation fig 6 b shows the stability of the reductant solution stored over 4 h within 60 min the absorbance gave fairly stable values of over 1 1 and decreased significantly after 2 h thus it is suggested to freshly make the reductant solutions and use it within 1 h fig 6 c shows the stability testing results of the colorimetric reagents of sulfanilamide hcl solution 10 g l in 3 5 m hcl and nedd 1 g l confirming that both reagents could remain stable at 4 c up to one month as the composition of total nitrogen is complex the digestion rates of various low covalence nitrogen compounds organic nitrogen and ammonium were tested fig 7 a shows the determination results of five representative nitrogen compounds including glycine urea tris nh4cl and gsh five samples were seperately prepared at a fixed n element concentration of 8 4 mg n l after addition experiments the recovery rates were found to be 99 1 1 5 110 3 0 5 82 1 1 7 75 7 0 6 and 79 1 1 7 respectively all the conversion rates reach a high percentage 75 and show a high digestion efficiency among those nitrogen compounds nitrogen standard samples were prepared from potassium nitrate nitrate ammonium chloride ammonium glycine amino acid urea organic nitrogen tris organic nitrogen and glutathione organic nitrogen for a final stock solution of 1000 mg n l the calibration test was conducted in nitrogen concentrations from 0 14 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l experiments were conducted using the parameters and assay protocols indicated above fig 7 b shows that a linear relationship between the tn concentration and the absorbance output exists in the range of 1 1 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l fig 7 c shows an example of data processing in our custom made bluelab application it is capable of results plotting data displaying data transmission through text message and data marking in the google map as 10 mg n l is the who standard for drinking water the dynamic range from 1 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l is chosen for analysis the 10 mg l reference by who indicates the content of nitrogen in our study we have also converted the concentrations of our dynamic range and lod equivalent to nitrogen instead of nitrite or nitrate therefore these numbers could be easily converted to nitrite nitrate or organic nitrogen through calculation we calculated the lod based on 3 times of standard deviations the lod of the colorimetric assay by using standard nitrate solutions was found to be 1 20 mg n l from the colorimetric reader and 1 07 mg n l from uv vis the performance from our reader is comparable to that from uv vis and both lower than the standard nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l required by the who who 2004 thus it is concluded that the analytical performance of our portable system is suitable for in situ water monitoring as a limitation of the current results we did not carry out experiments regarding the selectivity of our tn analyzer and did not demonstrate on site tn analysis on real water samples in the future the selectivity testing of the analyzer and the on site real water testing will be performed on tap water river and industrial wastewater the ph of the aquatic water in the real application may affect both the digestion and colorimetric determination in our current work the water samples were manually prepared from hplc grade water with a relatively stable ph value 7 thus we did not perform filtration and neutralization as a common method the real water sample should be filtered and neutralized before the tn analysis in the future work we will also explore the protocol of filtration and ph neutralization for on site real water testing 4 conclusion we successfully developed a portable analytical system for on site tn determination in water samples the portable tn analyzer contains a tn reaction chamber for nitrogen digestion and reduction and an optical measurement chamber for colorimetric determination of total nitrite the ucv thermal digestion method and the epa nitrate nitrite determination method were implemented on the tn analytical system the assay protocols and reaction conditions were optimized for individual steps including nitrogen oxidation nitrate reduction and nitrite optical detection comprehensive experiments have been conducted to find the optimum values of digestion time temperature and substrate oxidizer concentrations nitrate reduction time nitrite colorimetric reaction time and reagents stability over time with these optimized conditions fast digestion and colorimetric determination of tn in water were achieved in the range from 0 14 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l at a lod of 1 2 mg l lower than the 10 mg l who standard within 36 min the system has the advantages of i small size light weight and high portability ii full integration automatic determination and wireless communication iii low cost small reagent consumption and simple fluid manipulation and iv rapid detection and satisfactory analytical performance compared with existing laboratory instrumentation the system enables the digestion and

nitrogen from the low covalence state organic compound and ammonium to nitrate reduce nitrate to nitrite and eventually detect total nitrite using a colorimetric assay there are many ways of nitrogen digestion including kjeldahl method bremner et al 1996 microwave method colina and gardiner 1999 johnes and heathwaite 1992 uvc thermal oxidation hong 1999 kroon 1993 and high temperature catalytic combustion tingvall 1978 walsh 1989 among them uvc thermal digestion is the most effective and eco friendly method it relies on mild chemicals with less toxicity consumes fewer reagents but can oxidize organics thoroughly and quickly bronk et al 2000 frankovich and jones 1998 roig et al 1999 thomas et al 1997 herein we designed a fully integrated analytical system based on the uvc thermal digestion and colorimetric determination for quantitative analysis of tn fig 2 shows the portable tn analytical system which is composed of a reaction chamber for nitrogen digestion and reduction and an optical detection chamber for total nitrite determination in the chambers the cases holders and holding slots were designed using solidworks solidworks corporation out sourced by a 3d printer i3 prusa and assembled with electronic components as a miniaturized uvc thermal digestion method this reaction chamber consists of a uvc illumination lamp and a temperature controlling system fig 2 a before the uvc thermal digestion the sample solutions were prepared in two 4 well strips which were split from a standard 8 well strip fig 2 b shows that each 4 well strip employs three reservoirs for the tn measurement thus allowing the testing of six samples in total on the two 4 well strips one reservoir nearest to the fan was filled with water as the control group and can also help maintain the humidity and reduce solution loss in high temperature and ventilation the uvc illumination unit u shaped dual lamps has peak radiation at 254 nm and can act as an effective nitrogen digestion source in an aqueous environment a voltage power inverter was coupled with the lamp to convert the supply voltage from 5 v to 675 v which could ignite the mercury in the uvc lamp and help reveal ultraviolet at a peak wavelength of 254 nm fig 2 a shows that two sample holding slots were created to fit two standard 4 well strips and radially arrange them at a 1 cm distance to the uvc bulb center the u shaped dual lamp design of this uvc bulb ensures equal and sufficient digestion of organic nitrogen in each 4 well strip within a short reaction time the heat was produced from uvc illumination and a heating pad a temperature sensor and an electronic fan were integrated to precisely control the temperature the temperature control system was designed by integrating a low voltage heating pad a temperature sensor and an electronic ventilation fan the heating pad 5 cm 10 cm is wrapped around the 3d printed holder with a radius of 4 cm fig 2 a and the ventilation fan is placed at the end of the holder center the temperature is precisely monitored by the arduino microcontroller and temperature sensor forming negative feedback regulation of the heating by heating pad and cooling by ventilation fan at 3 c precision such design considerations were made to maintain a uniform temperature environment and ensure reaction repeatability of the uvc thermal method the detection chamber was designed according to the shape and size of the 4 well strip fig 2 a shows the main components of the nitrite detection chamber three sets of led photodetector couples were utilized to accommodate three reaction reservoirs each led photodetector couple consists of four small leds and one integrated photodetector placed in the center of four leds the leds have four independent illumination spectra with the wavelength peak lying at 470 nm blue led 520 nm green led 580 nm yellow led and 630 nm red led these spectra cover absorbance peaks of typical colorimetrical assays chen et al 2014 czugala et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 the photodetectors integrate rgb sensors covering the whole visible light spectrum and are able to quantify light intensity through the solution rapidly and simultaneously by reading and differentiating the signals from these leds the microcontroller helps select the most sensitive wavelength for a particular colorimetric assay to better assist on site tn measurement a smartphone application app was created which features bluetooth communication data collection and analysis and mapping of testing locations on google map through the mobile network this app can also transmit testing data through text messaging which ensures tele transmission capabilities in rural areas and developing countries lacking communication facilities internet the material cost of this system is cad 95 2 3 assay protocols the principle of tn detection is to first convert organic nitrogen and ammonium to nitrate reduce the nitrate to nitrite and finally perform colorimetric measurement on the nitrite in a typical experiment a solution was prepared in each reservoir 3 reservoirs used in the 4 well strip by adding 20 µl of nitrogen sample solution 2 µl of potassium persulfate 175 mm 3 µl of naoh solution 100 mm into high performance liquid chromatography hplc water to obtain a final volume of 120 µl 120 µl of water was filled into the fourth reservoir to maintain the humidity during oxidation this preparation was repeated for another 4 well strip two strips were then slid into the holding slots of the reaction chamber which was pre heated at 35 c the oxidation was started by the ignition of the uvc lamp irradiation of 20 min was conducted for nitrogen oxidation nitrogen samples were oxidized by potassium persulfate under uvc irradiation eqs 1 4 illustrate the oxidation mechanism in the equations oh represents a hydroxyl radical which is the neutral form of the hydroxide ion oh hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive which could act as a strong oxidizer in this study hydroxyl radicals were utilized to oxidize the nitrogen at low covalence status to nitrate ions during the uvc illumination persulfate was first decomposed to two sulfate ion radicals and simultaneously a water molecule was decomposed and generated one hydroxyl radical the sulfate ion radical was then converted to sulfate ion and one hydroxyl radical next nitrogen at low covalence status was oxidized to nitrate ions with the aid of abundant hydroxyl radicals 1 s 2 o 8 h v 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o h v h oh 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ohâ h 4 ohâ r 2 n r 1 n o 3 after the digestion total nitrogen and ammonium had all been turned into nitrate ions thus the water sample remained nitrate and nitrite as the final forms of nitrogen simultaneously the uvc lamp was turned off to create a dark environment and the fan was turned on for 2 min to lower the temperature of the reaction chamber the reaction chamber would later be used for the incubation of nitrate reduction to determine the total nitrate and nitrite a modified epa standard method was adopted for nitrate nitrite determination fig 3 a shows the reaction mechanism of this assay protocol in brief a reductant solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of reagent a 0 14 mm of cuso4 and 5 mm of znso4 reagent b 1 m of naoh and reagent c 4 mm of hydrazine sulfate this kind of mixing is to further reduce the assay time and pipetting procedure without sacrificing the reaction efficiency 60 µl of the mixed reductant solution was added in each reaction reservoir and allowed for 5 min incubation afterward 75 µl of sulfanilamide hcl solution 10 g l sulfanilamide in 3 5 m hcl was added to neutralize the reduction reaction followed by adding 20 µl of nedd 1 g l the final solution was incubated in the dark environment for 5 min for color development with the aid of nedd it generated a product of azo dye of which the peak wavelength absorption lies at 538 nm fig 3 b the absorbance for each reaction reservoir was then collected by the optical detection chamber in fig 2 a 3 results and discussion the determination of total nitrogen involves nitrogen oxidation nitrate reduction and total nitrite colorimetric reaction thorough experiments were performed to optimize the assay protocol to achieve satisfactory sensitivity and accuracy in the miniaturized environment 3 1 optimization of nitrogen digestion the digestion efficiency is the key factor to accurately monitor low covalence nitrogen organic nitrogen and ammonium among total nitrogen to improve the digestion rate it is necessary to optimize the oxidation parameters including oxidation time reaction temperature oxidizer concentration ph level and substrate buffer 15 30 µl of glycine solution 600 µm was used as a model to analyze the oxidation effect under varied reaction environment and oxidizer concentrations the temperature values of 30 c 35 c 40 c 50 c and 60 c were investigated in this miniaturized uvc thermal method fig 4 a shows the experimental results of temperature optimization within those temperatures the corresponding absorbance was relatively constant at around 0 92 no significant change was found in the oxidation effect with increasing incubation temperature uvc illumination can generate heat it was noted that the temperature of the reaction chamber was stabilized at 35 c after uvc illumination for 5 min as this temperature provided the optimal condition no further temperature control was needed in the digestion reaction here fig 4 b illustrates the digestion rate reflected by absorbance under various oxidation time the optimal duration was found to be 20 min with an absorbance of 1 4 that was much higher than the values with shorter or longer incubation time shorter oxidation time may cause incomplete oxidation reaction however the absorbance decreases to 1 25 at a longer reaction time e g 32 min the reason may lie in the large evaporation of sample solution after a long time exposure which led to less volume less light absorption during colorimetric determination afterward the substrate effect was investigated between the borate buffer and water fig 4 c shows that no significant difference was found within them borate buffer was preferred as it could help eliminate the ph effect from analyzed samples from eqs 1 and 2 hydroxyl radicals oh generated from water molecules h2o and persulfate s2o8 are the main oxidizer in the nitrogen redox reaction thus it is crucial to monitor the contents of ph and persulfate and provide adequate oh for the oxidation of low covalence nitrogen eqs 3 and 4 naoh 100 mm was added to the oxidation solution as a ph regulator its volume was tuned from 0 to 12 µl to find the optimal value fig 4 d shows the ph adjustment results during the digestion process reflected by absorbance at the volume of 3 µl the absorbance reached as high as 1 1 and decreased at a lower or higher volume thus it can be concluded that 3 µl of naoh 100 mm provided the optimum ph environment for the best oxidation rate after fixing the naoh concentration the content of potassium persulfate 175 mm was tested under a series of volumes from 0 to 6 µl fig 4 e reflected by absorbance the optimum oxidation rate was found at the volume of 2 µl it was noted that lower concentrated persulfate provided inadequate oxidizer while higher concentrated persulfate would suppress the reaction rate thus with the above experiments the following oxidation condition was adopted in the subsequent experiments temperature 35 c oxidation time 20 min substrate borate buffer ph 3 µl 100 mm naoh and oxidizer 2 µl 175 mm potassium persulfate 3 2 colorimetric assay optimization after nitrogen digestion organic nitrogen and ammonium had been converted to nitrate and nitrite as the remaining format of nitrogen the nitrogen products were then processed with standard epa nitrate nitrite colorimetric reaction fig 3 a shows that nitrate will firstly be reduced to nitrite under the assistance of cuso4 znso4 hydrazine sulfate will be added to neutralize the reduction solution total nitrite will transform to diazonium salt and further and is then converted to azo product after the addition of nedd the azo product has a peak absorbance at 538 nm which will be determined optically as the last step the working scenario of in situ water monitoring requires the assay protocol to be fast and convenient without sacrificing the analytical performance the reaction time in nitrate reduction and colorimetric development poses an indelible effect on the final sensitivity and limit of detection thus it is critical and necessary to investigate the time factor in both procedures to monitor the conditions experiments were conducted on the reaction durations from 0 to 30 min for nitrate reduction and 0 to 16 min for colorimetric development fig 5 a shows that the reduction rate reflected by absorbance from nitrate to nitrite increased with time passing by and reached a plateau after 15 min however it already achieved 80 of the maximum reduction efficiency at 5 min to facilitate the on site detection a 5 min reduction time was adopted to ensure short assay time but also satisfactory performance fig 5 b shows that the colorimetric reaction was fast and the absorbance reached a plateau within 5 min it was observed that this absorbance was stable afterward even overnight thus the following reaction durations are confirmed for the final protocol 5 min for nitrate reduction and 5 min for colorimetric development next the reagent stability was tested over time at 4 c fig 6 a illustrates the oxidizer stability of persulfate naoh in the range of 0 to 24 h an acceptable absorbance level with a value over 1 was observed from 0 1 to 24 h with slight fluctuations it could be concluded that the oxidizer solution should be used between 6 min and 24 h after preparation fig 6 b shows the stability of the reductant solution stored over 4 h within 60 min the absorbance gave fairly stable values of over 1 1 and decreased significantly after 2 h thus it is suggested to freshly make the reductant solutions and use it within 1 h fig 6 c shows the stability testing results of the colorimetric reagents of sulfanilamide hcl solution 10 g l in 3 5 m hcl and nedd 1 g l confirming that both reagents could remain stable at 4 c up to one month as the composition of total nitrogen is complex the digestion rates of various low covalence nitrogen compounds organic nitrogen and ammonium were tested fig 7 a shows the determination results of five representative nitrogen compounds including glycine urea tris nh4cl and gsh five samples were seperately prepared at a fixed n element concentration of 8 4 mg n l after addition experiments the recovery rates were found to be 99 1 1 5 110 3 0 5 82 1 1 7 75 7 0 6 and 79 1 1 7 respectively all the conversion rates reach a high percentage 75 and show a high digestion efficiency among those nitrogen compounds nitrogen standard samples were prepared from potassium nitrate nitrate ammonium chloride ammonium glycine amino acid urea organic nitrogen tris organic nitrogen and glutathione organic nitrogen for a final stock solution of 1000 mg n l the calibration test was conducted in nitrogen concentrations from 0 14 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l experiments were conducted using the parameters and assay protocols indicated above fig 7 b shows that a linear relationship between the tn concentration and the absorbance output exists in the range of 1 1 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l fig 7 c shows an example of data processing in our custom made bluelab application it is capable of results plotting data displaying data transmission through text message and data marking in the google map as 10 mg n l is the who standard for drinking water the dynamic range from 1 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l is chosen for analysis the 10 mg l reference by who indicates the content of nitrogen in our study we have also converted the concentrations of our dynamic range and lod equivalent to nitrogen instead of nitrite or nitrate therefore these numbers could be easily converted to nitrite nitrate or organic nitrogen through calculation we calculated the lod based on 3 times of standard deviations the lod of the colorimetric assay by using standard nitrate solutions was found to be 1 20 mg n l from the colorimetric reader and 1 07 mg n l from uv vis the performance from our reader is comparable to that from uv vis and both lower than the standard nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l required by the who who 2004 thus it is concluded that the analytical performance of our portable system is suitable for in situ water monitoring as a limitation of the current results we did not carry out experiments regarding the selectivity of our tn analyzer and did not demonstrate on site tn analysis on real water samples in the future the selectivity testing of the analyzer and the on site real water testing will be performed on tap water river and industrial wastewater the ph of the aquatic water in the real application may affect both the digestion and colorimetric determination in our current work the water samples were manually prepared from hplc grade water with a relatively stable ph value 7 thus we did not perform filtration and neutralization as a common method the real water sample should be filtered and neutralized before the tn analysis in the future work we will also explore the protocol of filtration and ph neutralization for on site real water testing 4 conclusion we successfully developed a portable analytical system for on site tn determination in water samples the portable tn analyzer contains a tn reaction chamber for nitrogen digestion and reduction and an optical measurement chamber for colorimetric determination of total nitrite the ucv thermal digestion method and the epa nitrate nitrite determination method were implemented on the tn analytical system the assay protocols and reaction conditions were optimized for individual steps including nitrogen oxidation nitrate reduction and nitrite optical detection comprehensive experiments have been conducted to find the optimum values of digestion time temperature and substrate oxidizer concentrations nitrate reduction time nitrite colorimetric reaction time and reagents stability over time with these optimized conditions fast digestion and colorimetric determination of tn in water were achieved in the range from 0 14 mg n l to 17 5 mg n l at a lod of 1 2 mg l lower than the 10 mg l who standard within 36 min the system has the advantages of i small size light weight and high portability ii full integration automatic determination and wireless communication iii low cost small reagent consumption and simple fluid manipulation and iv rapid detection and satisfactory analytical performance compared with existing laboratory instrumentation the system enables the digestion and measurement of tn in a quick portable and low cost manner in the future selectivity testing and real water monitoring will be performed on tap water river and industrial wastewater declaration of
