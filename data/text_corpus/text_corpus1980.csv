9900,agricultural subsurface drainage is critical for crop production in temperate humid regions with the heightened concern of its water quality implications we need a method to design drainage systems for both crop production and environmental protection the objective of this research was to develop an empirical equation that estimates the design drainage rate ddr for local soil and weather conditions this ddr can then be used in the hooghoudt equation to estimate the optimum drain spacing that maximizes profit we conducted drainmod simulations for each combination of four factors three drain depths three effective radii seven locations and five soils for each combination of factors simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m using 30 years 1990 2019 of weather data planted with continuous corn zea mays l simulations provided a 30 year average relative corn yield and drainage discharge for each combination of factors the drain spacings that maximized annual economic return on investment were identified as optimum spacings and used to calculate the ddr for each combination of factors results were then used in a multiple linear regression to develop two empirical equations for northeast and southeast usa with ddr as the dependent variable the independent variables were the long term average growing season precipitation drain depth equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer the environmental value of the empirical equations is that they help avoid too narrow of a drain spacing thereby preventing more drainage than is needed in conclusion application of these empirical equations is a means for estimating the site specific optimum drain spacing that maximizes economic return on investment keywords drainmod drain depth drain spacing effective radius subsurface drainage tile drainage 1 introduction agricultural subsurface drainage is the practice of removing excess water from the soil profile to provide suitable conditions for crop production evans and fausey 1999 ghane et al 2016 mourtzinis et al 2021 however drainage also increases transport of nutrients to surface water such that nitrate loss increases with rise in intensity of subsurface drainage skaggs et al 2005 the water quality impacts of subsurface drainage have gained so much attention such that a systems approach has been suggested for drainage design that integrates need for drainage soil water crop processes and nutrient reduction castellano et al 2019 this approach recognizes that drainage design should consider impacts on water quality as well as crop production ayars and evans 2015 strock et al 2011 to consider water quality in drainage design we need to know what design parameters affect water quality one of the most important design parameters that affects water quality is drain spacing skaggs et al 1994 drain spacing dictates how quickly water is removed from the soil profile and in turn affects nitrate loss kladivko et al 1999 luo et al 2010 youssef et al 2018 one method of determining drain spacing is choosing a spacing based on local experience and general information from local drainage guides these guides provide a range of drain spacings based on typical characteristics of soil series since hydraulic conductivity varies widely within a soil series these guides can lead to choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow or too wide for a specific site skaggs et al 2006 choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow leads to increased drainage intensity increased capital cost reduced profit and increased nitrate loss skaggs 2007 therefore there is a need for a better method of determining drain spacing to avoid over designing the system the best method of determining drain spacing is to optimize the system design for a site by modeling the performance of alternative designs using a computer simulation model such as drainmod skaggs et al 2006 or rzwqm ma et al 2012 however the application of simulation models is an involved process which is not usually practical for routine design another method of determining drain spacing is to use a calculator or spreadsheet to implement either the steady state or transient drain spacing equations ayars and evans 2015 skaggs 2007 the most popular of the two equations in humid climates is the steady state hooghoudt equation ayars and evans 2015 however application of this equation has been limited due to lack of location and crop specific design drainage rates ddr the d dr is the depth of water to be removed from the soil in 24 h by the designed drainage system the question of what ddr should be used for a given area brings up the principle of site specific agriculture that is to use an optimum amount of an input e g fertilizer or ddr for a specific location that gives the best outcome at the lowest cost sadler et al 2005 if the site specific ddr is known for a given location and crop practitioners can use the hooghoudt equation to estimate the optimum drain spacing this optimum drain spacing maximizes economic return on investment for that specific field therefore there is a need to determine the ddr tailored for local conditions previous studies have attempted to develop design criteria to estimate the ddr in a pioneering work researchers in north carolina used drainmod simulations to develop tables of ddr for soils in eastern north carolina these rates could then be used in the hooghoudt equation to calculate the optimum drain spacing skaggs and nassehzadeh tabrizi 1986 later skaggs et al 2006 conducted drainmod simulations to determine drain spacings that maximize profit i e maximize annual return on investment for four soil types at ten locations in the eastern usa the authors used a simple linear regression to determine an empirical equation that related the ddr to the growing season precipitation i e ddr 0 004 p g 1 1 where p g is the long term average growing season precipitation mm from one month prior to planting to four months after planting however effects of other parameters such as drain depth and soil properties on the ddr were not considered in a subsequent study skaggs 2007 further improved the previous empirical equation by adding additional independent variables of drain depth and soil transmissivity this provided an empirical equation to estimate the ddr for any location in the eastern usa however effective radius of the drain was not considered as an independent variable in estimating the ddr research has shown that the presence of a geotextile envelope i e sock filter can significantly increase effective radius of the drain and in turn increase flow rate into the drain dierickx 1999 oyarce et al 2017 stuyt and dierickx 2006 therefore there is a need to determine if effective radius can further improve the empirical equation for estimating the ddr the objective of this study was to develop an empirical equation that estimates the site specific ddr as a function of the long term growing season precipitation drain depth effective radius and soil properties the environmental value of this research is that it provides a drainage design procedure that prevents drainage more than needed thereby providing a water quality benefit the economic value of this research is that it provides a drainage design procedure that maximizes economic return on investment 2 materials and methods 2 1 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt equation van der ploeg et al 1999 may be written as 1 q r 8 k e d e m 4 k e m 2 s 2 where referring to fig 1 q is the steady state drainage rate cm day that is equal to the steady state rainfall rate r that would result in a midway water table elevation of m cm d e is the equivalent depth cm k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile from the surface to the restrictive layer cm day and s is the drain spacing cm fig 1 the equivalent depth may be calculated from the solution developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 or by the equations presented by moody 1966 in this study we used the former drain spacing was calculated by substituting a steady state drainage rate into eq 1 for a specific soil condition and a specified water table elevation midway between laterals the previous study by skaggs 2007 defined the design drainage rate ddr as the steady state drainage rate when water table midway between laterals is at the soil surface as illustrated in fig 1 with m d d drain depth and q ddr this definition may be written as 2 ddr 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 the term design drainage rate is often called drainage coefficient which is confusing because drainage coefficient is also commonly referred to as the hydraulic capacity of the drainage system the hydraulic capacity depends on the main size material and slope when water table midway between drains is at the surface ddr is equal to drainage intensity di as defined by skaggs 2017 2 2 drainmod description drainmod is a widely used field scale model developed to quantify the hydrology of subsurface drained soils skaggs 1982 1977 skaggs et al 2012 the model simulates hydrology using simple water balance equations input data required by the model include soil weather crop and drainage system parameters in addition to the hydrology simulations drainmod also predicts relative crop yield based on four stresses dry wet soil water conditions salinity and planting delays due to poor trafficability conditions evans et al 1991 crop yield and hydrology predictions of drainmod have been rigorusly tested by researchers throughout the usa and internationally adhikari et al 2020 gunn et al 2018 kanwar et al 1994 malakshahi et al 2020 skaggs et al 2012 sojka et al 2020 wang et al 2006 youssef et al 2018 2 3 data 2 3 1 locations drainmod simulations were conducted for seven locations to represent a wide range of climate scenarios and growing conditions in the eastern usa fig 2 table 1 2 3 2 soil characteristics five soils were chosen to represent various soil properties in the eastern usa table 2 the soils included drummer silty clay loam typic endoaquolls fine silty mixed superactive mesic normania clay loam aquic haplustoll fine loamy mixed mesic two rains sandy loam soils typic paleaquults fine loamy siliceous thermic and portsmouth sandy loam typic umbraquults fine loamy mixed thermic the soil input files were based on measured and calibrated data as referenced in table 2 2 3 3 weather data thirty years of recent local weather data 1990 2019 were obtained from the national climatic data center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and local weather stations table 1 daily precipitation and temperature data were used as weather inputs files for drainmod the pet was calculated internally in drainmod by the thornthwaite method with monthly location dependent pet correction factors adhikari et al 2020 with the exception of the lansing location pet monthly correction factors for all locations were obtained from the skaggs 2007 study for lansing pet monthly correction factors were obtained from a drainmod study that was conducted in paulding county northwest ohio which is close to lansing mi askar et al 2020 2 4 steps for developing the empirical equation overview of the steps for achieving our objective of determining the empirical equation are described in fig 3 detailed description of the steps is presented in this section step 1 modeling drainmod simulations were conducted for each combination of four factors including drain depths 75 100 and 125 cm effective radii 0 5 2 5 and 5 9 cm locations baton rouge la plymouth nc memphis tn waseca mn urbana il albany ny lansing mi and soils drummer normania rains a rains b portsmouth for each combination of factors simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m using 30 years 1990 2019 of weather data planted with continuous corn zea mays l simulations provided a 30 year average relative corn yield and drainage discharge for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil the analysis feature in the drainmod software was used to run batch simulations with different drain depth and spacing simulations were repeated for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil and for each combination of factors a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m was simulated for example one simulation was conducted for urbana weather conditions drummer silt loam drain depth of 75 cm effective radius of 0 5 cm and drain spacing of 5 0 m for that specific combination of factors d d r ef location soil simulations were repeated for drain spacings from 5 to 100 m with variable increments to increase the accuracy of selecting the optimum drain spacing the smallest increment was 0 5 m near the peak of the average annual return and the largest increment was 5 0 m for the effective radii factor an effective radius of 0 5 cm represents an average value for regular perforated corrugated plastic tubing with 4 longitudinal rows of perforations that are commonly used in the midwest usa while an effective radius of about 5 9 cm represents a knitted sock envelope installed under good conditions unpublished data in north america regular perforated drains refer to drains with average slot width of about 1 9 mm whereas sand slot a k a narrow slot or knife cut drains refer to drains with average slot width of about 0 6 mm that prevent sediment from entering the drain surface depressional storage of 1 0 cm was used to simulate fair to good surface drainage lateral seepage and deep percolation were assumed to be negligible we also assumed that the fields were not irrigated soil and crop input files from the previous study by skaggs 2007 were used in the current drainmod simulations step 2 economic analysis an economic analysis was conducted to determine the drain spacing that maximized annual return on investment for each combination of drain depth effective radius location and soil for each combination of factors and for spacings ranging from 5 to 100 m we calculated the average annual return on investment aar ha as 3 aar aacpi acpc aadsc where aacpi is the average annual corn production income ha acpc is the annual corn production cost ha and aadsc is the average annual drainage system cost ha we assumed an annual corn production cost acpc of 1 476 ha 597 ac based on the 2019 cost estimate for corn yield of 9 667 kg ha 154 bu ac table 3 laporte 2020 the average annual corn production income aacpi ha was calculated as 4 aacpi ry py cp where ry is the relative yield decimal py is the potential yield kg ha and cp is corn price kg drainmod predicted relative corn yield for each year of the simulation based on four crop stresses section 2 2 we assumed a corn price of 0 14 kg 3 52 bu and a potential corn yield of 14 000 kg ha laporte 2020 the potential yield is the average yield that would be obtained if there is no delay in planting the crop and no stress due excessive or deficient soil water conditions nor soil salinity we calculated the average annual drainage system cost aadsc ha huffman et al 2013 as 5 aadsc 10000 s o icds i r ai 2 dep mr where s o is the optimum drain spacing m icds is the initial cost of the drainage system that is 2 66 m table 3 i r ai is the 5 interest rate on average investment per year decimal dep is the 3 3 depreciation per year based on a 30 year expected lifetime of the system decimal and mr is the 0 3 maintenance rate per year decimal step 3 select the optimum drain spacing the drain spacing giving the maximum annual return on investment fig 4 was determined as the optimum drain spacing for each combination of drain depth effective radius location and soil in this step we found that varying the annual corn production cost acpc shifts the average annual return graph in fig 4 vertically but not horizontally when all economic and other inputs are kept constant thus changes in acpc resulted in the same optimum drain spacing step 4 calculate the design drainage rate we used the optimum drain spacing from step 3 in eq 2 to calculate the ddr at the end of this step we obtained a ddr for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil step 5 regression analysis a multiple linear regression was performed with ddr as the dependent variable the independent variables were the long term growing season precipitation p g drain depth d d equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k e depth to restrictive layer d and effective radius r ef these independent variables were chosen to improve upon the previous work of skaggs 2007 that used p g d d and transmissivity k e d as independent variables it is important for the success of the empirical equation that these independent variables be readily measured or obtained the statistical software of jmp 15 0 sas institute inc was used for the regression analysis and assumption checks 2 5 evaluating the extent of scatter in the predictions of the empirical equations to show the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equations the ddr values calculated in step 4 of section 2 4 were compared to the empirically predicted ddr values calculated from the regression equations the extent of scatter was quantified using evaluation statistics of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 nse determines how good is the fit of the plot of ddr of step 4 versus empirically predicted ddr compared to the 1 1 line an nse value of 1 shows perfect agreement between the ddr of step 4 and empirically predicted ddr rsr is a normalized error index with an optimum value of 0 2 6 determining the effect of weather record on the design of drainage systems we repeated steps 1 through 3 of section 2 4 to determine the optimum drain spacing using all the economic and drainmod inputs used in this study except for using the weather data from the period of 1941 1990 that was used by skaggs 2007 in other words the only difference between the two simulations was the range of weather data to demonstrate the effect of weather record on the ddr we provided an example simulation for the 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius for the drummer silty clay loam soil at five locations baton rouge plymouth waseca urbana and albany then we compared our optimum drain spacing from the period of 1990 2019 to that of the period of 1941 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of location on the design drainage rate results showed that generally ddr increased with increasing long term growing season precipitation fig 5 table 4 for example ddr was 1 9 cm day for 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in baton rouge compared to a ddr of 0 7 cm day for the same soil and conditions in lansing the larger ddr for baton rouge corresponded to a 14 0 m optimum spacing compared to a wider 23 5 m optimum spacing for lansing table 4 the differences in ddr between the two locations were due to differences in the long term growing season precipitation 662 mm for baton rouge versus 438 mm for lansing and et the timing of weather events and related location specific factors therefore the ddr differences between locations illustrate the need for site specific ddr values for drainage system design 3 2 effect of drain depth on the design drainage rate results showed that generally ddr decreased with increasing drain depth table 4 for example ddr was 0 9 cm day for 75 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in lansing on the other hand ddr was 0 7 cm day for 125 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in lansing the ddr at 75 cm drain depth corresponded with the narrower 18 0 m optimum spacing whereas the 125 cm drain depth was associated with the wider 28 0 m optimum spacing table 4 results of for the 0 5 cm and 5 9 cm effective radii are summarized in the supplementary table s1 as drains got deeper optimum drain spacing increased thereby increasing ddr average water table depth is shallower for the 75 cm drain depth than the 125 cm depth vlotman et al 2020 when water table is shallower in the shallow drains less soil profile is available for moisture storage thus greater excess water is available for drainage discharge thereby leading to a need for a greater ddr therefore a higher ddr is needed when drains are installed shallower 3 3 empirical equations 3 3 1 significance of the independent variables in the empirical equations in our first effort we determined an empirical equation based on data from all seven locations supplementary table s2 however the accuracy of the empirical equation improved when we divided the locations into two regions based on climate we determined separate empirical equations for the northeast and southeast regions fig 2 the boundary between the two regions was determined based on the long term average annual evapotranspiration map developed by reitz et al 2017 states south of the boundary had at least 50 area with an average annual evapotranspiration greater than 800 mm year supplementary fig s3 for both regions multiple linear regression showed that effective radius did not significantly affect the ddr supplementary table s3 so it was excluded from the regression analysis regression results showed that the long term growing season precipitation drain depth equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer were significant predictors the previous study by skaggs 2007 considered the combined effect of equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer by including transmissivity as an independent variable however we found greater accuracy of the empirical equations when these two factors were included as two separate independent variables compared to using the one variable of transmissivity 3 3 2 proportion of the variation explained by the empirical equations results of the regression analysis showed that 82 and 83 of the variation in the ddr were explained by eqs 6 and 10 in terms of the long term growing season precipitation drain depth equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer table 5 as the number of independent variables reduced the performance of the empirical equations diminished as indicated by the reduction in the r square values table 5 in some cases certain independent variables are unavailable or unknown for example if depth to the restrictive layer and effective saturated hydraulic conductivity are unknown eqs 8 and 12 would have to be used with r square values of 0 60 and 0 64 for the northeast and southeast regions respectively in practical applications the ddr values estimated from eq 6 to 13 can be used in the hooghoudt eq 2 to calculate the optimum drain spacing that maximizes annual return on investment ddr values estimated from the regression equations are valid for corn soybean rotation on fields with fair to good surface drainage soybean glycine max l merr is generally considered to be more tolerant of wet conditions than corn so the results would hold for corn soybean rotation evans and fausey 1999 as defined in the drainmod reference report a field with fair to good surface drainage has some shallow depressions and ponding occurs in some of the depressions after heavy rainfall skaggs 1980 3 3 3 extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equations the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equation was evaluated by comparing the empirically predicted ddr values calculated from the regression equations with the ddr values calculated in step 4 of section 2 4 i e drainmod and associated economic analyses fig 6 for the northeast region eq 6 the nse was 0 82 perfect value is 1 and rsr was 0 42 perfect value is 0 for the southeast region eq 10 the nse was 0 84 and rsr was 0 41 results show that there is some uncertainty in the prediction of ddr especially when one or more of the inputs are unavailable or unknown therefore these empirical equations should be used as a guide for drainage design and not a rigid criterion 3 3 4 crop production and water quality implications of the empirical equation drain spacing influences how quickly water is removed from the soil profile thereby affecting nitrate loss skaggs 2017 the traditional method of choosing the drain spacing is based on local experience which may lead to choosing a too narrow or too wide of a drain spacing than what is needed to optimize crop production i e maximize economic return on investment another traditional method is choosing a drain spacing based on local drainage guides that provides a range of drain spacings based on typical characteristics of soil series since hydraulic conductivity varies widely within a soil series these guides can lead to choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow or too wide for a specific field skaggs et al 2006 choosing a drain spacing that is wider than what is needed to optimize crop production removes less water from the soil profile that may cause yield loss because of crop water stress therefore the empirical equation helps avoid too wide of a drain spacing by estimating an optimum drain spacing that optimizes crop production on the other hand choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow than what is needed to optimize crop production increases drainage intensity thereby increasing nitrate loss kladivko et al 1999 luo et al 2010 skaggs 2017 skaggs et al 2006 therefore we recommend practitioners avoid selecting a drain spacing that is considerably narrower than the optimum drain spacing the environmental value of the empirical equation is that it helps avoid too narrow of a drain spacing avoiding drainage more than needed provides a water quality benefit by reducing nitrate loss 3 4 effect of weather record on the design of drainage systems comparison of the ddr values obtained in our study with earlier published results shows the ddr values reported herein are generally greater than those presented by skaggs 2007 and skaggs et al 2006 for some of the same locations the earlier simulation studies were conducted for the 50 year period of weather record 1941 1990 there were also differences in the economic inputs prices costs and interest rates and certain other inputs for example corn prices 0 10 kg vs 0 14 kg drain pipe material plus installation 2 62 m vs 2 66 m and interest rate 6 vs 5 varied from one period to the other due to inflation to investigate if the period of weather record was a reason for the differences in ddr values we compared the optimum drain spacing from the recent period of 1990 2019 to that from the period of 1941 1990 that was used by skaggs 2007 results for the 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer silty clay loam soil at five locations baton rouge plymouth waseca urbana and albany are summarized in table 6 except for the weather record all other inputs were the same as for the current study results showed that average optimum drain spacing based on the recent period 1990 2019 was 13 2 8 21 3 less than that based on weather data for 1941 1990 the narrower optimum drain spacing of the recent period corresponded to an average 35 0 3 0 9 increase in ddr optimum drain spacing decreased and ddr increased in all locations except for plymouth nc where the spacing was slightly increased 5 and ddr decreased 8 it is unclear why changes in optimum drain spacings and the corresponding ddr for plymouth nc for the two periods of weather data were much less and in the opposite direction than those for the other four locations climate change was evident from changes in average precipitation from the two periods of 1990 2019 and 1941 1990 results showed that all locations had a higher long term average annual precipitation for the recent period of 1990 2019 than the 1941 1990 period supplementary fig s1 we also found that the recent period of 1990 2019 had higher long term average growing season precipitation than the 1941 1990 period except for baton rouge fig 7 increase in annual precipitation over time has been previously reported for the midwest usa due to climate change easterling et al 2017 increase in annual precipitation is not the only climate change impact that influences drainage design other climate change impacts that influence drainage design include frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation temperature changes supplementary fig s2 extended drought periods over the growing season and other climate change impacts that affect crop yield therefore drainage design research along with climate change scenarios are needed to investigate how climate change will affect drainage design in the future 4 conclusions we developed empirical equations for northeast and southeast usa to estimate the site specific design drainage rate ddr within those regions our study resulted in the following key conclusions the site specific ddr can be estimated by an empirical equation when the following independent variables are available for a given field the long term average growing season precipitation p g drain depth d d equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k e and depth to restrictive layer d simulations showed that the ddr varied with location due to climate differences across a region therefore it is important to use site specific ddr for drainage design to meet the local drainage demand as drains got deeper optimum drain spacing increased thereby increasing ddr therefore a higher ddr is needed when installing drains at a shallower depth the benefit of the empirical equations is that they predict the ddr that maximizes economic return on investment in the drainage system while preventing greater than necessary drainage intensities i e too narrow of a drain spacing that remove more water than needed therefore the appropriate use of these equations will provide both economic and environmental benefits comparison of optimum drain spacing from the 1990 2019 period to that of the 1941 1990 period showed there is a need for narrower optimum drain spacing and greater ddr in the recent period due to difference in the weather data climate change and drainage design research are needed to investigate how climate change will affect drainage design in the future in conclusion this paper presents a design method that optimizes drain spacing for maximum annual economic return on investment based on local soil and weather conditions this method can be used in other temperate humid regions of the world to develop empirical equations for designing more efficient drainage systems the findings of this paper have been incorporated

geotextile envelope i e sock filter can significantly increase effective radius of the drain and in turn increase flow rate into the drain dierickx 1999 oyarce et al 2017 stuyt and dierickx 2006 therefore there is a need to determine if effective radius can further improve the empirical equation for estimating the ddr the objective of this study was to develop an empirical equation that estimates the site specific ddr as a function of the long term growing season precipitation drain depth effective radius and soil properties the environmental value of this research is that it provides a drainage design procedure that prevents drainage more than needed thereby providing a water quality benefit the economic value of this research is that it provides a drainage design procedure that maximizes economic return on investment 2 materials and methods 2 1 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt equation van der ploeg et al 1999 may be written as 1 q r 8 k e d e m 4 k e m 2 s 2 where referring to fig 1 q is the steady state drainage rate cm day that is equal to the steady state rainfall rate r that would result in a midway water table elevation of m cm d e is the equivalent depth cm k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile from the surface to the restrictive layer cm day and s is the drain spacing cm fig 1 the equivalent depth may be calculated from the solution developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 or by the equations presented by moody 1966 in this study we used the former drain spacing was calculated by substituting a steady state drainage rate into eq 1 for a specific soil condition and a specified water table elevation midway between laterals the previous study by skaggs 2007 defined the design drainage rate ddr as the steady state drainage rate when water table midway between laterals is at the soil surface as illustrated in fig 1 with m d d drain depth and q ddr this definition may be written as 2 ddr 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 the term design drainage rate is often called drainage coefficient which is confusing because drainage coefficient is also commonly referred to as the hydraulic capacity of the drainage system the hydraulic capacity depends on the main size material and slope when water table midway between drains is at the surface ddr is equal to drainage intensity di as defined by skaggs 2017 2 2 drainmod description drainmod is a widely used field scale model developed to quantify the hydrology of subsurface drained soils skaggs 1982 1977 skaggs et al 2012 the model simulates hydrology using simple water balance equations input data required by the model include soil weather crop and drainage system parameters in addition to the hydrology simulations drainmod also predicts relative crop yield based on four stresses dry wet soil water conditions salinity and planting delays due to poor trafficability conditions evans et al 1991 crop yield and hydrology predictions of drainmod have been rigorusly tested by researchers throughout the usa and internationally adhikari et al 2020 gunn et al 2018 kanwar et al 1994 malakshahi et al 2020 skaggs et al 2012 sojka et al 2020 wang et al 2006 youssef et al 2018 2 3 data 2 3 1 locations drainmod simulations were conducted for seven locations to represent a wide range of climate scenarios and growing conditions in the eastern usa fig 2 table 1 2 3 2 soil characteristics five soils were chosen to represent various soil properties in the eastern usa table 2 the soils included drummer silty clay loam typic endoaquolls fine silty mixed superactive mesic normania clay loam aquic haplustoll fine loamy mixed mesic two rains sandy loam soils typic paleaquults fine loamy siliceous thermic and portsmouth sandy loam typic umbraquults fine loamy mixed thermic the soil input files were based on measured and calibrated data as referenced in table 2 2 3 3 weather data thirty years of recent local weather data 1990 2019 were obtained from the national climatic data center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and local weather stations table 1 daily precipitation and temperature data were used as weather inputs files for drainmod the pet was calculated internally in drainmod by the thornthwaite method with monthly location dependent pet correction factors adhikari et al 2020 with the exception of the lansing location pet monthly correction factors for all locations were obtained from the skaggs 2007 study for lansing pet monthly correction factors were obtained from a drainmod study that was conducted in paulding county northwest ohio which is close to lansing mi askar et al 2020 2 4 steps for developing the empirical equation overview of the steps for achieving our objective of determining the empirical equation are described in fig 3 detailed description of the steps is presented in this section step 1 modeling drainmod simulations were conducted for each combination of four factors including drain depths 75 100 and 125 cm effective radii 0 5 2 5 and 5 9 cm locations baton rouge la plymouth nc memphis tn waseca mn urbana il albany ny lansing mi and soils drummer normania rains a rains b portsmouth for each combination of factors simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m using 30 years 1990 2019 of weather data planted with continuous corn zea mays l simulations provided a 30 year average relative corn yield and drainage discharge for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil the analysis feature in the drainmod software was used to run batch simulations with different drain depth and spacing simulations were repeated for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil and for each combination of factors a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m was simulated for example one simulation was conducted for urbana weather conditions drummer silt loam drain depth of 75 cm effective radius of 0 5 cm and drain spacing of 5 0 m for that specific combination of factors d d r ef location soil simulations were repeated for drain spacings from 5 to 100 m with variable increments to increase the accuracy of selecting the optimum drain spacing the smallest increment was 0 5 m near the peak of the average annual return and the largest increment was 5 0 m for the effective radii factor an effective radius of 0 5 cm represents an average value for regular perforated corrugated plastic tubing with 4 longitudinal rows of perforations that are commonly used in the midwest usa while an effective radius of about 5 9 cm represents a knitted sock envelope installed under good conditions unpublished data in north america regular perforated drains refer to drains with average slot width of about 1 9 mm whereas sand slot a k a narrow slot or knife cut drains refer to drains with average slot width of about 0 6 mm that prevent sediment from entering the drain surface depressional storage of 1 0 cm was used to simulate fair to good surface drainage lateral seepage and deep percolation were assumed to be negligible we also assumed that the fields were not irrigated soil and crop input files from the previous study by skaggs 2007 were used in the current drainmod simulations step 2 economic analysis an economic analysis was conducted to determine the drain spacing that maximized annual return on investment for each combination of drain depth effective radius location and soil for each combination of factors and for spacings ranging from 5 to 100 m we calculated the average annual return on investment aar ha as 3 aar aacpi acpc aadsc where aacpi is the average annual corn production income ha acpc is the annual corn production cost ha and aadsc is the average annual drainage system cost ha we assumed an annual corn production cost acpc of 1 476 ha 597 ac based on the 2019 cost estimate for corn yield of 9 667 kg ha 154 bu ac table 3 laporte 2020 the average annual corn production income aacpi ha was calculated as 4 aacpi ry py cp where ry is the relative yield decimal py is the potential yield kg ha and cp is corn price kg drainmod predicted relative corn yield for each year of the simulation based on four crop stresses section 2 2 we assumed a corn price of 0 14 kg 3 52 bu and a potential corn yield of 14 000 kg ha laporte 2020 the potential yield is the average yield that would be obtained if there is no delay in planting the crop and no stress due excessive or deficient soil water conditions nor soil salinity we calculated the average annual drainage system cost aadsc ha huffman et al 2013 as 5 aadsc 10000 s o icds i r ai 2 dep mr where s o is the optimum drain spacing m icds is the initial cost of the drainage system that

maintenance rate per year decimal step 3 select the optimum drain spacing the drain spacing giving the maximum annual return on investment fig 4 was determined as the optimum drain spacing for each combination of drain depth effective radius location and soil in this step we found that varying the annual corn production cost acpc shifts the average annual return graph in fig 4 vertically but not horizontally when all economic and other inputs are kept constant thus changes in acpc resulted in the same optimum drain spacing step 4 calculate the design drainage rate we used the optimum drain spacing from step 3 in eq 2 to calculate the ddr at the end of this step we obtained a ddr for each combination of factors d d r ef location soil step 5 regression analysis a multiple linear regression was performed with ddr as the dependent variable the independent variables were the long term growing season precipitation p g drain depth d d equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k e depth to restrictive layer d and effective radius r ef these independent variables were chosen to improve upon the previous work of skaggs 2007 that used p g d d and transmissivity k e d as independent variables it is important for the success of the empirical equation that these independent variables be readily measured or obtained the statistical software of jmp 15 0 sas institute inc was used for the regression analysis and assumption checks 2 5 evaluating the extent of scatter in the predictions of the empirical equations to show the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equations the ddr values calculated in step 4 of section 2 4 were compared to the empirically predicted ddr values calculated from the regression equations the extent of scatter was quantified using evaluation statistics of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 nse determines how good is the fit of the plot of ddr of step 4 versus empirically predicted ddr compared to the 1 1 line an nse value of 1 shows perfect agreement between the ddr of step 4 and empirically predicted ddr rsr is a normalized error index with an optimum value of 0 2 6 determining the effect of weather record on the design of drainage systems we repeated steps 1 through 3 of section 2 4 to determine the optimum drain spacing using all the economic and drainmod inputs used in this study except for using the weather data from the period of 1941 1990 that was used by skaggs 2007 in other words the only difference between the two simulations was the range of weather data to demonstrate the effect of weather record on the ddr we provided an example simulation for the 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius for the drummer silty clay loam soil at five locations baton rouge plymouth waseca urbana and albany then we compared our optimum drain spacing from the period of 1990 2019 to that of the period of 1941 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of location on the design drainage rate results showed that generally ddr increased with increasing long term growing season precipitation fig 5 table 4 for example ddr was 1 9 cm day for 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in baton rouge compared to a ddr of 0 7 cm day for the same soil and conditions in lansing the larger ddr for baton rouge corresponded to a 14 0 m optimum spacing compared to a wider 23 5 m optimum spacing for lansing table 4 the differences in ddr between the two locations were due to differences in the long term growing season precipitation 662 mm for baton rouge versus 438 mm for lansing and et the timing of weather events and related location specific factors therefore the ddr differences between locations illustrate the need for site specific ddr values for drainage system design 3 2 effect of drain depth on the design drainage rate results showed that generally ddr decreased with increasing drain depth table 4 for example ddr was 0 9 cm day for 75 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in lansing on the other hand ddr was 0 7 cm day for 125 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer soil in lansing the ddr at 75 cm drain depth corresponded with the narrower 18 0 m optimum spacing whereas the 125 cm drain depth was associated with the wider 28 0 m optimum spacing table 4 results of for the 0 5 cm and 5 9 cm effective radii are summarized in the supplementary table s1 as drains got deeper optimum drain spacing increased thereby increasing ddr average water table depth is shallower for the 75 cm drain depth than the 125 cm depth vlotman et al 2020 when water table is shallower in the shallow drains less soil profile is available for moisture storage thus greater excess water is available for drainage discharge thereby leading to a need for a greater ddr therefore a higher ddr is needed when drains are installed shallower 3 3 empirical equations 3 3 1 significance of the independent variables in the empirical equations in our first effort we determined an empirical equation based on data from all seven locations supplementary table s2 however the accuracy of the empirical equation improved when we divided the locations into two regions based on climate we determined separate empirical equations for the northeast and southeast regions fig 2 the boundary between the two regions was determined based on the long term average annual evapotranspiration map developed by reitz et al 2017 states south of the boundary had at least 50 area with an average annual evapotranspiration greater than 800 mm year supplementary fig s3 for both regions multiple linear regression showed that effective radius did not significantly affect the ddr supplementary table s3 so it was excluded from the regression analysis regression results showed that the long term growing season precipitation drain depth equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer were significant predictors the previous study by skaggs 2007 considered the combined effect of equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer by including transmissivity as an independent variable however we found greater accuracy of the empirical equations when these two factors were included as two separate independent variables compared to using the one variable of transmissivity 3 3 2 proportion of the variation explained by the empirical equations results of the regression analysis showed that 82 and 83 of the variation in the ddr were explained by eqs 6 and 10 in terms of the long term growing season precipitation drain depth equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth to restrictive layer table 5 as the number of independent variables reduced the performance of the empirical equations diminished as indicated by the reduction in the r square values table 5 in some cases certain independent variables are unavailable or unknown for example if depth to the restrictive layer and effective saturated hydraulic conductivity are unknown eqs 8 and 12 would have to be used with r square values of 0 60 and 0 64 for the northeast and southeast regions respectively in practical applications the ddr values estimated from eq 6 to 13 can be used in the hooghoudt eq 2 to calculate the optimum drain spacing that maximizes annual return on investment ddr values estimated from the regression equations are valid for corn soybean rotation on fields with fair to good surface drainage soybean glycine max l merr is generally considered to be more tolerant of wet conditions than corn so the results would hold for corn soybean rotation evans and fausey 1999 as defined in the drainmod reference report a field with fair to good surface drainage has some shallow depressions and ponding occurs in some of the depressions after heavy rainfall skaggs 1980 3 3 3 extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equations the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equation was evaluated by comparing the empirically predicted ddr values calculated from the regression equations with the ddr values calculated in step 4 of section 2 4 i e drainmod and associated economic analyses fig 6 for the northeast region eq 6 the nse was 0 82 perfect value is 1 and rsr was 0 42 perfect value is 0 for the southeast region eq 10 the nse was 0 84 and rsr was 0 41 results show that there is some uncertainty in the prediction of ddr especially when one or more of the inputs are unavailable or unknown therefore these empirical equations should be used as a guide for drainage design and not a rigid criterion 3 3 4 crop production and water quality implications of the empirical equation drain spacing influences how quickly water is removed from the soil profile thereby affecting nitrate loss skaggs 2017 the traditional method of choosing the drain spacing is based on local experience which may lead to choosing a too narrow or too wide of a drain spacing than what is needed to optimize crop production i e maximize economic return on investment another traditional method is choosing a drain spacing based on local drainage guides that provides a range of drain spacings based on typical characteristics of soil series since hydraulic conductivity varies widely within a soil series these guides can lead to choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow or too wide for a specific field skaggs et al 2006 choosing a drain spacing that is wider than what is needed to optimize crop production removes less water from the soil profile that may cause yield loss because of crop water stress therefore the empirical equation helps avoid too wide of a drain spacing by estimating an optimum drain spacing that optimizes crop production on the other hand choosing a drain spacing that is too narrow than what is needed to optimize crop production increases drainage intensity thereby increasing nitrate loss kladivko et al 1999 luo et al 2010 skaggs 2017 skaggs et al 2006 therefore we recommend practitioners avoid selecting a drain spacing that is considerably narrower than the optimum drain spacing the environmental value of the empirical equation is that it helps avoid too narrow of a drain spacing avoiding drainage more than needed provides a water quality benefit by reducing nitrate loss 3 4 effect of weather record on the design of drainage systems comparison of the ddr values obtained in our study with earlier published results shows the ddr values reported herein are generally greater than those presented by skaggs 2007 and skaggs et al 2006 for some of the same locations the earlier simulation studies were conducted for the 50 year period of weather record 1941 1990 there were also differences in the economic inputs prices costs and interest rates and certain other inputs for example corn prices 0 10 kg vs 0 14 kg drain pipe material plus installation 2 62 m vs 2 66 m and interest rate 6 vs 5 varied from one period to the other due to inflation to investigate if the period of weather record was a reason for the differences in ddr values we compared the optimum drain spacing from the recent period of 1990 2019 to that from the period of 1941 1990 that was used by skaggs 2007 results for the 100 cm drain depth 2 5 cm effective radius and drummer silty clay loam soil at five locations baton rouge plymouth waseca urbana and albany are summarized in table 6 except for the weather record all other inputs were the same as for the current study results showed that average optimum drain spacing based on the recent period 1990 2019 was 13 2 8 21 3 less than that based on weather data for 1941 1990 the narrower optimum drain spacing of the recent period corresponded to an average 35 0 3 0 9 increase in ddr optimum drain spacing decreased and ddr increased in all locations except for plymouth nc where the spacing was slightly increased 5 and ddr decreased 8 it is unclear why changes in optimum drain spacings and the corresponding ddr for plymouth nc for the two periods of weather data were much less and in the opposite direction than those for the other four locations climate change was evident from changes in average precipitation from the two periods of 1990 2019 and 1941 1990 results showed that all locations had a higher long term average annual precipitation for the recent period of 1990 2019 than the 1941 1990 period supplementary fig s1 we also found that the recent period of 1990 2019 had higher long term average growing season precipitation than the 1941 1990 period except for baton rouge fig 7 increase in annual precipitation over time has been previously reported for the midwest usa due to climate change easterling et al 2017 increase in annual precipitation is not the only climate change impact that influences drainage design other climate change impacts that influence drainage design include frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation temperature changes supplementary fig s2 extended drought periods over the growing season and other climate change impacts that affect crop yield therefore drainage design research along with climate change scenarios are needed to investigate how climate change will affect drainage design in the future 4 conclusions we developed empirical equations for northeast and southeast usa to estimate the site specific design drainage rate ddr within those regions our study resulted in the following key conclusions the site specific ddr can be estimated by an empirical equation when the following independent variables are available for a given field the long term average growing season precipitation p g drain depth d d equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile k e and depth to restrictive layer d simulations showed that the ddr varied with location due to climate differences across a region therefore it is important to use site specific ddr for drainage design to meet the local drainage demand as drains got deeper optimum drain spacing increased thereby increasing ddr therefore a higher ddr is needed when installing drains at a shallower depth the benefit of the empirical equations is that they predict the ddr that maximizes economic return on investment in the drainage system while preventing greater than necessary drainage intensities i e too narrow of a drain spacing that remove more water than needed therefore the appropriate use of these equations will provide both economic and environmental benefits comparison of optimum drain spacing from the 1990 2019 period to that of the 1941 1990 period showed there is a need for narrower optimum drain spacing and greater ddr in the recent period due to difference in the weather data climate change and drainage design research are needed to investigate how climate change will affect drainage design in the future in conclusion this paper presents a design method that optimizes drain spacing for maximum annual economic return on investment based on local soil and weather conditions this method can be used in other temperate humid regions of the world to develop empirical equations for designing more efficient drainage systems the findings of this paper have been incorporated

9901,crop pattern determination is an essential step toward proper water resources management in irrigated agricultural development especially in arid and in semi arid regions in this paper we propose a method for determining short term optimal crop pattern by developing a suitable model for a four reservoir system in the karun basin including karun 1 3 and 4 and gotvand reservoirs in iran the model satisfies multiple objectives including hydropower municipal industrial agricultural and environmental purposes to achieve this goal we examined two heuristic many objective algorithms including spea2 and nsga iii many objective algorithms provide a pareto front of optimal solutions however in practice we need to know an exact solution of crop pattern to overcome this problem a novel application of social choice sc is accomplished the results indicate the superiority of nsga iii over spea2 comparison of the results for the minimization objective functions shows that the average values of municipal agricultural environmental and hydropower obtained with the nsga iii algorithm are 0 22 6 73 0 49 and 1 72 respectively whereas in spea2 they are 0 72 9 47 2 05 and 4 72 this finding also emphasizes the importance of improvements necessary in solution algorithms for complicated water resources problems keywords many objective optimization optimal crop pattern multi reservoir operation nsga iii spea2 social choice 1 introduction the water crisis is a global problem which is more serious in arid and semi arid regions this problem becomes severe by increasing demand due to population growth improving living standards and climatic changes on the other hand efforts for adequate food production and economic development due to the rapid population growth have led to huge amounts of withdrawal from water resources malano and davidson 2009 pang et al 2013 the agriculture sector is mostly a major user of freshwater rumbaur et al 2015 in many developing countries the share of water use by agriculture is very high as compared to municipal and industrial sectors in iran nearly 92 of available renewable water is used by agriculture while municipal and industrial sectors use only 6 and 2 of water considering that iran located in middle east region with arid to semi arid climate is facing severe droughts and has a very low per capita available water below 1700 m3 it is very essential to manage its scares water utilization especially in irrigated agriculture this problem can be mainly solved by increasing the productivity of limited water resources and efficient use of irrigation water mariolakos 2007 increasing food demands with concerns to reducing environmental impacts as well as growing population persuade us to find new crop patterns rótolo et al 2015 the optimal cropping pattern is one of the most effective solutions for agricultural water management to utilize the optimum allocation of resources including water and land optimal cropping pattern determines which crops should be cultivated and or replaced each year in this regard the optimal allocation of water in agricultural lands and the optimization of cropping patterns with different methods were widely researched in recent decades among pioneer works dariane and hughes 1991 combined crop yield functions with reservoir operation in severe river basin in southern utah to determine the best crop patterns and optimal water allocations among different crops in each period mainuddin et al 1997 used the analytical hierarchy procedures and a linear programming lp model to optimize the pattern of farming in thailand for maximization of income and area under cultivation kuo et al 2000 used genetic algorithm ga for irrigation planning in tanshui farms they obtained maximum revenue and optimal cropping pattern in their study area by using the relative yield of plants and their water requirement haouari and azaiez 2001 proposed a lp model for optimizing reservoir operation surface and groundwater uses and the cropping pattern under water deficit conditions in the indian chitradorgay region georgiou and papamichail 2008 investigated the operation of a reservoir in the chalkidiki region of greece to determine the optimal cropping patterns under different climatic conditions using a nonlinear programming nlp model the proposed model is solved using the simulated annealing sa algorithm in combination with the gradient descent method mishra et al 2009 developed a multi objective optimization model to determine the optimal crop pattern and optimal size of auxiliary storage reservoir regulwar and gurav 2011 presented a multi objective linear fuzzy program for irrigation and deriving the optimal cropping pattern for the jayakwadi project in the godavari river in maharashtra india sadati et al 2014 used genetic algorithm to optimize water resources and cropping patterns in the droudzan river in fars province under different climatic conditions and scarcity water banihabib et al 2019 developed a fuzzy multi objective model to maximize the economic benefits of consumers and also to optimize the allocation of surface and groundwater resources used for the optimal cropping pattern najafabadi et al 2019 applied optimization measures to achieve the economic social and environmental objectives within the framework of multi objective planning leading to a 16 reduction in the level of the crop area in iran the results of such measures include a a reduction in the irrigation water consumption by 17 b an increase in profits by 58 and c an increase in production by 11 the history of reservoir operation clearly shows that there is a great amount of research on multi reservoir optimization and complex water resources systems labadie 2004 dariane and momtahen 2009 in recent years more attention has been given to systems with many objectives where water resources systems often have to be managed to meet these objectives which are usually in conflict with each other thus there has been a boost on research regarding many objective methods a many objective optimization problem maop is a multi objective optimization problem mop with four or more objectives son and kim 2018 among currently available maop algorithms spea2 is conceptually and functionally simple with high efficiency in solving problems this algorithm is developed based on the spea algorithm by zitzler et al 2001 nsga iii is another maop algorithm which is developed based on multi objective nsga ii algorithm through significant changes in its selection mechanism deb and jain 2013 chen et al 2017 used the nsga iii to solve the reservoir flood control operation problems karami and dariane 2018 proposed a many objective algorithm by combining melody search mes and social choice that can manage multiple scenarios simultaneously to find the optimal operating rule curves of a multi reservoir system problem they applied their proposed algorithm to optimize the operation policy according to different climate change scenarios there have been other applications of many objective algorithms some of which are mentioned as follows azari et al 2018 developed a model by coupling weap and nsga ii to derive hedging policy in a two reservoir system in the west of iran the results were compared with pesa ii and spea2 and reported that nsga ii performed better than the others farmani et al 2005 compared the performance of nsga ii and spea2 algorithms for water distribution network design their results show that spea2 algorithm is able to generate better solutions in comparison to nsga ii algorithm mytilinou and kolios 2017 used linked their model to nsga ii nsga iii and spea2 algorithms the performance of these algorithms demonstrated that nsga iii has better than nsga ii and spea2 algorithms the case of many objective modeling becomes more challenging for complex systems including multiple reservoirs solving optimization problems is usually a very complex task due to the existence of different goals in most real problems and especially in water resources management system problems so there is an essential need to develop a multi reservoir optimization model with a many objective approach therefore the purpose of this paper is to develop an appropriate model based on the optimal allocation of water resources from the multi reservoir system to meet the demands of a multi objective system with hydropower municipal and industrial agricultural and environmental purposes and also to obtain an optimal crop pattern in a short term period there are many articles dealing with multi reservoirs operation problems however adding crop pattern optimization in multi reservoir systems with many objectives is new to achieve this goal couple of many objective algorithms including spea2 and nsga iii has been selected we found that these two algorithms had the best performance among the available algorithms in our research nevertheless a major problem with multi and many objective algorithms is that they do not provide a single solution rather they find and present a pareto front of optimal solutions in one simulation run to overcome this problem a social choice method is proposed for choosing the best solution from among the pareto front solutions in the following section the methods used in this paper and components of the model are briefly described 2 methodology 2 1 nsga iii deb and jain 2013 introduced a novel generalization of nsga ii named nsga iii uniquely designed for solving many objective optimization the general framework of nsga iii is similar to nsga ii with significant changes in selection operator nsga iii uses a predefined set of referent points to ensure the diversity in obtained solutions instead of crowding distance in nsga ii deb et al 2002 both of the nsga iii and the nsga ii utilize crossover and mutation operator to generate offspring individuals and apply fast non dominated sorting approach to divide individuals into different non dominated ranks fig 1 shows the flowchart of the nsga iii algorithm the steps used in solving a problem by nsga iii are described as follows 1 define a set of reference points z r automatically or by the user 2 initialize the parent population p t of size n randomly and calculate objective functions for each chromosome 3 apply the binary tournament selection crossover and mutation operators for generating offspring population q t 4 combine the offspring population with the parent population and create a new population r t with 2 n members 5 do non dominated fast sorting for r t members and identify f 1 f 2 f ℓ 1 fronts 6 generate a new set of s t with non dominated members of different levels after non dominated sorting each non domination level is selected one at a time to construct a new population s t starting from f 1 until the size of st is equal to n or for the first time exceeds n the last level included is the ℓ t h level thus all solutions from level ℓ 1 onward are rejected from the combined population r t now two states can happen if s t n no further operations is need and the next generation starts with s t p t 1 s t if s t n then choose the remaining members k n p t 1 of f ℓ to keep the desired diversity in populations members from one to ℓ 1 fronts are already selected i e p t 1 i 1 ℓ 1 f i 1 compute niche count of reference point j z r to choose the remaining members to accomplish this objective functions and reference points are first normalized so that they have an identical range then orthogonal distance between a member in st and each of the reference lines joining the ideal point and a reference point is calculated thereafter each member in s t is associated with the reference pointe having the smallest orthogonal distance next the niche count ρ for each reference point defined as the number of members in s t f ℓ st except f ℓ that are associated with the reference point is calculated 2 identify the reference point that has minimum niche count and choose the member in f ℓ that is associated with the identified reference point for the final population p t 1 the niche count of the identified reference point is increased by one and the procedure is repeated to fill up p t 1 3 complete one loop of this algorithm then go to step 3 to achieve target iteration or precision 2 2 spea 2 spea2 is based on the spea and is capable of using other auxiliary algorithms to enhance its performance zitzler et al 2001 fig 2 shows

multiple objectives in real world problems particularly in water resources systems in problems with several objectives improving one objective usually ends up with taking distance from the desirable values of other objectives these objectives are defined based on system components such as social economical environmental flood control energy generation municipal industrial and agricultural or they depend on the organization s demands or beneficiary individuals in this area social choice methods can be easily based on all components of the system s satisfaction social choice is a method of voting and ranking available options based on their preferences for decision makers sc approach was first introduced by two french mathematician and political scientists jean charles de borda and condorcet during the french revolution two centuries later it was resurrected and completed to a democratic voting system by an economist named arrow arrow became interested in establishing a complete democratic system of voting by prioritizing the candidates in which a any potential outcome was achievable b outcome of any situation is possible c the winner shall not be elected by one vote only d eliminating some candidates will not affect the priority given to other candidates and e if the priority of a candidate on the ballot is raised the status of the same candidate will only improve as a

decision maker assigns candidate i a number of points equal to the number of candidates below candidate i which is m i and m is the number of candidates then the candidate with the highest summation of decision makers points borda count is the winner karami and dariane 2018 the borda count method is suggested as an efficient way to solve water resources management problems and based on many real case studies the most important advantage of the borda count method over the majority voting method is consideration of all decision makers in the ranking it is proved that borda count method is one of the most effective in determining the winner than the other methods taylor 1995 3 case study and application a four reservoir system in karun basin consisting of karun 1 3 and 4 and gotvand reservoirs each with an agricultural demand center at their downstream and a hydropower plant is considered as the case study in this paper generating energy is the primary purpose of karun 1 karun 3 and karun 4 reservoirs but it is the secondary objective in gotvand thus for karun 1 3 and 4 reservoirs the order of demands to be met is hydropower municipal environmental and agricultural for gotvand reservoir due to large areas of agriculture in the downstream the order of demands to be fulfilled is municipal environmental agricultural and hydropower fig 3 shows the geographical location map of the study area along with its components all the four reservoirs are built on the main branch of the karun river located in the southwest of iran between 48 15 and 52 30 eastern longitudes and 30 20 and 32 50 northern latitudes in this study the environmental demand is considered as equal to 10 of long term mean monthly river flow tennant 1976 according to this method mean monthly minimum streamflow requirements for karun 1 3 4 and gotvand are estimated as 63 55 33 and 72 million cubic meters mcm respectively the municipal demands are nearly constant during all months of the year and they are 0 7 9 1 0 4 and 7 5 mcm for karun 1 3 4 and gotvand reservoir respectively hydropower demands mcm are calculated using eq 1 1 d h y d t q r e q t p t n d a y 3600 10 6 where q r e q t is the flow required for primary energy production in period t m3 s p t is the duration of peak hours and n d a y is number of days per each month fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the system a review of system configuration as shown in fig 4 indicates the possible complexities in this study there are five objective functions in this system minimizing the sum of total normalized squared deviation of municipal release from its demand minimizing the sum of total normalized squared deviation of agricultural release from its demand minimizing the sum of total normalized squared deviation of

cultivation area are in hectare in this modeling decision variables are the releases from each reservoir for any downstream demands in period t and the amount of cultivation area for each crop downstream from reservoir i i e a c i it is worthwhile to mention that although in this article a short term of one year is considered for model implementation however the model can be easily modified for longer time spans the total number of decision variables is 232 192 variables related to the monthly releases all reservoirs and 40 decision variables for selected crops within the agricultural areas which indicates a problem with relatively high dimensions in this study the crop area constraints are satisfied based on the penalty function method the optimization problem is subject to the following constraints 1 the mass balance equation for reservoirs 7 s t 1 i s t i q t i r t i s p i l l t i e t i t 1 2 t i 1 2 n r where s t i and s t 1 i are storage volumes for i th reservoir at the beginning and end of period t and q t i s p i l l t i e t i and r t i are the inflow spill net evaporation losses and total release from the i th reservoir during month t respectively n r is the number of reservoirs in the system i e 4 in this case the inflow to the reservoirs is calculated based on the head water for karun 4 reservoir the intermediate flow that we already had as given based on work by dariane et al 2021 and the release from the upstream reservoir any water diversion and return flow the amount of evaporation losses in reservoirs are calculated based on the long term average evaporation height and the average lake area in each period using the reservoir area storage volume relationship the storage capacity constraints for reservoirs 8 s min i s t i s max i t 1 2 t i 1 2 n r where s min i and s max i are minimum and maximum storage volume for the i th reservoir respectively 2 the initial storage volume it is assumed that initial storage of reservoirs at the beginning of optimization period is equal to 90 of the maximum capacity 9 s 1 i 0 9 s max i i 1 2 n r 3 the final storage bound to avoid stealing water from storage differences for each reservoir it is assumed that the final storage at the end of the optimization horizon is equal or larger to the storage at the beginning of the first period 10 s t 1 i s 1 i i 1 2 n r 4 energy production limits the energy produced in each period is limited to the maximum possible energy production according to the power plant capacity this limitation for peak energy is applicable by the following equation 11 k w h t i p d e p i h r t p f t where p d e p t i installed plant capacity in k w p f t i is plant factor and h r t is number of hours of in period t for the secondary energy in each period the following equation is applied 12 k w h t i p d e p i h r t 1 p f t 5 the net head limit on the turbines in defining the amount of energy demand the maximum and minimum head constraints is first checked and then the produced energy is calculated if the net head on the turbine is within the permissible range 13 c h min i h d i h n e t t i c h max i h d i this relationship is defined based on power plant constraints the power plant has a range of operation beyond which it cannot operate efficiently when the net head h n e t is calculated it should be in a close range to the design head h d as defined by relation 13 here c h min and c h max have been considered equal to 0 65 and 1 25 respectively stelzer and walters 1977 6 total agricultural area constraints the sum of the cultivation area for each crop must be limited to the total cultivable area in each region 14 c 1 c a c i a g i i 1 2 n r where a g i is the total area of the agricultural region downstream from reservoir i in ha

irrigation demand assuming a total irrigation efficiency of 40 the gross irrigation demand of each crop is calculated by the following relation 16 t d m c t i r c t 0 4 for c 1 2 c t 1 2 t where i r c t is each crop s net irrigation demand in period t known next the amount of irrigation demand in each region is calculated by the following equation noting that a conversion factor is also used to convert t d m c t parameter in m m to m c m unit 17 d a g r t i c 1 c t d m c t a c c i 0 00001 one way to choose the best solution from among the optimal pareto front solutions is the application of weighted sum method by this method a weight is assigned to each of the objective functions according to their importance and weighted sum of functions is calculated therefore a multi objective problem will be converted into one objective problem weight consideration of the weighted sum method needs a sensitivity analysis and several programs runs since functions have priorities in water resource management choosing a proper social choice method for determining the weights in objective functions can be used instead of the time consuming sensitivity analysis process in the weighted sum method 4 results and discussion as mentioned earlier nsga iii and spea2 algorithms are comparatively applied to solve the multi purpose many objective water resources system problem under similar conditions the parameters of nsga iii and spea2 algorithms are obtained by sensitivity analysis and they are similar in both the crossover and mutation rates are obtained as 0 7 and 0 3 respectively the population size is found to be 100 and the number of iterations is set at 2000 since according to the pareto front none of the solutions is distinguishable as superior to the others in the last iteration the social choice method has been proposed to select the best solution from the pareto front solutions for this purpose the pareto front answers are first ranked for each objective function for the first four objective functions i e release deviations which are minimizations the lowest value of the objective function has been set as rank 1 and the highest value has the last rank next the superior answer was selected using the borda count method in this study the voters of each of the objective functions and the candidates of each of the solutions on the pareto front are considered since the meta heuristic algorithms are random in nature and may produce different solutions in each run the corresponding algorithm was run 5 times with 2000 iterations per run to get a better view of the performance of methods table 1 a and b shows the results of these independent runs as it can be seen from table 1 the mean objective function of municipal sector is lower than those of agricultural environmental and hydropower sectors also the mean objective function of agricultural sector is much higher than the other three these are justified by the prioritization factor and also the fact that the agricultural demand is substantially higher than municipal and environmental as well as hydropower demands and thus it faces more shortages than those sectors making the objective function greater than others it should be noted that water released for hydropower and environmental demands can be used to fulfill the municipal and agricultural demands at the downstream it can be seen from table 1 that the average objective function of municipal agriculture environmental and hydropower obtained by spea2 algorithm are respectively 227 41 318 and 174 higher worse than that of nsga iii which indicates its poor performance as compared to nsga iii however spea2 performs slightly 1 2 better than nsga iii in the fifth objective function i e maximization of net income which is negligible fig 5 compares the convergence of the two algorithms as it can be seen convergence of all targets in the nsga iii is faster than that of spea2 for example in the nsga iii method the performance of the municipal is more desired in the 500th iteration than in the spea2 method according to fig 5 in the nsga iii method the municipal objective function is almost fixed at 1700th iteration agricultural environmental hydropower net agricultural income functions are also approximately fixed in 1600th 500th 300th and 1500th iterations respectively however in the spea2 method the municipal objective function is almost fixed in iteration 2000 agricultural environmental hydropower net agricultural income functions are also approximately fixed in 1000th 1600th 1500th and 1500th iterations respectively therefore nsga iii is faster and performs better than spea2 in terms of convergence rate and the final solutions found the aforementioned findings can also be shown graphically for instance fig 6 illustrates the results of releases and demands for the municipal purpose in each of the karun4 karun3 karun1 and gotvand reservoirs fig 6 confirms the figures shown in table 1 a and b regarding the superiority of nsga iii over spea2 in municipal demand fulfillment similar trend is observed for other sectors table 2 represents the average cropping pattern which is optimized for 10 major crops in the karun basin and in the agricultural area attached to each reservoir they are derived from five independent runs as mentioned earlier all the obtained areas are within the minimum and maximum crop area constraint comparing the values of two methods in table 2 it can be seen that the optimal cultivation area for all dominant crops obtained by nsga iii and spea2 methods are usually different in some cases the difference is ignorable however in most cases it is very significant as high as 170 indicating the importance of optimization algorithm in solving water resources system problems this once again proves that the need for continuous research in optimization algorithms is inevitable and necessary in this field and maybe many other fields with complicated system problems fig 7 a and b show the monthly average percentage of supply for municipal environmental agricultural and hydropower demands of each reservoir which confirm better performance of nsga iii as compared to spea2 5 conclusions in this paper spea2 and nsga iii were applied in a multi reservoir multi objective system problem to determine short term optimum crop pattern in karun basin this was established using a novel application of a social choice method to overcome the selection problem among solutions in pareto front produced by many objective algorithms four objective functions were defined based on minimizing the sum of squared relative deviations from demands by hydropower municipal agricultural and environmental sectors also the fifth objective was defined to maximize the net income from crop production in the area the results indicated the firm superiority of nsga iii over spea2 in first four objective functions with spea2 being slightly better in the fifth objective function it was also noticed that the amount of agricultural objective function is substantially higher than other three dimensionless objective functions this was interpreted to be mainly due to higher demands by agriculture and consequently higher possibility of shortages the results obtained in this paper emphasize the importance of improvements necessary in solution algorithms for complicated water resources problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9901,crop pattern determination is an essential step toward proper water resources management in irrigated agricultural development especially in arid and in semi arid regions in this paper we propose a method for determining short term optimal crop pattern by developing a suitable model for a four reservoir system in the karun basin including karun 1 3 and 4 and gotvand reservoirs in iran the model satisfies multiple objectives including hydropower municipal industrial agricultural and environmental purposes to achieve this goal we examined two heuristic many objective algorithms including spea2 and nsga iii many objective algorithms provide a pareto front of optimal solutions however in practice we need to know an exact solution of crop pattern to overcome this problem a novel application of social choice sc is accomplished the results indicate the superiority of nsga iii over spea2 comparison of the results for the minimization objective functions shows that the average values of municipal agricultural environmental and hydropower obtained with the nsga iii algorithm are 0 22 6 73 0 49 and 1 72 respectively whereas in spea2 they are 0 72 9 47 2 05 and 4 72 this finding also emphasizes the importance of improvements necessary in solution algorithms for complicated water resources problems keywords many objective optimization optimal crop pattern multi reservoir operation nsga iii spea2 social choice 1 introduction the water crisis is a global problem which is more serious in arid and semi arid regions this problem becomes severe by increasing demand due to population growth improving living standards and climatic changes on the other hand efforts for adequate food production and economic development due to the rapid population growth have led to huge amounts of withdrawal from water resources malano and davidson 2009 pang et al 2013 the agriculture sector is mostly a major user of freshwater rumbaur et al 2015 in many developing countries the share of water use by agriculture is very high as compared to municipal and industrial sectors in iran nearly 92 of available renewable water is used by agriculture while municipal and industrial sectors use only 6 and 2 of water considering that iran located in middle east region with arid to semi arid climate is facing severe droughts and has a very low per capita available water below 1700 m3 it is very essential to manage its scares water utilization especially in irrigated agriculture this problem can be mainly solved by increasing the productivity of limited water resources and efficient use of irrigation water mariolakos 2007 increasing food demands with concerns to reducing environmental impacts as well as growing population persuade us to find new crop patterns rótolo et al 2015 the optimal cropping pattern is one of the most effective solutions for agricultural water management to utilize the optimum allocation of resources including water and land optimal cropping pattern determines which crops should be cultivated and or replaced each year in this regard the optimal allocation of water in agricultural lands and the optimization of cropping patterns with different methods were widely researched in recent decades among pioneer works dariane and hughes 1991 combined crop yield functions with reservoir operation in severe river basin in southern utah to determine the best crop patterns and optimal water allocations among different crops in each period mainuddin et al 1997 used the analytical hierarchy procedures and a linear programming lp model to optimize the pattern of farming in thailand for maximization of income and area under cultivation kuo et al 2000 used genetic algorithm ga for irrigation planning in tanshui farms they obtained maximum revenue and optimal cropping pattern in their study area by using the relative yield of plants and their water requirement haouari and azaiez 2001 proposed a lp model for optimizing reservoir operation surface and groundwater uses and the cropping pattern under water deficit conditions in the indian chitradorgay region georgiou and papamichail 2008 investigated the operation of a reservoir in the chalkidiki region of greece to determine the optimal cropping patterns under different climatic conditions using a nonlinear programming nlp model the proposed model is solved using the simulated annealing sa algorithm in combination with the gradient descent method mishra et al 2009 developed a multi objective optimization model to determine the optimal crop pattern and optimal size of auxiliary storage reservoir regulwar and gurav 2011 presented a multi objective linear fuzzy program for irrigation and deriving the optimal cropping pattern for the jayakwadi project in the godavari river in maharashtra india sadati et al 2014 used genetic algorithm to optimize water resources and cropping patterns in the droudzan river in fars province under different climatic conditions and scarcity water banihabib et al 2019 developed a fuzzy multi objective model to maximize the economic benefits of consumers and also to optimize the allocation of surface and groundwater resources used for the optimal cropping pattern najafabadi et al 2019 applied optimization measures to achieve the economic social and environmental objectives within the framework of multi objective planning leading to a 16 reduction in the level of the crop area in iran the results of such measures include a a reduction in the irrigation water consumption by 17 b an increase in profits by 58 and c an increase in production by 11 the history of reservoir operation clearly shows that there is a great amount of research on multi reservoir optimization and complex water resources systems labadie 2004 dariane and momtahen 2009 in recent years more attention has been given to systems with many objectives where water resources systems often have to be managed to meet these objectives which are usually in conflict with each other thus there has been a boost on research regarding many objective methods a many objective optimization problem maop is a multi objective optimization problem mop with four or more objectives son and kim 2018 among currently available maop algorithms spea2 is conceptually and functionally simple with high efficiency in solving problems this algorithm is developed based on the spea algorithm by zitzler et al 2001 nsga iii is another maop algorithm which is developed based on multi objective nsga ii algorithm through significant changes in its selection mechanism deb and jain 2013 chen et al 2017 used the nsga iii to solve the reservoir flood control operation problems karami and dariane 2018 proposed a many objective algorithm by combining melody search mes and social choice that can manage multiple scenarios simultaneously to find the optimal operating rule curves of a multi reservoir system problem they applied their proposed algorithm to optimize the operation policy according to different climate change scenarios there have been other applications of many objective algorithms some of which are mentioned as follows azari et al 2018 developed a model by coupling weap and nsga ii to derive hedging policy in a two reservoir system in the west of iran the results were compared with pesa ii and spea2 and reported that nsga ii performed better than the others farmani et al 2005 compared the performance of nsga ii and spea2 algorithms for water distribution network design their results show that spea2 algorithm is able to generate better solutions in comparison to nsga ii algorithm mytilinou and kolios 2017 used linked their model to nsga ii nsga iii and spea2 algorithms the performance of these algorithms demonstrated that nsga iii has better than nsga ii and spea2 algorithms the case of many objective modeling becomes more challenging for complex systems including multiple reservoirs solving optimization problems is usually a very complex task due to the existence of different goals in most real problems and especially in water resources management system problems so there is an essential need to develop a multi reservoir optimization model with a many objective approach therefore the purpose of this paper is to develop an appropriate model based on the optimal allocation of water resources from the multi reservoir system to meet the demands of a multi objective system with hydropower municipal and industrial agricultural and environmental purposes and also to obtain an optimal crop pattern in a short term period there are many articles dealing with multi reservoirs operation problems however adding crop pattern optimization in multi reservoir systems with many objectives is new to achieve this goal couple of many objective algorithms including spea2 and nsga iii has been selected we found that these two algorithms had the best performance among the available algorithms in our research nevertheless a major problem with multi and many objective algorithms is that they do not provide a single solution rather they find and present a pareto front of optimal solutions in one simulation run to overcome this problem a social choice method is proposed for choosing the best solution from among the pareto front solutions in the following section the methods used in this paper and components of the model are briefly described 2 methodology 2 1 nsga iii deb and jain 2013 introduced a novel generalization of nsga ii named nsga iii uniquely designed for solving many objective optimization the general framework of nsga iii is similar to nsga ii with significant changes in selection operator nsga iii uses a predefined set of referent points to ensure the diversity in obtained solutions instead of crowding distance in nsga ii deb et al 2002 both of the nsga iii and the nsga ii utilize crossover and mutation operator to generate offspring individuals and apply fast non dominated sorting approach to divide individuals into different non dominated ranks fig 1 shows the flowchart of the nsga iii algorithm the steps used in solving a problem by nsga iii are described as follows 1 define a set of reference points z r automatically or by the user 2 initialize the parent population p t of size n randomly and calculate objective functions for each chromosome 3 apply the binary tournament selection crossover and mutation operators for generating offspring population q t 4 combine the offspring population with the parent population and create a new population r t with 2 n members 5 do non dominated fast sorting for r t members and identify f 1 f 2 f ℓ 1 fronts 6 generate a new set of s t with non dominated members of different levels after non dominated sorting each non domination level is selected one at a time to construct a new population s t starting from f 1 until the size of st is equal to n or for the first time exceeds n the last level included is the ℓ t h level thus all solutions from level ℓ 1 onward are rejected from the combined population r t now two states can happen if s t n no further operations is need and the next generation starts with s t p t 1 s t if s t n then choose the remaining members k n p t 1 of f ℓ to keep the desired diversity in populations members from one to ℓ 1 fronts are already selected i e p t 1 i 1 ℓ 1 f i 1 compute niche count of reference point j z r to choose the remaining members to accomplish this objective functions and reference points are first normalized so that they have an identical range then orthogonal distance between a member in st and each of the reference lines joining the ideal point and a reference point is calculated thereafter each member in s t is associated with the reference pointe having the smallest orthogonal distance next the niche count ρ for each reference point defined as the number of members in s t f ℓ st except f ℓ that are associated with the reference point is calculated 2 identify the reference point that has minimum niche count and choose the member in f ℓ that is associated with the identified reference point for the final population p t 1 the niche count of the identified reference point is increased by one and the procedure is repeated to fill up p t 1 3 complete one loop of this algorithm then go to step 3 to achieve target iteration or precision 2 2 spea 2 spea2 is based on the spea and is capable of using other auxiliary algorithms to enhance its performance zitzler et al 2001 fig 2 shows the flowchart of spea2 and is described step by step in the following 1 initialization generate an initial population p 0 and create empty archive external set p 0 ϕ set t 0 next combine p 0 and p 0 to generate current population q t 2 fitness assignment calculate ﬁtness values of individuals in q t 3 environmental selection transfer non dominated members of q t to p t 1 where p t 1 is a draft for the next step archive now by comparing number of p t 1 members with n members three different states can occur if p t 1 n fill p t 1 with dominated members of q t if p t 1 n terminate excessive members with special method if p t 1 n do nothing 1 termination i f t t or another stopping criterion is satisﬁed then choose non dominated individuals of p t 1 as final solutions pareto front 2 mating selection perform binary tournament selection with replacement on p t 1 in order to ﬁll the mating pool 3 variation apply recombination and mutation operators to the mating pool p t 1 and set to the resulting population q t 1 p t 1 increment generation counter t t 1 and go to step 2 2 3 social choice solving optimization problems are along with too much complexity due to the existence of

for longer time spans the total number of decision variables is 232 192 variables related to the monthly releases all reservoirs and 40 decision variables for selected crops within the agricultural

weighted sum method by this method a weight is assigned to each of the objective functions according to their importance and weighted sum of functions is calculated therefore a multi objective problem will be converted into one objective problem weight consideration of the weighted sum method needs a sensitivity analysis and several programs runs since functions have priorities in water resource management choosing a proper social choice method for determining the weights in objective functions can be used instead of the time consuming sensitivity analysis process in the weighted sum method 4 results and discussion as mentioned earlier nsga iii and spea2 algorithms are comparatively applied to solve the multi purpose many objective water resources system problem under similar conditions the parameters of nsga iii and spea2 algorithms are obtained by sensitivity analysis and they are similar in both the crossover and mutation rates are obtained as 0 7 and 0 3 respectively the population size is found to be 100 and the number of iterations is set at 2000 since according to the pareto front none of the solutions is distinguishable as superior to the others in the last iteration the social choice method has been proposed to select the best solution from the pareto front solutions for this purpose the pareto front answers are first ranked for each objective function for the first four objective functions i e release deviations which are minimizations the lowest value of the objective function has been set as rank 1 and the highest value has the last rank next the superior answer was selected using the borda count method in this study the voters of each of the objective functions and the candidates of each of the solutions on the pareto front are considered since the meta heuristic algorithms are random in nature and may produce different solutions in each run the corresponding algorithm was run 5 times with 2000 iterations per run to get a better view of the performance of methods table 1 a and b shows the results of these independent runs as it can be seen from table 1 the mean objective function of municipal sector is lower than those of agricultural environmental and hydropower sectors also the mean objective function of agricultural sector is much higher than the other three these are justified by the prioritization factor and also the fact that the agricultural demand is substantially higher than municipal and environmental as well as hydropower demands and thus it faces more shortages than those sectors making the objective function greater than others it should be noted that water released for hydropower and environmental demands can be used to fulfill the municipal and agricultural demands at the downstream it can be seen from table 1 that the average objective function of municipal agriculture environmental and hydropower obtained by spea2 algorithm are respectively 227 41 318 and 174 higher worse than that of nsga iii which indicates its poor performance as compared to nsga iii however spea2 performs slightly 1 2 better than nsga iii in the fifth objective function i e maximization of net income which is negligible fig 5 compares the convergence of the two algorithms as it can be seen convergence of all targets in the nsga iii is faster than that of spea2 for example in the nsga iii method the performance of the municipal is more desired in the 500th iteration than in the spea2 method according to fig 5 in the nsga iii method the municipal objective function is almost fixed at 1700th iteration agricultural environmental hydropower net agricultural income functions are also approximately fixed in 1600th 500th 300th and 1500th iterations respectively however in the spea2 method the municipal objective function is almost fixed in iteration 2000 agricultural environmental hydropower net agricultural income functions are also approximately fixed in 1000th 1600th 1500th and 1500th iterations respectively therefore nsga iii is faster and performs better than spea2 in terms of convergence rate and the final solutions found the aforementioned findings can also be shown graphically for instance fig 6 illustrates the results of releases and demands for the municipal purpose in each of the karun4 karun3 karun1 and gotvand reservoirs fig 6 confirms the figures shown in table 1 a and b regarding the superiority of nsga iii over spea2 in municipal demand fulfillment similar trend is observed for other sectors table 2 represents the average cropping pattern which is optimized for 10 major crops in the karun basin and in the agricultural area attached to each reservoir they are derived from five independent runs as mentioned earlier all the obtained areas are within the minimum and maximum crop area constraint comparing the values of two methods in table 2 it can be seen that the optimal cultivation area for all dominant crops obtained by nsga iii and spea2 methods are usually different in some cases the difference is ignorable however in most cases it is very significant as high as 170 indicating the importance of optimization algorithm in solving water resources system problems this once again proves that the need for continuous research in optimization algorithms is inevitable and necessary in this field and maybe many other fields with complicated system problems fig 7 a and b show the monthly average percentage of supply for municipal environmental agricultural and hydropower demands of each reservoir which confirm better performance of nsga iii as compared to spea2 5 conclusions in this paper spea2 and nsga iii were applied in a multi reservoir multi objective system problem to determine short term optimum crop pattern in karun basin this was established using a novel application of a social choice method to overcome the selection problem among solutions in pareto front produced by many objective algorithms four objective functions were defined based on minimizing the sum of squared relative deviations from demands by hydropower municipal agricultural and environmental sectors also the fifth objective was defined to maximize the net income from crop production in the area the results indicated the firm superiority of nsga iii over spea2 in first four objective functions with spea2 being slightly better in the fifth objective function it was also noticed that the amount of agricultural objective function is substantially higher than other three dimensionless objective functions this was interpreted to be mainly due to higher demands by agriculture and consequently higher possibility of shortages the results obtained in this paper emphasize the importance of improvements necessary in solution algorithms for complicated water resources problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9902,this paper examines the effectiveness of reforming water rights regimes in the agricultural sector by replacing allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with the implementation of a priority rule that establishes security differentiated water rights the main objective is to assess whether this change improves the economic efficiency of water allocation at the irrigation district level particularly during cyclical scarcity events to this end a positive mathematical programming model is built to simulate the performance of the proposed reform in an irrigation district in southern spain the results show that the efficiency gains brought about by this change are very small which casts doubt on its ability to improve water use efficiency in the agricultural sector at the local level i e irrigation district under current local climate and water availability conditions in any case further research is needed to assess the suitability of this change in allocations rules at basin scale with greater farm heterogeneity especially given the likelihood of more frequent more intense droughts due to climate change keywords water allocation regime security differentiated water rights drought management positive mathematical programming spain 1 introduction and objectives water resources provide important ecosystem and socio cultural services e g biodiversity pollution sinks or recreational facilities and share many characteristics with public goods in addition water resources are a commodity used as an input in many economic activities e g agriculture industry or energy production furthermore access to supply facilities drinking water and sanitation is a basic human right that contributes to the maintenance of public health all this makes water a complex economic good hanemann 2006 for this reason water generally enjoys a special legal status managed according to the public trust doctrine which aims to ensure efficiency equity and environmental sustainability rogers et al 2002 according to this doctrine water management is usually based on centralized allocation regimes involving water rights also called entitlements licenses concessions or permits granted by a public authority that determines how much water can be diverted from water bodies and who is allowed to use these resources rights holders only the current allocation regimes are determined by historical water availability and traditional usage patterns which generally do not correspond to current social preferences in fact most of them are not designed to adapt to changing conditions affecting both the demand e g growing demand for water for economic activities and the environment and the supply e g climate change of water resources these outdated designs lead to inefficiencies in the allocation of water such as the use of this resource as an input for crops with low water productivity or the over abstraction of water bodies which jeopardizes water supply reliability and the provision of ecosystem services oecd 2015 in order to solve these inefficiencies in water allocation many countries have developed water trading instruments water markets and water banks to make allocation regimes more flexible and allow them to be adapted to new circumstances bjornlund 2003a debaere et al 2014 howitt 2015 along the same lines there have been calls for a reform of these allocation regimes aimed at achieving a more efficient and sustainable allocation of increasingly scarce water resources e g bruns et al 2005 hodgson 2006 it is worth pointing out that the availability of water varies over time and space which makes the temporal and spatial matching of supply and demand a major challenge for water managers hanemann 2006 this variability means water scarcity is dynamic ranging from wet periods when all volumes granted by water rights can be fully provided to dry periods droughts when scarce water resources have to be rationed although storage e g reservoirs and conveyance e g channels and pipelines infrastructure is used to minimize this mismatch significant fluctuations in resource availability inherent in any water system as a consequence of the natural water cycle seasonal and interannual variability of rainfall and water flows mean that water supply cannot be fully guaranteed especially in more arid regions moreover the frequency and intensity of these episodes of cyclical scarcity droughts are exacerbated in many regions by climate change resulting in water supply becoming less and less reliable bisselink et al 2018 when a drought episode occurs allocation regimes also determine how the available scarce resources are to be shared among the water rights holders by determining the proportion of the volumes granted by these rights that each holder can actually use this paper focuses on the allocation regimes implemented within the agricultural sector the world s largest water user and more specifically on the rationing systems to be applied to irrigation water rights holders during cyclical scarcity events droughts in this sense there are two main alternative approaches to rationing irrigation water allocations those based on the proportional rule and those based on priority rules oecd 2016 the proportional rule is the most widely used rationing method for irrigation water allocation during hydrological droughts according to this rule all water rights holders receive a quantity of water proportional to their water rights so that total demand equals total supply for the implementation of the priority rule the irrigation rights holders are divided into priority classes with their water rights being allocated lexicographically according to the established priority levels this means that the demands of the rights holders with the highest priority are met first and only when they are fully met is the remaining resource allocated to the following rights holders according to a criterion of decreasing priority order gómez limón et al 2020 both allocation rules have their pros and cons the proportional rule is easy to understand by rights holders and easy to implement in a real world setting moreover it is generally judged to be a fair procedure for rationing water since it promotes equal shares allocated to equal demands it fulfills the equal treatment of equals axiom characterizing symmetric rationing methods while these advantages explain the popularity of this allocation procedure it fails to achieve an economically efficient distribution of the available water this is because irrigators are heterogeneous in terms of production potential pedoclimatic conditions production technology or farm size economies of scale and the psychological characteristics e g risk aversion shaping their production decision making i e crop mixes with both of these features also determining heterogeneous agricultural and water productivity thus proportional water rationing has quite different impacts on individual irrigators e g intensive vs extensive farmers failing to minimize the aggregate losses stemming from water scarcity there is a wide range of empirical evidence on this source of inefficiency in the irrigation sector alarcón et al 2014 martínez and esteban 2014 goetz et al 2017 water rights regimes with different levels of priority are an interesting alternative for the allocation of water within the agricultural sector during cyclical scarcity periods since they enable more efficient water use and risk sharing freebairn and quiggin 2006 lefebvre et al 2012 the key idea behind this allocation procedure is that the irrigators who are more vulnerable to water supply gaps e g farmers with perennial or horticultural crops are able to reduce the risk related to water reliability by obtaining high priority rights transferring this risk to lower priority rights holders who are better positioned to assume this risk e g farmers with extensive annual crops also known as security differentiated water rights it is considered an adaptation measure to climate change xu et al 2014 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 furthermore this allocation rule enables higher priority rights holders to further specialize in higher value added farming systems thereby improving economic efficiency in the long term xu et al 2014 nevertheless this rule is seldom implemented because the configuration of efficient portfolios of water rights involves significant transaction costs bjornlund 2003b and the fact that it is an asymmetric rationing method rights holders are treated differently makes it politically and socially controversial in any case the literature provides consistent evidence that irrigators are willing to pay to increase water supply reliability e g rigby et al 2010 mesa jurado et al 2012 alcón et al 2014 guerrero baena et al 2019 justifying their interest in obtaining higher priority rights however these irrigators capacity to cover the transactions costs and the compensation claimed by those keeping lower priority rights i e reliability losers is still an open question needing empirical research despite the abovementioned cons priority allocation rules are in effect in the western united states following the prior appropriation doctrine i e priority determined by seniority and in the australian states of new south wales queensland southern australia and victoria based on two priority classes e g high security and general security access entitlements in new south wales or high reliability and low reliability entitlements in victoria taylor 2019 both cases provide an interesting international experience to learn from in order to improve agricultural water management gómez limón et al 2020 within this framework the objective of this paper is to assess the improvement in economic efficiency generated when an allocation regime based on the proportional rule is replaced with a regime based on a priority allocation rule to that end we focused on a spanish irrigation district as a case study using positive mathematical programming to simulate farmers willingness to pay wtp for higher priority water rights and willingness to accept wta for lower priority rights considering that their decisions regarding their individual portfolios of water rights determine their water supply reliability and farm profitability in the long run this approach will allow us to assess economic efficiency gains net social gains measured as the overall wtp minus overall wta linked to the implementation of the priority allocation rule if this instrument were found to improve water use efficiency it would enable the design of win win arrangements for all water rights holders helping to overcome any political or social objection to this institutional change the approach followed for this economic assessment contributes to the existing literature by modeling irrigators heterogeneity through a farm typology based on primary data collection and incorporating an updated distribution of the annual water allotments obtained from a stochastic hydrological simulation these two features make the results obtained reliable enough to support policy decision making aimed at improving irrigation water management at the irrigation district id level 2 agricultural water allocation in spain institutional framework 2 1 water allocation at the basin level the spanish water act states that all water resources are in the public domain the use of water for economic activities is permitted through administrative concessions or water rights that allow rights holders to extract water from a specific water body river aquifer or reservoir up to a maximum annual volume full water allotment with both of these elements established in the concession record these rights are granted to private agents by the corresponding river basin authority rba however they do not guarantee the availability of the maximum water volume approved every year the volume of water actually available for each rights holder annual water allotment is set every year depending on the hydrological situation i e water stored in the reservoirs and in accordance with the river basin management plan rbmp the spanish mainland territory i e excluding islands is divided into 15 river basins covering an area of 493 800 km2 and home to 46 million people the total water rights granted amount to 30 797 mm3 year full water allotment of which 5584 mm3 goes to urban uses 24 266 mm3 to agriculture and 948 mm3 to other uses industry energy etc dga and ceh 2018 most of the spanish river basins have a mediterranean climate with an average annual precipitation of 667 mm over 80 of which falls during the autumn and winter this rainfall generates average water flows water availability of 99 684 mm3 year however it is worth pointing out that most of the demand is concentrated during spring and summer for irrigation purposes to match supply and demand in a timely manner rbas operate well developed reservoir networks with a total storage capacity of 55 622 mm3 which in normal hydrological years i e those when enough water is stored in reservoirs allows all demands both from water rights holders and 2984 mm3 year to maintain the minimum ecological flows to be fully met dga and ceh 2018 this is not the case in drought years when water rationing is needed to balance water availability and demands in the case of cyclical scarcity the rbas limit water allocations according to the rbmps applying a combination of two rationing rules on the one hand a priority rule is applied whereby rights holders are ranked by priority based on the use of water urban uses are at the top of the list having absolute priority over agricultural use ranked as the second priority level and all other economic activities lowest priority level the second rationing rule applies when the available water is not enough to meet all rights within the same priority level in this case a proportional distribution is applied to all these rights holders in any case since urban uses account only for 18 1 of the spanish water rights this demand is practically guaranteed and is met even during the most extreme drought events in fact during prolonged droughts in spain water rationing using the proportional rule is only applied to agricultural water rights holders 78 8 of the water rights similarly to other countries such as australia or the united states spain has used spot water markets since 1999 as a way to partially solve the problem of inefficient water allocation in the agricultural sector during cyclical scarcity periods due to proportional rationing however the performance of water markets in spain has been rather disappointing since high transaction costs and multiple trade barriers limit trading activity palomo hierro et al 2015 moreover it is expected that water trade instruments will be banned by the new left wing spanish government on the grounds that access to water is a human right and thus should not be considered a commercial asset as established in the coalition government agreement signed by the two political parties supporting it given that we can reasonably anticipate an institutional context without water markets the implementation of the priority rule is worth analyzing as an alternative allocation criterion for irrigation water seeking to prevent the efficiency losses caused by the proportional rule during drought events gómez limón et al 2020 however allocation regimes at the national level are difficult and costly to adjust since they are path dependent institutional arrangements and long lived water infrastructure nevertheless as explained below this is not the case at the id level where it is easier to change the institutional arrangements and the infrastructure this justifies the scope of this paper which is focused on changing allocation rules at the id level 2 2 water allocation at the irrigation district level a proposal for reform most irrigation water rights are collectively granted to all farmers operating within the same id organized into water users associations wuas these wuas are non profit organizations that locally manage the water allotments annually set by the rba distributing the water available each year among their irrigators following their own allocation rules water management services provided by wuas are financed by the recipient irrigators through annual payments set to ensure cost recovery in almost all cases wuas have chosen the proportional rule as the internal allocation criterion to cope with water shortages this paper proposes a shift away from proportional allocation towards a priority rule allowing the implementation of security differentiated water rights at the id level it is worth clarifying that this change would only be implemented locally simply by modifying water allocations among local farmers while water allocations at the id level would remain unchanged i e it is assumed that the rba would continue to implement the proportional rule when allocating water among ids to effect this change in local allocation rules following the australian example two priority classes are proposed distinguishing between high security or priority rights and low security or general water rights irrigators would be able to combine these two priority rights creating a portfolio of water rights to achieve any desired level of reliability while minimizing the transaction costs involved in dynamically adapting to the optimal mix young and mccoll 2003 under spanish law water rights can only be granted by the rba these water rights are granted for free to private agents based on general interest criteria and these rights allow private agents to use water only for the specific purposes established by the rba in the water entitlement e g irrigation in a specific plot of land this linkage between water rights and certain uses i e water rights are bundled with land is one of the principles of spanish water law there are two main reasons for this approach first to allow public authorities rbas to allocate water resources following general interest objectives that go beyond economic efficiency e g territorial equity or environmental conservation and second to enable the public management of the already complex hydrological systems mainly water storage and delivery without drastic changes in the water uses place and time for delivery this explains why spanish water law prohibits the exchange of water rights permanent or entitlements water markets the proposed change in the allocation regime to introduce security differentiated water rights at the id level does not affect the abovementioned principle in any way taking the current situation as a starting point we propose that at the beginning of the new allocation regime water rights collectively granted to farmers within the same id be shared out among all local irrigators on an area basis i e 1 irrigated hectare 1 water right with all these rights initially considered as general rights this change does not in itself entail any change in water allocations compared to the current implementation of the proportional rule the real change is allowing a certain share of general water rights to be upgraded into priority rights to carry out this upgrade process an auction procedure is proposed in these auctions the bids offered by rights holders interested in upgrading would be measured as a surcharge on the annual payment to their wua once this upgrade has been completed the allocation regime will actually be changed to implement the priority rule it is worth pointing out that in following the procedure described above the principle of bundling water rights with the land is observed in fact when implementing the security differentiated water rights as suggested the irrigated area would remain unchanged i e the total number of former water rights is equal to the sum of the new general and priority rights and there is no exchange of rights which is prohibited by spanish law moreover the water annually allocated to each id would be exactly the same as before i e available water at the basin level for irrigation is shared among ids according to the current proportional rule set by law thus public management of water resources at the basin level water storage and delivery could be carried out as it is currently done this proposal is therefore different to the australian case where the conversion of rights has been set at defined rates specifically existing general rights can be upgraded to priority security via a conversion factor e g 3 general rights 1 priority security and a transformation price drastically altering the management of the hydrological systems the change proposed would involve gains for those rights holders upgrading a share of their rights more reliable water supply however this change also involves a loss for those rights holders that do not upgrade their rights since their water supply based only on general water rights becomes less reliable this loss is the reason why they should be compensated for this change in the allocation regime for this purpose the total amount of money collected through these surcharges would be used to reduce the annual payments of all general rights holders to the wua increased income from surcharges on priority rights would allow the payments for general rights to be reduced while the services provided by the wua remain self financed under the proposal simulated here those who win the bid in the auction can hold priority rights forever enabling long term investment planning e g fruit orchards or irrigation technology in any case our proposal also assumes that there would be a local water rights market allowing the dynamic allocation of these priority rights this proposal for implementing a priority rule would have to be accepted by a majority of irrigators i e approved as an allocation rule within the wua if this change is to create a win win solution where both reliability winners those upgrading their rights into priority ones and reliability losers those keeping their general rights increase their profitability in other words for the proposed change to be successful the increase in farm profitability achieved by reliability winners must be higher than the surcharges they would have to pay and the reduction in the annual payments to the wua charged to reliability losers must outweigh their farm profitability losses this condition would be met only if the change in allocation rule leads to an increase in economic efficiency that is if the aggregate profitability at the id level increases the main objective of this paper is to empirically test whether the proposed change in the allocation rules can enhance economic efficiency in the case study considered for this purpose a simulation exercise is performed with the programming model also providing information about the optimum percentage of rights to be upgraded into priority rights i e the share that maximizes economic efficiency at the id level 3 case study 3 1 the sector bxii irrigation district the sector bxii sbxii is an id covering 14 643 ha close to the mouth of the guadalquivir river this district is operated by 569 farmers average farm size of 25 7 ha organized into a wua holding a collective water right of 6000 cubic meters per hectare and year full water allotment the wua is in charge of water allocation among all irrigators currently doing so according to the proportional rule the costs of the water management services provided are financed through a binomial tariff with each irrigator annually paying 294 euros per hectare to recover fixed operational and management costs plus a volumetric charge of 0 003 euros per cubic meter of water applied to recover energy pumping costs although this area was converted to irrigation during the 1980s the irrigation infrastructure and techniques have since been updated sprinkler irrigation predominates 72 although drip 22 and surface irrigation 6 are also used depending on the crop this modern technology and the good agronomic conditions of the district make it a valuable example of highly profitable irrigation production where water use efficiency is relatively high however the main problem faced by irrigators in the sbxii is their sensitivity to water supply gaps i e water shortages during drought periods when the availability of irrigation water is not enough to meet full water allocations they experience fairly large losses much higher than those registered by other less modernized and less efficient irrigators elsewhere in the basin the main crops in the area are cotton 44 5 corn 12 9 tomato 11 5 sugar beet 9 4 wheat 8 7 sunflower 6 7 and other vegetables such as carrots and onions 6 3 however it is worth mentioning that there are several productive profiles at the farm level in order to characterize them a random sample of 59 farms located in the sbxii was selected gathering data regarding their main productive features size crop mixes productive technologies and income and costs by crops and the socio demographic characteristics of their farmers age educational level etc a typology of the farms sampled was identified through cluster analysis using the percentage of the area devoted to each crop as differentiating variables for further details see montilla lópez et al 2018 the characteristics of each identified farm type are summarized as follows farm type 1 ft1 large professional farmers this type represents 39 of farms in the sample and accounts for 52 of the total irrigable area this is the largest farm type in the sbxii 35 8 ha mainly oriented towards horticultural crops tomato 30 3 carrot 5 3 and onion 1 6 which are the most profitable crops other important crops are cotton 29 6 and sugar beet 24 0 farm type 2 ft2 risk diversifiers this farm type represents 41 of the farmers in the sample and accounts for 36 of the area of the sbxii it is a medium sized farm 23 9 ha characterized by having a highly diversified crop plan and dedicating areas to most of the existing crop options in the study area farm type 3 ft3 extensive conservative farmers this type of farm represents the smallest proportion of farmers in the sample 20 covering just 11 of the total area of the sbxii it is therefore the smallest farm type with an average of 15 0 ha its agricultural area is cultivated with the most extensive crops such as cotton 57 0 and sugar beet 39 1 which are both highly dependent on coupled subsidies as shown in table 1 these farm types are heterogeneous in terms of the profitability and productivity of water this means that they differ notably in the losses caused by proportional rationing implemented during drought events with much greater losses occurring in the case of the most intensive farming ft1 specialized in vegetables with higher productivity of water and more moderate losses for extensive farming ft2 and ft3 focused on industrial crops and cereals with lower productivity of water this heterogeneity justifies the choice of this case study to explore the implementation of priority water rights as an instrument to improve water management during scarcity periods 3 2 annual water allotments in the sbxii irrigation district the sbxii is located in a mediterranean region where irrigated agriculture is particularly vulnerable to the risk of hydrological drought meaning annual water allotments are frequently lower than those fixed in the water rights full water allotments thus annual water allotment must be considered as a stochastic variable that needs to be characterized before modeling the potential impact of any change in the allocation rules the distribution of the annual water allotments to the sbxii wa id could be fitted to different probability distribution functions according to historical records e g rey et al 2016 however this approach is not suitable when the water system analyzed has substantially changed over recent years as is the case in the guadalquivir river basin where the sbxii is located given recent changes in water demands new water rights granted reservoir infrastructure increased storage capacity and water management rules larger minimum ecological flows expósito and berbel 2019 distributions fitted according to past records are not appropriate for assessing feasible hydrological situations and current water supply reliability therefore an approach based on a stochastic hydrological simulation model considering the new demand and supply constraints and the institutional framework fixed in the guadalquivir rbmp chg 2015 is needed to estimate the probability distributions of annual water allotments this approach has been implemented by gómez limón 2020 for the hydrological system where the case study area is located sistema de regulación general yielding the empirical histogram shown in fig 1 the shape of this histogram does not fit to any commonly used distribution function for this reason we directly rely on the simulated observations obtained by gómez limón 2020 as irrigation water allotment scenarios to feed the mathematical programming model built see next section 4 modeling approach a positive mathematical programming model is built to simulate farmers behavior under the new water rights regime proposed in order to compare its potential performance with the current proportional allocation rule in terms of economic efficiency in the simulation of both allocation regimes water trading is not allowed i e anticipating an institutional context in spain without water markets meaning the analysis is focused on allocation rules as instruments for enhancing water efficiency 4 1 proportional and priority allocation rules the id subscript id taken as a case study comprises the three farm types subscript f which are considered as the decision making units each farm type represents n f farms with an average size of s f irrigated hectares with their weights being w f n f s f s id and where s id is the area of the id s id f n f s f under current internal management rules annual water allotments granted to the id wa id measured in cubic meters are shared proportionally among all farm types i e water allocations in cubic meters per hectare wa f are the same for all farm types within the id such that wa f wa id wa id s id for every f consequently the water allocation for farm type f measured in cubic meters is wa f wa f s f under the proposed new distribution rules the id would hold water rights defined as a portfolio of two different water rights priority and general rights which would be distributed among farms in any proportion therefore each farm type would hold a different portfolio of water rights the share of priority rights per farm type is denoted as pr f while the share of general rights is denoted as gr f with the two shares adding up to one pr f gr f 1 initially the optimal share of priority rights at the id level pr id f pr f w f is unknown so it will be parametrized to determine the pr id that yields the best outcome under this new water rights regime the annual water allotments to be allocated to each farm type are defined as the sum of the allotments granted for priority rights wapr and for general rights wagr 1 wa f wapr pr f wagr gr f these two terms are both determined annually depending on the water allocated to the id following the abovementioned priority procedure thus priority rights are served first with the full water allotment granted to the id fwa id as long as the water availability wa id is enough to cover all water demands from priority rights holders after that the remaining water is allocated proportionally among general rights holders see eq 2 in the event that there is not enough water to meet full allocations for priority rights the available water is to be rationed among priority rights holders following the proportional rule in this case general rights holders would not receive any water allocation see eq 3 mathematically this priority allocation rule can be expressed as follows 2 wa id pr id fwa id w a p r f w a i d w a g r w a i d p r i d f w a i d 1 p r i d 3 wa id pr id fwa id w a p r w a i d p r i d w a g r 0 we assume that farmers try to maximize farming profits as a function of their water allotments π f f wa f as explained above irrigators annual water allotments are variable depending on the water availability at the id level thus since water allotments are stochastic variables both wa id and wa f farming profits are also stochastic variables π f to simulate the risk from water supply variability at the id and farm levels n 5000 probabilistic values for wa id drawn from the hydrological simulation model built by gómez limón 2020 have been considered thus defining 5000 equally probable scenarios n 1 5000 4 2 farmers decision making for a given water allotment scenario for operative purposes we take the expected total gross margin i e total income minus variable costs gm f as a proxy for farming profits in the short run defined as a mathematical function of farmers decision variables that is the area covered by the different crops in our case study these variables are denoted by x c f where c denotes the crop and f indicates the farm type in addition farmers can make decisions regarding the share of their water right to be upgraded into priority rights pr f with the remaining water rights being considered as general water rights gr f thus farmers decision making is simulated by maximizing the expected total gross margin considering both kinds of decision variables gm f f x c f pr f following mainstream mathematical programming techniques used for ex ante policy analysis our modeling approach is based on positive mathematical programming pmp heckelei et al 2012 we implemented the standard approach formally introduced by howitt 1995 for two reasons first it is a simple method to apply in that it does not require exogenous information facilitating its application to other case studies elsewhere second this method allows us to overcome one of the problems of the pmp namely the impossibility of calibrating activities not observed in the reference year which is a necessity in our case in order to add rainfed crops as alternatives in the event of irrigation water supply gaps using howitt s standard method prevents us from calibrating the activities not observed in the reference year with these crops being added using their average cost instead of the usual pmp quadratic cost functions this approach is suitable because rainfed crops are much less profitable than irrigated crops so these alternatives only appear in cases when the annual water allotments are much lower than full water allotments and farmers are compelled to reduce the farming area actually irrigated this standard pmp procedure calibrates a non linear objective function for profit based on the observed behavior of farmers i e observed crop mix under a full water allotment scenario to exactly reproduce activity levels among the alternative options for eliciting the calibrating parameters we use the average cost approach heckelei and britz 2000 assuming a quadratic variable cost function for every crop c cv c α c x c ½ β c x c 2 where α c and β c are parameters to be elicited in order to reproduce the exact activity levels for each farm type in the reference year mérel and howitt 2014 thus for farm f the variable costs are 4 cv f x c f c α c f x c f ½ β c f x c f 2 although there are multiple sets of cost function parameters α c f and β c f that can exactly reproduce observed behavior under the average cost approach the quadratic cost function equals the accounting cost of the crop resulting in the following calibrating parameter definitions 5 α c f avc c f μ c f 6 β c f 2 μ c f x c f obs where avc c f is the average or observed accounting variable cost of crop c in farm type f x c f obs is the observed area of crop c in a year with full water allotment wa id fwa id in farm type f and μ c f are the dual values of the calibration constraints reproducing a normal hydrological scenario i e where no water rationing is needed a review of the standard pmp and the average cost approach can be found in heckelei and britz 2005 the pmp calibrated model can then be used for simulating farmers decision making in other scenarios e g water shortage situations and under different water allocation rules by modifying the objective function changing the values of the non calibrating parameters adding new constraints e g water availability or adding new decision variables e g new crop alternatives accordingly one of the most valuable advantages of the pmp is that it provides more flexible and realistic simulation responses than normative mathematical programming models henry de frahan et al 2007 it is assumed that when faced with water shortages i e wa id fwa id farmers react by changing their crop mixes replacing crops that have higher water requirements with others that have lower water needs or even rainfed crops i e null irrigation water requirement thus in addition to the observed irrigated crops two rainfed alternatives wheat and sunflower have also been considered as decision variables for simulating decision making under drought scenarios other potential management strategies to cope with cyclical scarcity e g improving irrigation efficiency at farm level or implementing deficit irrigation have been ruled out since they are not suitable for ids with modern irrigation technologies i e they have already achieved efficient water use specialized in herbaceous crops i e deficit irrigation doses do not lead to more profitability considering the priority allocation rule proposed farm types decision making can be integrated into a single model at the id level where optimum values for variables x c f and pr

fixed by the parameter pr id eq 7 10 denotes the rest of the constraints defining the feasible solution set which constitute agronomic rotational and frequency requirements policy cotton and sugar

types decision making can also be integrated with a simplified version of model 7 skipping eqs 7 6 7 9 and replacing eq 7 5 by wa f wa id for every farm type f 4 3 farmers decision making considering the full distribution of water allotments it should be recalled that the annual water allotment granted to the id is a stochastic variable wa id ranging from fwa id to 0 within this stochastic framework it is assumed that farmers make decisions regarding the upgrade of water rights in an attempt to maximize their expected or average total gross margin thus considering n 5000 probabilistic values for wa id model 7 becomes 8 1 max x c f n pr f z 1 n f n gm f n s f w f 8 2 s t gm f n c p c y c s c α c f ½ β c f x c f n x c f n f n 8 3 c x c f n s f f n 8 4 c wr c x c f n wa f n s f f n 8

n also affecting in each scenario n crop mixes x c f n and thus gm f n the objective function in this model 8 1 allows the joint maximization of the average gross margin for all farm types as a result of the optimum decision making regarding the upgrade into priority rights it is also worth recalling that pr id is parametrized so we can find the optimal share of priority rights within the id that maximizes the total efficiency to evaluate the possible improvements under this new water allocation regime in terms of economic efficiency it is necessary to establish a baseline scenario to do this the stochastic model is also solved considering current proportional allocation rules i e without the possibility of acquiring priority rights thus model 8 is also solved by ignoring eqs 8 6 8 9 and substituting eq 8 5 with wa f n wa id n for every farm type f in doing so we are able to obtain any variations in gross margins and water use at the farm and id level as well as other indicators for the analysis allowing an assessment of the proposed allocation rule 5 results the results of the simulation model yield evidence that priority rights could enhance overall economic efficiency in fact compared to the baseline values of the current proportional water rights regime the average gross margin at the id level is increased for every possible value of the parameter pr id share of priority rights over total water rights however these improvements in economic efficiency are almost negligible registering a disappointing maximum of 0 2 of the current gross margins for the optimum value for pr id 20 5 as can be observed in fig 2 the increase in the average gross margin at the id level black line is the overall result of heterogeneous impacts on the different farm types considered gray lines ft1 shows a significant wtp for upgrading general water rights into priority ones since this upgrade allows the highest increase in average profitability reaching a maximum wtp of 2 1 of its current gross margin i e with proportional water rights conversely ft2 and ft3 register the lowest wta for reducing their water supply reliability as a consequence of keeping general water rights requiring compensation i e reduction on the annual payment to the wau ranging from 0 to 5 1 of their current gross margins depending on the total share of priority rights granted in any case it should be highlighted that theoretically the wta of ft2 and ft3 could be fully met by the wtp of ft1 through the proposed compensation instrument while still leaving a gross margin surplus i e economic efficiency increase nevertheless it is also worth mentioning that the modeling approach followed has been simplified by assuming null transaction costs both static and institutional transaction costs garrick et al 2013 marshall 2013 thus since the wtp wta gap is very small in this case study a surplus of only 0 2 of current gross margins it is reasonable to assume that in a real world setting there would actually be no room for any efficiency increase table 2 shows the simulation results for the maximum efficiency solution based on a 20 5 share of priority water rights granted at the id level taking this solution as the best possible outcome it can be observed that ft1 upgrades 30 7 of its water rights into priority ones however it is worth noting that ft2 and ft3 also upgrade a share of their water rights although in lower proportions 11 3 and 3 1 respectively this optimum allocation of priority water rights allows ft1 to increase its average annual water allocation compared to the current situation i e implementation of proportional water rights while its water allocation became more stable over time an increase of 3 2 in the average allocation and a decrease of 11 3 in its standard deviation accordingly this improved water supply reliability leads to an increase in the average gross margin 2 0 and a decrease in its volatility 18 0 decrease in its standard deviation prompting this farm type to make the highest bid for a rights upgrade i e annual surcharges to be paid through the auction procedure suggested on the other hand the irrigation water supply gets worse for ft2 and ft3 both in terms of the average decreases of 2 9 and 5 5 respectively and the volatility increases of 10 3 and 19 5 respectively in their standard deviations this deteriorated supply reliability leads to worse profitability indicators reduced average gross margins 2 1 and 5 0 respectively and increased profit volatility 22 1 increase in the standard deviation of the gross margin for both farm types nevertheless these farming losses could theoretically be fully compensated by the surcharges paid by ft1 in this regard it is worth noting that the overall volume of water allocated at the id level is the same as in the proportional water rights baseline this constraint was implicitly assumed in the proposal in order to ensure that the proposed change in the water allocation regime has no direct impact on the environment e g water abstractions however the implementation of security differentiated water rights could involve some spillover effects both positive and negative on the environment first it could be logically assumed that the priority system may lessen the incentive to steal water for those more efficient farmers who are more sensitive to water supply gaps loch et al 2020b second the reform proposed in the water allocation regime could produce a negative side effect on the environment by decreasing the return flows indeed the farmers who are most willing to acquire priority rights are usually those who are more efficient in water use because they use more modern irrigation techniques thus it could be expected that the more priority rights these farmers acquire the lower the return flows to watercourses negatively affecting environmental flows at any rate in the case study considered the effects on returns would not have a significant impact on the environment because this id is located close to the mouth of the guadalquivir river and almost all the returns from the id go directly to the sea nevertheless because of how difficult they are to assess none of these potential side effects has been considered in the modeling exercise implemented lastly the results obtained for specific water allotment scenarios wa id under the optimum priority rights sharing as shown in table 3 are also noteworthy it can be easily seen that compared to the proportional rights regime the implementation of priority rights increases water allotments and annual gross margins in the case of ft1 the reliability winner while ft2 and ft3 reliability losers show a decrease in these two variables however the most notable result is that the overall variation in gross margins at the id level is not always positive for moderate to severe drought scenarios with an annual id level water allocation of between 3723 and 2032 m3 ha the outcome of the implementation of the proposed priority regime is worse than that of the current proportional water rights thus the implementation of priority rights not only provides a tiny increase in average economic efficiency but also involves annual economic inefficiency for a range of drought scenarios with a probability of occurrence of 14 9 however it is also true that priority rights could yield an efficiency increase in the event of an extreme drought annual water allotment below 1300 m3 ha 6 discussion and concluding remarks in light of the results obtained we reject the initial hypothesis that replacing allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with a priority rule establishing security differentiated water rights can help improve water use efficiency in the agricultural sector at the local i e irrigation district level in fact although the simulated performance shows that this reform in irrigation water rights could generate a slight efficiency improvement the economic gains would not be enough to cover the transaction costs associated with the implementation of the proposed allocation regime an upgrade of water rights through auctions and a compensation procedure to indemnify reliability losers these disappointing results are explained by the fact that priority rights do not reflect the marginal value of water across users in a timely manner oecd 2016 if the main political objective is to improve economic efficiency the most suitable instrument would be the spot water market allocation trading as it is the most useful mechanism for equalizing the marginal benefit of water across users chong and sunding 2006 water scarcity is a dynamic phenomenon that must be managed through the implementation of sufficiently flexible instruments capable of modifying allocations in the short term just as the spot water markets do this is not the case of allocation regimes based on priority rights which is a rigid instrument that cannot be modulated depending on the level of water scarcity in fact as shown by the australian experience priority rights should not be considered as an alternative instrument to spot water markets but rather a complementary instrument to water trading that can help improve water use efficiency as far as the authors know the assessment performed in this paper is innovative however a few previous related studies analyzing other water rationing rules are worth citing in this sense martínez and esteban 2014 alarcón et al 2014 and goetz et al 2017 have focused on other allocation rules uniform sequential equal economic loss or minimization of the total accumulated loss rules proposed by economic theory also using mathematical programming simulation techniques these authors report that while these alternative allocation rules could provide significant efficiency improvements at the id level compared to the proportional rule currently implemented all of them are outperformed by spot water markets although all this evidence is useful for policy analysis it is also true that the implementation of these alternative allocation rules could be complex in a real world setting e g economic analyses of the heterogeneity of farmers losses due to water shortages would first be needed involving significant transaction costs this is one of the reasons why they have not yet been implemented anywhere another related contribution worth noting is the study by adamson et al 2006 these authors also assess a water allocation regime with two security differentiated water rights high and low priority which is compared with the proportional allocation rule for this purpose they use a state contingent model of production under uncertainty with three states of nature normal drought and wet which is applied to the murray darling basin including all water rights holders both urban and agricultural they conclude that a water allocation solution with two levels of priority rights outperforms that obtained using the proportional rule there may be several reasons behind the unexpected and contradictory results reported in this paper first the differences found could be largely explained by the different scopes of the changes proposed in water allocation rules while in this paper the assessment performed considers a change in allocation rules at the id level only water allocation among farmers within the same id other studies have considered a shift in allocation rules for all water rights holders in a river basin thus also affecting water allocation among ids in this respect it would seem logical to assume that by including more heterogeneity among water rights holders priority rights could yield higher water use efficiency improvements in any case further research would be necessary to confirm that greater heterogeneity would lead to priority allocation solutions clearly outperforming those obtained with the proportional rule as evidenced in the case of the murray darling basin adamson et al 2006 second the sbxii id is a particular case study that is notable for its specialization in annual crops no perennial crop is grown in this district this characteristic probably also limits the efficiency gains reported here since farms with perennial crops are among those that stand to benefit the most from priority rights most permanent crops cannot be grown under rainfed conditions in case of irrigation water supply gaps requiring priority rights to ensure a sufficiently reliable supply in this regard it is also worth acknowledging the limitation of the modeling approach proposed to properly account for investment in fixed assets e g perennial crops or production technologies thus the results reported do account for potential further specialization in higher profitability farming systems also helping to improve water use efficiency in the long term as has been evidenced in the united states or australia xu et al 2014 third it worth noting that the results reported also reflect the current probability distribution of annual water allotments see fig 1 although annual water allotments are fairly often lower than the full water allotment the well developed network of reservoirs in the guadalquivir basin i e interannual storage capacity means that there is currently a fairly low risk of severe irrigation water supply gaps e g annual water allotments lower than 30 of full water allotment as a result the efficiency gains from priority rights are lower than those expected in basins with a higher probability of extreme hydrological droughts however this could be the situation in the guadalquivir basin in the near future as climate change projections point to an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts events fourth the results obtained could also be influenced by the case specific agricultural policy framework i e coupled subsidies and production quotas which may not exist in other regions which complicates comparisons with other irrigated agricultural systems in fact it is worth pointing out that the application of the proposed simulation approach to other irrigated areas would require some fine tuning to reflect local policy conditions in any case allocation regimes based on priority rights are interesting for two reasons first as pointed out by freebairn and quiggin 2006 and lefebvre et al 2012 these allocation regimes could be successfully combined with spot water markets as in the australian experience where the joint implementation of these two instruments has led to significant improvements in drought management in the irrigation sector second priority rights are an interesting risk management instrument for farmers as shown in the simulation results the farmers who are most vulnerable to risk ft1 in our case study can use priority rights as a hedging mechanism reducing gross margin volatility in the context of climate change where farmers are eager to stabilize their income these priority rights constitute an important adaptation instrument finally further research is called for to refine the proposed modeling approach and thereby obtain more accurate results in this sense more detailed modeling of decision making regarding the upgrade of water rights could be achieved by accounting for possible changes in production technologies investments in irrigation systems or perennial crops the existence of transaction costs and heterogeneity in farmers risk preferences moreover assessing the impact of priority rights at the basin level incorporating more farm type heterogeneity could provide relevant new insights into this topic these new avenues for research pose challenges since uncertainty about the future state of water systems creates difficulties in simulating farmers strategic decision making i e decisions involving investments in fixed capital and assessing the multiple impacts of investments made chasing higher economic returns e g loch et al 2020a suggest potentially irreversible losses of capital tied to water inputs and changing incentives to steal water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we gratefully

9902,this paper examines the effectiveness of reforming water rights regimes in the agricultural sector by replacing allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with the implementation of a priority rule that establishes security differentiated water rights the main objective is to assess whether this change improves the economic efficiency of water allocation at the irrigation district level particularly during cyclical scarcity events to this end a positive mathematical programming model is built to simulate the performance of the proposed reform in an irrigation district in southern spain the results show that the efficiency gains brought about by this change are very small which casts doubt on its ability to improve water use efficiency in the agricultural sector at the local level i e irrigation district under current local climate and water availability conditions in any case further research is needed to assess the suitability of this change in allocations rules at basin scale with greater farm heterogeneity especially given the likelihood of more frequent more intense droughts due to climate change keywords water allocation regime security differentiated water rights drought management positive mathematical programming spain 1 introduction and objectives water resources provide important ecosystem and socio cultural services e g biodiversity pollution sinks or recreational facilities and share many characteristics with public goods in addition water resources are a commodity used as an input in many economic activities e g agriculture industry or energy production furthermore access to supply facilities drinking water and sanitation is a basic human right that contributes to the maintenance of public health all this makes water a complex economic good hanemann 2006 for this reason water generally enjoys a special legal status managed according to the public trust doctrine which aims to ensure efficiency equity and environmental sustainability rogers et al 2002 according to this doctrine water management is usually based on centralized allocation regimes involving water rights also called entitlements licenses concessions or permits granted by a public authority that determines how much water can be diverted from water bodies and who is allowed to use these resources rights holders only the current allocation regimes are determined by historical water availability and traditional usage patterns which generally do not correspond to current social preferences in fact most of them are not designed to adapt to changing conditions affecting both the demand e g growing demand for water for economic activities and the environment and the supply e g climate change of water resources these outdated designs lead to inefficiencies in the allocation of water such as the use of this resource as an input for crops with low water productivity or the over abstraction of water bodies which jeopardizes water supply reliability and the provision of ecosystem services oecd 2015 in order to solve these inefficiencies in water allocation many countries have developed water trading instruments water markets and water banks to make allocation regimes more flexible and allow them to be adapted to new circumstances bjornlund 2003a debaere et al 2014 howitt 2015 along the same lines there have been calls for a reform of these allocation regimes aimed at achieving a more efficient and sustainable allocation of increasingly scarce water resources e g bruns et al 2005 hodgson 2006 it is worth pointing out that the availability of water varies over time and space which makes the temporal and spatial matching of supply and demand a major challenge for water managers hanemann 2006 this variability means water scarcity is dynamic ranging from wet periods when all volumes granted by water rights can be fully provided to dry periods droughts when scarce water resources have to be rationed although storage e g reservoirs and conveyance e g channels and pipelines infrastructure is used to minimize this mismatch significant fluctuations in resource availability inherent in any water system as a consequence of the natural water cycle seasonal and interannual variability of rainfall and water flows mean that water supply cannot be fully guaranteed especially in more arid regions moreover the frequency and intensity of these episodes of cyclical scarcity droughts are exacerbated in many regions by climate change resulting in water supply becoming less and less reliable bisselink et al 2018 when a drought episode occurs allocation regimes also determine how the available scarce resources are to be shared among the water rights holders by determining the proportion of the volumes granted by these rights that each holder can actually use this paper focuses on the allocation regimes implemented within the agricultural sector the world s largest water user and more specifically on the rationing systems to be applied to irrigation water rights holders during cyclical scarcity events droughts in this sense there are two main alternative approaches to rationing irrigation water allocations those based on the proportional rule and those based on priority rules oecd 2016 the proportional rule is the most widely used rationing method for irrigation water allocation during hydrological droughts according to this rule all water rights holders receive a quantity of water proportional to their water rights so that total demand equals total supply for the implementation of the priority rule the irrigation rights holders are divided into priority classes with their water rights being allocated lexicographically according to the established priority levels this means that the demands of the rights holders with the highest priority are met first and only when they are fully met is the remaining resource allocated to the following rights holders according to a criterion of decreasing priority order gómez limón et al 2020 both allocation rules have their pros and cons the proportional rule is easy to understand by rights holders and easy to implement in a real world setting moreover it is generally judged to be a fair procedure for rationing water since it promotes equal shares allocated to equal demands it fulfills the equal treatment of equals axiom characterizing symmetric rationing methods while these advantages explain the popularity of this allocation procedure it fails to achieve an economically efficient distribution of the available water this is because irrigators are heterogeneous in terms of production potential pedoclimatic conditions production technology or farm size economies of scale and the psychological characteristics e g risk aversion shaping their production decision making i e crop mixes with both of these features also determining heterogeneous agricultural and water productivity thus proportional water rationing has quite different impacts on individual irrigators e g intensive vs extensive farmers failing to minimize the aggregate losses stemming from water scarcity there is a wide range of empirical evidence on this source of inefficiency in the irrigation sector alarcón et al 2014 martínez and esteban 2014 goetz et al 2017 water rights regimes with different levels of priority are an interesting alternative for the allocation of water within the agricultural sector during cyclical scarcity periods since they enable more efficient water use and risk sharing freebairn and quiggin 2006 lefebvre et al 2012 the key idea behind this allocation procedure is that the irrigators who are more vulnerable to water supply gaps e g farmers with perennial or horticultural crops are able to reduce the risk related to water reliability by obtaining high priority rights transferring this risk to lower priority rights holders who are better positioned to assume this risk e g farmers with extensive annual crops also known as security differentiated water rights it is considered an adaptation measure to climate change xu et al 2014 mallawaarachchi et al 2020 furthermore this allocation rule enables higher priority rights holders to further specialize in higher value added farming systems thereby improving economic efficiency in the long term xu et al 2014 nevertheless this rule is seldom implemented because the configuration of efficient portfolios of water rights involves significant transaction costs bjornlund 2003b and the fact that it is an asymmetric rationing method rights holders are treated differently makes it politically and socially controversial in any case the literature provides consistent evidence that irrigators are willing to pay to increase water supply reliability e g rigby et al 2010 mesa jurado et al 2012 alcón et al 2014 guerrero baena et al 2019 justifying their interest in obtaining higher priority rights however these irrigators capacity to cover the transactions costs and the compensation claimed by those keeping lower priority rights i e reliability losers is still an open question needing empirical research despite the abovementioned cons priority allocation rules are in effect in the western united states following the prior appropriation doctrine i e priority determined by seniority and in the australian states of new south wales queensland southern australia and victoria based on two priority classes e g high security and general security access entitlements in new south wales or high reliability and low reliability entitlements in victoria taylor 2019 both cases provide an interesting international experience to learn from in order to improve agricultural water management gómez limón et al 2020 within this framework the objective of this paper is to assess the improvement in economic efficiency generated when an allocation regime based on the proportional rule is replaced with a regime based on a priority allocation rule to that end we focused on a spanish irrigation district as a case study using positive mathematical programming to simulate farmers willingness to pay wtp for higher priority water rights and willingness to accept wta for lower priority rights considering that their decisions regarding their individual portfolios of water rights determine their water supply reliability and farm profitability in the long run this approach will allow us to assess economic efficiency gains net social gains measured as the overall wtp minus overall wta linked to the implementation of the priority allocation rule if this instrument were found to improve water use efficiency it would enable the design of win win arrangements for all water rights holders helping to overcome any political or social objection to this institutional change the approach followed for this economic assessment contributes to the existing literature by modeling irrigators heterogeneity through a farm typology based on primary data collection and incorporating an updated distribution of the annual water allotments obtained from a stochastic hydrological simulation these two features make the results obtained reliable enough to support policy decision making aimed at improving irrigation water management at the irrigation district id level 2 agricultural water allocation in spain institutional framework 2 1 water allocation at the basin level the spanish water act states that all water resources are in the public domain the use of water for economic activities is permitted through administrative concessions or water rights that allow rights holders to extract water from a specific water body river aquifer or reservoir up to a maximum annual volume full water allotment with both of these elements established in the concession record these rights are granted to private agents by the corresponding river basin authority rba however they do not guarantee the availability of the maximum water volume approved every year the volume of water actually available for each rights holder annual water allotment is set every year depending on the hydrological situation i e water stored in the reservoirs and in accordance with the river basin management plan rbmp the spanish mainland territory i e excluding islands is divided into 15 river basins covering an area of 493 800 km2 and home to 46 million people the total water rights granted amount to 30 797 mm3 year full water allotment of which 5584 mm3 goes to urban uses 24 266 mm3 to agriculture and 948 mm3 to other uses industry energy etc dga and ceh 2018 most of the spanish river basins have a mediterranean climate with an average annual precipitation of 667 mm over 80 of which falls during the autumn and winter this rainfall generates average water flows water availability of 99 684 mm3 year however it is worth pointing out that most of the demand is concentrated during spring and summer for irrigation purposes to match supply and demand in a timely manner rbas operate well developed reservoir networks with a total storage capacity of 55 622 mm3 which in normal hydrological years i e those when enough water is stored in reservoirs allows all demands both from water rights holders and 2984 mm3 year to maintain the minimum ecological flows to be fully met dga and ceh 2018 this is not the case in drought years when water rationing is needed to balance water availability and demands in the case of cyclical scarcity the rbas limit water allocations according to the rbmps applying a combination of two rationing rules on the one hand a priority rule is applied whereby rights holders are ranked by priority based on the use of water urban uses are at the top of the list having absolute priority over agricultural use ranked as the second priority level and all other economic activities lowest priority level the second rationing rule applies when the available water is not enough to meet all rights within the same priority level in this case a proportional distribution is applied to all these rights holders in any case since urban uses account only for 18 1 of the spanish water rights this demand is practically guaranteed and is met even during the most extreme drought events in fact during prolonged droughts in spain water rationing using the proportional rule is only applied to agricultural water rights holders 78 8 of the water rights similarly to other countries such as australia or the united states spain has used spot water markets since 1999 as a way to partially solve the problem of inefficient water allocation in the agricultural sector during cyclical scarcity periods due to proportional rationing however the performance of water markets in spain has been rather disappointing since high transaction costs and multiple trade barriers limit trading activity palomo hierro et al 2015 moreover it is expected that water trade instruments will be banned by the new left wing spanish government on the grounds that access to water is a human right and thus should not be considered a commercial asset as established in the coalition government agreement signed by the two political parties supporting it given that we can reasonably anticipate an institutional context without water markets the implementation of the priority rule is worth analyzing as an alternative allocation criterion for irrigation water seeking to prevent the efficiency losses caused by the proportional rule during drought events gómez limón et al 2020 however allocation regimes at the national level are difficult and costly to adjust since they are path dependent institutional arrangements and long lived water infrastructure nevertheless as explained below this is not the case at the id level where it is easier to change the institutional arrangements and the infrastructure this justifies the scope of this paper which is focused on changing allocation rules at the id level 2 2 water allocation at the irrigation district level a proposal for reform most irrigation water rights are collectively granted to all farmers operating within the same id organized into water users associations wuas these wuas are non profit organizations that locally manage the water allotments annually set by the rba distributing the water available each year among their irrigators following their own allocation rules water management services provided by wuas are financed by the recipient irrigators through annual payments set to ensure cost recovery in almost all cases wuas have chosen the proportional rule as the internal allocation criterion to cope with water shortages this paper proposes a shift away from proportional allocation towards a priority rule allowing the implementation of security differentiated water rights at the id level it is worth clarifying that this change would only be implemented locally simply by modifying water allocations among local farmers while water allocations at the id level would remain unchanged i e it is assumed that the rba would continue to implement the proportional rule when allocating water among ids to effect this change in local allocation rules following the australian example two priority classes are proposed distinguishing between high security or priority rights and low security or general water rights irrigators would be able to combine these two priority rights creating a portfolio of water rights to achieve any desired level of reliability while minimizing the transaction costs involved in dynamically adapting to the optimal mix young and mccoll 2003 under spanish law water rights can only be granted by the rba these water rights are granted for free to private agents based on general interest criteria and these rights allow private agents to use water only for the specific purposes established by the rba in the water entitlement e g irrigation in a specific plot of land this linkage between water rights and certain uses i e water rights are bundled with land is one of the principles of spanish water law there are two main reasons for this approach first to allow public authorities rbas to allocate water resources following general interest objectives that go beyond economic efficiency e g territorial equity or environmental conservation and second to enable the public management of the already complex hydrological systems mainly water storage and delivery without drastic changes in the water uses place and time for delivery this explains why spanish water law prohibits the exchange of water rights permanent or entitlements water markets the proposed change in the allocation regime to introduce security differentiated water rights at the id level does not affect the abovementioned principle in any way taking the current situation as a starting point we propose that at the beginning of the new allocation regime water rights collectively granted to farmers within the same id be shared out among all local irrigators on an area basis i e 1 irrigated hectare 1 water right with all these rights initially considered as general rights this change does not in itself entail any change in water allocations compared to the current implementation of the proportional rule the real change is allowing a certain share of general water rights to be upgraded into priority rights to carry out this upgrade process an auction procedure is proposed in these auctions the bids offered by rights holders interested in upgrading would be measured as a surcharge on the annual payment to their wua once this upgrade has been completed the allocation regime will actually be changed to implement the priority rule it is worth pointing out that in following the procedure described above the principle of bundling water rights with the land is observed in fact when implementing the security differentiated water rights as suggested the irrigated area would remain unchanged i e the total number of former water rights is equal to the sum of the new general and priority rights and there is no exchange of rights which is prohibited by spanish law moreover the water annually allocated to each id would be exactly the same as before i e available water at the basin level for irrigation is shared among ids according to the current proportional rule set by law thus public management of water resources at the basin level water storage and delivery could be carried out as it is currently done this proposal is therefore different to the australian case where the conversion of rights has been set at defined rates specifically existing general rights can be upgraded to priority security via a conversion factor e g 3 general rights 1 priority security and a transformation price drastically altering the management of the hydrological systems the change proposed would involve gains for those rights holders upgrading a share of their rights more reliable water supply however this change also involves a loss for those rights holders that do not upgrade their rights since their water supply based only on general water rights becomes less reliable this loss is the reason why they should be compensated for this change in the allocation regime for this purpose the total amount of money collected through these surcharges would be used to reduce the annual payments of all general rights holders to the wua increased income from surcharges on priority rights would allow the payments for general rights to be reduced while the services provided by the wua remain self financed under the proposal simulated here those who win the bid in the auction can hold priority rights forever enabling long term investment planning e g fruit orchards or irrigation technology in any case our proposal also assumes that there would be a local water rights market allowing the dynamic allocation of these priority rights this proposal for implementing a priority rule would have to be accepted by a majority of irrigators i e approved as an allocation rule within the wua if this change is to create a win win solution where both reliability winners those upgrading their rights into priority ones and reliability losers those keeping their general rights increase their profitability in other words for the proposed change to be successful the increase in farm profitability achieved by reliability winners must be higher than the surcharges they would have to pay and the reduction in the annual payments to the wua charged to reliability losers must outweigh their farm profitability losses this condition would be met only if the change in allocation rule leads to an increase in economic efficiency that is if the aggregate profitability at the id level increases the main objective of this paper is to empirically test whether the proposed change in the allocation rules can enhance economic efficiency in the case study considered for this purpose a simulation exercise is performed with the programming model also providing information about the optimum percentage of rights to be upgraded into priority rights i e the share that maximizes economic efficiency at the id level 3 case study 3 1 the sector bxii irrigation district the sector bxii sbxii is an id covering 14 643 ha close to the mouth of the guadalquivir river this district is operated by 569 farmers average farm size of 25 7 ha organized into a wua holding a collective water right of 6000 cubic meters per hectare and year full water allotment the wua is in charge of water allocation among all irrigators currently doing so according to the proportional rule the costs of the water management services provided are financed through a binomial tariff with each irrigator annually paying 294 euros per hectare to recover fixed operational and management costs plus a volumetric charge of 0 003 euros per cubic meter of water applied to recover energy pumping costs although this area was converted to irrigation during the 1980s the irrigation infrastructure and techniques have since been updated sprinkler irrigation predominates 72 although drip 22 and surface irrigation 6 are also used depending on the crop this modern technology and the good agronomic conditions of the district make it a valuable example of highly profitable irrigation production where water use efficiency is relatively high however the main problem faced by irrigators in the sbxii is their sensitivity to water supply gaps i e water shortages during drought periods when the availability of irrigation water is not enough to meet full water allocations they experience fairly large losses much higher than those registered by other less modernized and less efficient irrigators elsewhere in the basin the main crops in the area are cotton 44 5 corn 12 9 tomato 11 5 sugar beet 9 4 wheat 8 7 sunflower 6 7 and other vegetables such as carrots and onions 6 3 however it is worth mentioning that there are several productive profiles at the farm level in order to characterize them a random sample of 59 farms located in the sbxii was selected gathering data regarding their main productive features size crop mixes productive technologies and income and costs by crops and the socio demographic characteristics of their farmers age educational level etc a typology of the farms sampled was identified through cluster analysis using the percentage of the area devoted to each crop as differentiating variables for further details see montilla lópez et al 2018 the characteristics of each identified farm type are summarized as follows farm type 1 ft1 large professional farmers this type represents 39 of farms in the sample and accounts for 52 of the total irrigable area this is the largest farm type in the sbxii 35 8 ha mainly oriented towards horticultural crops tomato 30 3 carrot 5 3 and onion 1 6 which are the most profitable crops other important crops are cotton 29 6 and sugar beet 24 0 farm type 2 ft2 risk diversifiers this farm type represents 41 of the farmers in the sample and accounts for 36 of the area of the sbxii it is a medium sized farm 23 9 ha characterized by having a highly diversified crop plan and dedicating areas to most of the existing crop options in the study area farm type 3 ft3 extensive conservative farmers this type of farm represents the smallest proportion of farmers in the sample 20 covering just 11 of the total area of the sbxii it is therefore the smallest farm type with an average of 15 0 ha its agricultural area is cultivated with the most extensive crops such as cotton 57 0 and sugar beet 39 1 which are both highly dependent on coupled subsidies as shown in table 1 these farm types are heterogeneous in terms of the profitability and productivity of water this means that they differ notably in the losses caused by proportional rationing implemented during drought events with much greater losses occurring in the case of the most intensive farming ft1 specialized in vegetables with higher productivity of water and more moderate losses for extensive farming ft2 and ft3 focused on industrial crops and cereals with lower productivity of water this heterogeneity justifies the choice of this case study to explore the implementation of priority water rights as an instrument to improve water management during scarcity periods 3 2 annual water allotments in the sbxii irrigation district the sbxii is located in a mediterranean region where irrigated agriculture is particularly vulnerable to the risk of hydrological drought meaning annual water allotments are frequently lower than those fixed in the water rights full water allotments thus annual water allotment must be considered as a stochastic variable that needs to be characterized before modeling the potential impact of any change in the allocation rules the distribution of the annual water allotments to the sbxii wa id could be fitted to different probability distribution functions according to historical records e g rey et al 2016 however this approach is not suitable when the water system analyzed has substantially changed over recent years as is the case in the guadalquivir river basin where the sbxii is located given recent changes in water demands new water rights granted reservoir infrastructure increased storage capacity and water management rules larger minimum ecological flows expósito and berbel 2019 distributions fitted according to past records are not appropriate for assessing feasible hydrological situations and current water supply reliability therefore an approach based on a stochastic hydrological simulation model considering the new demand and supply constraints and the institutional framework fixed in the guadalquivir rbmp chg 2015 is needed to estimate the probability distributions of annual water allotments this approach has been implemented by gómez limón 2020 for the hydrological system where the case study area is located sistema de regulación general yielding the empirical histogram shown in fig 1 the shape of this histogram does not fit to any commonly used distribution function for this reason we directly rely on the simulated observations obtained by gómez limón 2020 as irrigation water allotment scenarios to feed the mathematical programming model built see next section 4 modeling approach a positive mathematical programming model is built to simulate farmers behavior under the new water rights regime proposed in order to compare its potential performance with the current proportional allocation rule in terms of economic efficiency in the simulation of both allocation regimes water trading is not allowed i e anticipating an institutional context in spain without water markets meaning the analysis is focused on allocation rules as instruments for enhancing water efficiency 4 1 proportional and priority allocation rules the id subscript id taken as a case study comprises the three farm types subscript f which are considered as the decision making units each farm type represents n f farms with an average size of s f irrigated hectares with their weights being w f n f s f s id and where s id is the area of the id s id f n f s f under current internal management rules annual water allotments granted to the id wa id measured in cubic meters are shared proportionally among all farm types i e water allocations in cubic meters per hectare wa f are the same for all farm types within the id such that wa f wa id wa id s id for every f consequently the water allocation for farm type f measured in cubic meters is wa f wa f s f under the proposed new distribution rules the id would hold water rights defined as a portfolio of two different water rights priority and general rights which would be distributed among farms in any proportion therefore each farm type would hold a different portfolio of water rights the share of priority rights per farm type is denoted as pr f while the share of general rights is denoted as gr f with the two shares adding up to one pr f gr f 1 initially the optimal share of priority rights at the id level pr id f pr f w f is unknown so it will be parametrized to determine the pr id that yields the best outcome under this new water rights regime the annual water allotments to be allocated to each farm type are defined as the sum of the allotments granted for priority rights wapr and for general rights wagr 1 wa f wapr pr f wagr gr f these two terms are both determined annually depending on the water allocated to the id following the abovementioned priority procedure thus priority rights are served first with the full water allotment granted to the id fwa id as long as the water availability wa id is enough to cover all water demands from priority rights holders after that the remaining water is allocated proportionally among general rights holders see eq 2 in the event that there is not enough water to meet full allocations for priority rights the available water is to be rationed among priority rights holders following the proportional rule in this case general rights holders would not receive any water allocation see eq 3 mathematically this priority allocation rule can be expressed as follows 2 wa id pr id fwa id w a p r f w a i d w a g r w a i d p r i d f w a i d 1 p r i d 3 wa id pr id fwa id w a p r w a i d p r i d w a g r 0 we assume that farmers try to maximize farming profits as a function of their water allotments π f f wa f as explained above irrigators annual water allotments are variable depending on the water availability at the id level thus since water allotments are stochastic variables both wa id and wa f farming profits are also stochastic variables π f to simulate the risk from water supply variability at the id and farm levels n 5000 probabilistic values for wa id drawn from the hydrological simulation model built by gómez limón 2020 have been considered thus defining 5000 equally probable scenarios n 1 5000 4 2 farmers decision making for a given water allotment scenario for operative purposes we take the expected total gross margin i e total income minus variable costs gm f as a proxy for farming profits in the short run defined as a mathematical function of farmers decision variables that is the area covered by the different crops in our case study these variables are denoted by x c f where c denotes the crop and f indicates the farm type in addition farmers can make decisions regarding the share of their water right to be upgraded into priority rights pr f with the remaining water rights being considered as general water rights gr f thus farmers decision making is simulated by maximizing the expected total gross margin considering both kinds of decision variables gm f f x c f pr f following mainstream mathematical programming techniques used for ex ante policy analysis our modeling approach is based on positive mathematical programming pmp heckelei et al 2012 we implemented the standard approach formally introduced by howitt 1995 for two reasons first it is a simple method to apply in that it does not require exogenous information facilitating its application to other case studies elsewhere second this method allows us to overcome one of the problems of the pmp namely the impossibility of calibrating activities not observed in the reference year which is a necessity in our case in order to add rainfed crops as alternatives in the event of irrigation water supply gaps using howitt s standard method prevents us from calibrating the activities not observed in the reference year with these crops being added using their average cost instead of the usual pmp quadratic cost functions this approach is suitable because rainfed crops are much less profitable than irrigated crops so these alternatives only appear in cases when the annual water allotments are much lower than full water allotments and farmers are compelled to reduce the farming area actually irrigated this standard pmp procedure calibrates a non linear objective function for profit based on the observed behavior of farmers i e observed crop mix under a full water allotment scenario to exactly reproduce activity levels among the alternative options for eliciting the calibrating parameters we use the average cost approach heckelei and britz 2000 assuming a quadratic variable cost function for every crop c cv c α c x c ½ β c x c 2 where α c and β c are parameters to be elicited in order to reproduce the exact activity levels for each farm type in the reference year mérel and howitt 2014 thus for farm f the variable costs are 4 cv f x c f c α c f x c f ½ β c f x c f 2 although there are multiple sets of cost function parameters α c f and β c f that can exactly reproduce observed behavior under the average cost approach the quadratic cost function equals the accounting cost of the crop resulting in the following calibrating parameter definitions 5 α c f avc c f μ c f 6 β c f 2 μ c f x c f obs where avc c f is the average or observed accounting variable cost of crop c in farm type f x c f obs is the observed area of crop c in a year with full water allotment wa id fwa id in farm type f and μ c f are the dual values of the calibration constraints reproducing a normal hydrological scenario i e where no water rationing is needed a review of the standard pmp and the average cost approach can be found in heckelei and britz 2005 the pmp calibrated model can then be used for simulating farmers decision making in other scenarios e g water shortage situations and under different water allocation rules by modifying the objective function changing the values of the non calibrating parameters adding new constraints e g water availability or adding new decision variables e g new crop alternatives accordingly one of the most valuable advantages of the pmp is that it provides more flexible and realistic simulation responses than normative mathematical programming models henry de frahan et al 2007 it is assumed that when faced with water shortages i e wa id fwa id farmers react by changing their crop mixes replacing crops that have higher water requirements with others that have lower water needs or even rainfed crops i e null irrigation water requirement thus in addition to the observed irrigated crops two rainfed alternatives wheat and sunflower have also been considered as decision variables for simulating decision making under drought scenarios other potential management strategies to cope with cyclical scarcity e g improving irrigation efficiency at farm level or implementing deficit irrigation have been ruled out since they are not suitable for ids with modern irrigation technologies i e they have already achieved efficient water use specialized in herbaceous crops i e deficit irrigation doses do not lead to more profitability considering the priority allocation rule proposed farm types decision making can be integrated into a single model at the id level where optimum values for variables x c f and pr f and gr f are to be found for every value considered for the parameter pr id 7 1 max x c f pr f z f gm f s f w f 7 2 s t gm f c p c y c s c α c f ½ β c f x c f x c f f 7 3 c x c f s f f 7 4 c wr c x

fixed by the parameter pr id eq 7 10 denotes the rest of the constraints defining the feasible solution set which constitute agronomic rotational and frequency requirements policy cotton and sugar

types decision making can also be integrated with a simplified version of model 7 skipping eqs 7 6 7 9 and replacing eq 7 5 by wa f wa id for every farm type f 4 3 farmers decision making considering the full distribution of water allotments it should be recalled that the annual water allotment granted to the id is a stochastic variable wa id ranging from fwa id to 0 within this stochastic framework it is assumed that farmers make decisions regarding the upgrade of water rights in an attempt to maximize their expected or average total gross margin thus considering n 5000 probabilistic values for wa id model 7 becomes 8 1 max x c f n pr f z 1 n f n gm f n s f w f 8 2 s t gm f n c p c y c s c α c f ½ β c f x c f n x c f n f n 8 3 c x c f n s f f n 8 4 c wr c x c f n wa f n s f f n 8

n also affecting in each scenario n crop mixes x c f n and thus gm f n the objective function in this model 8 1 allows the joint maximization of the average gross margin for all farm types as a result of the optimum decision making regarding the upgrade into priority rights it is also worth recalling that pr id is parametrized so we can find the optimal share of priority rights within the id that maximizes the total efficiency to evaluate the possible improvements under this new water allocation regime in terms of economic efficiency it is necessary to establish a baseline scenario to do this the stochastic model is also solved considering current proportional allocation rules i e without the possibility of acquiring priority rights thus model 8 is also solved by ignoring eqs 8 6 8 9 and substituting eq 8 5 with wa f n wa id n for every farm type f in doing so we are able to obtain any variations in gross margins and water use at the farm and id level as well as other indicators for the analysis allowing an assessment of the proposed allocation rule 5 results the results of the simulation model yield evidence that priority rights could enhance overall economic efficiency in fact compared to the baseline values of the current proportional water rights regime the average gross margin at the id level is increased for every possible value of the parameter pr id share of priority rights over total water rights however these improvements in economic efficiency are almost negligible registering a disappointing maximum of 0 2 of the current gross margins for the optimum value for pr id 20 5 as can be observed in fig 2 the increase in the average gross margin at the id level black line is the overall result of heterogeneous impacts on the different farm types considered gray lines ft1 shows a significant wtp for upgrading general water rights into priority ones since this upgrade allows the highest increase in average profitability reaching a maximum wtp of 2 1 of its current gross margin i e with proportional water rights conversely ft2 and ft3 register the lowest wta for reducing their water supply reliability as a consequence of keeping general water rights requiring compensation i e reduction on the annual payment to the wau ranging from 0 to 5 1 of their current gross margins depending on the total share of priority rights granted in any case it should be highlighted that theoretically the wta of ft2 and ft3 could be fully met by the wtp of ft1 through the proposed compensation instrument while still leaving a gross margin surplus i e economic efficiency increase nevertheless it is also worth mentioning that the modeling approach followed has been simplified by assuming null transaction costs both static and institutional transaction costs garrick et al 2013 marshall 2013 thus since the wtp wta gap is very small in this case study a surplus of only 0 2 of current gross margins it is reasonable to assume that in a real world setting there would actually be no room for any efficiency increase table 2 shows the simulation results for the maximum efficiency solution based on a 20 5 share of priority water rights granted at the id level taking this solution as the best possible outcome it can be observed that ft1 upgrades 30 7 of its water rights into priority ones however it is worth noting that ft2 and ft3 also upgrade a share of their water rights although in lower proportions 11 3 and 3 1 respectively this optimum allocation of priority water rights allows ft1 to increase its average annual water allocation compared to the current situation i e implementation of proportional water rights while its water allocation became more stable over time an increase of 3 2 in the average allocation and a decrease of 11 3 in its standard deviation accordingly this improved water supply reliability leads to an increase in the average gross margin 2 0 and a decrease in its volatility 18 0 decrease in its standard deviation prompting this farm type to make the highest bid for a rights upgrade i e annual surcharges to be paid through the auction procedure suggested on the other hand the irrigation water supply gets worse for ft2 and ft3 both in terms of the average decreases of 2 9 and 5 5 respectively and the volatility increases of 10 3 and 19 5 respectively in their standard deviations this deteriorated supply reliability leads to worse profitability indicators reduced average gross margins 2 1 and 5 0 respectively and increased profit volatility 22 1 increase in the standard deviation of the gross margin for both farm types nevertheless these farming losses could theoretically be fully compensated by the surcharges paid by ft1 in this regard it is worth noting that the overall volume of water allocated at the id level is the same as in the proportional water rights baseline this constraint was implicitly assumed in the proposal in order to ensure that the proposed change in the water allocation regime has no direct impact on the environment e g water abstractions however the implementation of security differentiated water rights could involve some spillover effects both positive and negative on the environment first it could be logically assumed that the priority system may lessen the incentive to steal water for those more efficient farmers who are more sensitive to water supply gaps loch et al 2020b second the reform proposed in the water allocation regime could produce a negative side effect on the environment by decreasing the return flows indeed the farmers who are most willing to acquire priority rights are usually those who are more efficient in water use because they use more modern irrigation techniques thus it could be expected that the more priority rights these farmers acquire the lower the return flows to watercourses negatively affecting environmental flows at any rate in the case study considered the effects on returns would not have a significant impact on the environment because this id is located close to the mouth of the guadalquivir river and almost all the returns from the id go directly to the sea nevertheless because of how difficult they are to assess none of these potential side effects has been considered in the modeling exercise implemented lastly the results obtained for specific water allotment scenarios wa id under the optimum priority rights sharing as shown in table 3 are also noteworthy it can be easily seen that compared to the proportional rights regime the implementation of priority rights increases water allotments and annual gross margins in the case of ft1 the reliability winner while ft2 and ft3 reliability losers show a decrease in these two variables however the most notable result is that the overall variation in gross margins at the id level is not always positive for moderate to severe drought scenarios with an annual id level water allocation of between 3723 and 2032 m3 ha the outcome of the implementation of the proposed priority regime is worse than that of the current proportional water rights thus the implementation of priority rights not only provides a tiny increase in average economic efficiency but also involves annual economic inefficiency for a range of drought scenarios with a probability of occurrence of 14 9 however it is also true that priority rights could yield an efficiency increase in the event of an extreme drought annual water allotment below 1300 m3 ha 6 discussion and concluding remarks in light of the results obtained we reject the initial hypothesis that replacing allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with a priority rule establishing security differentiated water rights can help improve water use efficiency in the agricultural sector at the local i e irrigation district level in fact although the simulated performance shows that this reform in irrigation water rights could generate a slight efficiency improvement the economic gains would not be enough to cover the transaction costs associated with the implementation of the proposed allocation regime an upgrade of water rights through auctions and a compensation procedure to indemnify reliability losers these disappointing results are explained by the fact that priority rights do not reflect the marginal value of water across users in a timely manner oecd 2016 if the main political objective is to improve economic efficiency the most suitable instrument would be the spot water market allocation trading as it is the most useful mechanism for equalizing the marginal benefit of water across users chong and sunding 2006 water scarcity is a dynamic phenomenon that must be managed through the implementation of sufficiently flexible instruments capable of modifying allocations in the short term just as the spot water markets do this is not the case of allocation regimes based on priority rights which is a rigid instrument that cannot be modulated depending on the level of water scarcity in fact as shown by the australian experience priority rights should not be considered as an alternative instrument to spot water markets but rather a complementary instrument to water trading that can help improve water use efficiency as far as the authors know the assessment performed in this paper is innovative however a few previous related studies analyzing other water rationing rules are worth citing in this sense martínez and esteban 2014 alarcón et al 2014 and goetz et al 2017 have focused on other allocation rules uniform sequential equal economic loss or minimization of the total accumulated loss rules proposed by economic theory also using mathematical programming simulation techniques these authors report that while these alternative allocation rules could provide significant efficiency improvements at the id level compared to the proportional rule currently implemented all of them are outperformed by spot water markets although all this evidence is useful for policy analysis it is also true that the implementation of these alternative allocation rules could be complex in a real world setting e g economic analyses of the heterogeneity of farmers losses due to water shortages would first be needed involving significant transaction costs this is one of the reasons why they have not yet been implemented anywhere another related contribution worth noting is the study by adamson et al 2006 these authors also assess a water allocation regime with two security differentiated water rights high and low priority which is compared with the proportional allocation rule for this purpose they use a state contingent model of production under uncertainty with three states of nature normal drought and wet which is applied to the murray darling basin including all water rights holders both urban and agricultural they conclude that a water allocation solution with two levels of priority rights outperforms that obtained using the proportional rule there may be several reasons behind the unexpected and contradictory results reported in this paper first the differences found could be largely explained by the different scopes of the changes proposed in water allocation rules while in this paper the assessment performed considers a change in allocation rules at the id level only water allocation among farmers within the same id other studies have considered a shift in allocation rules for all water rights holders in a river basin thus also affecting water allocation among ids in this respect it would seem logical to assume that by including more heterogeneity among water rights holders priority rights could yield higher water use efficiency improvements in any case further research would be necessary to confirm that greater heterogeneity would lead to priority allocation solutions clearly outperforming those obtained with the proportional rule as evidenced in the case of the murray darling basin adamson et al 2006 second the sbxii id is a particular case study that is notable for its specialization in annual crops no perennial crop is grown in this district this characteristic probably also limits the efficiency gains reported here since farms with perennial crops are among those that stand to benefit the most from priority rights most permanent crops cannot be grown under rainfed conditions in case of irrigation water supply gaps requiring priority rights to ensure a sufficiently reliable supply in this regard it is also worth acknowledging the limitation of the modeling approach proposed to properly account for investment in fixed assets e g perennial crops or production technologies thus the results reported do account for potential further specialization in higher profitability farming systems also helping to improve water use efficiency in the long term as has been evidenced in the united states or australia xu et al 2014 third it worth noting that the results reported also reflect the current probability distribution of annual water allotments see fig 1 although annual water allotments are fairly often lower than the full water allotment the well developed network of reservoirs in the guadalquivir basin i e interannual storage capacity means that there is currently a fairly low risk of severe irrigation water supply gaps e g annual water allotments lower than 30 of full water allotment as a result the efficiency gains from priority rights are lower than those expected in basins with a higher probability of extreme hydrological droughts however this could be the situation in the guadalquivir basin in the near future as climate change projections point to an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts events fourth the results obtained could also be influenced by the case specific agricultural policy framework i e coupled subsidies and production quotas which may not exist in other regions which complicates comparisons with other irrigated agricultural systems in fact it is worth pointing out that the application of the proposed simulation approach to other irrigated areas would require some fine tuning to reflect local policy conditions in any case allocation regimes based on priority rights are interesting for two reasons first as pointed out by freebairn and quiggin 2006 and lefebvre et al 2012 these allocation regimes could be successfully combined with spot water markets as in the australian experience where the joint implementation of these two instruments has led to significant improvements in drought management in the irrigation sector second priority rights are an interesting risk management instrument for farmers as shown in the simulation results the farmers who are most vulnerable to risk ft1 in our case study can use priority rights as a hedging mechanism reducing gross margin volatility in the context of climate change where farmers are eager to stabilize their income these priority rights constitute an important adaptation instrument finally further research is called for to refine the proposed modeling approach and thereby obtain more accurate results in this sense more detailed modeling of decision making regarding the upgrade of water rights could be achieved by accounting for possible changes in production technologies investments in irrigation systems or perennial crops the existence of transaction costs and heterogeneity in farmers risk preferences moreover assessing the impact of priority rights at the basin level incorporating more farm type heterogeneity could provide relevant new insights into this topic these new avenues for research pose challenges since uncertainty about the future state of water systems creates difficulties in simulating farmers strategic decision making i e decisions involving investments in fixed capital and assessing the multiple impacts of investments made chasing higher economic returns e g loch et al 2020a suggest potentially irreversible losses of capital tied to water inputs and changing incentives to steal water resources declaration of competing interest the

9903,the arid and semi arid region of northwest china is an important region for spring maize production in china but improper water and fertilizer management has caused ecological problems in these regions a two year field experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016 in the gansu province of china to investigate the effects of different irrigation amounts and fertilization rates on growth grain yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil nutrient residue of drip fertigated spring maize and explore the optimal combination of irrigation amount and fertilization rate based on a multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce model the irrigation levels included i60 60 of crop evapotranspiration i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 and i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 the n p2o5 k2o fertilization rates kg ha 1 were f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 the results showed that plant height stem diameter and leaf area index were highest under f240 120 120 maize yield dry matter water use efficiency wue followed a upward opening parabola with irrigation amount and fertilization rate and reached the maximum under i90f180 90 90 in 2015 and under i100f180 90 90 in 2016 with the simultaneous increase in irrigation amount and fertilization rate nitrate nitrogen content in the 60 120 cm soil layer showed an increasing trend based on the mfce model the irrigation amount of 415 450 mm combined with the n p2o5 k2o rate of 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 obtained the optimal comprehensive benefit of maize growth economic return water and fertilizer utilization and environmental benefit this work can provide a scientific basis for the optimization and management of spring maize irrigation and fertilization in northwest china keywords optimization soil nutrient residual water use efficiency comprehensive model yield 1 introduction as the largest product in the global cereal trade maize is the most important food source for the majority of the population tilman et al 2011 wu et al 2021 maize starch is the main form of carbohydrate and energy storage in maize grains accounting for 65 75 of kernel dry weight of maize grains qu et al 2022 in addition corn starch is often used as a binder in industrial production increasing maize production has becoming a necessary condition for achieving food security and social development as the world s second largest maize producer china planted 42 4 million hectares of maize and produced 259 7 billion kilograms tian et al 2020 in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china spring maize is the main food crop in the area but water scarcity is an important factor limiting the growth and yield of maize in the area guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 while local farmers commonly over utilize irrigation water and fertilizers in order to achieve high maize yields which reduces water and fertilizer use efficiency causes soil structure degradation crop lodging and decreases crop yield and quality kang et al 2009 wang et al 2019b yan et al 2019 there are also environmental problems such as the decrease of groundwater level and the increase of nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater which should not be ignored hu et al 2016 ma et al 2009 saving agricultural water improving water use and improving fertilizer efficiency and yield have become key issues for local agriculture to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture in the region therefore the government is encouraging farmers to exploit high efficient water saving irrigation technologies mulched drip irrigation technology is an advanced integration of water and fertilizer technology which can control the water and nutrient status in the root zone in real time and precision effectively reduce the evaporation between plants and deep seepage and minimize nutrient leaching wang et al 2019a yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 water and fertilizer have great influence on maize growth suitable irrigation amount is beneficial to increase net of maize avoid excessive energy consumption caused by excessive growth of leaf root and other organs which can promote the yield of the population cai et al 2020 ordóñez et al 2020 either deficit or excessive irrigation can lessen its yield araya et al 2021 farré and faci 2009 water deficiency may change crop physiological and biochemical characteristics thereby inhibiting crop growth and productivity ashraf 2010 stepanovic et al 2021 reported that maize yield was decreased by more than 11 under 50 less irrigation water deficit irrigation compared with full irrigation but wue was increased by 22 although wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue decreased with the increase of irrigation amount maize yield and evapotranspiration of crops increased khaliq et al 2009 sepaskhah et al 2011 on the other hand excessive irrigation reduced the metabolism of reactive oxygen species lin et al 2004 and nutrient uptake of maize grains and yield yan et al 2021 lu et al 2021b reported that the optimized irrigation system maximized the use of rainfall reduced soil nitrogen leaching loss and significantly improved wue with little yield reduction previous studies have showed that a reasonable irrigation amount can effectively improve maize wue and yield guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 fertilizer is also one of the important factors affecting maize growth reasonable fertilization is conducive to the regulation of maize root morphology so as to better absorb nutrients and water improve the environmental stress resistance of maize plants and achieve higher water nutrient utilization efficiency and yield bhattacharyya et al 2018 wang et al 2019c in addition different nutrient deficiency had different effects on maize growth the lack of nitrogen n will lead to the reduction of crop leaf area and the reduction of solar radiation intercepted by crops thereby affecting photosynthesis sung et al 2015 long term phosphorus p deficiency will result in maize growth restriction increase the root shoot ratio and delay leaf appearance artuso et al 2018 besides potassium k deficiency will cause leaf curl yellowing block chlorophyll synthesis and reduce photosynthesis of maize du et al 2019 römheld and kirkby 2010 the increase in maize yield by fertilization depends not only on the amount of nutrients but also on the combination of water and fertilizer applied gheysari et al 2009 reported that appropriate combination of water and fertilizer in regions with low rainfall increased maize yield reduced nitrate leaching and controlled nitrate leaching depth wang et al 2016a reported that under the same irrigation amount maize yield and nitrogen use efficiency were improved by applying nitrogen fertilizer at a certain proportion during the growth period in addition nitrogen uptake has a high correlation with soil moisture content and maize yield is significantly reduced due to water scarcity even under high fertilization conditions aynehband et al 2011 li et al 2021b therefore for increasing maize production and ensuring the sustainable development of maize in northwest china the optimal application regimens of water n p and k should be considered simultaneously multi objective comprehensive evaluation and analysis methods can effectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme and the evaluation results obtained are reliable and reasonable wang et al 2019a principal components analysis pca technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and fuzzy evaluation have been widely used in many fields he et al 2021 constructed a multivariate water fertilizer regulation model to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of cherry tomato and optimized the amount of water and fertilizer over two growing seasons zhang et al 2018 measured the yield and quality indexes of nine cold season forages and proposed a new way of different forage species quality ranking based on topsis li et al 2021a established a comprehensive quality evaluation model for greenhouse cherry tomato based on pca and gray relational analysis these evaluation methods can cover most of the growth parameters and determine the optimal design projects these studies have mainly used subjective or objective methods to evaluate a single index however the scientific and reasonable selection of weight is still lacking more importantly these studies only selected the best treatments based on the evaluation results without further modeling analysis which often result in inaccurate results therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the interaction effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on maize growth grain yield wue pfp partial factor productivity and soil nutrient residue based on a two year field experiment 2 to establish an evaluation system for comprehensively improving the growth economic return water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit of drip fertigated maize based on multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce models 3 to determine the optimum irrigation amount and fertilization rate suitable for the optimal comprehensive benefit of maize in northwest china this study can provide theoretical basis and support the decision system of spring maize production in the arid regions of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2

soil physical chemical and hydraulic properties are given in table 1 2 2 irrigation and fertilization treatments in 2015 four irrigation amounts were applied including 60 75 90 and 105 of actual crop evapotranspiration etc however maize yield was found to continue increasing with the irrigation amount therefore 60 80 100 120 of etc were further applied in 2016 in order to measure whether close to 100 etc was most advantageous to maize production gao et al 2006 suggested that the n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 2 was suitable for maize growth however considering the high initial available potassium content in the experiment area the ratio was adjusted to 2 1 1 in the present study four fertilizer n p2o5 k2o rates f1 60 30 30 kg ha 1 f2 120 60 60 kg ha 1 f3 180 90 90 kg ha 1 and f4 240 120 120 kg

controlled the amount of irrigation in each experimental plot the planting density of maize was 76 500 plants per ha with a seedling emergence rate of 91 8 the fertilizer forms were urea 46 n ammonium dihydrogen phosphate 12 2 n 11 8 p and potassium chloride 39 k the application proportions of fertilizers during the growing season were 20 at the seedling stage 30 at the six leaf collar stage 30 at the tasseling stage and 20 at the grain filling stage 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 spring maize growth and grain yield in each plot four plants were randomly selected to measure plant height stem diameter leaf area and aboveground biomass at the seedling six collar twelve collar tasseling filling milky and maturity stages the maize leaf area was calculated as three fourths of the leaf width multiplying the leaf length yan et al 2021 the leaf area index lai was calculated following the guidance of allen et al 1998 maize plants were placed in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and then dried to a constant weight at 75 c to obtain aboveground biomass twenty maize plants were randomly selected at the ripening stage to measure the grain number per cob and the 100 grain weight the yield per plant

indicators of spring maize i e wue pfp ni and soil no3 n or available p or available k residues were classified as the following factors economic growth water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit then the secondary indicators were divided into sub factors fig 1 to be more specific yield and ni were sorted as economic indicators u1 while plant height stem diameter lai and aboveground biomass were sorted as growth indicators u2 wue and pfp were sorted as water and fertilizer use efficiency u3 and soil no3 n available p and available k were sorted as environmental benefit u4 2 4 2 evaluation criteria of each evaluation index the evaluation index was calculated to determine the index evaluation criteria a finite group v v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 was construed where v1 was a very high class v2 was a high class v3 was a moderate class v4 was a low class and v5 was a very low class the membership function was used to depict the membership degree of each evaluation factor in the comprehensive evaluation of spring maize according to the result of this study a trapezoidal membership function distribution was used as follows 7 u i v 1 1 x a 1 x a 2 a 1 a 2 a 2 x a 1 0 x a 2 8 u i v j 1 x a k x a k 1 a k a k 1 a k 1 x a k a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k x a k 1 0 x a k 1 x a k 1 9 u i v 5 1 x a 5 a 4 x a 4 a 5 a 5 x a 4 0 x a 4 where x donates the actual evaluation factors data a k donates the corresponding level threshold which was defined with the natural breaks method wu and hu 2020 and uivj donates the membership degree of the ith factor ui corresponding to the jth grade vj however the lower the soil no3 n available p and available k the better the environment benefits so they can be written as follows 10 u i v 1 1 x a 1 a 2 x a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 0 x a 2 11 u i v j 1 x a k a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k x a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k 1 a k 1 x a k 0 x a k 1 x a k 1 12 u i v 5 1 x a 5 x a 4 a 5 a 4 a 4 x a 5 0 x a 4 according to the formula from 7 to 12 the membership degree of each evaluation index to the evaluation grade was obtained to construct the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix r 2 4 3 determination of mfce factor weights a correct evaluation system needs to determine a reasonable weight including the subjective weight and objective weight subjective factor weights can reflect intentions of decision makers but they are susceptible to subjective arbitrariness objective weight methods can reflect the characteristics of data while without considering subjective opinions the calculated weights may divorce from reality du and gao 2020 therefore hybrid indicators should be used to obtain the advantages of the two methods which can not only reflect the preference of decision makers but also reflect the influence of objective factors such as inter year the steps of the hybrid method are as follows 1 determining the subjective weights using analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp was proposed by saaty saaty 1980 the evaluation objects are decomposed continuously according to the overall evaluation objectives determined by the evaluation purpose and the evaluation objectives of each layer are obtained an evaluation index that measures the degree of achievement of a goal by taking the lowest level index particularly the comprehensive evaluation of spring maize was decomposed into objective factor and subfactor layers fig 1 the judgment matrix was then formed according to the hierarchy relation of the integrated system when constructing the matrix five irrigation experts were interviewed in the form of questionnaire and the importance of several indicators was compared according to saaty s 9 point scale table 2 to compose judgment matrix b table 3 when the matrix a was built the subjective weights was calculated as follows 13 m i j 1 n b i b j 14 w a h p m i n i 1 n m i n where m i donates the matrix line product the consistency ratio index cr was calculated to ensure the reliability of the ahp weights 15 c r c i r i ri donates the average value of the result consistency index according to the order of the matrix table 4 table 5 ci is the consistency index and can be expressed as follows 16 c i λ max m m 1 where λ max donates the maximum or principal eigenvalue of the matrix when cr was less than 0 10 the matrix had good consistency otherwise it should be changed 2 determination of the objective weights using the entropy method em the entropy method was proposed by shannon 1997 it can be used to describe the amount of information and the degree of dispersion of evaluation indicators the higher the dispersion is the greater the subjective weigh of the index to avoid the influence of units of measure the data was standardized as follow 17 z i j x i j min x 1 j x 2 j x n j max x 1 j x 2 j x n j min x 1 j x 2 j x n j where z ij donates the standardized value qian et al 2015 after that the probability of each of these indices can be calculated as 18 p i j z i j i 1 n z i j the information entropy was then calculated particularly the j th index information entropy ej was defined as 19 e j 1 ln n i 1 n p i j ln p i j finally the em weight was determined as follows 20 w e m 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j 3 calculation of the comprehensive weight the comprehensive weight can be obtained by linear combination of the objective and subjective weights 21 w c o m p α 1 w 1 α 2 w 2 where α 1 and α 2 donate the combination coefficient α 1 α 2 0 and α 1 α 2 1 in this study w 1 and w 2 donate ahp weight and em weight zhu et al 2021 the payoff function of the optimization objective was then established to minimize the deviation of the comprehensive weight 22 min i 1 2 α i w i t w j t 2 based on matrix differentiation properties the model transformation was expressed as follows 23 w 1 t w 1 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w 1 w 2 t w 2 α 1 α 2 w 1 t w 1 w 2 t w 2 2 4 4 performance of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation result vector b was calculated as follows 24 b w c o m p r b 1 b 2 b 5 where r donates the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix and b 1 b 2 b 5 mean the membership degree of different evaluation grades for further analysis the semantic scales very excellent excellent medium poor and very poor were quantified assigning values of 5 4 3 2 and 1 respectively which were multiplied by b to obtain the synthesis score of each treatment 2 5 data analysis the excel software office 2016 microsoft corp usa was used to analyze the data ahp entropy and other computation were conducted using the matlab 2020a program mathworks usa 3 results 3 1 maize growth the year y irrigation

level f60 f120 f180 and f240 increased soil k accumulation by 8 94 25 12 9 21 58 76 and 51 91 92 06 in 2015 and by 7 10 15 47 20 82 72 03 and 22 39 132 03 in 2016 respectively soil k accumulation was greatest in the 0 60 cm soil layer and it had little change in the 60 120 cm soil layer fig 3 3 4 mfce of spring maize the feasibility of 16 treatments was evaluated by the mfce model economic benefit is the goal trailed by farmers while the growth can improve the field micro environment and is the guarantee of high yield wue and pfp are two important indexes for the efficient utilization of agricultural resources soil nutrient residues are important sides for agricultural environment benefits therefore yield u11 ni u12 table s1 plant height u21 stem diameter u22 lai u23 aboveground biomass u24 wue u31 pfp u32 soil no3 n accumulation u41 soil available p accumulation u42 soil available k accumulation u43 in each treatment were used to conduct the mfce analysis subjective weights and objective weights were calculated using ahp and em respectively tables 8 and 9 the reliability of wahp was checked by using eq 15 and eq 16 there were differences in wem between the two years because the entropy method used the data itself to determine the weight wahp and wem were then merged together as the comprehensive weights by using eq 21 and eq 22 table 10 the multi level fuzzy evaluation values are given in table 11 in 2015 and 2016 with the increase of fertilization rate the evaluation value score showed an increasing and then decreasing trend however the score increased persistently with the increasing irrigation amount in 2015 under the same fertilization level because the highest irrigation amount was only 105 etc in 2016 the score of i100 was significantly higher than that of i60 i80 and i120 the f180 fertilizer level was more beneficial for improving the comprehensive value meanwhile the lowest fertilizer level f60 and the highest fertilizer level f240 were unfavorable to the realization of the objectives of the comprehensive benefits the best treatment was i90f180 and i100f180 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the worst treatment was i60f240 in both 2015 and 2016 3 5 interactive effects of water and fertilizer regimes on spring maize the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadric surface in 2015 and 2016 was 0 937 and 0 912 fig 4 respectively there were extremely significant quadratic polynomial correlation in 2015 and 2016 p 0 01 which indicated that the regression models for two years could be used to ensure the effects of irrigation and fertilization on the comprehensive benefits of spring maize in 2015 the comprehensive benefits of spring maize presented a proximately linear relationship with irrigation amount and showed a parabolic decreasing relationship with fertilization rate when the irrigation amount was the same the comprehensive evaluation value gradually increased when the fertilization rate was below 198 kg ha 1 however when the fertilization rate exceeded 198 kg ha 1 that value decreased rapidly when irrigation amount was 535 600 mm and the fertilization rate was 144 249 kg ha 1 n at a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 1 the comprehensive evaluation value attained 95 of confidence interval for the maximum in 2016 the comprehensive benefits of spring maize presented a decreasing opening parabola relationship which meant the comprehensive evaluation value firstly increased and then decreased when both factors gradually increased when the irrigation amount was 415 550 mm and the fertilization rate was 108 204 kg ha 1 n at a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 1 the comprehensive evaluation value attained 95 of confidence interval for the maximum values fig 4 however fig 3 indicated that fertilization rate 180 kg ha 1 n may increase the risk of agricultural pollution with regard to conserving both water and fertilizer and avoiding agricultural pollution the optimal irrigation amount was 415 450 mm and fertilization amount ranged from 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different water and fertilizer regimes on maize growth and yield water and nutrients are essential elements for maize growth wang et al 2017 northwest china with sufficient solar and thermal resources is very suitable for the growth of spring maize while a more precise water and fertilizer management strategy is still needed lu et al 2021a zhong et al 2020 many studies have shown that increasing water supply can promote maize plant height biomass and lai gheysari et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 insufficient irrigation may cause lower plant height and inhibited the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by the plant fan et al 2020 qi et al 2020 revealed that water stress was adverse to maize growth and the highest plant height stem diameter lai biomass grain yield yield composition and wue of maize were obtained under full irrigation yan et al 2021 also found that increasing irrigation amount promoted the growth of maize and the maximal lai was obtained under an irrigation amount of 120 crop evapotranspiration however the maximum value of dry matter accumulation and yield were obtained at 105 of crop evapotranspiration which were similar to our findings when the soil water content is suitable increasing the amount of fertilizer can significantly promote plant growth improve leaf area index delay leaf senescence increase the storage and accumulation of root stem and leaf nutrients and increase the number of grains and improve grain filling rate berenguer et al 2009 chilundo et al 2018 miner et al 2018 however the yield and leaf area index of maize do not increase linearly with the increase of fertilizer application rate guo et al 2018 reported that high nitrogen treatment showed a certain inhibitory effect and the stem diameter decreased over time feng et al 2016 saiz fernández et al 2015 revealed that high n fertilizer application produced higher soil nitrogen concentration at early growth stages inhibited the early growth of maize and finally led to a decrease in dry matter accumulation and maize yield our results showed that plant height stem diameter and lai of maize were not inhibited under high fertilization but maize yield and dry matter accumulation decreased one possible reason was the difference in the fertilization methods compared with sprinkling irrigation that all fertilizers entered the soil before or during sowing the water and fertilizer integration technology of drip irrigation was more uniform in time and space which was hard to cause excessive nitrogen concentration however high fertilization excessively promoted vegetative growth increasing leaf area and plant height reduced the group light and air permeability delayed reproductive growth and thus reduced dry matter accumulation of grains fang et al 2021 4 2 effects of different irrigation amounts and fertilizer rates on water and fertilizer efficiency improving the use efficiency of water and fertilizer through irrigation and fertilization strategy has been the continuous pursuit of agriculture today zou et al 2021 revealed that wue was higher under deficit irrigation but it can be improved by optimizing irrigation scheduling wang et al 2018 showed that excessive irrigation caused a decline in wue our study found that irrigation and fertilization had interacting effects on wue the highest wue was obtained at 90 etc and 100 etc irrigation levels in 2015 and 2016 with a mean value of 2 90 kg m 3 in 2015 and 3 29 kg m 3 in 2016 respectively this study found that wue showed an increasing and then decreasing trend when the amount of fertilizer gradually increased it was consistent with that of sun and xu sun et al 2018 xu et al 2020b the reason for this different may be that sufficient fertilizer was beneficial for the growth and development of crop canopy during spring maize growing season however excessive fertilization caused larger crop canopies and excessive transpiration resulting in the decline of wue pfp is a pivotal index to estimate the utilization efficiency of fertilizer previous studies found that reducing the amount of fertilizer can increase pfp while excessive fertilization can decrease pfp li et al 2020 wang et al 2016b our study obtained the same conclusions in addition we found that the pfp of low fertilizer treatment increased with the increase of irrigation amount while the pfp of high fertilizer treatment first increased and then decreased one possible reason was that irrigation improved the uptake of fertilizer but the excessive irrigation leached fertilizers beyond the root zone 4 3 effects of different irrigation and fertilizer regimes on soil nutrition soil environmental problems caused by excessive fertilization and irrigation have attracted increasing attentions kurtzman et al 2013 min et al 2018 in soils urea was hydrolyzed to ammonium and quickly converted to nitrate azad et al 2019 there was a quadratic relationship between soil soluble nitrogen and annual leaching loss when the rate of fertilizer applied matched the plant demand there was only a very small amount of fertilizer nitrogen in the soil at the harvest stage di and cameron 2000 jenkinson 2001 yan et al 2021 founded that no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the increasing fertilization rate our results were basically consistent with previous studies besides when fertilizer amount was higher than 120 60 60 kg ha 1 the nitrate nitrogen content in surface soils decreased when irrigation amount increased however in 2015 compared with i60 and i75 i105 increased the nitrate nitrogen content in soil layers below 40 cm by 17 54 and 33 74 respectively this indicated that the higher irrigation amount caused a higher risk of nitrogen leaching maize root system had a high nitrogen use efficiency for surface layer and soil nutrients below 60 cm were difficult to be absorbed and utilized zou et al 2017 reducing irrigation amount was an effective measure to reduce nitrogen leaching and environmental risk it has been reported that soil nitrogen residues greater than 150 kg ha 1in the 0 100 cm soil layer also reduced the response of crops to nitrogen fertilizer addition in the following year lenka et al 2013 therefore it was necessary to appropriately reduce the rate of nitrogen application to reduce soil no3 n residue when p fertilizer was applied to the soil a small part existed in the form of orthophosphates for absorption by plant roots and most of them were closely bound to the soil solid phase in the form of organophosphates frossard et al 2000 van der bom et al 2019 our results also verified this conclusion that soil available phosphorus was mainly concentrated in 0 40 cm which was not as easy to leach as no3 n however with the increasing p rate soil p residue increased therefore it was recommended to reduce the application rate of p fertilizer to maximize the use of p reserves in the soil many studies have shown that excessive application of potassium fertilizer would not only cause high soil nutrient concentration and potassium leaching loss but also lead to low utilization rate and resource waste song et al 2020 vanden nest et al 2017 potassium fertilizer was easily affected by the cation exchange process in the soil k ions in soils were easily adsorbed by clay minerals so k leaching loss was between p and no3 n bhattacharyya et al 2018 di and cameron 2004 which were similar to our results generally irrigation and fertilization had interactive effects on soil npk residues drought stress resulted in the decrease of nutrient uptake by maize plants and excessive nutrients remained in the soil ge et al 2012 on the other hand suitable irrigation amount can promote nutrient uptake and reduce residual while excessive irrigation had the risks of nutrient leaching and contamination of groundwater bodies 4 4 multi objective evaluation in our study the ahp and em were firstly employed to determine the subjective and objective weights the combined weight was then obtained by payoff function of the optimization objective eqs 21 23 therefore this study overcame some of the disadvantages of earlier studies on considering only a single weight or a simple combination of subjective and objective weight the economic effect growth effect water and fertilizer utilization and environmental benefits aspects were considered to coordinate the influence of each index on the synthetic growth of spring maize the relationships between maize comprehensive evaluation value and water fertilizer inputs were further analyzed by considering the 95 confidence interval from fig 3 there were some differences between the two years the main reason was the difference in the irrigation amount the maximum irrigation amount in 2015 was only 105 etc which produced no negative effects on maize yield and growth and excessive irrigation had not become a limiting factor however excessive water supply 120 etc in 2016 may cause the overuse of light and heat resources and delayed reproductive growth fan et al 2016 2005 furthermore the higher irrigation amount possibly reduced plant nutrient uptake by leaching nutrients in the root zone xu et al 2020a yan et al 2021 through a synthesize model based on multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation our study found that the multi objective synthesis level was best under irrigation amount ranging between 415 and 450 mm and fertilization rate ranging from 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o 5 conclusions irrigation and fertilization had obvious positive effects on growth indicators but appropriately reducing fertilization did not reduce maize yield and dry matter weight which significantly improved the use efficiency of water and fertilizer soil no3 n was easiest to migrate with water followed by soil k and p soil nutrient residue was directly proportional to the rate of fertilizer application and inversely proportional to the amount of irrigation higher irrigation and fertilization regimes resulted in greater no3 n leaching into the 40 120 cm soil layer according to the mfce model the maximum growth economy water and fertilizer efficiency and economic benefit of 95 can be achieved with the irrigation amount of 415 450 mm combined with the fertilization rate of 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o moreover it can save water and fertilizer and reduce the risk of groundwater pollution our study can provide a scientific management of spring maize fertilization and

9903,the arid and semi arid region of northwest china is an important region for spring maize production in china but improper water and fertilizer management has caused ecological problems in these regions a two year field experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016 in the gansu province of china to investigate the effects of different irrigation amounts and fertilization rates on growth grain yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and soil nutrient residue of drip fertigated spring maize and explore the optimal combination of irrigation amount and fertilization rate based on a multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce model the irrigation levels included i60 60 of crop evapotranspiration i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 and i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 the n p2o5 k2o fertilization rates kg ha 1 were f60 30 30 f120 60 60 f180 90 90 and f240 120 120 the results showed that plant height stem diameter and leaf area index were highest under f240 120 120 maize yield dry matter water use efficiency wue followed a upward opening parabola with irrigation amount and fertilization rate and reached the maximum under i90f180 90 90 in 2015 and under i100f180 90 90 in 2016 with the simultaneous increase in irrigation amount and fertilization rate nitrate nitrogen content in the 60 120 cm soil layer showed an increasing trend based on the mfce model the irrigation amount of 415 450 mm combined with the n p2o5 k2o rate of 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 obtained the optimal comprehensive benefit of maize growth economic return water and fertilizer utilization and environmental benefit this work can provide a scientific basis for the optimization and management of spring maize irrigation and fertilization in northwest china keywords optimization soil nutrient residual water use efficiency comprehensive model yield 1 introduction as the largest product in the global cereal trade maize is the most important food source for the majority of the population tilman et al 2011 wu et al 2021 maize starch is the main form of carbohydrate and energy storage in maize grains accounting for 65 75 of kernel dry weight of maize grains qu et al 2022 in addition corn starch is often used as a binder in industrial production increasing maize production has becoming a necessary condition for achieving food security and social development as the world s second largest maize producer china planted 42 4 million hectares of maize and produced 259 7 billion kilograms tian et al 2020 in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china spring maize is the main food crop in the area but water scarcity is an important factor limiting the growth and yield of maize in the area guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 while local farmers commonly over utilize irrigation water and fertilizers in order to achieve high maize yields which reduces water and fertilizer use efficiency causes soil structure degradation crop lodging and decreases crop yield and quality kang et al 2009 wang et al 2019b yan et al 2019 there are also environmental problems such as the decrease of groundwater level and the increase of nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater which should not be ignored hu et al 2016 ma et al 2009 saving agricultural water improving water use and improving fertilizer efficiency and yield have become key issues for local agriculture to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture in the region therefore the government is encouraging farmers to exploit high efficient water saving irrigation technologies mulched drip irrigation technology is an advanced integration of water and fertilizer technology which can control the water and nutrient status in the root zone in real time and precision effectively reduce the evaporation between plants and deep seepage and minimize nutrient leaching wang et al 2019a yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 water and fertilizer have great influence on maize growth suitable irrigation amount is beneficial to increase net of maize avoid excessive energy consumption caused by excessive growth of leaf root and other organs which can promote the yield of the population cai et al 2020 ordóñez et al 2020 either deficit or excessive irrigation can lessen its yield araya et al 2021 farré and faci 2009 water deficiency may change crop physiological and biochemical characteristics thereby inhibiting crop growth and productivity ashraf 2010 stepanovic et al 2021 reported that maize yield was decreased by more than 11 under 50 less irrigation water deficit irrigation compared with full irrigation but wue was increased by 22 although wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue decreased with the increase of irrigation amount maize yield and evapotranspiration of crops increased khaliq et al 2009 sepaskhah et al 2011 on the other hand excessive irrigation reduced the metabolism of reactive oxygen species lin et al 2004 and nutrient uptake of maize grains and yield yan et al 2021 lu et al 2021b reported that the optimized irrigation system maximized the use of rainfall reduced soil nitrogen leaching loss and significantly improved wue with little yield reduction previous studies have showed that a reasonable irrigation amount can effectively improve maize wue and yield guo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 fertilizer is also one of the important factors affecting maize growth reasonable fertilization is conducive to the regulation of maize root morphology so as to better absorb nutrients and water improve the environmental stress resistance of maize plants and achieve higher water nutrient utilization efficiency and yield bhattacharyya et al 2018 wang et al 2019c in addition different nutrient deficiency had different effects on maize growth the lack of nitrogen n will lead to the reduction of crop leaf area and the reduction of solar radiation intercepted by crops thereby affecting photosynthesis sung et al 2015 long term phosphorus p deficiency will result in maize growth restriction increase the root shoot ratio and delay leaf appearance artuso et al 2018 besides potassium k deficiency will cause leaf curl yellowing block chlorophyll synthesis and reduce photosynthesis of maize du et al 2019 römheld and kirkby 2010 the increase in maize yield by fertilization depends not only on the amount of nutrients but also on the combination of water and fertilizer applied gheysari et al 2009 reported that appropriate combination of water and fertilizer in regions with low rainfall increased maize yield reduced nitrate leaching and controlled nitrate leaching depth wang et al 2016a reported that under the same irrigation amount maize yield and nitrogen use efficiency were improved by applying nitrogen fertilizer at a certain proportion during the growth period in addition nitrogen uptake has a high correlation with soil moisture content and maize yield is significantly reduced due to water scarcity even under high fertilization conditions aynehband et al 2011 li et al 2021b therefore for increasing maize production and ensuring the sustainable development of maize in northwest china the optimal application regimens of water n p and k should be considered simultaneously multi objective comprehensive evaluation and analysis methods can effectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme and the evaluation results obtained are reliable and reasonable wang et al 2019a principal components analysis pca technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and fuzzy evaluation have been widely used in many fields he et al 2021 constructed a multivariate water fertilizer regulation model to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of cherry tomato and optimized the amount of water and fertilizer over two growing seasons zhang et al 2018 measured the yield and quality indexes of nine cold season forages and proposed a new way of different forage species quality ranking based on topsis li et al 2021a established a comprehensive quality evaluation model for greenhouse cherry tomato based on pca and gray relational analysis these evaluation methods can cover most of the growth parameters and determine the optimal design projects these studies have mainly used subjective or objective methods to evaluate a single index however the scientific and reasonable selection of weight is still lacking more importantly these studies only selected the best treatments based on the evaluation results without further modeling analysis which often result in inaccurate results therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the interaction effects of irrigation amount and fertilization rate on maize growth grain yield wue pfp partial factor productivity and soil nutrient residue based on a two year field experiment 2 to establish an evaluation system for comprehensively improving the growth economic return water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit of drip fertigated maize based on multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation mfce models 3 to determine the optimum irrigation amount and fertilization rate suitable for the optimal comprehensive benefit of maize in northwest china this study can provide theoretical basis and support the decision system of spring maize production in the arid regions of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil conditions at the experimental site the experiments were conducted at the agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station of china agricultural university 37 50 n 102

collected from the field and taken to the laboratory for physical and chemical properties measurement air dried and 2 mm sieved soil samples were used to measure the sand silt and clay contents of the soil with the malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 the soil texture was classified as clay loam according to the international classification criteria soil survey staff 2006 soil extract was obtained at a soil water ratio of 1 5 to measure ph by a ph meter phs 2f the mineralization degree of irrigation water was 0 7 g l 1 and it was extracted from 40 m underground the basic soil physical chemical and hydraulic properties are given in table 1 2 2 irrigation and fertilization treatments in 2015 four irrigation amounts were applied including 60 75 90 and 105 of actual crop evapotranspiration etc however maize yield was found to continue increasing with the irrigation amount therefore 60 80 100 120 of etc were further applied in 2016 in order to measure whether close to 100 etc was most advantageous to maize production gao et al 2006 suggested that the n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 2 was suitable for maize growth however considering the high initial available potassium content in the experiment area the ratio was adjusted to 2 1 1 in the present study four fertilizer n p2o5 k2o rates f1 60 30 30 kg ha 1 f2 120 60 60 kg ha 1 f3 180 90 90 kg ha 1 and f4 240 120 120 kg

the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated with the penman monteith equation fan et al 2018 the irrigation interval was fixed to 10 days when no rainfall events occurred if it rained on the irrigation day the irrigation was put off to the next day the irrigation scheduling during 2015 2016 are illustrated in table 2 a drip irrigation belt was set in the middle of the two narrow rows with the distance of each row of 0 2 m the drip irrigation tape was a patch drip irrigation tape the emitter spacing was 20 cm and the discharge rate of the emitter was 2 3 l h 1 the rotorcraft water meter controlled the amount of irrigation in each experimental plot the planting density of maize was 76 500 plants per ha with a seedling emergence rate of 91 8 the fertilizer forms were urea 46 n ammonium dihydrogen phosphate 12 2 n 11 8 p and potassium chloride 39 k the application proportions of fertilizers during the growing season were 20 at the seedling stage 30 at the six leaf collar stage 30 at the tasseling stage and 20 at the grain filling stage 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 spring maize growth and grain yield in each plot four plants were randomly selected to measure plant height stem diameter leaf area and aboveground biomass at the seedling six collar twelve collar tasseling filling milky and maturity stages the maize leaf area was calculated as three fourths of the leaf width multiplying the leaf length yan et al 2021 the leaf area index lai was calculated following the guidance of allen et al 1998 maize plants were placed in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and then dried to a constant weight at 75 c to obtain aboveground biomass twenty maize plants were randomly selected at the ripening stage to measure the grain number per cob and the 100 grain weight the yield per plant and yield per hectare were then calculated 2 3 2 water use efficiency wue wue was calculated as follows 2 wue gy et where gy is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the maize water consumption mm et was calculated as 3 e t p u i d r δ w where p is the effective rainfall mm u is the groundwater recharge i is the irrigation r is the surface runoff d is the deep drainage δw is the change in soil moisture from the beginning to the end of the experiment according to the actual situation in the experiments u d and r could be ignored 2 3 3 partial factor productivity pfp pfp was calculated as 4

indicators of spring maize i e wue pfp ni and soil no3 n or available p or available k residues were classified as the following factors economic growth water and fertilizer use efficiency and environmental benefit then the secondary indicators were divided into sub factors fig 1 to be more specific yield and ni were sorted as economic indicators u1 while plant height stem diameter lai and aboveground biomass were sorted as growth indicators u2 wue and pfp were sorted as water and fertilizer use efficiency u3 and soil no3 n available p and available k were sorted as environmental benefit u4 2 4 2 evaluation criteria of each evaluation index the evaluation index was calculated to determine the index evaluation criteria a finite group v v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 was construed where v1 was a very high class v2 was a high class v3 was a moderate class v4 was a low class and v5 was a very low class the membership function was used to depict the membership degree of each evaluation factor in the comprehensive evaluation of spring maize according to the result of this study a trapezoidal membership function distribution was used as follows 7 u i v 1 1 x a 1 x a 2 a 1 a 2 a 2 x a 1 0 x a 2 8 u i v j 1 x a k x a k 1 a k a k 1 a k 1 x a k a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k x a k 1 0 x a k 1 x a k 1 9 u i v 5 1 x a 5 a 4 x a 4 a 5 a 5 x a 4 0 x a 4 where x donates the actual evaluation factors data a k donates the corresponding level threshold which was defined with the natural breaks method wu and hu 2020 and uivj donates the membership degree of the ith factor ui corresponding to the jth grade vj however the lower the soil no3 n available p and available k the better the environment benefits so they can be written as follows 10 u i v 1 1 x a 1 a 2 x a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 0 x a 2 11 u i v j 1 x a k a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k x a k 1 x a k 1 a k a k 1 a k 1 x a k 0 x a k 1 x a k 1 12 u i v 5 1 x a 5 x a 4 a 5 a 4 a 4 x a 5 0 x a 4 according to the formula from 7 to 12 the membership degree of each evaluation index to the evaluation grade was obtained to construct the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix r 2 4 3 determination of mfce factor weights a correct evaluation system needs to determine a reasonable weight including the subjective weight and objective weight subjective factor weights can reflect intentions of decision makers but they are susceptible to subjective arbitrariness objective weight methods can reflect the characteristics of data while without considering subjective opinions the calculated weights may divorce from reality du and gao 2020 therefore hybrid indicators should be used to obtain the advantages of the two methods which can not only reflect the preference of decision makers but also reflect the influence of objective factors such as inter year the steps of the hybrid method are as follows 1 determining the subjective weights using analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp was proposed by saaty saaty 1980 the evaluation objects are decomposed continuously according to the overall evaluation objectives determined by the evaluation purpose and the evaluation objectives of each layer are obtained an evaluation index that measures the degree of achievement of a goal by taking the lowest level index particularly the comprehensive evaluation of spring maize was decomposed into objective factor and subfactor layers fig 1 the judgment matrix was then formed according to the hierarchy relation of the integrated system when constructing the matrix five irrigation experts were interviewed in the form of questionnaire and the importance of several indicators was compared according to saaty s 9 point scale table 2 to compose judgment matrix b table 3 when the matrix a was built the subjective weights was calculated as follows 13 m i j 1

entropy method em the entropy method was proposed by shannon 1997 it can be used to describe the amount of information and the degree of dispersion of evaluation indicators the higher the dispersion is the greater the subjective weigh of the index to avoid the influence of units of measure the data was standardized as follow 17 z i j x i j min x 1 j x 2 j x n j max x 1 j x 2 j x n j min x 1 j x 2 j x n j where z ij donates the standardized value qian et al 2015 after that the probability of each of these indices can be calculated as 18 p i j z i j i 1 n z i j the information entropy was then calculated particularly the j th index information entropy ej was defined as 19 e j 1 ln n i 1 n p i j ln p i j finally the em weight was determined as follows 20 w e m 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j 3 calculation of the comprehensive weight the comprehensive weight can be obtained by linear combination of the objective and subjective weights 21 w c o m p α 1 w 1 α 2 w 2 where α 1 and α 2 donate the combination

trend compared with the low irrigation level i60 the i75 i90 and i105 treatments increased average yield of by 18 56 35 72 and 41 30 in 2015 respectively with the increase of irrigation amount maize yield showed a first increasing and then decreasing trend compared with i60 i80 i100 and i120 increased average yield by 21 26 39 24 and 29 22 in 2016 respectively table 7 wue exhibited similar trends to maize yield which increased firstly and then decreased with the increasing irrigation amount and fertilization rate wue of the i90f180 treatment in 2015 and i100f180 treatment in 2016 was significantly higher than those of the other treatments table 7 pfp decreased with the increase of fertilization rate compared with the low fertilization level f60 f120 f180 and f240 treatments

interactions on the soil p and k accumulation p 0 01 table 6 the accumulation of no3 n in the 0 120 cm soil profile increased with the increase of fertilization rate but it gradually decreased when irrigation amount increased compared with the low fertilization level f60 f120 f180 and f240 increased soil no3 n accumulation by 0 06 0 65 5 58 27 59 and 14 54 60 32 in 2015 and by 0 06 0 63 5 40 26 69 and 14 05 58 34 in 2016 respectively the accumulation of no3 n in the 0 40 cm soil layer was largest besides soil no3 n would move downwards with the increasing irrigation amount compared with that in 2015 the average soil no3 n accumulation in the 0 120 cm soil layer was increased by 3 06 while the average soil no3 n accumulation in the 40 120 cm soil layer was increased by 20 09 in 2016 fig 3 this indicated that more no3 n was leached into deep soils and accumulated annually when the irrigation amount was the same soil p accumulation in the 0 120 cm soil profile showed an increasing trend with the increase of fertilization rate compared with the low fertilization level f60 f120 f180 and f240 increased soil p accumulation by 1 69 25 58 31 50 75 87 and 93 81 127 30 in 2015 and by 4 89 9 46 20 60 49 03 and 30 32 109 90 in 2016 respectively besides soil p accumulation in the 0 120 cm soil profile increased with the increase of irrigation amount but there was little change in the 40 120 cm soil profile fig 3 when the irrigation amount was the same soil k accumulation in the 0 120 cm soil profile increased with the increase of fertilization rate compared with the low fertilization level f60 f120 f180 and f240 increased soil k accumulation by 8 94 25 12 9 21 58 76 and 51 91 92 06 in 2015 and by 7 10 15 47 20 82 72 03 and 22 39 132 03 in 2016 respectively soil k accumulation was greatest in the 0 60 cm soil layer and it had little change in the 60 120 cm soil layer fig 3 3 4 mfce of spring maize the feasibility of 16 treatments was evaluated by the mfce model economic benefit is the goal trailed by farmers while the growth can improve the field micro environment and is the guarantee of high yield wue and pfp are two important indexes for the efficient utilization of agricultural resources soil nutrient residues are important sides for agricultural environment benefits therefore yield u11 ni u12 table s1 plant height u21 stem diameter u22 lai u23 aboveground biomass u24 wue u31 pfp u32 soil no3 n accumulation u41 soil available p accumulation u42 soil available k accumulation u43 in each treatment were used to conduct the mfce analysis subjective weights and objective weights were calculated using ahp and em respectively tables 8 and 9 the reliability of wahp was checked by using eq 15 and eq 16 there were differences in wem between the two years because the entropy method used the data itself to determine the weight wahp and wem were then merged together as the comprehensive weights by using eq 21 and eq 22 table 10 the multi level fuzzy evaluation values are given in table 11 in 2015 and 2016 with the increase of fertilization rate the evaluation value score showed an increasing and then decreasing trend however the score increased persistently with the increasing irrigation amount in 2015 under the same fertilization level because the highest irrigation amount was only 105 etc in 2016 the score of i100 was significantly higher than that of i60 i80 and i120 the f180 fertilizer level was more beneficial for improving the comprehensive value meanwhile the lowest fertilizer level f60 and the highest fertilizer level f240 were unfavorable to the realization of the objectives of the comprehensive benefits the best treatment was i90f180 and i100f180 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the worst treatment was i60f240 in both 2015 and 2016 3 5 interactive effects of water and fertilizer regimes on spring maize the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadric surface in 2015 and 2016 was 0 937 and 0 912 fig 4 respectively there were extremely significant quadratic polynomial correlation in 2015 and 2016 p 0 01 which indicated that the regression models for two years could be used to ensure the effects of irrigation and fertilization on the comprehensive benefits of spring maize in 2015 the comprehensive benefits of spring maize presented a proximately linear relationship with irrigation amount and showed a parabolic decreasing relationship with fertilization rate when the irrigation amount was the same the comprehensive evaluation value gradually increased when the fertilization rate was below 198 kg ha 1 however when the fertilization rate exceeded 198 kg ha 1 that value decreased rapidly when irrigation amount was 535 600 mm and the fertilization rate was 144 249 kg ha 1 n at a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 1 the comprehensive evaluation value attained 95 of confidence interval for the maximum in 2016 the comprehensive benefits of spring maize presented a decreasing opening parabola relationship which meant the comprehensive evaluation value firstly increased and then decreased when both factors gradually increased when the irrigation amount was 415 550 mm and the fertilization rate was 108 204 kg ha 1 n at a n p2o5 k2o ratio of 2 1 1 the comprehensive evaluation value attained 95 of confidence interval for the maximum values fig 4 however fig 3 indicated that fertilization rate 180 kg ha 1 n may increase the risk of agricultural pollution with regard to conserving both water and fertilizer and avoiding agricultural pollution the optimal irrigation amount was 415 450 mm and fertilization amount ranged from 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different water and fertilizer regimes on maize growth and yield water and nutrients are essential elements for maize growth wang et al 2017 northwest china with sufficient solar and thermal resources is very suitable for the growth of spring maize while a more precise water and fertilizer management strategy is still needed lu et al 2021a zhong et al 2020 many studies have shown that increasing water supply can promote maize plant height biomass and lai gheysari et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 insufficient irrigation may cause lower plant height and inhibited the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by the plant fan et al 2020 qi et al 2020 revealed that water stress was adverse to maize growth and the highest plant height stem diameter lai biomass grain yield yield composition and wue of maize were obtained under full irrigation yan et al 2021 also found that increasing irrigation amount promoted the growth of maize and the maximal lai was obtained under an irrigation amount of 120 crop evapotranspiration however the maximum value of dry matter accumulation and yield were obtained at 105 of crop evapotranspiration which were similar to our findings when the soil water content is suitable increasing the amount of fertilizer can significantly promote plant growth improve leaf area index delay leaf senescence increase the storage and accumulation of root stem and leaf nutrients and increase the number of grains and improve grain filling rate berenguer et al 2009 chilundo et al 2018 miner et al 2018 however the yield and leaf area index of maize do not increase linearly with the increase of fertilizer application rate guo et al 2018 reported that high nitrogen treatment showed a certain inhibitory effect and the stem diameter decreased over time feng et al 2016 saiz fernández et al 2015 revealed that high n fertilizer application produced higher soil nitrogen concentration at early growth stages inhibited the early growth of maize and finally led to a decrease in dry matter accumulation and maize yield our results showed that plant height stem diameter and lai of maize were not inhibited under high fertilization but maize yield and dry matter accumulation decreased one possible reason was the difference in the fertilization methods compared with sprinkling irrigation that all fertilizers entered the soil before or during sowing the water and fertilizer integration technology of drip irrigation was more uniform in time and space which was hard to cause excessive nitrogen concentration however high fertilization excessively promoted vegetative growth increasing leaf area and plant height reduced the group light and air permeability delayed reproductive growth and thus reduced dry matter accumulation of grains fang et al 2021 4 2 effects of different irrigation amounts and fertilizer rates on water and fertilizer efficiency improving the use efficiency of water and fertilizer through irrigation and fertilization strategy has been the continuous pursuit of agriculture today zou et al 2021 revealed that wue was higher under deficit irrigation but it can be improved by optimizing irrigation scheduling wang et al 2018 showed that excessive irrigation caused a decline in wue our study found that irrigation and fertilization had interacting effects on wue the highest wue was obtained at 90 etc and 100 etc irrigation levels in 2015 and 2016 with a mean value of 2 90 kg m 3 in 2015 and 3 29 kg m 3 in 2016 respectively this study found that wue showed an increasing and then decreasing trend when the amount of fertilizer gradually increased it was consistent with that of sun and xu sun et al 2018 xu et al 2020b the reason for this different may be that sufficient fertilizer was beneficial for the growth and development of crop canopy during spring maize growing season however excessive fertilization caused larger crop canopies and excessive transpiration resulting in the decline of wue pfp is a pivotal index to estimate the utilization efficiency of fertilizer previous studies found that reducing the amount of fertilizer can increase pfp while excessive fertilization can decrease pfp li et al 2020 wang et al 2016b our study obtained the same conclusions in addition we found that the pfp of low fertilizer treatment increased with the increase of irrigation amount while the pfp of high fertilizer treatment first increased and then decreased one possible reason was that irrigation improved the uptake of fertilizer but the excessive irrigation leached fertilizers beyond the root zone 4 3 effects of different irrigation and fertilizer regimes on soil nutrition soil environmental problems caused by excessive fertilization and irrigation have attracted increasing attentions kurtzman et al 2013 min et al 2018 in soils urea was hydrolyzed to ammonium and quickly converted to nitrate azad et al 2019 there was a quadratic relationship between soil soluble nitrogen and annual leaching loss when the rate of fertilizer applied matched the plant demand there was only a very small amount of fertilizer nitrogen in the soil at the harvest stage di and cameron 2000 jenkinson 2001 yan et al 2021 founded that no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the increasing fertilization rate our results were basically consistent with previous studies besides when fertilizer amount was higher than 120 60 60 kg ha 1 the nitrate nitrogen content in surface soils decreased when irrigation amount increased however in 2015 compared with i60 and i75 i105 increased the nitrate nitrogen content in soil layers below 40 cm by 17 54 and 33 74 respectively this indicated that the higher irrigation amount caused a higher risk of nitrogen leaching maize root system had a high nitrogen use efficiency for surface layer and soil nutrients below 60 cm were difficult to be absorbed and utilized zou et al 2017 reducing irrigation amount was an effective measure to reduce nitrogen leaching and environmental risk it has been reported that soil nitrogen residues greater than 150 kg ha 1in the 0 100 cm soil layer also reduced the response of crops to nitrogen fertilizer addition in the following year lenka et al 2013 therefore it was necessary to appropriately reduce the rate of nitrogen application to reduce soil no3 n residue when p fertilizer was applied to the soil a small part existed in the form of orthophosphates for absorption by plant roots and most of them were closely bound to the soil solid phase in the form of organophosphates frossard et al 2000 van der bom et al 2019 our results also verified this conclusion that soil available phosphorus was mainly concentrated in 0 40 cm which was not as easy to leach as no3 n however with the increasing p rate soil p residue increased therefore it was recommended to reduce the application rate of p fertilizer to maximize the use of p reserves in the soil many studies have shown that excessive application of potassium fertilizer would not only cause high soil nutrient concentration and potassium leaching loss but also lead to low utilization rate and resource waste song et al 2020 vanden nest et al 2017 potassium fertilizer was easily affected by the cation exchange process in the soil k ions in soils were easily adsorbed by clay minerals so k leaching loss was between p and no3 n bhattacharyya et al 2018 di and cameron 2004 which were similar to our results generally irrigation and fertilization had interactive effects on soil npk residues drought stress resulted in the decrease of nutrient uptake by maize plants and excessive nutrients remained in the soil ge et al 2012 on the other hand suitable irrigation amount can promote nutrient uptake and reduce residual while excessive irrigation had the risks of nutrient leaching and contamination of groundwater bodies 4 4 multi objective evaluation in our study the ahp and em were firstly employed to determine the subjective and objective weights the combined weight was then obtained by payoff function of the optimization objective eqs 21 23 therefore this study overcame some of the disadvantages of earlier studies on considering only a single weight or a simple combination of subjective and objective weight the economic effect growth effect water and fertilizer utilization and environmental benefits aspects were considered to coordinate the influence of each index on the synthetic growth of spring maize the relationships between maize comprehensive evaluation value and water fertilizer inputs were further analyzed by considering the 95 confidence interval from fig 3 there were some differences between the two years the main reason was the difference in the irrigation amount the maximum irrigation amount in 2015 was only 105 etc which produced no negative effects on maize yield and growth and excessive irrigation had not become a limiting factor however excessive water supply 120 etc in 2016 may cause the overuse of light and heat resources and delayed reproductive growth fan et al 2016 2005 furthermore the higher irrigation amount possibly reduced plant nutrient uptake by leaching nutrients in the root zone xu et al 2020a yan et al 2021 through a synthesize model based on multi level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation our study found that the multi objective synthesis level was best under irrigation amount ranging between 415 and 450 mm and fertilization rate ranging from 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o 5 conclusions irrigation and fertilization had obvious positive effects on growth indicators but appropriately reducing fertilization did not reduce maize yield and dry matter weight which significantly improved the use efficiency of water and fertilizer soil no3 n was easiest to migrate with water followed by soil k and p soil nutrient residue was directly proportional to the rate of fertilizer application and inversely proportional to the amount of irrigation higher irrigation and fertilization regimes resulted in greater no3 n leaching into the 40 120 cm soil layer according to the mfce model the maximum growth economy water and fertilizer efficiency and economic benefit of 95 can be achieved with the irrigation amount of 415 450 mm combined with the fertilization rate of 144 77 77 to 180 90 90 kg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o moreover it can save water and fertilizer and reduce the risk of groundwater pollution our study can provide a scientific management of spring maize fertilization and

9904,irrigated agriculture is the primary sector demanding water resources in the world given that improved irrigation technologies could play a crucial role in enhancing water use efficiency this paper uses causal inference estimators to evaluate the effect of these technologies on irrigators at the farm level in two irrigated valleys in central chile doubly robust estimators were employed to address the selection bias of the adoption of improved irrigation technologies the results show first a low level of technology adoption with only 18 of irrigators adopting irrigation where access to credits and education plays a crucial role in their adoption despite this low rate the estimates show consistently positive and significant impacts on adopters in terms of annual margins and land use as a result our research calls for attention towards focusing programs and policy targeting on reducing entry barriers and broadening the adoption of irrigation technologies allowing to reduce the gap in terms of economic wellbeing and the long term sustainability and adaptation to climate change of irrigated areas keywords efficient irrigation technologies causal inference doubly robust estimators irrigated agriculture central chile 1 introduction agriculture is the productive sector with the highest consumptive water use with crop irrigation representing roughly 70 of water withdrawals worldwide grafton et al 2018 siebert et al 2010 further factors such as the increasing demands for food the demographic and economic growth and predicted changes in water availability due to climate change will substantially impact agricultural systems balasubramanya and stifel 2020 manning et al 2017 the need to increase water productivity in agriculture the so called more crop per drop has been stressed as a key factor to face these challenges aiming to ensure the long term sustainability for the agricultural sector giordano et al 2019a rosegrant et al 2013 to meet growing water demands and to deal with the uncertainty and decreasing water resources improvements and technological changes at off farm e g water transport infrastructure improve irrigation system distribution and at the on farm level e g water applications adoption of efficient irrigation technologies will be required sowers et al 2011 in particular irrigation and the adoption of improved irrigation technologies have been pointed out as a strategic instrument at the on farm level from several research disciplines to enhance the sustainability of irrigation and of water resources namara et al 2007 perry et al 2017 such improvements pinpoint a multiplicity of benefits such as water saving resource use efficiency improvements in farmers welfare poverty reduction among others berbel et al 2019 dillon 2011b giordano et al 2019b hussain 2007 levidow et al 2014 mwangi and crewett 2019 perry et al 2017 lately irrigation is considered as a strategy for adaptation to climate change deressa et al 2009 as well as an approach to contribute to food security and nutrition improvements balana et al 2020 burney et al 2010 the high rate of consumption of water by agriculture as well as the plethora of benefits conferred to irrigation has triggered a substantial body of literature dedicated to the adoption of irrigation technologies aiming to explain the drivers and hindering factors affecting such adoption adeoti 2008 alcon et al 2011 caswell and zilberman 1985 zhang et al 2019 these studies have identified that social natural and financial capital as well as environmental factors influence farmers adoption decisions the second strand of research refers to the examination of the impacts of irrigation itself either assessing impacts of infrastructure provision e g small reservoirs dams or conveyance systems or the use of improved technologies for the first there is a recent body of research employing different quasi experimental designs evaluating the rainfed versus irrigation dichotomy these research have reported for instance that small scale irrigation projects have a more significant impact on agricultural production and income than large scale schemes with the latter having a higher effect on consumption dillon 2011a in income overall expenditure asset accumulation and expenditures on agricultural inputs zeweld et al 2015 likewise differences in crop yields and diversification garbero and songsermsawas 2018 and vulnerability reduction to droughts for households located downstream of the dams duflo and pande 2007 takeshima 2018 have been also reported nonetheless a different question arises within an irrigation system corresponding to the differential effect between traditional and improved irrigation methods even though the benefits of modern irrigation technologies have been described for instance by narayanamoorthy et al 2018 and mupaso et al 2014 and borrego marín and berbel 2019 employing a partial budget technique and cost benefit analysis respectively reported that modern irrigation systems are economically superior to traditional methods however those studies lack a strong identification strategy for estimating the effect of such technologies accordingly the primary aim of this article is to estimate the impact of the adoption of on farm efficient irrigation technologies such as drip or sprinklers methods eis henceforth in doing so an empirical comparison of eis adopters with irrigators watering their farms by traditional methods non adopters is conducted methodologically we base our empirical approach on the potential outcome framework rosenbaum and rubin 1983 complementing the emerging body of research employing rigorous counterfactual based strategies to evaluate the impact of projects and technologies in agriculture reducing potential problems of selection bias garbero and songsermsawas 2018 haile et al 2017 takeshima et al 2020 tambo and mockshell 2018 we do so based on a sample of irrigators drawn from two irrigated schemes in central chile in terms of irrigation the country counts with 1 million hectares under several irrigation methods with efficient irrigation technologies being a central component of the agricultural policy during the past 4 decades martin and saavedra 2018 we expect the results to be useful for farmers policymakers and researchers by providing robust quantitative empirical evidence on the impact of eis at the farm level the rest of this article organizes as follows section 2 describes the data and study area and characteristics for irrigators adopting eis and non adopters section 3 presents the econometric strategy to estimate the treatment effects using non experimental data section 4 displays the estimates of the impacts of eis on our interest variables between both types of irrigators finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 data and methods 2 1 study area overview and data collection the analysis is carried out with 2 water user

july as the rainiest and coldest months in contrast january february and december are the driest and warmest months with average temperatures of approximately 18 c agrimed 2017 this condition determines a negative balance between annual evaporation and total precipitation indicating the need for irrigation to meet crop water demands meza et al 2012 besides since 2014 this imbalance is compensated with a header reservoir of 78 3 hm3 capacity allowing the storage and distribution of water rights throughout the irrigation season reducing water supply uncertainty in terms of agricultural production this part of chile is appropriate for a multiplicity of crops in the region cash crops coexist with self consumption agriculture with a wide range of farm sizes specifically

2 wua located in central chile we analyze the effect of irrigation technologies on a series of variables at the farm level based on self reported values one set of interest variables comprises outcomes such as net margin per hectare the farm net margins and input usage we work with margins instead of productivity outcomes yields because of the existing variety of crops in the area and as producers are profit maximizers net margins is the relevant impact variable when working with margins we also assume that farmers are price takers as the information was gathered in chilean pesos clp an exchange rate of 1 usd 821 5 clp was applied updated on 30 of june of 2020 on the other hand we measure the impact on the irrigated area in two ways the first in absolute terms that is the total hectares under irrigation and secondly in relative terms to the entire area of the property being a fractional response variable bounded between 0 and 1 the literature on technology adoption reveals that farmers apply technologies based on a combination of factors such as profitability foster and rosenzweig 2010 green et al 1996 or production goals skills knowledge and regulatory constraints among others ma et al 2018 water savings or irrigated area expansion can contribute to the farmer s decision to use a determined eis regarding this if farmers randomly adopt eis then the causal effect of technology adoption is assessed as the average difference between adopters and non adopters of this technology for any particular outcome cerulli 2015 however in our sample the assignment of eis among irrigators is not randomized instead irrigators decide the adoption depending on observed and unobservable characteristics as a result adopters of eis may differ from non adopters in some aspects such as their expectations and perceptions that could determine whether and which type of innovations they adopt and their realization of the potential benefits associated with those innovations haile et al 2017 thus the issue of self selection may emerge when estimating the effect of eis needing to be addressed in order to determine the impact of irrigation technology adoption on our outcomes of interest given the nature of this study a non experimental observational study we employ a quasi experimental design to estimate the impact of irrigation technologies in order to deal with selection bias and confounding cerulli 2015 wooldridge 2010 particularly we are interested in assessing the average treatment effect ate which is equal to the average difference between two potential outcomes each interest variable for adopters of eis and non adopters in doing so we employ and rely on the potential outcome framework rosenbaum and rubin 1983 rubin 2005 formally for an individual i i 1 2 n d i is the indicator of treatment with d 1 if individual i employs eis and d 0 otherwise which is assumed to affect an outcome variable y and x is a set of observed covariates that could affect the outcome confounding thus y i1 is the outcome that we would observe if unit i had received treatment and y i0 is the outcome that we would observe if unit i had not received treatment rosenbaum and rubin 1983 therefore the average treatment effect in the presence of confounding is determined as 1 a t e x e y i 1 y i 0 x 2 ate x e y x d 1 e y x d 0 in addition to estimating ate between adopters and non adopters we aim to assess the average treatment effect on the untreated atut atut is the treatment effect for those who did not receive the treatment eq 4 calculated for the subsample of non treated units cerulli 2015 atut estimates may provide insightful information on the causal relationship between our interest outcomes and eis adoption which may be sensitive to public irrigation policies or programs 3 atet x e y 1 y 0 d 1 x 4 atut x e y 1 y 0 d 0 x when estimating treatment effects 2 identification assumptions need to be addressed the first is the conditional independence assumption cia also known as selection on observables or unconfoundedness which means that the set of variables that affect both treatment assignment and treatment specific outcomes are observable once controlling for that the dependence between treatment assignment and treatment specific outcomes is removed cerulli 2015 haile et al 2017 formally this assumption formalizes as 5 y it d it x i wit h t 0 1 where symbolizes the independence between an outcome variable y it and the treatment variable d conditional on a set of covariates x the second identification assumption is the overlap condition overlap indicates that for every x there is a positive probability of being in the treatment group and the control group eq 6 cerulli 2015 haile et al 2017 linden et al 2016 6 0 p d i x i 1 when the two assumptions hold it is possible to estimate the average treatment effects of eis on our set of outcomes to do so we employ two methods based on the selection on observables namely the inverse probability weighting regression adjustment ipwra and the augmented inverse probability weighting aipw 6 6 the estimations were made using the teffects ipwra and aipw estimation commands ipwra allows to estimate both ate atet and atut while ipwa estimates only ate statacorp 2019 stata 16 base reference manual college station tx the ipwra and aipw estimators model both the outcome and treatment to account for the aforementioned non random assignment estimating unbiased treatment effects in the presence of confounding wooldridge 2010 they belong to the family of doubly robust estimators which combine a form of outcome regression with a model for the treatment to estimate the causal effect of an exposure treatment on an outcome funk et al 2011 the doubly robust property means that the treatment effect is consistently estimated if one model either the outcome model or the treatment is miss specified while the other model is correctly specified linden et al 2016 tan 2010 wooldridge 2010 because it is not always possible to know which model is correctly specified doubly robust estimators are recommendable providing an extra opportunity to achieve specification linden et al 2016 to select the set of variables to be considered as predictors and potential confounders employed in both the treatment and the outcome equations we rely on economic theory and the body of literature on technology adoption in agriculture and the impacts of irrigation alcon et al 2011 caswell and zilberman 1985 engler et al 2016 garbero and songsermsawas 2018 green et al 1996 in particular we control directly for observable household level characteristics physical capital and contextual infrastructure attributes that might be correlated with the farmers decision to implement an efficient irrigation system eis furthermore both methods have been increasingly applied in different fields of agricultural research cunguara and darnhofer 2011 ma et al 2018 mullally and chakravarty 2018 takeshima et al 2020 tambo and mockshell 2018 ipwra and aipw employ inverse probability weights w to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects austin and stuart 2015 both methods require first to specify a participation regression model binary in this case which allows us to estimate the propensity score p to then determine a regression model for the outcome variable specifically the p obtained from the decision model serves to compute the w s as follows w d p 1 d 1 p where d corresponds to the treatment assignment d 1 denotes treatment and d 0 indicates non treatment austin and stuart 2015 as a result each individual receives a weight w which is the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that an individual received the goal of weighting is that the sample reflects the population creating counterfactuals where they are not observed in the data thus the method gives larger weights to the individuals who are underrepresented in the sample and a lower weight to those who are over represented finally the mean outcomes of adopters and non adopters are estimated the main difference between both estimators is how they use the w on one hand ipwra estimators use the w in a weighted regression coefficients to compute averages of treatment predicted outcomes for adopter and non adopters of eis kebebe 2017 statacorp 2019 tambo and mockshell 2018 formally the ate is estimated as follows 7 a te ˆ iprwa 1 n 1 n m 1 x i m 0 x i on the other hand aipw runs regression functions for the outcome variable one for the treatment and one for the control group it then uses the weights to compute the potential outcome means the aipw incorporates an augmentation term in the inverse probability weighting estimator allowing the treatment effect estimator to remain consistent if the participation model is miss specified however if it is correctly specified the augmentation term goes to zero linden et al 2016 8 ate ˆ aipw 1 n i 1 n y i d it t i p t x i d it t i p t x i p t x i m t x i where y i is the outcome variable d it t i is the indicator of receiving the treatment t for individual i p corresponds to the estimated propensities scores and m t x i is the regression b ot x i b 1 t in the case of ate ipwra m t x i are regression coefficients weighted by w as described above nonetheless before estimating the causal effect it is necessary to check the balance between the treated and non treated units austin and stuart 2015 the covariate balance is an essential criterion to help ensure the validity of the treatment effects estimations linden et al 2016 to test the quality of balancing in our sample after weighting we use quantitative and qualitative methods quantitatively we check the balance based on the standardized difference in means and proportions smd calculated as x t x c s t 2 s c 2 2 where x t and s t 2 are the average and the standard deviation for the treatment status respectively of individual i which is not influenced by the sample size and variance ratios and graphs for the baseline covariates moreover we employ graphical methods to qualitatively compare both groups austin 2009 austin and stuart 2015 stuart 2010 one issue when employing methods based on weighting is the susceptibility to large w this situation arises with very low p for the treated units or p close to 1 case of non treated recommendations to address this potential problem is to use trimming or truncated weights austin and stuart 2015 therefore we applied a trimming procedure to limit farmers for subsequent analyses to those with p 0 025 percentile 0 975 and p 0 05 percentile 0 95 7 7 the loss in the sample size hinders us from applying a more intensive trimming in terms of the propensity score austin and stuart 2015 takeshima et al 2020 although we are aware of the loss of sample size and analytical power this procedure allows us to test the consistency of our results 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics summary statistics for a series of farmer characteristics socio economic natural capital contextual characteristics and comparisons between both groups eis adopters and non eis adopters are presented in table 1 8 8 table s1 in supplementary material provides the definition and descriptive statistics for this set of variables according to the figures we first observe a low level of adoption of eis by farmers in both wua with only 60 farmers 18 belonging to the treatment group this relatively low level of adoption is below the national average of approximately 27 fao 2016 and in other mediterranean countries alcon et al 2019 eis adopters tend to be less aged and more educated but less experienced in farming in terms of socio economic characteristics furthermore they access credits in a higher proportion as well as access technical support public or private despite that other on farm technologies infrastructure technologies such as wells and on farm ponds and water management techniques irrigation scheduling or programming tools are not well spread in the area eis adopters implement more irrigation technologies 0 53 vs 0 14 in this regard jordán and speelman 2020 identify 2 technological groups with one small group comprising moderate to intensive users 12 of farmers while the second comprises the majority of not adopters most of them restricted in natural capital and facing financial barriers 88 additionally an adopter of eis grows more diversified products and a majority of them are devoted to fruit production conversely non adopters are more likely to cultivate annual crops regarding natural resources eis users own both more land 33 vs 7 4 ha and water rights 54 4 vs 16 l s 1 however when estimating the quotient between water per unit of area l s 1 ha 1 non adopters have more water availability we found no differences between eis adopters and non adopters concerning their water withdrawal system and holding a water community reservoir 24 when considering the contextual or infrastructure characteristics despite this difference and the fact that data was collected in a dry year even then 88 of farmers state that they could fully irrigate their crops with no significant difference between adopters and non adopters 92 vs 87 on the other hand table 1 shows differences in terms of accessibility to water with eis adopters having a more positive perception concerning access to water than non adopters finally for our set of outcome variables there are statistical differences for each of them when comparing adopters and non adopters the average margin per hectare is approximately usd 2 472 with adopters earning more than non adopters 6 792 vs 1 529 there is also a considerable difference between both groups regarding farm margin 15 45 vs 222 7 musd further adopters tend to spend more resources on inputs 4 695 vs 1 840 finally in terms of land use adopters tend to irrigate more in absolute 33 vs 7 ha and relative terms 85 vs 71 3 2 determinants of adoption of eis and covariate balancing as a first step to estimate the impact of eis table 2 reports the results for the treatment model adoption of eis used to determine the weights w and the subsequent treatment effects in our model the list of relevant covariates that are assumed to influence the adoption of eis are age education agricultural experience access to credits farm ownership type of water withdrawal annual fees water rights farm size accessibility and the belonging water user association it is important to remark that our primary goal is to achieve a good balance across the set of covariates rather than to explain the drivers affecting farmers eis adoption decisions 9 9 for a more detailed discussion of drivers influencing irrigation technologies in the study area see jordán c speelman s 2020 on farm adoption of irrigation technologies in two irrigated valleys in central chile the effect of relative abundance of water resources agricultural water management 236 106147 therefore to guarantee the balance between both groups we did not consider the full set of available covariates described in table 1 the adoption model depicts the factors influencing the adoption of eis table 2 shows that education access to credits farm ownership and accessibility increase the probability of adopting eis from these variables access to credits and farm ownership are the significant drivers for technology adoption increasing the chances up to 16 and 12 respectively according to their marginal effects access to credits is often found as a key factor for technology adoption and adaptation settings deressa et al 2009 di falco et al 2011 jara rojas et al 2012 education is also a critical factor influencing the likelihood of technology adoption in irrigation bjornlund et al 2009 dillon 2011b as well as other agricultural research fields such as the adoption of rice certified seeds mariano et al 2012 and precision agriculture isgin et al 2008 accessibility to water is a self reported statement indicating how difficult it is for an irrigator to access water potential sources of hardships in accessing water may be the location within either the irrigation system or the canal secondary or tertiary level inappropriate or lack of infrastructure at the water intake point with the set of covariates included in the first stage we proceed first to estimate the propensity scores and then to balance and estimate the weights w table 3 presents the covariate balancing resulting from employing the inverse probability weighting method when comparing the smd for the raw data and the weighted sample it is noticeable the reduction in differences between the adopters and non adopters the smd for each variable is clearly reduced with all the differences below 0 1 9 out 11 variables hold an smd lower than 0 05 ranging between 0 057 and 0 04 also nearly each variance ratio is over 0 75 resulting in appropriate sample weighting and balancing properties austin 2009 stuart et al 2013 complementary graphs for the balance checking can be found in the supplemental material 3 3 impact of efficient irrigation technologies this section presents the estimates for the impact of eis on the targeted outcomes as aforementioned doubly robust estimators ipwra and aipw were employed for the empirical analysis as was previously stated the advantage of using a doubly robust estimator is that the treatment parameter of interest can still be consistently estimated in the situation where one model is miss specified as long as the other is correctly specified all our outcome variables are in natural logs except the share of irrigated land therefore alongside reporting the estimates for the treatment effects in a logarithmic scale to investigate the difference in the treatment effect estimates we also calculated the exponential values of the pairwise differences of the potential outcomes between treated and non treated that is 100 exp treatment 1 in addition we present the results in monetary terms table 4 summarizes the treatment effect estimates for our two estimators specified for the full set of variables overall the results indicate significant effects of adopting eis technologies for both methods in terms of statistical significance with a slight difference in their magnitudes a general comparison of the results of aipw and ipwra estimators confirms the consistency in our ate estimates verifying the fact that eis is a valuable technology specifically when analyzing the results we found the following for the margin per hectare results report that efficient irrigation technologies enable irrigators to obtain a positive and significant impact 5 significance for both methods the ate is between 0 42 and 0 45 determining differences of about 51 57 in the net margin per hectare for both groups in monetary terms this effect translates to differences in 1 640 to 1 830 usd ha 1 for aipw and ipwra respectively in addition the estimates for atet and atut are both significant at 1 and 5 with the former having a higher effect table 4 this result suggests that net margin per hectare grows more when we use those who have already adopted as a reference instead of employing non adopters as a target group 92 vs 51 respectively second our estimates also determined a positive and significant average effect of eis on total net margin farmers who employ eis obtain on average a remarkable average difference of 4 5 times on this variable which in turn translates into an increase in the range of usd 32 976 35 000 our additional estimates atet and atut also present significant effects at 1 and 10 with a more substantial effect on the current adopters than the potential impact of eis when taking as reference their non adopters counterparts in terms of levels the results are 7 8 vs 3 8 times respectively in terms of input usage we find that irrigators employing eis have higher use of inputs 5 significant level on average eis presents a difference between 0 35 and 0 37 implying an increase in 42 45 on the annual agricultural costs per hectare this difference translates into a range between 550 and 608 usdha 1 again the results of the supplementary estimates detect a larger effect on the adopters than non adopters taking the adopters as a reference the average cost effect increases by 68 which reduces to a potential 40 increase for non adopters if they adopt eis technologies although eis technologies are less labor intensive technologies than traditional irrigation i e flooded and furrow irrigation our results at first glance are contrary some possible explanations are that eis demands a considerable initial investment with respect to traditional methods frisvold et al 2018 and increasing maintenance costs sanchis ibor et al 2016 another fact that may contribute to a higher input usage is the switch to more profitable crops demanding more labor and inputs use such as fruit trees with respect to the impact on land use on the one hand we found that for the variable total irrigated land the ate is 0 53 and 0 60 5 and 10 significant respectively these results in absolute values indicate that eis enables adopters to irrigate on average between 2 2 and 2 6 more hectares than the non adopters the average effect based on the non treated displays a significant effect at 10 0 50 but lesser than the effect on those already employing eis 0574 at 1 further this effect is slightly higher than ate with a percentage increase of 2 on the other hand when analyzing the impact of eis on the percentage of irrigated land the results for ate show a significant effect for both estimators the ate moves between 10 6 and 11 4 at 5 of significance with non adopters irrigating roughly 72 whereas adopters irrigate on average about 82 84 of their farms thus on average eis technologies enable farmers to irrigate 15 more area regarding our additional estimates and likewise to the rest of the variables we found that atut is slightly higher 10 4 vs 9 5 than atet but non significant with just the already adopters potentially increasing their irrigated area 3 4 robustness check to validate the consistency of the results we applied a robustness check based on trimming thus 18 and 35 observations representing the extreme tails at 5 below 0 025 and above 0 975 and 10 below 0 05 and above 0 95 were removed from the sample as trimming reduces and generates a new dataset determining a new set of p and w the balance check needs to be reassessed tables 3 and 4 in the supplemental material contain the balancing properties of the reduced sample depicting an adequate balance for the pseudo population of adopters and non adopters table 5 illustrates the results for ate for the full set of outcomes after trimming after removing the tails the results still show positive and significant differences between adopters and non adopters of eis for the complete set of outcomes with slight differences respecting those obtained for the whole sample however we detected large reductions in ate for the total irrigated land and total margin in terms of the effect on the untreated in general we found a smaller effect when comparing with the effect on the treated and particularly we did not find evidence of significant effects on the two land variables for 5 and 10 trimming and on input usage for 10 trimming atet and atut estimations are presented in table 5 in the supplemental material overall the results can be described in different ways firstly this research quantitatively confirms some of the potential benefits of irrigation technologies at the farm level documented by several research fields such as agricultural economics agronomy or water management levidow et al 2014 taylor and zilberman 2017 specifically the difference in ate between traditional and eis systems effects might be explained by two components the first corresponds to the higher net margins per unit of land captured by the margin per hectare suggesting that adopters make more efficient use of their resources the second is related to the increase in profits given differences in irrigated land into production reflected by the variables total margin total irrigated land and percentage of irrigated land both components entail either more productive or a shift towards more profitable crops which usually occurs when adopting this type of technology borrego marín and berbel 2019 taylor and zilberman 2017 secondly and differently from the increasing research revealing the significant and valuable effects access to of irrigation to achieve better results at the farm level dillon 2011a garbero and songsermsawas 2018 takeshima 2018 our study goes a step further by focusing and analyzing the effect of eis technologies a decision made when water is available in this manner we complement research assessing the value of efficient irrigation technologies but with different empirical strategies such as the studies of borrego marín and berbel 2019 and mupaso et al 2014 determining the superiority of modern irrigation systems by a cost benefit analysis approach the significant effect in the outcome variables are interesting from an agricultural and irrigation policy perspective especially for countries who have opted to invest in this type of technology targeting modernization efficiency water resources usage or the expansion of irrigation land through subsidies birkenholtz 2017 molle and sanchis ibor 2019 taylor and zilberman 2017 becoming relevant due to the still relatively low agricultural land irrigated under this kind of systems alcon et al 2019 however results have to be viewed with caution as they are based on one agricultural season analyses based on more extended and more heterogeneous data series would allow exploring more in detail the dynamics and trends of adoption and the outcome variables regarding the climatic and hydrologic conditions in contrast with the positive and significant effects of eis adoption from a profit maximization point of view our results also suggest that improvements in the technical efficiency at the field level do not reduce water consumption although this is not the main focus of this article this finding seems to support the presence of the so called rebound effect or efficiency paradox grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 this paradox has become critical for irrigation water management especially because governments have widely encouraged irrigation modernization mainly through subsidies rey et al 2019 given the consequences of the rebound effect some scholars e g berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 pérez blanco et al 2020 have identified conditions by which rebound effects might be reduced or avoided such as constraining the expansion of agricultural land or the complementary between technologies and policies in this regard chilean farmers face no constraints for agricultural expansion and the water policy framework allocates water through water rights to any requesting agent free of charge with complete and perpetual ownership of the requested water right vergara and rivera 2018 both lack of policy regulations do not create incentives for reducing water withdrawals and consumption leaving room for the use of water savings and the subsequent increase in irrigated area moreover the modernization subsidy programs in chile are designed to favor projects showing more significant increases in irrigated land martin and saavedra 2018 as aforementioned the observational nature of the study does not allow us to extrapolate our findings as to the impact on water savings of the chilean irrigation modernization programs furthermore although the positive and significant impacts of eis on farm profitability would confirm the potential success of this approach our findings on agricultural expansion also warn policymakers that it is crucial to reflect on water conservation targeting when designing such programs 4 conclusions in response to critical challenges such as increasing demographic and economic growth and the demand for food as well as with the aim of improved water resources use in agriculture the promotion of improved irrigation technologies has been emphasized in many parts of the world irrigation technologies are said to bring an ample range of benefits from productivity water use efficiency poverty reduction food security to crucial role for future agricultural adaptation in water scarce areas this research contributes to the literature of irrigation technology adoption estimating and examining the impact of improved irrigation systems on farm level economics and land use variables for a sample of irrigators belonging to 2 irrigated valleys of central chile for one moderately dry agricultural year specifically we estimated the effect of modern irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinklers systems by contrasting with traditional irrigation methods such as flooding and furrow on a series of outcomes namely net annual margin total annual income annual inputs usage total irrigated land and the percentage of the irrigated land to capture the effect of those technologies and deal with selection bias and confounding we employed two estimators based on observables with doubly robust properties the iprwa and the aipw our results report empirical evidence to some of those impacts assigned to irrigation but not sufficiently investigated in the scholarly literature our findings describe first that despite the considerable time supporting the adoption of improved irrigation technologies in the country the use of such technologies in the study area is low only 18 of sampled farmers have adopted them the main drivers of adoption are education land ownership a good perception of accessibility to their water rights and access to credits with the latter as the more critical factor increasing hindering such adoption furthermore we report novel findings on the impact of these technologies by employing a causal effect approach after controlling for confounding and selection bias the results show positive and significant average effects with technology adopters consistently obtaining better results than their non adopter counterparts for the set of the outcome variables besides the impact on the treated outperforms the effect on the untreated though non adopters also benefit from irrigation technologies although our analysis and conclusions are based merely on one agricultural season we can draw some policy implications first authorities should deploy efforts reducing entry barriers facilitating and broadening the access to these technologies as well as reducing access to credit constraints making the initial investment affordable for the majority of farmers leaving no one behind notwithstanding the low adoption rate this is warranted by the fact that farmers employing irrigation technologies are better off than non adopters and by the lower but significant impact found on the untreated increasing farmers participation in irrigation programs needs to be strengthened to increase adoption rates allowing irrigators to achieve the economic benefits of irrigation technologies and increase resiliency to climate variability and climate change further not only support and promotion to adopt technology at the on farm level is required but also improvements at the level of off farm and water intake points second given the magnitude of the reported results investments in efficient irrigation technologies via subsidization may be an appropriate governmental policy to increase farmers income and land use however as the irrigation literature points out efficient irrigation systems are beneficial at the individual level but could be detrimental at the basin level hence reconciling both benefits at the farm level but not neglecting the long term sustainability of water resources is the challenge this is particularly the case of countries like chile where the primary goal of the irrigation subsidy policy still is to expand irrigated area through the improvement of farm level irrigation efficiency finally it is noteworthy to point out some limitations of this article as was aforementioned the study relies on data of a particular agricultural season cross sectional data limiting the analysis of the adoption over time evaluating the effects trends of particular years and the control of unobserved differences between adopters and non adopters furthermore the evidence presented restricts to particular conditions two irrigated valleys benefited by a head reservoir with relatively abundant resources with a clear focus on the farm and economics impact level with no measures in terms of the water saving potential or third party effects additionally we have not considered the impact of complementary technologies infrastructure or management tools e g irrigation scheduling likewise intended for better use of water resources and the potential impact positive and negative of modernization subsidy programs hence we acknowledge the need for broadening further research towards irrigation systems with different environmental and institutional conditions capturing the different characteristics mentioned above and allowing first to confirm our findings and then to achieve a more comprehensive picture regarding the chilean irrigated

9904,irrigated agriculture is the primary sector demanding water resources in the world given that improved irrigation technologies could play a crucial role in enhancing water use efficiency this paper uses causal inference estimators to evaluate the effect of these technologies on irrigators at the farm level in two irrigated valleys in central chile doubly robust estimators were employed to address the selection bias of the adoption of improved irrigation technologies the results show first a low level of technology adoption with only 18 of irrigators adopting irrigation where access to credits and education plays a crucial role in their adoption despite this low rate the estimates show consistently positive and significant impacts on adopters in terms of annual margins and land use as a result our research calls for attention towards focusing programs and policy targeting on reducing entry barriers and broadening the adoption of irrigation technologies allowing to reduce the gap in terms of economic wellbeing and the long term sustainability and adaptation to climate change of irrigated areas keywords efficient irrigation technologies causal inference doubly robust estimators irrigated agriculture central chile 1 introduction agriculture is the productive sector with the highest consumptive water use with crop irrigation representing roughly 70 of water withdrawals worldwide grafton et al 2018 siebert et al 2010 further factors such as the increasing demands for food the demographic and economic growth and predicted changes in water availability due to climate change will substantially impact agricultural systems balasubramanya and stifel 2020 manning et al 2017 the need to increase water productivity in agriculture the so called more crop per drop has been stressed as a key factor to face these challenges aiming to ensure the long term sustainability for the agricultural sector giordano et al 2019a rosegrant et al 2013 to meet growing water demands and to deal with the uncertainty and decreasing water resources improvements and technological changes at off farm e g water transport infrastructure improve irrigation system distribution and at the on farm level e g water applications adoption of efficient irrigation technologies will be required sowers et al 2011 in particular irrigation and the adoption of improved irrigation technologies have been pointed out as a strategic instrument at the on farm level from several research disciplines to enhance the sustainability of irrigation and of water resources namara et al 2007 perry et al 2017 such improvements pinpoint a multiplicity of benefits such as water saving resource use efficiency improvements in farmers welfare poverty reduction among others berbel et al 2019 dillon 2011b giordano et al 2019b hussain 2007 levidow et al 2014 mwangi and crewett 2019 perry et al 2017 lately irrigation is considered as a strategy for adaptation to climate change deressa et al 2009 as well as an approach to contribute to food security and nutrition improvements balana et al 2020 burney et al 2010 the high rate of consumption of water by agriculture as well as the plethora of benefits conferred to irrigation has triggered a substantial body of literature dedicated to the adoption of irrigation technologies aiming to explain the drivers and hindering factors affecting such adoption adeoti 2008 alcon et al 2011 caswell and zilberman 1985 zhang et al 2019 these studies have identified that social natural and financial capital as well as environmental factors influence farmers adoption decisions the second strand of research refers to the examination of the impacts of irrigation itself either assessing impacts of infrastructure provision e g small reservoirs dams or conveyance systems or the use of improved technologies for the first there is a recent body of research employing different quasi experimental designs evaluating the rainfed versus irrigation dichotomy these research have reported for instance that small scale irrigation projects have a more significant impact on agricultural production and income than large scale schemes with the latter having a higher effect on consumption dillon 2011a in income overall expenditure asset accumulation and expenditures on agricultural inputs zeweld et al 2015 likewise differences in crop yields and diversification garbero and songsermsawas 2018 and vulnerability reduction to droughts for households located downstream of the dams duflo and pande 2007 takeshima 2018 have been also reported nonetheless a different question arises within an irrigation system corresponding to the differential effect between traditional and improved irrigation methods even though the benefits of modern irrigation technologies have been described for instance by narayanamoorthy et al 2018 and mupaso et al 2014 and borrego marín and berbel 2019 employing a partial budget technique and cost benefit analysis respectively reported that modern irrigation systems are economically superior to traditional methods however those studies lack a strong identification strategy for estimating the effect of such technologies accordingly the primary aim of this article is to estimate the impact of the adoption of on farm efficient irrigation technologies such as drip or sprinklers methods eis henceforth in doing so an empirical comparison of eis adopters with irrigators watering their farms by traditional methods non adopters is conducted methodologically we base our empirical approach on the potential outcome framework rosenbaum and rubin 1983 complementing the emerging body of research employing rigorous counterfactual based strategies to evaluate the impact of projects and technologies in agriculture reducing potential problems of selection bias garbero and songsermsawas 2018 haile et al 2017 takeshima et al 2020 tambo and mockshell 2018 we do so based on a sample of irrigators drawn from two irrigated schemes in central chile in terms of irrigation the country counts with 1 million hectares under several irrigation methods with efficient irrigation technologies being a central component of the agricultural policy during the past 4 decades martin and saavedra 2018 we expect the results to be useful for farmers policymakers and researchers by providing robust quantitative empirical evidence on the impact of eis at the farm level the rest of this article organizes as follows section 2 describes the data and study area and characteristics for irrigators adopting eis and non adopters section 3 presents the econometric strategy to estimate the treatment effects using non experimental data section 4 displays the estimates of the impacts of eis on our interest variables between both types of irrigators finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 data and methods 2 1 study area overview and data collection the analysis is carried out with 2 water user associations wua 4 4 for irrigation water management the chilean water code wc81 states that owners of water rights are responsible for its management through three levels of organization at natural sources level management is done by the junta de vigilancia vigilance committees jv for artificial sources irrigators gather either in comunidades de agua water communities wc or asociacion de canalistas canal users associations ca ancoa and achibueno belonging to the maule river basin in central chile fig 1 under each wua there are a series of autonomous water communities wc in this case 31 wc s are part of ancoa holding 7 418 0 l s 1 providing water to circa 10 000 ha cnr 2013 on the other hand 22 wc s are under the achibueno umbrella administrating 20 767 2 l s 1 and irrigating 25 000 ha cnr 2013 a mediterranean climate characterizes the area with a heterogeneous and uneven water availability throughout the year the region receives on average 870 mm of rainfall with june and july as the rainiest and coldest months in contrast january february and december are the driest and warmest months with average temperatures of approximately 18 c agrimed 2017 this condition determines a negative balance between annual evaporation and total precipitation indicating the need for irrigation to meet crop water demands meza et al 2012 besides since 2014 this imbalance is compensated with a header reservoir of 78 3 hm3 capacity allowing the storage and distribution of water rights throughout the irrigation season reducing water supply uncertainty in terms of agricultural production this part of chile is appropriate for a multiplicity of crops in the region cash crops coexist with self consumption agriculture with a wide range of farm sizes specifically corn rice blueberries raspberries as well as perennials such as apple and cherry trees are the main crops cultivated fernández et al 2019 data were collected throughout the agricultural season 2018 19 rainfall in the year 2018 amounted to 649 mm direccion general de aguas 2018 25 below the long term average the year was part of the most extensive drought period hitting central chile from 2010 to 2018 garreaud et al 2019 we surveyed 335 irrigators who are members of 26 wc from both wuas the sampling method was a stratified sampling centered on water rights wr 5 5 in the 1981 water code water is declared an economic good fully separated from the land wc81 also defines private and permanent property rights over water wr allowing the free transferability of this resource vergara a rivera d 2018 legal and institutional framework of water resources in donoso g ed water policy in chile springer international publishing cham pp 67 85 in which farmers were randomly selected from their wc according to their weights in the respective wua in practice first farmers were divided into two groups wua according to the number of individuals of each wua afterward irrigators of the main canals of each wua were selected through a proportional sampling keeping the weight of each canal in the area we gathered the information for the whole spectrum of farms in the area being a member of a wc as the sole selection requirement the survey covered a series of topics such as socioeconomics agricultural production physical capital land size wr access to water resources irrigation technologies practices and crops and some physical and contextual characteristics of the canals in addition to characterize farmers context and environment within each canal self reported data on their location and physical infrastructure characteristics were also gathered 2 2 methods as it was formerly said this paper focuses on the impact of eis adoption drip sprinklers technologies on farmers belonging to 2 wua located in central chile we analyze the effect of irrigation technologies on a series of variables at the farm level based on self reported values one set of interest variables comprises outcomes such as net margin per hectare the farm net margins and input usage we work with margins instead of productivity outcomes yields because of the existing variety of crops in the area and as producers are profit maximizers net margins is the relevant impact variable when working with margins we also assume that farmers are price takers as the information was gathered in chilean pesos clp an exchange rate of 1 usd 821 5 clp was applied updated on 30 of june of 2020 on the other hand we measure the impact on the irrigated area in two ways the first in absolute terms that is the total hectares under irrigation and secondly in relative terms to the entire area of the property being a fractional response variable bounded between 0 and 1 the literature on technology adoption reveals that farmers apply technologies based on a combination of factors such as profitability foster and rosenzweig 2010 green et al 1996 or production goals skills knowledge and regulatory constraints among others ma et al 2018 water savings or irrigated area expansion can contribute to the farmer s decision to use a determined eis regarding this if farmers randomly adopt eis then the causal effect of technology adoption is assessed as the average difference between adopters and non adopters of this technology for any particular outcome cerulli 2015 however in our sample the assignment of eis among irrigators is not randomized instead irrigators decide the adoption depending on observed and unobservable characteristics as a result adopters of eis may differ from non adopters in some aspects such as their expectations and perceptions that could determine whether and which type of innovations they adopt and their realization of the potential benefits associated with those innovations haile et al 2017 thus the issue of self selection may emerge when estimating the effect of eis needing to be addressed in order to determine the impact of irrigation technology adoption on our outcomes of interest given the nature of this study a non experimental observational study we employ a quasi experimental design to estimate the impact of irrigation technologies in order to deal with selection bias and confounding cerulli 2015 wooldridge 2010 particularly we are interested in assessing the average treatment effect ate which is equal to the average difference between two potential outcomes each interest variable for adopters of eis and non adopters in doing so we employ and rely on the potential outcome framework rosenbaum and rubin 1983 rubin 2005 formally for an individual i i 1 2 n d i is the indicator of treatment with d 1 if individual i employs eis and d 0 otherwise which is assumed to affect an outcome variable y and x is a set of observed covariates that could affect the outcome confounding thus y i1 is the outcome that we would observe if unit i had received treatment and y i0 is the outcome that we would observe if unit i had not received treatment rosenbaum and rubin 1983 therefore the average treatment effect in the presence of confounding is determined as 1 a t e x e y i 1 y i 0 x 2 ate x e y x d 1 e y x d 0 in addition to estimating ate between adopters and non adopters we aim to assess the average treatment effect on the untreated atut atut is the treatment effect for those who did not receive the treatment eq 4 calculated for the subsample of non treated units cerulli 2015 atut estimates may provide insightful information on the causal relationship between our interest outcomes and eis adoption which may be sensitive to public irrigation policies or programs 3 atet x e y 1 y 0 d 1 x 4 atut x e y 1 y 0 d 0 x when estimating treatment effects 2 identification assumptions need to be addressed the first is the conditional independence assumption cia also known as selection on observables or unconfoundedness which means that the set of variables that affect both treatment assignment and treatment specific outcomes are observable once controlling for that the dependence between treatment assignment and treatment specific outcomes is removed cerulli 2015 haile et al 2017 formally this assumption formalizes as 5 y it d it x i wit h t 0 1 where symbolizes the independence between an outcome variable y it and the treatment variable d conditional on a set of covariates x the second identification assumption is the overlap condition overlap indicates that for every x there is a positive probability of being in the treatment group and the control group eq 6 cerulli 2015 haile et al 2017 linden et al 2016 6 0 p d i x i 1 when the two assumptions hold it is possible to estimate the average treatment effects of eis on our set of outcomes to do so we employ two methods based on the selection on observables namely the inverse probability weighting regression adjustment ipwra and the augmented inverse probability weighting aipw 6 6 the estimations were made using the teffects ipwra and aipw estimation commands ipwra allows to estimate both ate atet and atut while ipwa estimates only ate statacorp 2019 stata 16 base reference manual college station tx the ipwra and aipw estimators model both the outcome and treatment to account for the aforementioned non random assignment estimating unbiased treatment effects in the presence of confounding wooldridge 2010 they belong to the family of doubly robust estimators which combine a form of outcome regression with a model for the treatment to estimate the causal effect of an exposure treatment on an outcome funk et al 2011 the doubly robust property means that the treatment effect is consistently estimated if one model either the outcome model or the treatment is miss specified while the other model is correctly specified linden et al 2016 tan 2010 wooldridge 2010 because it is not always possible to know which model is correctly specified doubly robust estimators are recommendable providing an extra opportunity to achieve specification linden et al 2016 to select the set of variables to be considered as predictors and potential confounders employed in both the treatment and the outcome equations we rely on economic theory and the body of literature on technology adoption in agriculture and the impacts of irrigation alcon et al 2011 caswell and zilberman 1985 engler et al 2016 garbero and songsermsawas 2018 green et al 1996 in particular we control directly for observable household level characteristics physical capital and contextual infrastructure attributes that might be correlated with the farmers decision to implement an efficient irrigation system eis furthermore both methods have been increasingly applied in different fields of agricultural research cunguara and darnhofer 2011 ma et al 2018 mullally and chakravarty 2018 takeshima et al 2020 tambo and mockshell 2018 ipwra and aipw employ inverse probability weights w to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects austin and stuart 2015 both methods require first to specify a participation regression model binary in this case which allows us to estimate the propensity score p to then determine a regression model for the outcome variable specifically the p obtained from the decision model serves to compute the w s as follows w d p 1 d 1 p where d corresponds to the treatment assignment d 1 denotes treatment and d 0 indicates non treatment austin and stuart 2015 as a result each individual receives a weight w which is the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that an individual received the goal of weighting is that the sample reflects the population creating counterfactuals where they are not observed in the data thus the method gives larger weights to the individuals who are underrepresented in the sample and a lower weight to those who are over represented finally the mean outcomes of adopters and non adopters are estimated the main difference between both estimators is how they use the w on one hand ipwra estimators use the w in a weighted regression coefficients to compute averages of treatment predicted outcomes for adopter and non adopters of eis kebebe 2017 statacorp 2019 tambo and mockshell 2018 formally the ate is estimated as follows 7 a te ˆ iprwa 1 n 1 n m 1 x i m 0 x i on the other hand aipw runs regression functions for the outcome variable one for the treatment and one for the control group it then uses the weights to compute the potential outcome means the aipw incorporates an augmentation term in the inverse probability weighting estimator allowing the treatment effect estimator to remain consistent if the participation model is miss specified however if it is correctly specified the augmentation term goes to zero linden et al 2016 8 ate ˆ aipw 1 n i 1 n y i d it t i p t x i d it t i p t x i p t x i m t x i where y i is the outcome variable d it t i is the indicator of receiving the treatment t for individual i p corresponds to the estimated propensities scores and m t x i is the regression b ot x i b 1 t in the case of ate ipwra m t x i are regression coefficients weighted by w as described above nonetheless before estimating the causal effect it is necessary to check the balance between the treated and non treated units austin and stuart 2015 the covariate balance is an essential criterion to help ensure the validity of the treatment effects estimations linden et al 2016 to test the quality of balancing in our sample after weighting we use quantitative and qualitative methods quantitatively we check the balance based on the standardized difference in means and proportions smd calculated as x t x c s t 2 s c 2 2 where x t and s t 2 are the average and the standard deviation for the treatment status respectively of individual i which is not influenced by the sample size and variance ratios and graphs for the baseline covariates moreover we employ graphical methods to qualitatively compare both groups austin 2009 austin and stuart 2015 stuart 2010 one issue when employing methods based on weighting is the susceptibility to large w this situation arises with very low p for the treated units or p close to 1 case of non treated recommendations to address this potential problem is to use trimming or truncated weights austin and stuart 2015 therefore we applied a trimming procedure to limit farmers for subsequent analyses to those with p 0 025 percentile 0 975 and p 0 05 percentile 0 95 7 7 the loss in the sample size hinders us from applying a more intensive trimming in terms of the propensity score austin and stuart 2015 takeshima et al 2020 although we are aware of the loss of sample size and analytical power this procedure allows us to test the consistency of our results 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics summary statistics for a series of farmer characteristics socio economic natural capital contextual characteristics and comparisons between both groups eis adopters and non eis adopters are presented in table 1 8 8 table s1 in supplementary material provides the definition and descriptive statistics for this set of variables according to the figures we first observe a low level of adoption of eis by farmers in both wua with only 60 farmers 18 belonging to the treatment group this relatively low level of adoption is below the national average of approximately 27 fao 2016 and in other mediterranean countries alcon et al 2019 eis adopters tend to be less aged and more educated but less experienced in farming in terms of socio economic characteristics furthermore they access credits in a higher proportion as well as access technical support public or private despite that other on farm technologies infrastructure technologies such as wells and on farm ponds and water management techniques irrigation scheduling or programming tools are not well spread in the area eis adopters implement more irrigation technologies 0 53 vs 0 14 in this regard jordán and speelman 2020 identify 2 technological groups with one small group comprising moderate to intensive users 12 of farmers while the second comprises the majority of not adopters most of them restricted in natural capital and facing financial barriers 88 additionally an adopter of eis grows more diversified products and a majority of them are devoted to fruit production conversely non adopters are more likely to cultivate annual crops regarding natural resources eis users own both more land 33 vs 7 4 ha and water rights 54 4 vs 16 l s 1 however when estimating the quotient between water per unit of area l s 1 ha 1 non adopters have more water availability we found no differences between eis adopters and non adopters concerning their water withdrawal system and holding a water community reservoir 24 when considering the contextual or infrastructure characteristics despite this difference and the fact that data was collected in a dry year even then 88 of farmers state that they could fully irrigate their crops with no significant difference between adopters and non adopters 92 vs 87 on the other hand table 1 shows differences in terms of accessibility to water with eis adopters having a more positive perception concerning access to water than non adopters finally for our set of outcome variables there are statistical differences for each of them when comparing adopters and non adopters the average margin per hectare is approximately usd 2 472 with adopters earning more than non adopters 6 792 vs 1 529 there is also a considerable difference between both groups regarding farm margin 15 45 vs 222 7 musd further adopters tend to spend more resources on inputs 4 695 vs 1 840 finally in terms of land use adopters tend to irrigate more in absolute 33 vs 7 ha and relative terms 85 vs 71 3 2 determinants of adoption of eis and covariate balancing as a first step to estimate the impact of eis table 2 reports the results for the treatment model adoption of eis used to determine the weights w and the subsequent treatment effects in our model the list of relevant covariates that are assumed to influence the adoption of eis are age education agricultural experience access to credits farm ownership type of water withdrawal annual fees water rights farm size accessibility and the belonging water user association it is important to remark that our primary goal is to achieve a good balance across the set of covariates rather than to explain the drivers affecting farmers eis adoption decisions 9 9 for a more detailed discussion of drivers influencing irrigation technologies in the study area see jordán c speelman s 2020 on farm adoption of irrigation technologies in two irrigated valleys in central chile the effect of relative abundance of water resources agricultural water management 236 106147 therefore to guarantee the balance between both groups we did not consider the full set of available covariates described in table 1 the adoption model depicts the factors influencing the adoption of eis table 2 shows that education access to credits farm ownership and accessibility increase the probability of adopting eis from these variables access to credits and farm ownership are the significant drivers for technology adoption increasing the chances up to 16 and 12 respectively according to their marginal effects access to credits is often found as a key factor for technology adoption and adaptation settings deressa et al 2009 di falco et al 2011 jara rojas et al 2012 education is also a critical factor influencing the likelihood of technology adoption in irrigation bjornlund et al 2009 dillon 2011b as well as other agricultural research fields such as the adoption of rice certified seeds mariano et al 2012 and precision agriculture isgin et al 2008 accessibility to water is a self reported statement indicating how difficult it is for an irrigator to access water potential sources of hardships in accessing water may be the location within either the irrigation system or the canal secondary or tertiary level inappropriate or lack of infrastructure at the water intake point with the set of covariates included in the first stage we proceed first to estimate the propensity scores and then to balance and estimate the weights w table 3 presents the covariate balancing resulting from employing the inverse probability weighting method when comparing the smd for the raw data and the weighted sample it is noticeable the reduction in differences between the adopters and non adopters the smd for each variable is clearly reduced with all the differences below 0 1 9 out 11 variables hold an smd lower than 0 05 ranging between 0 057 and 0 04 also nearly each variance ratio is over 0 75 resulting in appropriate sample weighting and balancing properties austin 2009 stuart et al 2013 complementary graphs for the balance checking can be found in the supplemental material 3 3 impact of efficient irrigation technologies this section presents the estimates for the impact of eis on the targeted outcomes as aforementioned doubly robust estimators ipwra and aipw were employed for the empirical analysis as was previously stated the advantage of using a doubly robust estimator is that the treatment parameter of interest can still be consistently estimated in the situation where one model is miss specified as long as the other is correctly specified all our outcome variables are in natural logs except the share of irrigated land therefore alongside reporting the estimates for the treatment effects in a logarithmic scale to investigate the difference in the treatment effect estimates we also calculated the exponential values of the pairwise differences of the potential outcomes between treated and non treated that is 100 exp treatment 1 in addition we present the results in monetary terms table 4 summarizes the treatment effect estimates for our two estimators specified for the full set of variables overall the results indicate significant effects of adopting eis technologies for both methods in terms of statistical significance with a slight difference in their magnitudes a general comparison of the results of aipw and ipwra estimators confirms the consistency in our ate estimates verifying the fact that eis is a valuable technology specifically when analyzing the results we found the following for the margin per hectare results report that efficient irrigation technologies enable irrigators to obtain a positive and significant impact 5 significance for both methods the ate is between 0 42 and 0 45 determining differences of about 51 57 in the net margin per hectare for both groups in monetary terms this effect translates to differences in 1 640 to 1 830 usd ha 1 for aipw and ipwra respectively in addition the estimates for atet and atut are both significant at 1 and 5 with the former having a higher effect table 4 this result suggests that net margin per hectare grows more when we use those who have already adopted as a reference instead of employing non adopters as a target group 92 vs 51 respectively second our estimates also determined a positive and significant average effect of eis on total net margin farmers who employ eis obtain on average a remarkable average difference of 4 5 times on this variable which in turn translates into an increase in the range of usd 32 976 35 000 our additional estimates atet and atut also present significant effects at 1 and 10 with a more substantial effect on the current adopters than the potential impact of eis when taking as reference their non adopters counterparts in terms of levels the results are 7 8 vs 3 8 times respectively in terms of input usage we find that irrigators employing eis have higher use of inputs 5 significant level on average eis presents a difference between 0 35 and 0 37 implying an increase in 42 45 on the annual agricultural costs per hectare this difference translates into a range between 550 and 608 usdha 1 again the results of the supplementary estimates detect a larger effect on the adopters than non adopters taking the adopters as a reference the average cost effect increases by 68 which reduces to a potential 40 increase for non adopters if they adopt eis technologies although eis technologies are less labor intensive technologies than traditional irrigation i e flooded and furrow irrigation our results at first glance are contrary some possible explanations are that eis demands a considerable initial investment with respect to traditional methods frisvold et al 2018 and increasing maintenance costs sanchis ibor et al 2016 another fact that may contribute to a higher input usage is the switch to more profitable crops demanding more labor and inputs use such as fruit trees with respect to the impact on land use on the one hand we found that for the variable total irrigated land the ate is 0 53 and 0 60 5 and 10 significant respectively these results in absolute values indicate that eis enables adopters to irrigate on average between 2 2 and 2 6 more hectares than the non adopters the average effect based on the non treated displays a significant effect at 10 0 50 but lesser than the effect on those already employing eis 0574 at 1 further this effect is slightly higher than ate with a percentage increase of 2 on the other hand when analyzing the impact of eis on the percentage of irrigated land the results for ate show a significant effect for both estimators the ate moves between 10 6 and 11 4 at 5 of significance with non adopters irrigating roughly 72 whereas adopters irrigate on average about 82 84 of their farms thus on average eis technologies enable farmers to irrigate 15 more area regarding our additional estimates and likewise to the rest of the variables we found that atut is slightly higher 10 4 vs 9 5 than atet but non significant with just the already adopters potentially increasing their irrigated area 3 4 robustness check to validate the consistency of the results we applied a robustness check based on trimming thus 18 and 35 observations representing the extreme tails at 5 below 0 025 and above 0 975 and 10 below 0 05 and above 0 95 were removed from the sample as trimming reduces and generates a new dataset determining a new set of p and w the balance check needs to be reassessed tables 3 and 4 in the supplemental material contain the balancing properties of the reduced sample depicting an adequate balance for the pseudo population of adopters and non adopters table 5 illustrates the results for ate for the full set of outcomes after trimming after removing the tails the results still show positive and significant differences between adopters and non adopters of eis for the complete set of outcomes with slight differences respecting those obtained for the whole sample however we detected large reductions in ate for the total irrigated land and total margin in terms of the effect on the untreated in general we found a smaller effect when comparing with the effect on the treated and particularly we did not find evidence of significant effects on the two land variables for 5 and 10 trimming and on input usage for 10 trimming atet and atut estimations are presented in table 5 in the supplemental material overall the results can be described in different ways firstly this research quantitatively confirms some of the potential benefits of irrigation technologies at the farm level documented by several research fields such as agricultural economics agronomy or water management levidow et al 2014 taylor and zilberman 2017 specifically the difference in ate between traditional and eis systems effects might be explained by two components the first corresponds to the higher net margins per unit of land captured by the margin per hectare suggesting that adopters make more efficient use of their resources the second is related to the increase in profits given differences in irrigated land into production reflected by the variables total margin total irrigated land and percentage of irrigated land both components entail either more productive or a shift towards more profitable crops which usually occurs when adopting this type of technology borrego marín and berbel 2019 taylor and zilberman 2017 secondly and differently from the increasing research revealing the significant and valuable effects access to of irrigation to achieve better results at the farm level dillon 2011a garbero and songsermsawas 2018 takeshima 2018 our study goes a step further by focusing and analyzing the effect of eis technologies a decision made when water is available in this manner we complement research assessing the value of efficient irrigation technologies but with different empirical strategies such as the studies of borrego marín and berbel 2019 and mupaso et al 2014 determining the superiority of modern irrigation systems by a cost benefit analysis approach the significant effect in the outcome variables are interesting from an agricultural and irrigation policy perspective especially for countries who have opted to invest in this type of technology targeting modernization efficiency water resources usage or the expansion of irrigation land through subsidies birkenholtz 2017 molle and sanchis ibor 2019 taylor and zilberman 2017 becoming relevant due to the still relatively low agricultural land irrigated under this kind of systems alcon et al 2019 however results have to be viewed with caution as they are based on one agricultural season analyses based on more extended and more heterogeneous data series would allow exploring more in detail the dynamics and trends of adoption and the outcome variables regarding the climatic and hydrologic conditions in contrast with the positive and significant effects of eis adoption from a profit maximization point of view our results also suggest that improvements in the technical efficiency at the field level do not reduce water consumption although this is not the main focus of this article this finding seems to support the presence of the so called rebound effect or efficiency paradox grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 this paradox has become critical for irrigation water management especially because governments have widely encouraged irrigation modernization mainly through subsidies rey et al 2019 given the consequences of the rebound effect some scholars e g berbel et al 2015 grafton et al 2018 pérez blanco et al 2020 have identified conditions by which rebound effects might be reduced or avoided such as constraining the expansion of agricultural land or the complementary between technologies and policies in this regard chilean farmers face no constraints for agricultural expansion and the water policy framework allocates water through water rights to any requesting agent free of charge with complete and perpetual ownership of the requested water right vergara and rivera 2018 both lack of policy regulations do not create incentives for reducing water withdrawals and consumption leaving room for the use of water savings and the subsequent increase in irrigated area moreover the modernization subsidy programs in chile are designed to favor projects showing more significant increases in irrigated land martin and saavedra 2018 as aforementioned the observational nature of the study does not allow us to extrapolate our findings as to the impact on water savings of the chilean irrigation modernization programs furthermore although the positive and significant impacts of eis on farm profitability would confirm the potential success of this approach our findings on agricultural expansion also warn policymakers that it is crucial to reflect on water conservation targeting when designing such programs 4 conclusions in response to critical challenges such as increasing demographic and economic growth and the demand for food as well as with the aim of improved water resources use in agriculture the promotion of improved irrigation technologies has been emphasized in many parts of the world irrigation technologies are said to bring an ample range of benefits from productivity water use efficiency poverty reduction food security to crucial role for future agricultural adaptation in water scarce areas this research contributes to the literature of irrigation technology adoption estimating and examining the impact of improved irrigation systems on farm level economics and land use variables for a sample of irrigators belonging to 2 irrigated valleys of central chile for one moderately dry agricultural year specifically we estimated the effect of modern irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinklers systems by contrasting with traditional irrigation methods such as flooding and furrow on a series of outcomes namely net annual margin total annual income annual inputs usage total irrigated land and the percentage of the irrigated land to capture the effect of those technologies and deal with selection bias and confounding we employed two estimators based on observables with doubly robust properties the iprwa and the aipw our results report empirical evidence to some of those impacts assigned to irrigation but not sufficiently investigated in the scholarly literature our findings describe first that despite the considerable time supporting the adoption of improved irrigation technologies in the country the use of such technologies in the study area is low only 18 of sampled farmers have adopted them the main drivers of adoption are education land ownership a good perception of accessibility to their water rights and access to credits with the latter as the more critical factor increasing hindering such adoption furthermore we report novel findings on the impact of these technologies by employing a causal effect approach after controlling for confounding and selection bias the results show positive and significant average effects with technology adopters consistently obtaining better results than their non adopter counterparts for the set of the outcome variables besides the impact on the treated outperforms the effect on the untreated though non adopters also benefit from irrigation technologies although our analysis and conclusions are based merely on one agricultural season we can draw some policy implications first authorities should deploy efforts reducing entry barriers facilitating and broadening the access to these technologies as well as reducing access to credit constraints making the initial investment affordable for the majority of farmers leaving no one behind notwithstanding the low adoption rate this is warranted by the fact that farmers employing irrigation technologies are better off than non adopters and by the lower but significant impact found on the untreated increasing farmers participation in irrigation programs needs to be strengthened to increase adoption rates allowing irrigators to achieve the economic benefits of irrigation technologies and increase resiliency to climate variability and climate change further not only support and promotion to adopt technology at the on farm level is required but also improvements at the level of off farm and water intake points second given the magnitude of the reported results investments in efficient irrigation technologies via subsidization may be an appropriate governmental policy to increase farmers income and land use however as the irrigation literature points out efficient irrigation systems are beneficial at the individual level but could be detrimental at the basin level hence reconciling both benefits at the farm level but not neglecting the long term sustainability of water resources is the challenge this is particularly the case of countries like chile where the primary goal of the irrigation subsidy policy still is to expand irrigated area through the improvement of farm level irrigation efficiency finally it is noteworthy to point out some limitations of this article as was aforementioned the study relies on data of a particular agricultural season cross sectional data limiting the analysis of the adoption over time evaluating the effects trends of particular years and the control of unobserved differences between adopters and non adopters furthermore the evidence presented restricts to particular conditions two irrigated valleys benefited by a head reservoir with relatively abundant resources with a clear focus on the farm and economics impact level with no measures in terms of the water saving potential or third party effects additionally we have not considered the impact of complementary technologies infrastructure or management tools e g irrigation scheduling likewise intended for better use of water resources and the potential impact positive and negative of modernization subsidy programs hence we acknowledge the need for broadening further research towards irrigation systems with different environmental and institutional conditions capturing the different characteristics mentioned above and allowing first to confirm our findings and then to achieve a more comprehensive picture regarding the chilean irrigated agriculture and the effects of efficient irrigation technologies beyond the classical limits of profit maximization on the other hand declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
