advance coefficient by changing the camber ratio over the blades it is shown that magnitudes of the efficiency torque thrust vorticity pressure coefficient and the width of the efficiency curve are changed non linearly by changing the camber ratio keywords hydrodynamics marine propeller camber ratio open water 1 introduction in the last decade several researchers have investigated the propellers hydrodynamics using numerical approaches watanbe et al 2003 modeled a propeller in both steady and unsteady conditions using standard k ω turbulence model in this research the average amount of error was about 15 in predicting the produced thrust shams et al hayati et al 2012 investigated effects of the rake on the hydrodynamic performance of a propeller they applied a cfd tool based on rans equations using k ω turbulence model this study contained a 15 computational error in computing the axial torque of propellers podded propellers were studied by arikan et al using sst k ω turbulence model arikan et al 2012 peng et al 2013 investigated effects of turbulence models on predicting hydrodynamic coefficients of a specific marine propeller numerically they showed that eddy viscosity turbulence models were more accurate than reynolds stress models in predicting hydrodynamic coefficients of the propeller furthermore they found that eddy viscosity turbulence models predicted the propellers performance similarly shamsi et al shamsi and ghassemi 2015 performed some time accurate analyses over the flow around a podded driver using sliding mesh method they used a rans solver for predicting unsteady hydrodynamic forces acting on the propulsion system other efforts were also carried out on predicting the performance of propellers using cfd methods in spite of numerous researches done on predicting the performance of specific propellers or the physics of the surrounding flow effects of geometrical parameters on the performance of propellers are rarely discussed by researchers for example rake skew and number of blades are among geometrical parameters which are discussed by some researchers and by the authors in recent years hayati et al 2012 abdel maksoud et al 1998 ghasemi 2009 nouri and mohammadi 2016 a propeller is made of several different sections distributed in the radial direction over some blades since the magnitude of an airfoil camber ratio is directly related to its effective angle of attack blevins 1984 this parameter has a close relationship with the propellers hydrodynamic performance this research numerically discusses the relationship between the propellers hydrodynamic performance and its radial camber ratio distribution in this research effects of the camber ratio on the propellers hydrodynamic efficiency pressure distribution cavitation behaviour downstream vorticity distribution noise propagation thrust and axial torque are discussed in the open water condition some open water four digit naca based marine propellers with similar geometrical parameters except for camber ratios were considered and their hydrodynamic characteristics were examined four digit naca airfols were selected as cross sections of propellers because a they could be simply modeled through some formula b using similar airfoils in different propellers one could reveal the effects of a specific geometrical parameter in the propellers hydrodynamic behavior c four digit naca airfoils were approximately similar to applied cross sections in common marine propellers the applied configurations for propellers in this research were considered similar to common un skewed marine ones in this way the obtained results were reliable in the case of common marine propellers in this research the applied computational tool was a cfd code based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans fluent 15 0 2 numerical method in order to analyse the flow field around the propeller continuity and momentum equations must be solved since the flow was assumed to be isothermal the energy equation was neglected furthermore the flow was assumed to be incompressible in this way steady states equations can be stated as follows by the use of reynolds decomposition and time averaging techniques without the effects of external forces 1 ρ u j u i x j x j p δ i j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j u i x i 0 where ui p ρ and xi are velocity components static pressure density and coordinates respectively the overbar index represents time averaged values and the prime index represents fluctuating parts authors proved the validity of the simulations procedure in their previous work in reference nouri and mohammadi 2016 using following assumptions 1 the rng k ε turbulence model was used 2 the velocity pressure coupling method was based on a simplec algorithm semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent 3 the presto pressure staggering option discretization scheme was used for pressure because it was more suitable for high speed rotating flows 4 the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme was applied as the discretization scheme of convective terms 5 the applied method for modeling rotational effects of the propeller was the moving reference frame the applied computational domain and its dimensions are depicted in figs 1 and 2 the applied boundary conditions were fixed inlet velocity and zero pressure gradient normal to the face of the cylindrical domain upstream the propeller left side of fig 1 fixed pressure and zero velocity gradients downstream the propeller and normal to the face of the cylindrical domain right side of fig 1 fixed velocity and zero pressure gradient on the lateral face of the cylindrical domain no slip boundary condition on solid boundaries as investigated by the authors in reference nouri and mohammadi 2016 a mesh sizing of 1 5 of the propellers diameter d on the propellers faces and a bias factor of 50d for the far filed was resulted in a good prediction of the hydrodynamic efficiency the maximum error was found about 8 in the prediction of the thrust coefficient therefore the presented simulation procedure was accurate enough to predict the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of similar propellers 3 dimensionless parameters the applied dimensionless parameters which are used in this research are summarized as follows carlton 2011 thrust coefficient 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 torque coefficient 3 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 advance coefficient 4 j v a n d hydrodynamic efficiency 5 n p t v a 2 π n q where t is the propellers thrust in newton n q is the propellers torque in newton meter n m n is the rotational speed of the propeller in revolutions per second rps d is the propellers diameter in meter m va is the advance velocity of the propeller in meters per second m sec and ρ is the fluid density 4 case study the main goal of this research was to study effects of the camber ratio on some marine propellers hydrodynamic behavior thus eight propellers were modeled by using similar geometrical parameters except for the camber ratio selected camber ratios placed between 0 and 6 which was a common range for naca airfoils the maximum camber ratio of an airfoil is shown by f c where f is the maximum camber of the airfoil and c is the chord length following assumptions were made in order to prepare geometries of mentioned propellers 1 the number of blades was 7 2 the expanded area ratio was 1 3 the diameter was 45cm 4 the radial maximum thickness distribution was similar between different models 5 cross sections of propellers in all radius ratios were four digit naca with maximum camber and thickness locations equal to 30 of the length of the chord from the leading edge the airfoil cross sections were drawn using 4 digit naca formula for camber line and thickness distribution 6 the pitch ratio p d was 1 5 7 the camber ratio was unchanged in the radial direction for each model the applied camber ratios on propellers were as follows 6 f c r i 1 to 8 c i c 1 0 c 2 0 5 c 3 1 c 4 2 c 5 3 c 6 4 c 7 5 c 8 6 where f c r is the radial distribution of camber ratio c is a constant and i is the indexer one of the modeled propellers is depicted in fig 3 as mentioned above since the radial thickness distribution was kept constant in the radial direction between all models using naca formula the obtained results could be assumed independent from the thickness distribution furthermore because the pitch ratio was kept constant in all models the interaction between radial camber ratio distribution and pitch ratio was omitted therefore one could be sure that the obtained results were directly related to camber ratio and not to the other parameters 5 results eight different propellers which had same geometrical parameters except for the camber ratio were faced to an inlet flow with the velocity of 10m sec rates of revolution of propellers were changed in such a way that a fairly broad range of advance coefficients was covered characteristic curves of propellers are depicted in figs 4 7 as shown in figs 4 and 5 by increasing the propellers camber ratio from 0 to 1 the maximum magnitude of the hydrodynamic efficiency is increased by about 4 while more increase in camber ratio more than 1 decreases the maximum efficiency of the propeller the efficiency was reduced by about 14 in model number 8 relative to model number 3 the magnitude of the camber ratio affected the hydrodynamic performance of propellers because it changed the effective angle of attack over the propellers radial sections this relationship is presented for the airfoil in faltinsen 2005 as α e f f φ β 1 8 f c r a d where α e f f is the airfoil effective angle of attack φ is the airfoil geometrical angle which is the representative of the pitch ratio β is the flow angle and f c is the maximum camber ratio of the airfoil as shown in fig 5 the location of the maximum efficiency was almost unchanged by changing the camber ratio in the range of 1 2 1 25 for the advance coefficient so it is concluded that the location of the maximum efficiency of considered propellers versus advance coefficient j was related to the real angle of attack of the sections and not to the effective ones as shown in fig 5 increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 4 expanded the width of the efficiency curve and reduced its dependency on the advance coefficient though more increase in the camber ratio did not have any effect on the width of the efficiency curve this happened because the camber ratio affected zero angles of attack of radial sections note that increasing the camber ratio moves zero angles of attack into the smaller ones the radial sections have smaller zero angles of attack in greater advance coefficients hence increasing the propellers camber ratio broadened its efficiency curve into greater advance coefficients this pattern was weakened when the camber ratio reached 4 more increase in camber ratio than 4 slightly reduced the width of the efficiency curve in large advance coefficients this is related to the dependency of the flow separation on the camber ratio large magnitude of the camber ratio makes the flow separate from the airfoil pressure side in small angles of attack and has an inverse effect on the airfoil performance milgram 1971 fig 7 showed that there was not a significant difference between the produced thrust of highly cambered propellers in large advance coefficients this happened because of combining the camber ratio enlargement and flow separation in the other hand fig 6 showed that increasing the propellers camber ratio raised its axial torque in every operational point it happened because largely cambered airfoils do not have sensible difference with each other in producing the lift component in small angles of attack but their drag coefficients increase in all angles of attack as well when the camber ratio is increased shyy et al 2007 since the coincidence of the frequency of unsteady vortices generated at trailing edges of the propeller with the local natural frequency of propellers blades produces a large amount of underwater noise yamada and kawakita 2015 authors tried to find a relationship between the camber ratio and the frequency of vortices at trailing edges the radial distribution of the vorticity field is plotted for downstream flow just behind propellers in fig 8 the considered advance coefficient in fig 8 was j 1 2 which was among the optimum range the vorticity contours were obtained from time dependent simulations by means of sliding mesh technique and by means of a time step size which was corresponded to a rotation of one degree for propellers wang et al 2016 as shown in fig 8 increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 2 does not sensibly affect the frequency of trailing edges vortices while more increase in camber ratio more than 2 significantly augmented the frequency of the trailing edge vortices the maximum frequency increased by about 175 by increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 6 on the other hand the first mode natural frequency was about 260hz for the model with 0 camber ratio and was about 280hz for the model with 6 camber ratio in the water medium it means that increasing the camber ratio increased the natural frequency of the propeller by about 5 comparing the growth rate of 5 for the structure with the growth rate of 175 for the downstream flow shows that by increasing the camber ratio more than 2 the frequency of trailing edges vortices tended to the first mode structural natural frequency and the risk of underwater noise propagation was increased in order to investigate effects of the camber ratio on the pressure distribution over propellers the pressure coefficient was used as eq 7 7 c p p p 1 2 ρ v 2 where p is the absolute pressure p is the ambient pressure far from the propeller v is the velocity of the flow far from the propeller and ρ is the density of the fluid since cavitation occurs in the flow where the pressure is lower than the vapor pressure of the fluid in the ambient temperature the considered limit for the pressure in order for being participated in computing the pressure coefficient was selected as the vapor pressure therefore the area averaged pressure coefficients were computed in every radial position in cells which contained the lower static pressure than the specified limit the propeller face was sliced into several radial sections and the averaging was performed in each section between cells inside the area by using the definition presented in eq 7 radial distributions of the pressure coefficient over propellers were plotted versus camber ratio as fig 9 note that these values were computed in j 1 2 as shown in fig 9 increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 2 improved the pressure distribution over the blades i e the risk of cavitation was decreased increasing the camber ratio from 2 to 4 weakened the pressure distribution in roots and improved it in upper sections the curves of pressure coefficients moved downward by more increase in the camber ratio f c 4 therefore it is concluded that increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 2 improved the propellers resistance against cavitation occurrence while its augmentation more than 4 weakened this property increasing the camber ratio from 2 to 4 weakened the propellers resistance against cavitation occurrence in roots and improved this characteristic in upper sections note that interpretation of the pressure distribution results was provided for each propeller relative to the uncambered propeller model 6 conclusion the relationship between the camber ratio of the propellers radial cross sections and its hydrodynamic performance pressure and vorticity distributions hydrodynamic efficiency torque and thrust was discussed in this research eight different models of propellers which had similar geometrical parameters except for the camber ratio 0 to 6 were modeled and simulated by using a cfd tool the radial distribution of the camber ratio over the blades of each model was considered as having a unique value f c r constant in order for covering a desired range for the advance coefficient simulations were performed by a fixed advance velocity 10m sec and variable rates of revolution it was shown that increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 4 expanded the efficiency curve more increase in the camber ratio than 4 did not affect the width of the efficiency curves it was shown that increasing the camber ratio did not change the location of the maximum efficiency on dimensionless curves furthermore a nonlinear relationship was observed between the maximum efficiency and the camber ratio increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 1 improved the hydrodynamic efficiency while more increase in the camber ratio weakened this parameter it was shown that increasing the camber ratio augmented the propellers axial torque in all advance coefficients and augmented the propellers thrust in small advance coefficients in the case of largely cambered propellers more than 4 in this research increasing the camber ratio did not augment the produced thrust in large advance coefficients by investigation of the pressure distribution over blades it was shown that a increasing the camber ratio from 0 to 2 improved the propellers resistance against cavitation occurrence in every radial section b increasing the camber ratio from 2 to 4 weakened the propellers resistance against cavitation occurrence in roots and improved this characteristic in upper sections c increasing the camber ratio more than 4 weakened the propellers resistance against cavitation occurrence in every radial section radial distributions of the vorticity were plotted just behind the propellers it was shown that increasing the camber ratio of the propeller increased the risk of underwater noise propagation acknowledgement here is where we

increase the capital expenditure capex required for a given project installation costs typically account for approximately 30 of the overall project cost this study considers the installation modelling for uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool the tool is used to output time domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases by varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software the results provide a quantification of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk it is identified that the round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays the paper provides a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks to support developers and project planners keywords offshore wind installation vessel technology stochastic weather weather downtime installation risk 1 introduction 1 1 background offshore wind farm owf development has increased steadily throughout the uk over the last decade and is predicted to maintain this momentum until at least 2020 offshorewind biz 2016 renewable uk 2016 the uk has more offshore wind turbines than the whole of the rest of europe 1 5gw is currently under construction with a further 5gw of projects yet to begin development the crown estate 2015 as turbine sizes distances from shore increase weather becomes more severe and water depths span beyond 30m the logistical challenge becomes ever more prominent for prospective developers marine operations play a pivotal role throughout all phases of a wind farm s life cycle yet uncertainties associated with offshore installation can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure capex required for a given project installation costs can account for approximately 30 of the overall project cost and it is anticipated informed engineering decisions in this area present further cost saving potential krohn et al 2005 the increasing remoteness and heightened weather conditions for the uk s future owfs increases the complexity of the marine operations and the importance of making the correct decisions prior to development and sourcing of the correct vessels to complete the tasks at the beginning of the owf development in the uk in 2001 the vessels used for construction introduced bottlenecks and delays in construction this was caused by a lack in availability of specialised vessels as these were predominantly used in the oil and gas sector introducing competition for their services in some cases the vessels were oversized or not ideally suited to the operations which were often sourced at overinflated charter rates as owf development increased the industry began to manufacture purpose built offshore wind vessels that would offer more deck space cope with more severe weather and reduce overall installation durations offshore technology 2012 this paper considers the installation modelling for uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 the analysis is based on time domain predictions for the completion of key installation operations under user specified exceedance probabilities commonly used by investors to determine a project s viability and used by developers to assess their risk preferences by varying key wind farm characteristics an assessment on the performance of typical installation vessels adopted for each of the uk development rounds is investigated with the use of an owf installation decision support software tool a comparative analysis of the predicted durations between each of the two offshore wind rounds is completed this analysis will help inform planning operatives when considering vessel selection in their next project and reveal if further innovation is needed to overcome delays when developing future owfs the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a brief literature review of the most pertinent work in this field in section 3 we begin with a description of the wind farm installation software and an overview of the processes applied within the tool we then describe in section 3 3 the various sources of meteorological data used for each round and provide a justification for their selection the key owf characteristics to be varied throughout the simulations is included in section 3 4 these are applied to resemble the range of owf sizes and remoteness typically experienced within each round it is also intended that these highlight the characteristics that can significantly impact the progression of offshore installation operations and where further technological innovation can be explored section 3 5 describes the process used to identify the typical vessel spreads used in each offshore wind round and section 3 6 describes the fundamental owf installation operations and their associated environmental limits section 4 presents an overview of the results which are supported with discussion in section 5 covering the outcomes by round value to planners and future work finally a summary of our findings and relevant conclusions are presented in section 6 2 literature review the work on the modelling of logistical requirements and installation of owfs has increased over the last five years in an attempt to reduce uncertainty associated with accessing and completing work at offshore locations this type of modelling and analysis allows practitioners to review the installation of an owf in advance so that developers can prepare for certain outcomes in terms of cost or delay many authors focus on the modelling of the construction operations and subsequent weather risk analyses irawan et al 2015 look to address the scheduling issues surrounding offshore wind construction by means of an integer linear programming method to identify the optimal installation with lowest costs and shortest schedules combining weather data and vessel availability their investigation in the use of metaheuristic approaches such as variable neighbourhood search vns and simulated annealing sa was found to offer reasonable results with low computation time their approach is compared against a linear programming optimiser known as cplex which is found to identify the optimum solution but takes longer to reveal the answer others have considered the specific modelling of the logistics surrounding the installation steps where barlow et al 2015 review what vessels and operations are most susceptible to weather constraints during the installation campaign their study aims to assess the impact of operational and vessel improvements over recent times indicating that a non linear relationship exists between vessel limits and the duration of the installation it is also concluded that load out operations appear most susceptible in adverse weather conditions logistics are again the topic in the paper presented by vis and ursavas 2016 where their modelling approach reveals that the key activities impacting performance are the vessel loads distance to shore and the pre assembly strategy adopted for the main wind turbine components they recommend that a pre assembly strategy should be employed that presents the optimum choice between the lowest number of lifts possible and the maximum number of turbines that can fit on a vessel this reflects that the optimum will differ in each offshore wind project but careful consideration of these two parameters should help reveal the best solution for a given project scholz reiter et al 2011 point out that bad weather conditions are the main cause for delays in the logistics and installation of an offshore wind farm they apply their mixed integer linear programming milp model to identify the optimal installation schedule for different weather conditions and the loading operations their study considers the installation of 12 turbines across three synthetically produced weather scenarios each representing either good medium or bad weather and the tool is used to identify optimal installation schedules for the vessels they acknowledge the stochastic nature of weather conditions and express an interest in developing their tool and assess the impact of weather uncertainty beyond these initial three categories ait alla et al 2013 developed a milp model to minimise the installation costs by considering vessel utilisation and fixed costs that span the length of the installation period their approach considers the weather in a deterministic manner and reviews the outcome of two installation scenarios muhabie et al 2015 consider the use of discrete event simulation by considering weather restrictions distances vessel capabilities and assembly scenarios they consider the use of real historical weather data and generated data sets adopting a probabilistic approach the results demonstrate a good level of agreement between the two approaches when considering the average mean lead time and reference future work to optimise the fleet sizes capacities and overall installation strategies this paper evaluates the installation durations and subsequent vessel performance during the construction of an owf a probabilistic function to simulate the weather is enclosed within the adopted tool which is capable of producing a range of results under user specified exceedance probability quantiles the user defined exceedance quantiles provides an assessment of installation risk at different confidence levels this presents a key benefit over the tools reviewed in this section as it offers the adaptability to planners and investors as required the tool can simulate the full installation of an owf handled in phases and considers the environmental constraints of the operations and vessels across the predicted weather outcomes 3 methodology this paper employs an offshore wind installation software simulation tool to determine the installation duration of an offshore wind farm owf in advance moreover a focus on the predicted performance of vessel technology synonymous of typical vessel spreads used throughout the first two uk offshore wind rounds are analysed to identify the variation in installation durations and weather downtime 3 1 wind farm installation software the software tool relies on monte carlo methods to simulate multiple independent scenarios of the defined installation strategy for an offshore wind farm the tool considers risk as delays to the installation imposed by adverse weather conditions a hmm model rabiner and juang 1986 has been used to generate each meteorological scenario informed historical weather data which begins with the evaluation of a transition matrix a for the markov chain this matrix represents the evolution of the weather parameters wind speed v t wave height h t and speed of the sea current p t in this study the wind speed and wave height are the only weather conditions evaluated meteorological parameters are intrinsically stochastic but also exhibit some continuity over time therefore at any one time if the sea is in a certain state it is more likely that the next time one hour for example the sea remains in a similar state the main characteristic of a markov chain is that the next state depends only on the state at the current point in time which is described by fig 3 1 if the probability of moving from one state to another are known then it is possible to generate meteorological parameters and thus to obtain a new weather scenario each element of the transition matrix a is the probability for the arrival of state j is knowing the initial state i a is a matrix of size n n with n the number of states of the markov chain the vector π of the initial probability array of the hidden states is also determined for chain size n it is possible to obtain empirical estimates of this matrix and vector by a a i j 1 i j n and π π i 1 i n where a i j number of transitions i j number of transitions from i and π i number of observations in the state i total number of observations for a given initial state the number of arrivals of possible states is relatively low at a maximum of 30 thus the matrix a contains many zeros and forms what is called a matrix dig for each initial state i it is best to store only the non zero values a i and associated indices p i which is defined as p i j a i j 0 and a i a i j j p i once the estimated transition matrix is established the software will simulate a weather scenario over a period specified which corresponds the maximum installation duration envisaged by the user the software simulates the weather at the time i 1 knowing the state of the weather at the time i according to transition matrix the method relies on a monthly transformation in the data in order to normalise the environmental data to a stationary form which is inspired by dinwoodie et al 2012 the transformed data is assumed to be embodiment of a markov chain and the matrix a and the vector π are estimated on these transformed data after the simulation of the markov chain is applied to reconstruct the monthly outcomes into one meteorological scenario an overview of these steps is demonstrated by fig 3 2 x i k x i k 1 x i k 2 x i k 3 is regarded as the vector of three meteorological parameters for the i th observation during month number k k 1 2 12 the monthly processing carried out in the method is as follows for each of the parameters h 1 2 3 y i k h x i k h μ i k h σ i k h where μ i k h and σ i k h are the mean and standard deviation of the parameter number h over the month number k the meteorological parameters are supposed to take their values in a discrete space and have a finite number of states a given meteorological scenario is used directly within each monte carlo simulation to calculate a duration for each primary installation phase eight installation phases are considered within this study which are as follows dredging survey foundation transition piece turbine wtg scour protection pre lay grapnel run plgr cable installation and cable burial these phases include sequences that comprise of sub tasks elementary to the operations the tool allows phases to be suspended once a sequence has been completed and uses their base duration to determine if an adequate weather window is available or if the vessel should hold station offshore a weather window can be defined simply as weather conditions that are predicted to stay within the environmental limits of a sequence for a specified duration once the software has computed the predicted durations these can be processed to reveal the average installation rates irs and weather downtime wdt for each of the installation phases the p90 exceedance quantile was selected as the referenced result category providing 90 confidence that the predicted durations will not be exceeded the numerical results allow the calculation of key performance indicators kpis in this study we use the duration for each phase divided by the number of wind turbines associated to the given model to reveal an average ir in days per turbine days wtg similarly the base unweathered duration for each installation phase is deducted from the predicted duration to reveal the average weather downtime wdt that can be expected for each turbine location under the individual phases these irs and wdt values can then be generally compared between the rounds to assess the impact of vessel technology additionally the variation about the mean ir and wdt predictions can be used to estimate the installation risk that may be anticipated for each installation phase 3 2 model calculations a high level description of the methodology applied within the tool for the execution of installation phases is as follows firstly the ship to be used for an installation phase is mobilised the vessel goes offshore as soon as it s shipping weather limits are satisfied next the logistics model as outlined in fig 3 3 is used to apply the phases considering the make up sequences within each phase this process initially recognises phases that were not completed in the previous weather window and the process begins at the first of the remaining sequences otherwise the tool identifies the maximum number of phases to be handled by the vessel and if it is within these bounds the process begins with the next phase in hand it is determined if a weather window exists where the environmental limits of the next sequence are satisfied for the corresponding duration if the conditions are not satisfied the software continues to search for a suitable weather window and whilst none are available the vessel holds station this stands unless the weather conditions become worse than the waiting condition limits for the vessel meaning the vessel returns to port and awaits the next opportunity to set sail to site the completion of each sequence marks the end of the weather window search and the tool assesses if the vessel can remain on site either by the maximum number of phases or by the predicted weather conditions again if poorer weather is predicted and the environmental limits allow the vessel can hold station if the vessel is in the middle of a current phase or there are phases to complete the process starts over and searches for a window to complete the next sequence this iterative process continues and is applied to all installation phases until they are complete for each wind turbine after which the vessel for the given phase is demobilised and the next vessel begins the subsequent phase in the defined schedule finally the process is complete when the maximum number of monte carlo simulations has been reached the predicted durations for each installation phase are presented with a start and an end date these dates are recorded under user specified exceedance quantiles such as p50 p70 and p90 it is these predicted durations that are used as the main source of results in this study as presented in section 4 3 3 meteorological data meteorological data was obtained from separate hindcasts used for the two offshore wind rounds in each simulation a single metocean time series is used to inform the hmm which generates 1000 stochastic weather scenarios these scenarios provide a basis to assess the progression of the installation phases by considering the environmental limits of the sub tasks and vessels specified for each round data from teesside and greater gabbard was selected representing the conditions of round 1 and round 2 sites respectively the wind speeds in each data set are referenced at 10m teesside offshore wind farm is located off the north east coast of england and its near shore location is synonymous of a round 1 project the data set was developed by a private consultant drawing on field and modelled data to construct a metocean time series for round 2 publicly available data for the greater gabbard offshore wind farm was sourced from the crown estate s marine data exchange the crown estate 2015 greater gabbard is located off the english suffolk coast and is close to the average distance of all round 2 sites 3 4 wind farm characteristics the key owf characteristics for each project within the two offshore wind rounds have been reviewed based on the information included in renewable uk 2015 this identified mean maximum and minimum characteristic values across all of the owfs in each round the characteristics varied within the simulation tool and the values identified for each round are listed in tables 3 1 3 2 for each owf round 11 cases were simulated beginning with a mean case for all parameters and then varying one parameter at a time with either a maximum or minimum value two extreme cases are included comprising of maximum and minimum case for the number of turbines and distance to shore combined to consider the impact of start date selection three dates were selected to investigate the impact of seasonality across the two rounds april was chosen to resemble construction beginning in the spring august for summer and december for a winter start 3 5 vessel technology spreads an assessment of the vessels used across all of the owfs within the consenting rounds in renewable uk 2015 was completed to identify the typical vessel spread used at the time of installation it is accepted that the categorisation by uk offshore wind rounds does not mean all construction activities were completed within an allocated time frame as some round 2 sites were installed before round 1 projects however this classification was adopted to gauge the impact of step changes in vessel technology to identify the main vessel types used to install or planned for installation of each owf reference to the vessel listings for each respective wind farm on 4c offshore were used to populate a vessel database for each round 4c offshore ltd 2016 using the parent installation phases as a guide the vessel database for each round was then assessed to reveal the most common vessel type chartered for each phase which produced a representative vessel spread for each round it should be noted that the vessel spreads for each round included in table 3 3 are based on the transparency of information published on the 4c offshore website the provided references give more detail on the general vessel type and a full list of vessel characteristics used in the study are appended in table a 1 for each vessel type identified and listed in table 3 3 the referenced vessel specifications were used to generate approximations for the loaded and unloaded transit speeds in conjunction to survival limits for wave height and wind speed where some environmental limits were not listed on the specification sheets generic references or limits for similar vessels were used to approximate the relevant values dalgic et al 2015 douglas westwood 2013 sperstad et al 2016 thomsen 2012 van oord acz 2001 whilst this information is sufficiently detailed for modelling analysts will have more specific information from the vessel operators to plan the marine operations the commissioning phase of the wind farm which predominantly adopts crew transfer vessels ctvs to transfer technical personnel to the turbines has not been considered eight offshore installation phases are considered for analysis and are summarised in table 3 3 which specifies the installation phase and vessel used in the model set up it should be noted that all vessels are assumed to have the capacity to remain offshore to complete the work at all turbine locations with the exception of the vessels used for the foundation transition piece and wtg installation phases which are limited to a maximum of three turbine locations per voyage this limitation is discussed further in section 5 4 each phase and vessel choice for the different rounds are described in the following passage the dredging survey phase prepares or clears the seabed before the main owf construction activities begin and ensures the work has been completed to a sufficient standard dredging is not required for all projects but has been included to acknowledge some form of seabed preparation common to many sites it is assumed that the dredging phase follows on from and is prescribed by an extensive seabed survey this is completed well in advance of the main construction activities to inform project teams of any unexploded ordnances potential obstacles seabed integrity the applicable foundation type s for the site and the extent of dredging operations required a dredge vessel can be fairly simple consisting of a barge equipped with a backhoe excavator to more advanced dynamically positioned dp vessels that include trailing suction hopper technology tshd kaiser and snyder 2012 less sophisticated dredgers were used in earlier uk projects but as installations have moved further from shore developers have discarded traditional monopile foundations for gravity based or jacket structures this requires improved accuracy and subsequent manoeuvrability of the dredge vessels demanding the most advanced technology available to developers the second phase considered is the foundation installation phase from review of the vessels used for foundation works in both rounds it is evident that different types of vessels have been employed to deal with the variation or trends in foundation type used between rounds renewable uk 2015 the majority of round 1 sites adopted monopile foundations as these could be installed quite easily in the nearshore locations synonymous with the majority of these sites this type of installation can be handled on board jack up barges and dedicated wind turbine installation vessels wtivs and this type of vessel was identified as the most common vessel in round 1 round 2 sites are generally greater in size and located further from shore leading to more challenging conditions for installation this shift presented further logistical challenges and often heavy lift vessels that could deliver and install foundations were employed to reduce materials handling at the offshore locations the installation of the transition piece which is the structural section that links the monopile and wind turbine is the next installation phase the transition piece provides a fendering area for crew transfer vessels to interface with the structure and a ladder for personnel to climb onto the platform before entering the turbine for either construction or maintenance tasks it is common that the transition piece is prefabricated onto a jacket or tripod foundations but it is assumed that monopile configurations are used for the installation campaigns considered throughout in this paper the wind turbine installation phase was found to adopt some form of dedicated wtiv across in both rounds these vessel types incorporate four to six legs that rest on the seabed and elevate the main body of the wtiv above the water this protects the vessel from wave heights between 1 5 3hs depending on vessel design and helps stabilise the lifting operations these vessels are also used to transport between three to eight turbines at a time depending on the available cargo capacity and the installation strategy adopted as indicated in section 3 5 the turbine installation vessel has an assumed capacity of three turbines per voyage the whole lifting process remains sensitive to the conditions particularly wind speed and when individual blades or assembled rotor sections are hoisted the environmental limits are often lowered a number of different wtg installation strategies have been used in various projects as presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 these range from individual sub section lifts for the towers and single blades through to fully assembled turbine lifts it is assumed that the lifting strategy is identical in both rounds to limit the amount of modelling permutations considered the bunny ear configuration with a 2 stage tower lift was selected as the most applicable strategy as this presented a compromise between fully assembled and an individual component installation in this installation strategy the maximum and minimum tower sections are connected on land as with the rotor which is pre assembled consisting of a nacelle and 2 blades attached this results in a total of three lifts at the turbine location beginning with the tower then rotor and finally the third blade maples et al 2013 it should be noted that the reference duration in table 3 4 represents the approximate time to install each turbine using in the bunny ear configuration and this figure would fluctuate for each of the installation strategies presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 in round 1 jack up barges without their own means of propulsion were commonly used these vessels often have modest elevation heights and are dependent on other vessels such as anchor handling tugs ahts to transit and manoeuvre the barge to each wind turbine location self propelled jack ups started to be used in round 1 but were more commonly chartered for round 2 projects this next stage in wtiv design presented improved manoeuvrability elevation heights and deck space offering improved cargo capacities and logistical options scour protection is installed to prevent structural instability around the foundation of an offshore wind turbine induced by tidal flow or wave action the specific solution depends on the foundation selected the long term meteorological conditions and the seabed material rock dumping is often used to place variable grades of stone around foundations or protection is placed over vulnerable cable lengths in the form of concrete mattresses this phase can be completed with a hopper barge and towing tug or more commonly with a dedicated side stone dumping vessel or with more sophisticated fall pipe vessels fpv it is assumed in these analyses that the scour protection is installed around the base of the mono pile foundations the pre lay grapnel run plgr is used to clear debris along the cable route before installation ensuring that hazards do not interfere with cable laying and burial phases or during future maintenance operations offshore wind programme board 2015 a hook like anchor is pulled during this process and relies on the forward motion of the vessel to work the seabed creating a narrow trench of approximately 1m depth along the cable route a multi purpose workboat with a bollard pull of roughly 20 tons is normally used for this activity cable laying operations require a dedicated cable lay vessel clv to lay the inter array cables between the turbines and export cable to the onshore substation or from the offshore substation to the cable landfall point earlier projects often employed adapted barges that feed out cable from a pre installed cable carousel due to the near shore sheltered conditions energy institute 2014 these rely on other vessels to tow and install anchoring arrangements to keep the barge to the designated cable path as these vessels are not equipped with dynamic positioning dp systems it is assumed that this type of installation was used for the round 1 project and is modelled with a transit speed that resembles the speed of an aht of between 6 and 8 knots in some instances an adapted supply vessel was used to take advantage of the dp capabilities but for the majority of the round 2 projects specifically designed clvs were employed to cope with more extreme conditions and exposed cable routes many of these vessels can handle simultaneous laying trenching and burial operations but often a secondary vessel is assumed to complete the trenching and burial phases bard and thalemann 2011 the cable burial phase is assumed to enclose both the trenching process and final burial of the cable the study also assumes that a post lay burial operation is applied in both rounds utilising a secondary multi purpose support vessel mpsv or large survey vessels this lay and trench technique deploys an rov from the parent multi purpose vessel to trench around and bury the cable in one operation the main logistical steps of this phase are assumed to relate to the parent multi purpose vessel and a burial duration was selected on a per wind turbine basis 3 6 operations environmental limits durations to assess the vessel technology from round 1 and 2 a set installation scenario is used presented in table 3 4 to resemble a typical installation programme a number of the phases were set to run simultaneously the foundation phase was specified to begin once the dredging and survey phase had reached 60 completion the transition piece installation began when 40 of the foundation phase was completed turbine installation began after 20 of the foundations were installed scour protection follows at 80 of completion 100 for the plgr phase cable installation at 60 of the plgr phase and cable burial only begins after the cable installation had completed to 100 each of the main installation phases were allocated with environmental limits independent of the associated vessel restrictions and resemble the maximum conditions that can be experienced when completing these offshore operations separate from vessel capabilities the same task parameters are assumed in both rounds which are to the author s best knowledge and experience a fair representation of the expected values for these installation operations it is reiterated that separate environmental limits exist for the different vessels in terms of transit and waiting modes as soon as the weather conditions are below a vessel s transit limits the vessel will set sail to the offshore site the transit time is calculated simply by dividing the distance between the farm and the port by the vessel speed if at any point the weather conditions exceed the transiting limits during an outward or inter turbine voyage the vessel returns to port when the transit duration has been completed the vessel is on site and the software calls on the limits and durations applied to the installation phases this determines if a sufficient weather window exists to start an installation sequence or if the vessel should wait for the next available weather window if the waiting conditions of the vessel are satisfied three main characteristics are used for each installation step within the models 1 reference duration average number of hours spent per wtg 2 maximum wind speed m s and 3 maximum wave height m reference to available literature such as maples et al 2013 douglas westwood 2013 and in house planning documentation was used to establish the base installation durations wind speeds and wave heights for each phase listed in table 3 4 4 results to assess the impact of vessel technology on construction durations for offshore wind farms the scenarios in section 3 4 were applied using the simulation tool described in section 3 1 for both wind rounds 11 cases were constructed initially taking one mean case of all parameters eight cases where each parameter was run with an maximum and minimum value in turn and two extreme cases combining a maximum and minimum situation for the number of turbines and distance to shore the main characteristics of the vessels under analysis are the transit and survival limits which are composed of a maximum wave height and wind speed as listed in table a 1 the transit speeds of each vessel for loaded and unloaded states are also specified an overview of the vessel spreads used for each round is included in table 3 3 each simulation is run for a 1000 iterations to obtain sufficiently accurate results the average simualtion time for a round one case was 1 day and 1 6 days for round two for each of the individual 11 cases the software produces a calendar output for all installation phases recorded under user specified exceedance quantiles the predicted duration for each installation phase is presented with a start and an end date meaning the results are rounded to the nearest day the p90 duration quantile was selected for analysis in this study as it provides greater certainty that the predicted values will not be exceeded when conducting these type of operations offshore the predicted p90 duration for each phase are divided by the number of turbines specified in each case to reveal the average installation rate ir in days per turbine days wtg the ir represents the average number of days required to complete the installation task at each turbine in the model including the impact of weather delay to demonstrate how these results can be used in practice an average result for weather downtime wdt is calculated by deducting the base duration from the predicted p90 duration for the phases in each case the base duration in each phase is calculated using the net time to complete the installation tasks without the impact of weather delay and multiplying this by the number of turbines in each case the resulting wdt duration is once again divided by the number of turbines for each case to reveal a wdt value for the individual installation phases in days wtg within each case eight ir and wdt values are collected corresponding with the number installation phases for each round a total of 11 cases were collected and an average ir and wdt for the eight installation phases was computed from this compilation as shown in figs 4 1 and 4 2 as discussed in section 3 1 the deviation from these averages is regarded as a means to estimate the installation risk in the potential outcomes box plots that show the variation in the results are presented in figs 4 3 a to d and a comparison of the recorded variation in each phase in both rounds is included in fig 5 3 the greatest variability in the results were observed for the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation phases as represented by the larger bars in fig 5 3 this indicates that the greatest risk is estimated to occur within these phases although the round 2 figures demonstrate lower deviation despite higher durations 4 1 results overview the ir for each of the eight phases was used to compare the differences between the vessel spreads of each round fig 4 1 presents a summary of the installation rates in days per wind turbine days wtg the results in fig 4 1 show that round 1 is predicted to have the smallest irs with the largest recorded for the dredging and survey foundation and wtg installation phases predicted to be around 4 2 4 1 and 3 6 days wtg respectively the results for round 2 show the greatest irs and the largest are again recorded for the same phases at 5 4 4 4 and 6 3 days wtg respectively it can be generalised that round 1 appears to outperform round 2 vessels in terms of installation rate by approximately 25 on average across the eight installation phases the biggest difference between round 1 and 2 is seen with the dregde survey phase at around 1 day wtg and the wtg installation phase at approximately 2 5 days wtg as a direct consequence of the results presented in fig 4 1 knowing the base duration for each of the installation phases allows for the amount of wdt to be identified the weather delay expected on average for each phase between the two rounds is presented in fig 4 2 this confirms that the greatest delays are observed in the round 2 phases this process presents a method for predicting the average wdt for each installation phase if this approach was used to analyse a case specific simulation built to match the characteristics of a prospective development this would provide a basis to scale the results by the number of turbines and reveal an approximate overall wdt for each installation phase 4 2 results by round the results for the individual rounds were further analysed to determine the distribution of phase durations predicted by the software the box plots of the irs and wdts in each round have been aligned in figs 4 3a to d in terms of wdt figs 4 36c and d demonstrate the same range of distribution as the irs but at lower values a plot of the quantification of the inter quartile ranges for the irs and wdts from each phase across the two rounds is included in fig 5 1 2 and is used to demonstrate the spread in the results which can be used to signify the installation risk for the combined vessel phase configurations this is calculated by simply subtracting the bounds of the first quartile from the third quartile for each of the installation phases in rounds 1 and 2 fig 4 3a demonstrates a considerable range for the installation phases in round 1 particularly in the wind turbine wtg transition piece and foundation installation steps as demonstrated by the broad space taken by the interquartile range iqr the variability of these irs span from approximately 2 4 to 5 5 days wtg with an iqr of about 3 days wtg for the foundations 1 4 3 9 days wtg with an iqr of 2 3 days wtg for the transition pieces and 1 9 5 3 wtg days with an iqr of 3 4 days wtg for the turbines all of the phases demonstrates a skew towards the upper values of the data the dredging survey cable installation and cable burial phases exhibit lower variance in the results and a nominal range was predicted for the scour and plgr stages with the majority of these phases taking 1 day or less per wind turbine fig 4 3c shows similar variance between the round 1 ir and weather downtime predictions wdt based on the results in fig 4 3a it can be expected that the greatest ranges would be seen at the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation phases at 0 4 3 6 days wtg with an iqr of 3 days wtg 0 4 2 8 days wtg with an iqr of 2 3 days wtg and 0 8 4 3 days wtg with an iqr of 3 2 days wtg respectively again the medians for these phases are skewed towards the upper data in the plots the distribution of all phases in fig 4 3c have a near identical profile as seen the irs the scour and pglr phases are predicted to have the lowest wdts and subsequent wdt in round 1 without much variation while the three key phases of the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation present the highest values in terms of delay fig 4 3b shows generally smaller ranges for the results when compared to round 1 the broadest iqr distributions relate to the dredging survey transition piece and wind turbine phases at 0 5 0 4 and 0 45 days wtg respectively the foundation and transition piece installations have an overall range of approximately 2 days wtg and the largest recorded for the wtg installation at 4 days wtg the same distribution profiles are again replicated in the wdt plots shown in fig 4 3d and once more the scour protection and plgr phases demonstrate the lower weather downtime the dredging survey foundation and wtg installation phases are shown to have the largest values in terms of wdt generally it was found that the installation rates and wdt predicted for the phases in round 2 are higher in comparison to round 1 however the results seem more consistent as the distributions are quite narrow and this smaller variation indicates a reduction in installation risk 5 discussion the outcomes and reasoning surrounding the results is covered in this section we begin with the installation rates and wdt values included in figs 4 1 and 4 2 which list the average result for the various scenarios within each installation phase across the two rounds the results used to draw these averages were compiled separately to allow analysis by rounds and review of the scenarios that resulted in the largest recorded durations 5 1 vessel performance by round the most notable average results from each round is covered in the following sections and considers the source of these outcomes including the contribution of each installation phase towards the averages obtained 5 1 1 round 1 in round 1 the average total of construction days spent per wind turbine which includes all phases across all scenarios are the lowest for both rounds at 20 23 days wtg this is complemented with a wdt figure of 10 21 days wtg on average and both exhibit a standard deviation of 3 2 days wtg despite the adoption of less dedicated and specialised vessels on the market it appears that round 1 sites benefit from their near shore locations this characteristic provides more sheltered conditions during construction reduces the impact of weather on the vessels and subsequent delays however in round 1 projects the averaged results suggest that over 50 of the charter time for the vessels would likely be attributed to downtime the average combined construction duration was found to be 403 days which required a total of 640 individual boat days relating to the overlap of phases described in section 3 6 these outcomes arrived at approximate weather downtime value of 328 days per project on average a review of the individual phases revealed that the wind turbine installation phase makes the largest contribution to downtime recorded at 26 the case which caused the largest impact in terms of ir and wdt was the mean case at 23 6 days wtg for ir and 13 6 days wtg for wdt these were closely followed by very similar results for the distance to shore inter turbine distance cases at around 23 24 days wtg ir and 13 14 days wtg wdt the lowest predicted duration was seen with the lower number of turbines scenario at 16 days wtg and 6 days wtg for ir and wdt respectively it was expected that the maximum distance to shore and number of turbine cases would result in greatest recorded irs and wdts however as the number of turbines or distances in the model increase so does the elapsed time for each phase and delays gradually shift the start date of successive phases this suggests that seasonal conditions can be incurred at different moments during different phases of an installation campaign stemming from the size of the project to be completed for example the start date recorded for wtg installation in the case with the minimum number of turbines was 11 08 2017 whilst the start date for the maximum number of turbine cases was 12 05 2018 despite this dramatic shift due to the size of project the start date for maximum number of turbine case is in may it is likely that the weather conditions were more favourable in may than in august this observation is further exemplified by the results for the start date cases which have the same characteristics as the mean case but with a different date defined for the launch of the first phase the results recorded for the upper start date case starting 01 04 2017 are the second lowest recorded at 16 8 days wtg for ir and 6 8 days wtg for wdt it is also suggested that the weather downtime will increase if the vessel employed for each installation phase has to return to base to reload various components as is the case for the foundation transition piece and wtg vessels in this study referring to the box plots in figs 4 3a and c it is evident that many of the phases are quite variable in terms of ir and wdt with the largest spread of values observed for the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation the large variation shown in fig 5 1 2 signifies a lack of consistency in the ir and wdt values for each scenario and indicate a significant amount of installation risk that could be expected for these phases throughout round 1 this suggests that the vessels employed for these three phases at the time of round 1 were susceptible to variations in their working climate exemplified by the broad spread of values for the phases described above 5 1 2 round 2 round 2 vessels are predicted to have the largest average irs and wdt values between the two rounds the average ir across all scenarios is 25 4 days wtg and 15 4 days wtg for the average wdt with a standard deviation of 2 17 days for both this deviation is lower than round 1 and it can be said that the installation risk is lower with the round 2 vessels overall the average wdt value represents an increase of 50 compared to round 1 these initial outcomes convey the impact of more challenging offshore conditions typically experienced at these sites the results indicate that on average over 60 of the entire vessel charter period would experience weather downtime suggesting developers could have faced a significant bill for downtime for projects with similarities to this category the average and combined construction duration was predicted to be around 1384 days per project requiring a large number of separate boat days in excess of 2300 days combined the average wdt value for all the scenarios in round 2 was just over 1260 days per project reference to the individual phases revealed that the wtg installation phase again made the largest contribution to overall wdt recorded at nearly 34 of all downtime on average which is a considerable increase compared to round 1 this implies that the typical turbine installation vessel employed during round 2 was generally not ideally suited to the heightened weather conditions typical of more challenging waters further from shore the scenario found to have the largest impact in ir and wdt was the lower number of wind turbines case with values of 29 67 days wtg and 19 62 days wtg respectively the scenario with the least impact in the round 2 predictions is the maximum start date 01 04 2017 with an ir of 23 days wtg and wdt value of approximately 13 days this outcome is surprising as it may be expected that with less turbines the installation rates may be better or at least stay the same it is noted that for larger wind farms that the weather delays are averaged across a greater number of turbines which may compensate the wdt predictions it is again proposed that the impact of successive scheduling can dramatically change the amount of downtime experienced relating to the changing seasonal weather conditions as there are less turbines in the minimum wtg case this means phases such as the wtg installation would be reached sooner and could be completed in more severe weather conditions in comparison to larger projects that may not reach the most susceptible phases until a calmer weather season is incurred to exemplify the wtg installation start date for the case with the minimum number of turbines was recorded as 11 11 2017 and for the maximum start date case as 01 06 2018 it is again likely the weather was less severe in june than in november it therefore suggested that a consecutive installation schedule as applied in this study may not be the optimum approach when planning offshore wind farm construction it is apparent that the majority of phases experienced an increase in wdt on average and again the wtg installation phase has shown a 97 increase in average downtime in comparison to round 1 notably the scour protection conveys a 250 increase a 100 increase in plgr 58 for cable installation and approximately 40 45 increase for the dredging and cable burial phases two wdts found to increase slightly are the foundation and transition piece installation each confirming an approximate increase of 8 and 13 respectively on average it is proposed that the vessels in round 2 were not well suited to the conditions associated with these sites which relates to the vessel types commonly chartered at this time it is proposed that vessel availability restrictions are demonstrated in round 2 as over sized and weather sensitive heavy lift vessels were commonly employed these vessels were used for phases such as foundation or transition piece installations and originated from other offshore industries matched with inflated daily charter rates it would be appropriate to apply a cost benefit analysis when considering the charter of these vessels in comparison to the resulting wdt costs that may be expected from more capable but less available vessels in the market in some cases developers may have struggled to source a cheaper alternative with the improved capabilities and to some extent this demonstrates that optimum vessel designs were not available or had yet to be built during the construction of round 2 sites thus focus on the development of dedicated wind farm installation vessels was essential to the industry at this time the box plots in figs 4 3b and d show significantly less variation in comparison to round 1 this suggests that despite an overall increase in wdt on average the vessels employed for round 2 performed more consistently and therefore a reduction in the installation risk is observed in fig 5 1 2 this means more certainty could be drawn from wdt predictions but the challenge in reducing the overall magnitude of these delays was still a concern the scour protection and plgr phases still exhibit fairly low ir and wdt values compared to round 1 but the plots demonstrate more variability in the results which suggests these vessels may perform less consistently when used in more challenging conditions 5 2 value to planning personnel the presented approach is of interest to planning personnel as a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks whilst the study and simulation do not relate to any specific project it has provided a basis to schedule vessel missions based on the bounds of the two installation rounds ensuring efficient low cost installation strategies is essential if offshore wind is to make a meaningful cost effective contribution to the uk s energy mix aiming for a levelised cost under 100 mwh the crown estate 2012 many of the delays identified have been tackled by introducing innovative vessel designs made to cope with more extreme weather conditions and increased deck space or lifting capabilities this paper has assessed the environmental capabilities of the vessels and attempts identify their susceptibility to various project characteristics to help reduce the costs of this industry and offer guidance on vessel charter as the study has been compartmentalised by uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 it is intended that operatives can benchmark these findings against the outcome of their own projects and compare vessel performance predictions this study provides a clear indication of the installation risks for the vessel spreads used in each round and the phases predicted to have the largest installation risk highlight areas where precautionary or mitigation steps may be required when chartering vessels with similar capabilities a method to approximate the wdt for each installation phase is discussed in section 4 1 it is demonstrated that the selection of the vessels identified in round 1 for a site of this category would generally result in lower weather downtimes but there may be significant variation in the foundation transition piece and turbine installation phases the vessels specified for round 2 exhibit considerably less variation but larger weather downtimes compared to round 1 this result proposes that more modern vessels should perform more consistently management could take more certainty on their predicted wdt figures if they opt for and can access the most sophisticated vessels available it is also found that periodic scheduling of installation phases should be considered when conducting an offshore wind development the consecutive nature of the phases employed within this study has revealed that the larger less accessible projects may not experience the greatest downtime as a result of shifted schedules from delays incurred during earlier phases we have demonstrated the effect of successive scheduling of installation phases in these type of models as delays incurred earlier in the project can shift the start date of phases waiting to begin it is therefore suggested that individual models are primarily constructed for each installation phase with a preferable or predicted start date the effects of different start dates could be assessed by the individual models and would aid planners in the construction of a master installation schedule compromising between the impact of delays and preferred installation periods to generalise these perspectives round 1 vessel technology exhibits the lowest wdt although a considerable amount of variation in the observed delays may occur if employed for more remote unsheltered locations the vessels employed for round 2 offer more certainty as the results appear more consistent but are predicted to experience larger wdts this demonstrated that despite the adoption of a more standardised approach for these projects there was an opportunity to reduce the wdt figures with more sophisticated and capable vessels 5 3 data validation the irs presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 were used to complete a validation of the adopted method and analyses within this reference the kaiser et al list observed irs days wtg for foundations and wind turbines from eight uk round 1 wind farms these values are presented in a boat days basis which represent the entire time spent per vessel for each foundation and turbine installation in days wtg this metric provides a suitable base for comparison and as these phases were predicted to have some of largest weather downtimes in fig 4 2 it should provide an interesting reference unfortunately the authors are unaware of any other available data set that presents the remaining installation phases in this manner p50 predictions were also computed during the simulations completed for this study and the p50 irs were obtained using the same approach in section 4 the average p90 and p50 prediction for the foundation and wtg phases are compared against the average irs recorded across various round 1 sites in fig 5 2 an initial review of the data demonstrates that the average round 1 predictions both p90 and p50 are of similar order to the recorded values for the round 1 site this gives an indication that the predictions produced by the software and the method to obtain the irs can produce realistic results the average predicted and recorded irs for the foundation and turbine installation phases are compared in fig 5 3 the error bars signify one standard deviation and represent the variation in the results it is evident in the average p50 prediction is nearly identical to the recorded irs for the foundations at 3 8 days wtg the p90 results are on average greater than the p50 and recorded irs at approximately 4 1 days wtg but are similar to the p50 values in the wtg installation phase at 3 7 days wtg compared to 3 4 days wtg for the recorded data the error bars show a considerable spread for the data in both the p50 and p90 predictions it can therefore be deduced that as the recorded average lies within the error bar of the p50 and p90 values the values show similarity to the recorded data providing further confidence in the predicted results the error bars for the pxx values are much broader in the wtg data when compared to the recorded irs and the p50 error bar has a smaller spread against the other two values for the foundation data this indicates that these probabilistic results produced by the software can over and under predict the average irs in specific cases the average p50 values are closer to the recorded irs and are only 6 greater in the wtg category as the p90 outcomes were selected to represent the upper bounds of the software predictions it was expected these values would be greater than the recorded irs yet these show good agreement with the recorded data the p90 predictions are approximately 10 greater than the recorded irs on average and demonstrate this approach can be used to produce conservative estimates 5 4 limitations and future work this paper aimed to model the scenarios vessel spreads and offshore wind farm characteristics using an offshore wind installation software as the analysis progressed it was clear a few amendments to the modelling approach may have produced a more comprehensive set of results and offered more insight in the progression of the marine operations throughout the various scenarios and rounds firstly it should be noted that all of the results presented are taken from p90 predictions from the software this implies that the predictions are somewhat pessimistic in their outlook offering 90 certainty that the values will not be exceeded it may be the case that these results do not resemble what will occur in reality although this metric does provide a good level of confidence that observed durations will be within bounds of recorded predictions it can be argued that the metric of average number of days spent per wtg hrs wtg may not be the most suitable way of depicting the ir of cable sections or burial operations but was identified to be the most applicable approach for use within the software tool the cable lay and burial durations were obtained using reference to in house planning documentation and an average installation rate was obtained by dividing the total duration by the number of turbines for the particular project in each of the simulated cases the same environmental limits are assumed for the installation tasks in both rounds however with improved vessel capabilities it is possible that the limits for the installation tasks could be extended more modern capable vessels may improve attributes such as stability and lifting capacity beyond the transit and station keeping limits considered in this study as such different environmental limits could be allocated to each round and method statements produced by installation contractors could be used to obtain variable inputs for these parameters subject to the vessel and equipment employed for installation furthermore the impact of water depth is not considered in this study the task durations could have been altered to account for this by again consulting method statements or by applying an assumed α factor in many cases an α factor may be imposed by a marine warranty surveyor mws to account for uncertainty in the forecast and or applied as a contingency in the execution of the marine operations det norske veritas 2011 the uncertainty relating to water depth could be quantified for various installation tasks and applied to obtain contingency durations it is assumed that the operational limits in this study table 3 4 are unconditional to an applied α factor and the authors believe that the task durations are to the best of their knowledge a fair representation of the values used in reality the main environmental limits that were considered for the vessels and operations in this analysis were predominantly focused on wave height and wind speed vessel transit speeds were also included to reflect the expected travel durations the software can also account for the minimum wave period s and current speeds m s however due to the lack of available data for operations and vessels the parameters were not used it would be more informative and would allow greater accuracy if these parameters were considered which would rely on input from vessel owners and experience professionals in the field additionally it is assumed throughout that all vessels are capable of remaining offshore for the entire installation campaign i e for the entire set of wtgs to be installed with the exception of those for the foundation transition piece and wtg phases set at a maximum of three phases per voyage this was selected as the number of inward and outward transits required for the remaining vessels is considerably variable in reality it is fair to suggest if the remaining vessels were allocated with a maximum number of phases per voyage a change in wdt be observed for these installation phases the vessels have specified waiting conditions in the software and when these are exceeded the vessel returns to shore this means that these vessels did not remain offshore during bad weather and it is suggested that portion of the wdt calculated for these phases will account for the time to transit to and from port it should be noted that a weather window is not sought for a vessel s outward or inter turbine voyages in the software in some instances a vessel may partially cover the distance of a voyage and is required to return to port when the weather exceeds transit limits this is a limitation of the software as a forecasting mechanism similar to weather forecasts issued in reality could be built into the software to prevent the likelihood of unsuccessful voyages and improve the authenticity of the results for the modelling of wtg installation in the software it was assumed that the associated duration was based on the bunny ear installation configuration it is of the author s interests to extent this study considering impact variable wtg installation strategies as presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 and maples et al 2013 it is noted that the sequence of the installation phases considered is not standard to all offshore wind installation projects the analysis completed is not wholly dependent on this sequence but if this was altered the results for each phase could change as these would begin at different periods in the simulated weather scenarios however as various knock on delays are incurred as a result of the consecutive scheduling approach the phases are applied at various months and seasons throughout the simulation as with many meteorological data sets a number of missing entries were discovered and as the tool is reliant on evenly spaced intervals when forecasting the weather linear interpolation was applied to compensate for these missing entries this inevitably introduces a degree of approximation within the weather forecasting that may have altered the results slightly and a complete set of entries would provide further confidence with the results the software implements suspension to the marine operations between specified sequences if the vessel is able to hold station offshore however in the interests of modelling time only one sequence was specified within each installation phase that encompassed the entire duration of all the sub tasks if the phases had been modelled with multiple embedded sequences this may have provided a higher resolution in the results and adjusted the wdt predictions as each of the phases across all the models only consisted of one sequence it is fair to presume the simulations were completed on a level basis and can be used for comparison in terms of overall vessel performance it is not advised that the predicted irs or wdt values are used as a direct reference and should only serve as reference or sense check for similar analyses the results used to formulate the irs and wdt values are initially taken from the calendar outputs produced by the software these outputs are presented in the form of dates and each completion date for the phases is a result of the duration rounded to the nearest day this indicates that the results are likely to over or under predict the phase durations but are believed to provide a good level of approximation for comparison modelling and investigation on the impact of learning rates observed by kaiser and snyder 2012 is of interest to the authors this can be modelled in the software tool and presents an intriguing expansion for this study a review on the associated costs for the wdt predictions against charter rates of the vessels would provide a helpful means to assess potential trade offs when employing particular vessels and sub contractors 6 conclusion this paper presents the application of an offshore wind farm installation simulation tool to assess the performance of vessel technology employed across offshore wind development rounds 1 and 2 in the uk the study provides a retrospective analysis on the expected performance of the vessel types employed and describes a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks we have presented the fundamental architecture and functionality of the software tool stipulating the application of monte carlo simulation in conjunction with embedded forecasting and logistical models that play out the operations across a set of stochastic weather scenarios a description of the hmm used to generate weather scenarios is provided we have explained the use of p90 exceedance probabilities in our results and the post analysis used to determine installation rates irs and weather downtime wdt values in days per wind turbine days wtg or turbine location two meteorological data sets were used and sourced form recorded and modelled data each were selected to resemble the conditions of a round 1 and 2 site in turn the variable wind farm characteristics considered within both rounds are presented in tables 3 1 3 2 in total 11 different scenarios were simulated for each round to gauge vessel performance we completed a review of the available information to ascertain the most commonly used vessel for each installation phase within the rounds a comprehensive description on the application of these vessels and the assumed installation strategies is also presented before arriving at our selected vessel spreads in table 3 3 which we believe to resemble the most commonly chartered vessel types in both rounds the operational limits and durations of the installation phases are presented in section 3 6 which dictate the wave heights and wind speeds that must be satisfied for the work to be completed at site we have proposed alteration of the task values in future analyses to account for the logistical capabilities of the vessel types investigated the influence of vessel performance is based on transit and survival limits which dictate the transit progression duration station keeping and navigation to the next turbine location the results indicate that the lowest irs and wdts are associated with round 1 which can be justified by the sheltered near shore location of these sites meaning the vessels were protected from severe weather conditions expected at rounds 2 sites this is affirmed with the results for round 2 which exhibits the largest irs and wdt values and is believed to demonstrate the limitations of the vessels employed for these installations the box plots presented in figs 4 3a d have highlighted that round 1 vessels experienced lower levels of wdt with potential for variability exhibiting uncertainty in the predicted downtimes for round 2 the variability is reduced but the wdt increases overall showing the vessels would perform more consistently but the delays experienced may be prohibitive towards the cost of each project the quantification of iqrs in the results for the two rounds has provided a view of the installation risk associated with the representative vessel spreads and highlights where precautionary strategies may be best applied to overcome costly delays the limitations of the software model construction and overall methodology has been discussed in section 5 4 we have found the ir results for the foundation and wtg installation phases in round 1 compare well with the irs recorded at a range of round 1 projects it is noted that when consecutive installation sequence is adopted start dates can be delayed and the knock on effect can induce significant downtimes in successive phases it is therefore suggested that future work could consider methodical analysis and scheduling to devise a robust master plan for an entire installation project accounting for seasonal weather conditions additionally we foresee expansion in the fragmentation of installation sequences to assess the impact of suspendability during the operations lastly the authors are interested in the cost trade offs between the predicted wdts and vessel charter costs to support planning and contracting processes acknowledgements 1 this work is funded in part by the energy technologies institute eti research councils uk rcuk

23711,marine operations play a pivotal role throughout all phases of a wind farm s life cycle in particular uncertainties associated with offshore installations can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure capex required for a given project installation costs typically account for approximately 30 of the overall project cost this study considers the installation modelling for uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool the tool is used to output time domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases by varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software the results provide a quantification of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk it is identified that the round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays the paper provides a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks to support developers and project planners keywords offshore wind installation vessel technology stochastic weather weather downtime installation risk 1 introduction 1 1 background offshore wind farm owf development has increased steadily throughout the uk over the last decade and is predicted to maintain this momentum until at least 2020 offshorewind biz 2016 renewable uk 2016 the uk has more offshore wind turbines than the whole of the rest of europe 1 5gw is currently under construction with a further 5gw of projects yet to begin development the crown estate 2015 as turbine sizes distances from shore increase weather becomes more severe and water depths span beyond 30m the logistical challenge becomes ever more prominent for prospective developers marine operations play a pivotal role throughout all phases of a wind farm s life cycle yet uncertainties associated with offshore installation can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure capex required for a given project installation costs can account for approximately 30 of the overall project cost and it is anticipated informed engineering decisions in this area present further cost saving potential krohn et al 2005 the increasing remoteness and heightened weather conditions for the uk s future owfs increases the complexity of the marine operations and the importance of making the correct decisions prior to development and sourcing of the correct vessels to complete the tasks at the beginning of the owf development in the uk in 2001 the vessels used for construction introduced bottlenecks and delays in construction this was caused by a lack in availability of specialised vessels as these were predominantly used in the oil and gas sector introducing competition for their services in some cases the vessels were oversized or not ideally suited to the operations which were often sourced at overinflated charter rates as owf development increased the industry began to manufacture purpose built offshore wind vessels that would offer more deck space cope with more severe weather and reduce overall installation durations offshore technology 2012 this paper considers the installation modelling for uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 the analysis is based on time domain predictions for the completion of key installation operations under user specified exceedance probabilities commonly used by investors to determine a project s viability and used by developers to assess their risk preferences by varying key wind farm characteristics an assessment on the performance of typical installation vessels adopted for each of the uk development rounds is investigated with the use of an owf installation decision support software tool a comparative analysis of the predicted durations between each of the two offshore wind rounds is completed this analysis will help inform planning operatives when considering vessel selection in their next project and reveal if further innovation is needed to overcome delays when developing future owfs the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a brief literature review of the most pertinent work in this field in section 3 we begin with a description of the wind farm installation software and an overview of the processes applied within the tool we then describe in section 3 3 the various sources of meteorological data used for each round and provide a justification for their selection the key owf characteristics to be varied throughout the simulations is included in section 3 4 these are applied to resemble the range of owf sizes and remoteness typically experienced within each round it is also intended that these highlight the characteristics that can significantly impact the progression of offshore installation operations and where further technological innovation can be explored section 3 5 describes the process used to identify the typical vessel spreads used in each offshore wind round and section 3 6 describes the fundamental owf installation operations and their associated environmental limits section 4 presents an overview of the results which are supported with discussion in section 5 covering the outcomes by round value to planners and future work finally a summary of our findings and relevant conclusions are presented in section 6 2 literature review the work on the modelling of logistical requirements and installation of owfs has increased over the last five years in an attempt to reduce uncertainty associated with accessing and completing work at offshore locations this type of modelling and analysis allows practitioners to review the installation of an owf in advance so that developers can prepare for certain outcomes in terms of cost or delay many authors focus on the modelling of the construction operations and subsequent weather risk analyses irawan et al 2015 look to address the scheduling issues surrounding offshore wind construction by means of an integer linear programming method to identify the optimal installation with lowest costs and shortest schedules combining weather data and vessel availability their investigation in the use of metaheuristic approaches such as variable neighbourhood search vns and simulated annealing sa was found to offer reasonable results with low computation time their approach is compared against a linear programming optimiser known as cplex which is found to identify the optimum solution but takes longer to reveal the answer others have considered the specific modelling of the logistics surrounding the installation steps where barlow et al 2015 review what vessels and operations are most susceptible to weather constraints during the installation campaign their study aims to assess the impact of operational and vessel improvements over recent times indicating that a non linear relationship exists between vessel limits and the duration of the installation it is also concluded that load out operations appear most susceptible in adverse weather conditions logistics are again the topic in the paper presented by vis and ursavas 2016 where their modelling approach reveals that the key activities impacting performance are the vessel loads distance to shore and the pre assembly strategy adopted for the main wind turbine components they recommend that a pre assembly strategy should be employed that presents the optimum choice between the lowest number of lifts possible and the maximum number of turbines that can fit on a vessel this reflects that the optimum will differ in each offshore wind project but careful consideration of these two parameters should help reveal the best solution for a given project scholz reiter et al 2011 point out that bad weather conditions are the main cause for delays in the logistics and installation of an offshore wind farm they apply their mixed integer linear programming milp model to identify the optimal installation schedule for different weather conditions and the loading operations their study considers the installation of 12 turbines across three synthetically produced weather scenarios each representing either good medium or bad weather and the tool is used to identify optimal installation schedules for the vessels they acknowledge the stochastic nature of weather conditions and express an interest in developing their tool and assess the impact of weather uncertainty beyond these initial three categories ait alla et al 2013 developed a milp model to minimise the installation costs by considering vessel utilisation and fixed costs that span the length of the installation period their approach considers the weather in a deterministic manner and reviews the outcome of two installation scenarios muhabie et al 2015 consider the use of discrete event simulation by considering weather restrictions distances vessel capabilities and assembly scenarios they consider the use of real historical weather data and generated data sets adopting a probabilistic approach the results demonstrate a good level of agreement between the two approaches when considering the average mean lead time and reference future work to optimise the fleet sizes capacities and overall installation strategies this paper evaluates the installation durations and subsequent vessel performance during the construction of an owf a probabilistic function to simulate the weather is enclosed within the adopted tool which is capable of producing a range of results under user specified exceedance probability quantiles the user defined exceedance quantiles provides an assessment of installation risk at different confidence levels this presents a key benefit over the tools reviewed in this section as it offers the adaptability to planners and investors as required the tool can simulate the full installation of an owf handled in phases and considers the environmental constraints of the operations and vessels across the predicted weather outcomes 3 methodology this paper employs an offshore wind installation software simulation tool to determine the installation duration of an offshore wind farm owf in advance moreover a focus on the predicted performance of vessel technology synonymous of typical vessel spreads used throughout the first two uk offshore wind rounds are analysed to identify the variation in installation durations and weather downtime 3 1 wind farm installation software the software tool relies on monte carlo methods to simulate multiple independent scenarios of the defined installation strategy for an offshore wind farm the tool considers risk as delays to the installation imposed by adverse weather conditions a hmm model rabiner and juang 1986 has been used to generate each meteorological scenario informed historical weather data which begins with the evaluation of a transition matrix a for the markov chain this matrix represents the evolution of the weather parameters wind speed v t wave height h t and speed of the sea current p t in this study the wind speed and wave height are the only weather conditions evaluated meteorological parameters are intrinsically stochastic but also exhibit some continuity over time therefore at any one time if the sea is in a certain state it is more likely that the next time one hour for example the sea remains in a similar state the main characteristic of a markov chain is that the next state depends only on the state at the current point in time which is described by fig 3 1 if the probability of moving from one state to another are known then it is possible to generate meteorological parameters and thus to obtain a new weather scenario each element of the transition matrix a is the probability for the arrival of state j is knowing the initial state i a is a matrix of size n n with n the number of states of the markov chain the vector π of the initial probability array of the hidden states is also determined for chain size n it is possible to obtain empirical estimates of this matrix and vector by a a i j 1 i j n and π π i 1 i n where a i j number of transitions i j number of transitions from i and π i number of observations in the state i total number of observations for a given initial state the number of arrivals of possible states is relatively low at a maximum of 30 thus the matrix a contains many zeros and forms what is called a matrix dig for each initial state i it is best to store only the non zero values a i and associated indices p i which is defined as p i j a i j 0 and a i a i j j p i once the estimated transition matrix is established the software will simulate a weather scenario over a period specified which corresponds the maximum installation duration envisaged by the user the software simulates the weather at the time i 1 knowing the state of the weather at the time i according to transition matrix the method relies on a monthly transformation in the data in order to normalise the environmental data to a stationary form which is inspired by dinwoodie et al 2012 the transformed data is assumed to be embodiment of a markov chain and the matrix a and the vector π are estimated on these transformed data after the simulation of the markov chain is applied to reconstruct the monthly outcomes into one meteorological scenario an overview of these steps is demonstrated by fig 3 2 x i k x i k 1 x i k 2 x i k 3 is regarded as the vector of three meteorological parameters for the i th observation during month number k k 1 2 12 the monthly processing carried out in the method is as follows for each of the parameters h 1 2 3 y i k h x i k h μ i k h σ i k h where μ i k h and σ i k h are the mean and standard deviation of the parameter number h over the month number k the meteorological parameters are supposed to take their values in a discrete space and have a finite number of states a given meteorological scenario is used directly within each monte carlo simulation to calculate a duration for each primary installation phase eight installation phases are considered within this study which are as follows dredging survey foundation transition piece turbine wtg scour protection pre lay grapnel run plgr cable installation and cable burial these phases include sequences that comprise of sub tasks elementary to the operations the tool allows phases to be suspended once a sequence has been completed and uses their base duration to determine if an adequate weather window is available or if the vessel should hold station offshore a weather window can be defined simply as weather conditions that are predicted to stay within the environmental limits of a sequence for a specified duration once the software has computed the predicted durations these can be processed to reveal the average installation rates irs and weather downtime wdt for each of the installation phases the p90 exceedance quantile was selected as the referenced result category providing 90 confidence that the predicted durations will not be exceeded the numerical results allow the calculation of key performance indicators kpis in this study we use the duration for each phase divided by the number of wind turbines associated to the given model to reveal an average ir in days per turbine days wtg similarly the base unweathered duration for each installation phase is deducted from the predicted duration to reveal the average weather downtime wdt that can be expected for each turbine location under the individual phases these irs and wdt values can then be generally compared between the rounds to assess the impact of vessel technology additionally the variation about the mean ir and wdt predictions can be used to estimate the installation risk that may be anticipated for each installation phase 3 2 model calculations a high level description of the methodology applied within the tool for the execution of installation phases is as follows firstly the ship to be used for an installation phase is mobilised the vessel goes offshore as soon as it s shipping weather limits are satisfied next the logistics model as outlined in fig 3 3 is used to apply the phases considering the make up sequences within each phase this process initially recognises phases that were not completed in the previous weather window and the process begins at the first of the remaining sequences otherwise the tool identifies the maximum number of phases to be handled by the vessel and if it is within these bounds the process begins with the next phase in hand it is determined if a weather window exists where the environmental limits of the next sequence are satisfied for the corresponding duration if the conditions are not satisfied the software continues to search for a suitable weather window and whilst none are available the vessel holds station this stands unless the weather conditions become worse than the waiting condition limits for the vessel meaning the vessel returns to port and awaits the next opportunity to set sail to site the completion of each sequence marks the end of the weather window search and the tool assesses if the vessel can remain on site either by the maximum number of phases or by the predicted weather conditions again if poorer weather is predicted and the environmental limits allow the vessel can hold station if the vessel is in the middle of a current phase or there are phases to complete the process starts over and searches for a window to complete the next sequence this iterative process continues and is applied to all installation phases until they are complete for each wind turbine after which the vessel for the given phase is demobilised and the next vessel begins the subsequent phase in the defined schedule finally the process is complete when the maximum number of monte carlo simulations has been reached the predicted durations for each installation phase are presented with a start and an end date these dates are recorded under user specified exceedance quantiles such as p50 p70 and p90 it is these predicted durations that are used as the main source of results in this study as presented in section 4 3 3 meteorological data meteorological data was obtained from separate hindcasts used for the two offshore wind rounds in each simulation a single metocean time series is used to inform the hmm which generates 1000 stochastic weather scenarios these scenarios provide a basis to assess the progression of the installation phases by considering the environmental limits of the sub tasks and vessels specified for each round data from teesside and greater gabbard was selected representing the conditions of round 1 and round 2 sites respectively the wind speeds in each data set are referenced at 10m teesside offshore wind farm is located off the north east coast of england and its near shore location is synonymous of a round 1 project the data set was developed by a private consultant drawing on field and modelled data to construct a metocean time series for round 2 publicly available data for the greater gabbard offshore wind farm was sourced from the crown estate s marine data exchange the crown estate 2015 greater gabbard is located off the english suffolk coast and is close to the average distance of all round 2 sites 3 4 wind farm characteristics the key owf characteristics for each project within the two offshore wind rounds have been reviewed based on the information included in renewable uk 2015 this identified mean maximum and minimum characteristic values across all of the owfs in each round the characteristics varied within the simulation tool and the values identified for each round are listed in tables 3 1 3 2 for each owf round 11 cases were simulated beginning with a mean case for all parameters and then varying one parameter at a time with either a maximum or minimum value two extreme cases are included comprising of maximum and minimum case for the number of turbines and distance to shore combined to consider the impact of start date selection three dates were selected to investigate the impact of seasonality across the two rounds april was chosen to resemble construction beginning in the spring august for summer and december for a winter start 3 5 vessel technology spreads an assessment of the vessels used across all of the owfs within the consenting rounds in renewable uk 2015 was completed to identify the typical vessel spread used at the time of installation it is accepted that the categorisation by uk offshore wind rounds does not mean all construction activities were completed within an allocated time frame as some round 2 sites were installed before round 1 projects however this classification was adopted to gauge the impact of step changes in vessel technology to identify the main vessel types used to install or planned for installation of each owf reference to the vessel listings for each respective wind farm on 4c offshore were used to populate a vessel database for each round 4c offshore ltd 2016 using the parent installation phases as a guide the vessel database for each round was then assessed to reveal the most common vessel type chartered for each phase which produced a representative vessel spread for each round it should be noted that the vessel spreads for each round included in table 3 3 are based on the transparency of information published on the 4c offshore website the provided references give more detail on the general vessel type and a full list of vessel characteristics used in the study are appended in table a 1 for each vessel type identified and listed in table 3 3 the referenced vessel specifications were used to generate approximations for the loaded and unloaded transit speeds in conjunction to survival limits for wave height and wind speed where some environmental limits were not listed on the specification sheets generic references or limits for similar vessels were used to approximate the relevant values dalgic et al 2015 douglas westwood 2013 sperstad et al 2016 thomsen 2012 van oord acz 2001 whilst this information is sufficiently detailed for modelling analysts will have more specific information from the vessel operators to plan the marine operations the commissioning phase of the wind farm which predominantly adopts crew transfer vessels ctvs to transfer technical personnel to the turbines has not been considered eight offshore installation phases are considered for analysis and are summarised in table 3 3 which specifies the installation phase and vessel used in the model set up it should be noted that all vessels are assumed to have the capacity to remain offshore to complete the work at all turbine locations with the exception of the vessels used for the foundation transition piece and wtg installation phases which are limited to a maximum of three turbine locations per voyage this limitation is discussed further in section 5 4 each phase and vessel choice for the different rounds are described in the following passage the dredging survey phase prepares or clears the seabed before the main owf construction activities begin and ensures the work has been completed to a sufficient standard dredging is not required for all projects but has been included to acknowledge some form of seabed preparation common to many sites it is assumed that the dredging phase follows on from and is prescribed by an extensive seabed survey this is completed well in advance of the main construction activities to inform project teams of any unexploded ordnances potential obstacles seabed integrity the applicable foundation type s for the site and the extent of dredging operations required a dredge vessel can be fairly simple consisting of a barge equipped with a backhoe excavator to more advanced dynamically positioned dp vessels that include trailing suction hopper technology tshd kaiser and snyder 2012 less sophisticated dredgers were used in earlier uk projects but as installations have moved further from shore developers have discarded traditional monopile foundations for gravity based or jacket structures this requires improved accuracy and subsequent manoeuvrability of the dredge vessels demanding the most advanced technology available to developers the second phase considered is the foundation installation phase from review of the vessels used for foundation works in both rounds it is evident that different types of vessels have been employed to deal with the variation or trends in foundation type used between rounds renewable uk 2015 the majority of round 1 sites adopted monopile foundations as these could be installed quite easily in the nearshore locations synonymous with the majority of these sites this type of installation can be handled on board jack up barges and dedicated wind turbine installation vessels wtivs and this type of vessel was identified as the most common vessel in round 1 round 2 sites are generally greater in size and located further from shore leading to more challenging conditions for installation this shift presented further logistical challenges and often heavy lift vessels that could deliver and install foundations were employed to reduce materials handling at the offshore locations the installation of the transition piece which is the structural section that links the monopile and wind turbine is the next installation phase the transition piece provides a fendering area for crew transfer vessels to interface with the structure and a ladder for personnel to climb onto the platform before entering the turbine for either construction or maintenance tasks it is common that the transition piece is prefabricated onto a jacket or tripod foundations but it is assumed that monopile configurations are used for the installation campaigns considered throughout in this paper the wind turbine installation phase was found to adopt some form of dedicated wtiv across in both rounds these vessel types incorporate four to six legs that rest on the seabed and elevate the main body of the wtiv above the water this protects the vessel from wave heights between 1 5 3hs depending on vessel design and helps stabilise the lifting operations these vessels are also used to transport between three to eight turbines at a time depending on the available cargo capacity and the installation strategy adopted as indicated in section 3 5 the turbine installation vessel has an assumed capacity of three turbines per voyage the whole lifting process remains sensitive to the conditions particularly wind speed and when individual blades or assembled rotor sections are hoisted the environmental limits are often lowered a number of different wtg installation strategies have been used in various projects as presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 these range from individual sub section lifts for the towers and single blades through to fully assembled turbine lifts it is assumed that the lifting strategy is identical in both rounds to limit the amount of modelling permutations considered the bunny ear configuration with a 2 stage tower lift was selected as the most applicable strategy as this presented a compromise between fully assembled and an individual component installation in this installation strategy the maximum and minimum tower sections are connected on land as with the rotor which is pre assembled consisting of a nacelle and 2 blades attached this results in a total of three lifts at the turbine location beginning with the tower then rotor and finally the third blade maples et al 2013 it should be noted that the reference duration in table 3 4 represents the approximate time to install each turbine using in the bunny ear configuration and this figure would fluctuate for each of the installation strategies presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 in round 1 jack up barges without their own means of propulsion were commonly used these vessels often have modest elevation heights and are dependent on other vessels such as anchor handling tugs ahts to transit and manoeuvre the barge to each wind turbine location self propelled jack ups started to be used in round 1 but were more commonly chartered for round 2 projects this next stage in wtiv design presented improved manoeuvrability elevation heights and deck space offering improved cargo capacities and logistical options scour protection is installed to prevent structural instability around the foundation of an offshore wind turbine induced by tidal flow or wave action the specific solution depends on the foundation selected the long term meteorological conditions and the seabed material rock dumping is often used to place variable grades of stone around foundations or protection is placed over vulnerable cable lengths in the form of concrete mattresses this phase can be completed with a hopper barge and towing tug or more commonly with a dedicated side stone dumping vessel or with more sophisticated fall pipe vessels fpv it is assumed in these analyses that the scour protection is installed around the base of the mono pile foundations the pre lay grapnel run plgr is used to clear debris along the cable route before installation ensuring that hazards do not interfere with cable laying and burial phases or during future maintenance operations offshore wind programme board 2015 a hook like anchor is pulled during this process and relies on the forward motion of the vessel to work the seabed creating a narrow trench of approximately 1m depth along the cable route a multi purpose workboat with a bollard pull of roughly 20 tons is normally used for this activity cable laying operations require a dedicated cable lay vessel clv to lay the inter array cables between the turbines and export cable to the onshore substation or from the offshore substation to the cable landfall point earlier projects often employed adapted barges that feed out cable from a pre installed cable carousel due to the near shore sheltered conditions energy institute 2014 these rely on other vessels to tow and install anchoring arrangements to keep the barge to the designated cable path as these vessels are not equipped with dynamic positioning dp systems it is assumed that this type of installation was used for the round 1 project and is modelled with a transit speed that resembles the speed of an aht of between 6 and 8 knots in some instances an adapted supply vessel was used to take advantage of the dp capabilities but for the majority of the round 2 projects specifically designed clvs were employed to cope with more extreme conditions and exposed cable routes many of these vessels can handle simultaneous laying trenching and burial operations but often a secondary vessel is assumed to complete the trenching and burial phases bard and thalemann 2011 the cable burial phase is assumed to enclose both the trenching process and final burial of the cable the study also assumes that a post lay burial operation is applied in both rounds utilising a secondary multi purpose support vessel mpsv or large survey vessels this lay and trench technique deploys an rov from the parent multi purpose vessel to trench around and bury the cable in one operation the main logistical steps of this phase are assumed to relate to the parent multi purpose vessel and a burial duration was selected on a per wind turbine basis 3 6 operations environmental limits durations to assess the vessel technology from round 1 and 2 a set installation scenario is used presented in table 3 4 to resemble a typical installation programme a number of the phases were set to run simultaneously the foundation phase was specified to begin once the dredging and survey phase had reached 60 completion the transition piece installation began when 40 of the foundation phase was completed turbine installation began after 20 of the foundations were installed scour protection follows at 80 of completion 100 for the plgr phase cable installation at 60 of the plgr phase and cable burial only begins after the cable installation had completed to 100 each of the main installation phases were allocated with environmental limits independent of the associated vessel restrictions and resemble the maximum conditions that can be experienced when completing these offshore operations separate from vessel capabilities the same task parameters are assumed in both rounds which are to the author s best knowledge and experience a fair representation of the expected values for these installation operations it is reiterated that separate environmental limits exist for the different vessels in terms of transit and waiting modes as soon as the weather conditions are below a vessel s transit limits the vessel will set sail to the offshore site the transit time is calculated simply by dividing the distance between the farm and the port by the vessel speed if at any point the weather conditions exceed the transiting limits during an outward or inter turbine voyage the vessel returns to port when the transit duration has been completed the vessel is on site and the software calls on the limits and durations applied to the installation phases this determines if a sufficient weather window exists to start an installation sequence or if the vessel should wait for the next available weather window if the waiting conditions of the vessel are satisfied three main characteristics are used for each installation step within the models 1 reference duration average number of hours spent per wtg 2 maximum wind speed m s and 3 maximum wave height m reference to available literature such as maples et al 2013 douglas westwood 2013 and in house planning documentation was used to establish the base installation durations wind speeds and wave heights for each phase listed in table 3 4 4 results to assess the impact of vessel technology on construction durations for offshore wind farms the scenarios in section 3 4 were applied using the simulation tool described in section 3 1 for both wind rounds 11 cases were constructed initially taking one mean case of all parameters eight cases where each parameter was run with an maximum and minimum value in turn and two extreme cases combining a maximum and minimum situation for the number of turbines and distance to shore the main characteristics of the vessels under analysis are the transit and survival limits which are composed of a maximum wave height and wind speed as listed in table a 1 the transit speeds of each vessel for loaded and unloaded states are also specified an overview of the vessel spreads used for each round is included in table 3 3 each simulation is run for a 1000 iterations to obtain sufficiently accurate results the average simualtion time for a round one case was 1 day and 1 6 days for round two for each of the individual 11 cases the software produces a calendar output for all installation phases recorded under user specified exceedance quantiles the predicted duration for each installation phase is presented with a start and an end date meaning the results are rounded to the nearest day the p90 duration quantile was selected for analysis in this study as it provides greater certainty that the predicted values will not be exceeded when conducting these type of operations offshore the predicted p90 duration for each phase are divided by the number of turbines specified in each case to reveal the average installation rate ir in days per turbine days wtg the ir represents the average number of days required to complete the installation task at each turbine in the model including the impact of weather delay to demonstrate how these results can be used in practice an average result for weather downtime wdt is calculated by deducting the base duration from the predicted p90 duration for the phases in each case the base duration in each phase is calculated using the net time to complete the installation tasks without the impact of weather delay and multiplying this by the number of turbines in each case the resulting wdt duration is once again divided by the number of turbines for each case to reveal a wdt value for the individual installation phases in days wtg within each case eight ir and wdt values are collected corresponding with the number installation phases for each round a total of 11 cases were collected and an average ir and wdt for the eight installation phases was computed from this compilation as shown in figs 4 1 and 4 2 as discussed in section 3 1 the deviation from these averages is regarded as a means to estimate the installation risk in the potential outcomes box plots that show the variation in the results are presented in figs 4 3 a to d and a comparison of the recorded variation in each phase in both rounds is included in fig 5 3 the greatest variability in the results were observed for the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation phases as represented by the larger bars in fig 5 3 this indicates that the greatest risk is estimated to occur within these phases although the round 2 figures demonstrate lower deviation despite higher durations 4 1 results overview the ir for each of the eight phases was used to compare the differences between the vessel spreads of each round fig 4 1 presents a summary of the installation rates in days per wind turbine days wtg the results in fig 4 1 show that round 1 is predicted to have the smallest irs with the largest recorded for the dredging and survey foundation and wtg installation phases predicted to be around 4 2 4 1 and 3 6 days wtg respectively the results for round 2 show the greatest irs and the largest are again recorded for the same phases at 5 4 4 4 and 6 3 days wtg respectively it can be generalised that round 1 appears to outperform round 2 vessels in terms of installation rate by approximately 25 on average across the eight installation phases the biggest difference between round 1 and 2 is seen with the dregde survey phase at around 1 day wtg and the wtg installation phase at approximately 2 5 days wtg as a direct consequence of the results presented in fig 4 1 knowing the base duration for each of the installation phases allows for the amount of wdt to be identified the weather delay expected on average for each phase between the two rounds is presented in fig 4 2 this confirms that the greatest delays are observed in the round 2 phases this process presents a method for predicting the average wdt for each installation phase if this approach was used to analyse a case specific simulation built to match the characteristics of a prospective development this would provide a basis to scale the results by the number of turbines and reveal an approximate overall wdt for each installation phase 4 2 results by round the results for the individual rounds were further analysed to determine the distribution of phase durations predicted by the software the box plots of the irs and wdts in each round have been aligned in figs 4 3a to d in terms of wdt figs 4 36c and d demonstrate the same range of distribution as the irs but at lower values a plot of the quantification of the inter quartile ranges for the irs and wdts from each phase across the two rounds is included in fig 5 1 2 and is used to demonstrate the spread in the results which can be used to signify the installation risk for the combined vessel phase configurations this is calculated by simply subtracting the bounds of the first quartile from the third quartile for each of the installation phases in rounds 1 and 2 fig 4 3a demonstrates a considerable range for the installation phases in round 1 particularly in the wind turbine wtg transition piece and foundation installation steps as demonstrated by the broad space taken by the interquartile range iqr the variability of these irs span from approximately 2 4 to 5 5 days wtg with an iqr of about 3 days wtg for the foundations 1 4 3 9 days wtg with an iqr of 2 3 days wtg for the transition pieces and 1 9 5 3 wtg days with an iqr of 3 4 days wtg for the turbines all of the phases demonstrates a skew towards the upper values of the data the dredging survey cable installation and cable burial phases exhibit lower variance in the results and a nominal range was predicted for the scour and plgr stages with the majority of these phases taking 1 day or less per wind turbine fig 4 3c shows similar variance between the round 1 ir and weather downtime predictions wdt based on the results in fig 4 3a it can be expected that the greatest ranges would be seen at the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation phases at 0 4 3 6 days wtg with an iqr of 3 days wtg 0 4 2 8 days wtg with an iqr of 2 3 days wtg and 0 8 4 3 days wtg with an iqr of 3 2 days wtg respectively again the medians for these phases are skewed towards the upper data in the plots the distribution of all phases in fig 4 3c have a near identical profile as seen the irs the scour and pglr phases are predicted to have the lowest wdts and subsequent wdt in round 1 without much variation while the three key phases of the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation present the highest values in terms of delay fig 4 3b shows generally smaller ranges for the results when compared to round 1 the broadest iqr distributions relate to the dredging survey transition piece and wind turbine phases at 0 5 0 4 and 0 45 days wtg respectively the foundation and transition piece installations have an overall range of approximately 2 days wtg and the largest recorded for the wtg installation at 4 days wtg the same distribution profiles are again replicated in the wdt plots shown in fig 4 3d and once more the scour protection and plgr phases demonstrate the lower weather downtime the dredging survey foundation and wtg installation phases are shown to have the largest values in terms of wdt generally it was found that the installation rates and wdt predicted for the phases in round 2 are higher in comparison to round 1 however the results seem more consistent as the distributions are quite narrow and this smaller variation indicates a reduction in installation risk 5 discussion the outcomes and reasoning surrounding the results is covered in this section we begin with the installation rates and wdt values included in figs 4 1 and 4 2 which list the average result for the various scenarios within each installation phase across the two rounds the results used to draw these averages were compiled separately to allow analysis by rounds and review of the scenarios that resulted in the largest recorded durations 5 1 vessel performance by round the most notable average results from each round is covered in the following sections and considers the source of these outcomes including the contribution of each installation phase towards the averages obtained 5 1 1 round 1 in round 1 the average total of construction days spent per wind turbine which includes all phases across all scenarios are the lowest for both rounds at 20 23 days wtg this is complemented with a wdt figure of 10 21 days wtg on average and both exhibit a standard deviation of 3 2 days wtg despite the adoption of less dedicated and specialised vessels on the market it appears that round 1 sites benefit from their near shore locations this characteristic provides more sheltered conditions during construction reduces the impact of weather on the vessels and subsequent delays however in round 1 projects the averaged results suggest that over 50 of the charter time for the vessels would likely be attributed to downtime the average combined construction duration was found to be 403 days which required a total of 640 individual boat days relating to the overlap of phases described in section 3 6 these outcomes arrived at approximate weather downtime value of 328 days per project on average a review of the individual phases revealed that the wind turbine installation phase makes the largest contribution to downtime recorded at 26 the case which caused the largest impact in terms of ir and wdt was the mean case at 23 6 days wtg for ir and 13 6 days wtg for wdt these were closely followed by very similar results for the distance to shore inter turbine distance cases at around 23 24 days wtg ir and 13 14 days wtg wdt the lowest predicted duration was seen with the lower number of turbines scenario at 16 days wtg and 6 days wtg for ir and wdt respectively it was expected that the maximum distance to shore and number of turbine cases would result in greatest recorded irs and wdts however as the number of turbines or distances in the model increase so does the elapsed time for each phase and delays gradually shift the start date of successive phases this suggests that seasonal conditions can be incurred at different moments during different phases of an installation campaign stemming from the size of the project to be completed for example the start date recorded for wtg installation in the case with the minimum number of turbines was 11 08 2017 whilst the start date for the maximum number of turbine cases was 12 05 2018 despite this dramatic shift due to the size of project the start date for maximum number of turbine case is in may it is likely that the weather conditions were more favourable in may than in august this observation is further exemplified by the results for the start date cases which have the same characteristics as the mean case but with a different date defined for the launch of the first phase the results recorded for the upper start date case starting 01 04 2017 are the second lowest recorded at 16 8 days wtg for ir and 6 8 days wtg for wdt it is also suggested that the weather downtime will increase if the vessel employed for each installation phase has to return to base to reload various components as is the case for the foundation transition piece and wtg vessels in this study referring to the box plots in figs 4 3a and c it is evident that many of the phases are quite variable in terms of ir and wdt with the largest spread of values observed for the foundation transition piece and wind turbine installation the large variation shown in fig 5 1 2 signifies a lack of consistency in the ir and wdt values for each scenario and indicate a significant amount of installation risk that could be expected for these phases throughout round 1 this suggests that the vessels employed for these three phases at the time of round 1 were susceptible to variations in their working climate exemplified by the broad spread of values for the phases described above 5 1 2 round 2 round 2 vessels are predicted to have the largest average irs and wdt values between the two rounds the average ir across all scenarios is 25 4 days wtg and 15 4 days wtg for the average wdt with a standard deviation of 2 17 days for both this deviation is lower than round 1 and it can be said that the installation risk is lower with the round 2 vessels overall the average wdt value represents an increase of 50 compared to round 1 these initial outcomes convey the impact of more challenging offshore conditions typically experienced at these sites the results indicate that on average over 60 of the entire vessel charter period would experience weather downtime suggesting developers could have faced a significant bill for downtime for projects with similarities to this category the average and combined construction duration was predicted to be around 1384 days per project requiring a large number of separate boat days in excess of 2300 days combined the average wdt value for all the scenarios in round 2 was just over 1260 days per project reference to the individual phases revealed that the wtg installation phase again made the largest contribution to overall wdt recorded at nearly 34 of all downtime on average which is a considerable increase compared to round 1 this implies that the typical turbine installation vessel employed during round 2 was generally not ideally suited to the heightened weather conditions typical of more challenging waters further from shore the scenario found to have the largest impact in ir and wdt was the lower number of wind turbines case with values of 29 67 days wtg and 19 62 days wtg respectively the scenario with the least impact in the round 2 predictions is the maximum start date 01 04 2017 with an ir of 23 days wtg and wdt value of approximately 13 days this outcome is surprising as it may be expected that with less turbines the installation rates may be better or at least stay the same it is noted that for larger wind farms that the weather delays are averaged across a greater number of turbines which may compensate the wdt predictions it is again proposed that the impact of successive scheduling can dramatically change the amount of downtime experienced relating to the changing seasonal weather conditions as there are less turbines in the minimum wtg case this means phases such as the wtg installation would be reached sooner and could be completed in more severe weather conditions in comparison to larger projects that may not reach the most susceptible phases until a calmer weather season is incurred to exemplify the wtg installation start date for the case with the minimum number of turbines was recorded as 11 11 2017 and for the maximum start date case as 01 06 2018 it is again likely the weather was less severe in june than in november it therefore suggested that a consecutive installation schedule as applied in this study may not be the optimum approach when planning offshore wind farm construction it is apparent that the majority of phases experienced an increase in wdt on average and again the wtg installation phase has shown a 97 increase in average downtime in comparison to round 1 notably the scour protection conveys a 250 increase a 100 increase in plgr 58 for cable installation and approximately 40 45 increase for the dredging and cable burial phases two wdts found to increase slightly are the foundation and transition piece installation each confirming an approximate increase of 8 and 13 respectively on average it is proposed that the vessels in round 2 were not well suited to the conditions associated with these sites which relates to the vessel types commonly chartered at this time it is proposed that vessel availability restrictions are demonstrated in round 2 as over sized and weather sensitive heavy lift vessels were commonly employed these vessels were used for phases such as foundation or transition piece installations and originated from other offshore industries matched with inflated daily charter rates it would be appropriate to apply a cost benefit analysis when considering the charter of these vessels in comparison to the resulting wdt costs that may be expected from more capable but less available vessels in the market in some cases developers may have struggled to source a cheaper alternative with the improved capabilities and to some extent this demonstrates that optimum vessel designs were not available or had yet to be built during the construction of round 2 sites thus focus on the development of dedicated wind farm installation vessels was essential to the industry at this time the box plots in figs 4 3b and d show significantly less variation in comparison to round 1 this suggests that despite an overall increase in wdt on average the vessels employed for round 2 performed more consistently and therefore a reduction in the installation risk is observed in fig 5 1 2 this means more certainty could be drawn from wdt predictions but the challenge in reducing the overall magnitude of these delays was still a concern the scour protection and plgr phases still exhibit fairly low ir and wdt values compared to round 1 but the plots demonstrate more variability in the results which suggests these vessels may perform less consistently when used in more challenging conditions 5 2 value to planning personnel the presented approach is of interest to planning personnel as a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks whilst the study and simulation do not relate to any specific project it has provided a basis to schedule vessel missions based on the bounds of the two installation rounds ensuring efficient low cost installation strategies is essential if offshore wind is to make a meaningful cost effective contribution to the uk s energy mix aiming for a levelised cost under 100 mwh the crown estate 2012 many of the delays identified have been tackled by introducing innovative vessel designs made to cope with more extreme weather conditions and increased deck space or lifting capabilities this paper has assessed the environmental capabilities of the vessels and attempts identify their susceptibility to various project characteristics to help reduce the costs of this industry and offer guidance on vessel charter as the study has been compartmentalised by uk offshore wind rounds 1 and 2 it is intended that operatives can benchmark these findings against the outcome of their own projects and compare vessel performance predictions this study provides a clear indication of the installation risks for the vessel spreads used in each round and the phases predicted to have the largest installation risk highlight areas where precautionary or mitigation steps may be required when chartering vessels with similar capabilities a method to approximate the wdt for each installation phase is discussed in section 4 1 it is demonstrated that the selection of the vessels identified in round 1 for a site of this category would generally result in lower weather downtimes but there may be significant variation in the foundation transition piece and turbine installation phases the vessels specified for round 2 exhibit considerably less variation but larger weather downtimes compared to round 1 this result proposes that more modern vessels should perform more consistently management could take more certainty on their predicted wdt figures if they opt for and can access the most sophisticated vessels available it is also found that periodic scheduling of installation phases should be considered when conducting an offshore wind development the consecutive nature of the phases employed within this study has revealed that the larger less accessible projects may not experience the greatest downtime as a result of shifted schedules from delays incurred during earlier phases we have demonstrated the effect of successive scheduling of installation phases in these type of models as delays incurred earlier in the project can shift the start date of phases waiting to begin it is therefore suggested that individual models are primarily constructed for each installation phase with a preferable or predicted start date the effects of different start dates could be assessed by the individual models and would aid planners in the construction of a master installation schedule compromising between the impact of delays and preferred installation periods to generalise these perspectives round 1 vessel technology exhibits the lowest wdt although a considerable amount of variation in the observed delays may occur if employed for more remote unsheltered locations the vessels employed for round 2 offer more certainty as the results appear more consistent but are predicted to experience larger wdts this demonstrated that despite the adoption of a more standardised approach for these projects there was an opportunity to reduce the wdt figures with more sophisticated and capable vessels 5 3 data validation the irs presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 were used to complete a validation of the adopted method and analyses within this reference the kaiser et al list observed irs days wtg for foundations and wind turbines from eight uk round 1 wind farms these values are presented in a boat days basis which represent the entire time spent per vessel for each foundation and turbine installation in days wtg this metric provides a suitable base for comparison and as these phases were predicted to have some of largest weather downtimes in fig 4 2 it should provide an interesting reference unfortunately the authors are unaware of any other available data set that presents the remaining installation phases in this manner p50 predictions were also computed during the simulations completed for this study and the p50 irs were obtained using the same approach in section 4 the average p90 and p50 prediction for the foundation and wtg phases are compared against the average irs recorded across various round 1 sites in fig 5 2 an initial review of the data demonstrates that the average round 1 predictions both p90 and p50 are of similar order to the recorded values for the round 1 site this gives an indication that the predictions produced by the software and the method to obtain the irs can produce realistic results the average predicted and recorded irs for the foundation and turbine installation phases are compared in fig 5 3 the error bars signify one standard deviation and represent the variation in the results it is evident in the average p50 prediction is nearly identical to the recorded irs for the foundations at 3 8 days wtg the p90 results are on average greater than the p50 and recorded irs at approximately 4 1 days wtg but are similar to the p50 values in the wtg installation phase at 3 7 days wtg compared to 3 4 days wtg for the recorded data the error bars show a considerable spread for the data in both the p50 and p90 predictions it can therefore be deduced that as the recorded average lies within the error bar of the p50 and p90 values the values show similarity to the recorded data providing further confidence in the predicted results the error bars for the pxx values are much broader in the wtg data when compared to the recorded irs and the p50 error bar has a smaller spread against the other two values for the foundation data this indicates that these probabilistic results produced by the software can over and under predict the average irs in specific cases the average p50 values are closer to the recorded irs and are only 6 greater in the wtg category as the p90 outcomes were selected to represent the upper bounds of the software predictions it was expected these values would be greater than the recorded irs yet these show good agreement with the recorded data the p90 predictions are approximately 10 greater than the recorded irs on average and demonstrate this approach can be used to produce conservative estimates 5 4 limitations and future work this paper aimed to model the scenarios vessel spreads and offshore wind farm characteristics using an offshore wind installation software as the analysis progressed it was clear a few amendments to the modelling approach may have produced a more comprehensive set of results and offered more insight in the progression of the marine operations throughout the various scenarios and rounds firstly it should be noted that all of the results presented are taken from p90 predictions from the software this implies that the predictions are somewhat pessimistic in their outlook offering 90 certainty that the values will not be exceeded it may be the case that these results do not resemble what will occur in reality although this metric does provide a good level of confidence that observed durations will be within bounds of recorded predictions it can be argued that the metric of average number of days spent per wtg hrs wtg may not be the most suitable way of depicting the ir of cable sections or burial operations but was identified to be the most applicable approach for use within the software tool the cable lay and burial durations were obtained using reference to in house planning documentation and an average installation rate was obtained by dividing the total duration by the number of turbines for the particular project in each of the simulated cases the same environmental limits are assumed for the installation tasks in both rounds however with improved vessel capabilities it is possible that the limits for the installation tasks could be extended more modern capable vessels may improve attributes such as stability and lifting capacity beyond the transit and station keeping limits considered in this study as such different environmental limits could be allocated to each round and method statements produced by installation contractors could be used to obtain variable inputs for these parameters subject to the vessel and equipment employed for installation furthermore the impact of water depth is not considered in this study the task durations could have been altered to account for this by again consulting method statements or by applying an assumed α factor in many cases an α factor may be imposed by a marine warranty surveyor mws to account for uncertainty in the forecast and or applied as a contingency in the execution of the marine operations det norske veritas 2011 the uncertainty relating to water depth could be quantified for various installation tasks and applied to obtain contingency durations it is assumed that the operational limits in this study table 3 4 are unconditional to an applied α factor and the authors believe that the task durations are to the best of their knowledge a fair representation of the values used in reality the main environmental limits that were considered for the vessels and operations in this analysis were predominantly focused on wave height and wind speed vessel transit speeds were also included to reflect the expected travel durations the software can also account for the minimum wave period s and current speeds m s however due to the lack of available data for operations and vessels the parameters were not used it would be more informative and would allow greater accuracy if these parameters were considered which would rely on input from vessel owners and experience professionals in the field additionally it is assumed throughout that all vessels are capable of remaining offshore for the entire installation campaign i e for the entire set of wtgs to be installed with the exception of those for the foundation transition piece and wtg phases set at a maximum of three phases per voyage this was selected as the number of inward and outward transits required for the remaining vessels is considerably variable in reality it is fair to suggest if the remaining vessels were allocated with a maximum number of phases per voyage a change in wdt be observed for these installation phases the vessels have specified waiting conditions in the software and when these are exceeded the vessel returns to shore this means that these vessels did not remain offshore during bad weather and it is suggested that portion of the wdt calculated for these phases will account for the time to transit to and from port it should be noted that a weather window is not sought for a vessel s outward or inter turbine voyages in the software in some instances a vessel may partially cover the distance of a voyage and is required to return to port when the weather exceeds transit limits this is a limitation of the software as a forecasting mechanism similar to weather forecasts issued in reality could be built into the software to prevent the likelihood of unsuccessful voyages and improve the authenticity of the results for the modelling of wtg installation in the software it was assumed that the associated duration was based on the bunny ear installation configuration it is of the author s interests to extent this study considering impact variable wtg installation strategies as presented in kaiser and snyder 2012 and maples et al 2013 it is noted that the sequence of the installation phases considered is not standard to all offshore wind installation projects the analysis completed is not wholly dependent on this sequence but if this was altered the results for each phase could change as these would begin at different periods in the simulated weather scenarios however as various knock on delays are incurred as a result of the consecutive scheduling approach the phases are applied at various months and seasons throughout the simulation as with many meteorological data sets a number of missing entries were discovered and as the tool is reliant on evenly spaced intervals when forecasting the weather linear interpolation was applied to compensate for these missing entries this inevitably introduces a degree of approximation within the weather forecasting that may have altered the results slightly and a complete set of entries would provide further confidence with the results the software implements suspension to the marine operations between specified sequences if the vessel is able to hold station offshore however in the interests of modelling time only one sequence was specified within each installation phase that encompassed the entire duration of all the sub tasks if the phases had been modelled with multiple embedded sequences this may have provided a higher resolution in the results and adjusted the wdt predictions as each of the phases across all the models only consisted of one sequence it is fair to presume the simulations were completed on a level basis and can be used for comparison in terms of overall vessel performance it is not advised that the predicted irs or wdt values are used as a direct reference and should only serve as reference or sense check for similar analyses the results used to formulate the irs and wdt values are initially taken from the calendar outputs produced by the software these outputs are presented in the form of dates and each completion date for the phases is a result of the duration rounded to the nearest day this indicates that the results are likely to over or under predict the phase durations but are believed to provide a good level of approximation for comparison modelling and investigation on the impact of learning rates observed by kaiser and snyder 2012 is of interest to the authors this can be modelled in the software tool and presents an intriguing expansion for this study a review on the associated costs for the wdt predictions against charter rates of the vessels would provide a helpful means to assess potential trade offs when employing particular vessels and sub contractors 6 conclusion this paper presents the application of an offshore wind farm installation simulation tool to assess the performance of vessel technology employed across offshore wind development rounds 1 and 2 in the uk the study provides a retrospective analysis on the expected performance of the vessel types employed and describes a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks we have presented the fundamental architecture and functionality of the software tool stipulating the application of monte carlo simulation in conjunction with embedded forecasting and logistical models that play out the operations across a set of stochastic weather scenarios a description of the hmm used to generate weather scenarios is provided we have explained the use of p90 exceedance probabilities in our results and the post analysis used to determine installation rates irs and weather downtime wdt values in days per wind turbine days wtg or turbine location two meteorological data sets were used and sourced form recorded and modelled data each were selected to resemble the conditions of a round 1 and 2 site in turn the variable wind farm characteristics considered within both rounds are presented in tables 3 1 3 2 in total 11 different scenarios were simulated for each round to gauge vessel performance we completed a review of the available information to ascertain the most commonly used vessel for each installation phase within the rounds a comprehensive description on the application of these vessels and the assumed installation strategies is also presented before arriving at our selected vessel spreads in table 3 3 which we believe to resemble the most commonly chartered vessel types in both rounds the operational limits and durations of the installation phases are presented in section 3 6 which dictate the wave heights and wind speeds that must be satisfied for the work to be completed at site we have proposed alteration of the task values in future analyses to account for the logistical capabilities of the vessel types investigated the influence of vessel performance is based on transit and survival limits which dictate the transit progression duration station keeping and navigation to the next turbine location the results indicate that the lowest irs and wdts are associated with round 1 which can be justified by the sheltered near shore location of these sites meaning the vessels were protected from severe weather conditions expected at rounds 2 sites this is affirmed with the results for round 2 which exhibits the largest irs and wdt values and is believed to demonstrate the limitations of the vessels employed for these installations the box plots presented in figs 4 3a d have highlighted that round 1 vessels experienced lower levels of wdt with potential for variability exhibiting uncertainty in the predicted downtimes for round 2 the variability is reduced but the wdt increases overall showing the vessels would perform more consistently but the delays experienced may be prohibitive towards the cost of each project the quantification of iqrs in the results for the two rounds has provided a view of the installation risk associated with the representative vessel spreads and highlights where precautionary strategies may be best applied to overcome costly delays the limitations of the software model construction and overall methodology has been discussed in section 5 4 we have found the ir results for the foundation and wtg installation phases in round 1 compare well with the irs recorded at a range of round 1 projects it is noted that when consecutive installation sequence is adopted start dates can be delayed and the knock on effect can induce significant downtimes in successive phases it is therefore suggested that future work could consider methodical analysis and scheduling to devise a robust master plan for an entire installation project accounting for seasonal weather conditions additionally we foresee expansion in the fragmentation of installation sequences to assess the impact of suspendability during the operations lastly the authors are interested in the cost trade offs between the predicted wdts and vessel charter costs to support planning and contracting processes acknowledgements 1 this work is funded in part by the energy technologies institute eti research councils uk rcuk

23712,in this article reinforcement learning is used to obtain optimal reactive control of a two body point absorber in particular the q learning algorithm is adopted for the maximization of the energy extraction in each sea state the controller damping and stiffness coefficients are varied in steps observing the associated reward which corresponds to an increase in the absorbed power or penalty owing to large displacements the generated power is averaged over a time horizon spanning several wave cycles due to the periodicity of ocean waves discarding the transient effects at the start of each new episode the model of a two body point absorber is developed in order to validate the control strategy in both regular and irregular waves in all analysed sea states the controller learns the optimal damping and stiffness coefficients furthermore the scheme is independent of internal models of the device response which means that it can adapt to variations in the unit dynamics with time and does not suffer from modelling errors keywords reinforcement learning rl q learning reactive control point absorber wave energy converter wec 1 introduction wave power is a renewable energy resource that can considerably contribute to the future energy generation thus reducing society s dependence on fossil fuels although a potential of up to 2 1tw of power has been estimated globally gunn and stock williams 2012 wave energy converter wec devices are not economically viable yet despite a large number of different designs having been suggested falcão 2010 the design of an effective control strategy is fundamental in order to address this problem since it can result in substantial gains in absorbed energy without additional hardware costs over the years different control strategies have been proposed for the maximization of power extraction of wecs a review of the first studies can be found in salter et al 2002 while ringwood et al 2014 presents a review of recent techniques from hydrodynamic considerations complex conjugate control would theoretically provide optimal energy absorption by achieving resonance between the wec and the incident waves salter et al 2002 nevertheless delivering optimal control may be infeasible in reality due to the associated excessive motions and loads in extreme waves hence alternative suboptimal control schemes have been implemented which include physical constraints on the motions forces and power rating of the device ringwood et al 2014 latching declutching model predictive and simple but effective control are instances of real time wec control schemes firstly suggested by budal and falnes 1977 latching control achieves resonance conditions by adjusting the time period when the machine is locked in place through a dedicated mechanism babarit et al 2004 babarit and clément 2006 during the remaining part of the wave cycle the device motions are linearly damped declutching control presents a similar concept but in this case the power take off pto system is disconnected during part of the wave cycle through a by pass valve with hydraulic ptos as opposed to being fixed in place babarit et al 2009 model predictive control applies at each time step the force that is expected to result in maximum energy absorption over a future time horizon brekken 2011 hals et al 2011 li and belmont 2014a richter et al 2014 simple but effective control obtains an estimate for the optimal controller force by modelling the current excitation force as a narrow banded function fusco and ringwood 2013 these control strategies can include constrains on the motions and loading of wecs while it is hard to scale latching control to farms of wecs model predictive control has been successfully implemented for multi body devices and even small array problems richter et al 2013 oetinger and magaña 2014 li and belmont 2014b amann and magaña 2015 oetinger et al 2015 however model predictive control presents high computational requirements simple but effective control results in similar performance but with a simpler implementation ringwood et al 2014 nevertheless these methods are strongly affected by the accuracy of the prediction of the future wave excitation force usually over a short time horizon as well as of the model of the machine dynamics ringwood et al 2014 resistive and reactive control represent alternative types of schemes that rely on time averaged sea states so that stationary wave conditions are assumed salter et al 2002 numerical simulations are performed so as to obtain the pto damping resistive control or combination of damping and stiffness reactive control that result in maximum energy absorption in each sea state nambiar 2015 it is possible to include force saturation within the numerical model and displacement constraints in the cost function on the one hand these techniques may present a lower efficiency as compared with on line control schemes on the other hand resistive and reactive control are conceptually simple to understand and they present much lower computational costs than real time methods furthermore they are easily scalable to multi body or multiple device problems as for instance shown by nambiar 2015 the aforementioned schemes suffer from a significant problem the optimal control action is determined based on internal models of the body dynamics therefore modelling errors can severely affect the performance of these algorithms with significant drops in efficiency in addition these control strategies do not account for changes in the device dynamics over time e g due to slow marine growth or sudden non critical subsystem failures for these reasons the authors have proposed the application of reinforcement learning rl to resistive control in a previous work anderlini 2016 with this machine learning algorithm the controller learns the optimal pto damping coefficient in every sea state directly from experience penalties for large displacements are included to prevent failures in extreme waves in this article the developed control strategy based on rl is generalised to reactive control although wecs are expected to be deployed in arrays so as to exploit the advantage of economies of scale nambiar 2015 we consider a single axisymmetric device for simplicity in particular a more realistic wec than that in anderlini 2016 is analysed a two body point absorber similar to the reference model 3 in neary and previsic 2014 previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 point absorbers which extract energy by resisting the motions of a small floating body subject to wave loading through a pto system represent a well understood and simple offshore wec technology falcão 2010 the performance of the algorithm is assessed in both regular and irregular waves 2 optimal reactive control of a point absorber 2 1 system description in this work the reference model 3 point absorber developed by sandia national laboratories is used as a case study this decision is based on its realistic design while it is still possible to approximate its motions with a simple model furthermore it is well documented in the literature the development of the wec is described in neary and previsic 2014 in detail previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 present experimental measurements that have been used to quantify its performance the device is a floating moored axisymmetric point absorber that comprises of two bodies whose relative motion due to wave excitation results in absorbed energy the selected point absorber features a hydraulic pto system as shown in fig 1 as envisioned by neary and previsic 2014 the mechanical energy associated with the relative motion between the float and the reaction plate is converted into electrical energy through a hydraulic stage the advantages of a hydraulic pto unit whose design is inspired by henderson 2006 falcão 2007 forehand et al 2016 are its robustness capacity for energy storage and speed control furthermore no expensive fully rated power converters are necessary because through the pto system it is possible to control the output current forehand et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the point absorber comprises of two bodies a float and a reaction plate connected to a vertical spar the wave excitation causes the float and reaction plate to move however the oscillations of the reaction plate present a much lower magnitude than the float because of the higher inertia viscous drag and depth of the plate hence the motion difference is used to drive a two way single degree of freedom ram that pumps high pressure oil into the circuit a rectifying valve prevents flow reversal furthermore the flow is smoothed out through a gas accumulator system in the reference model 3 neary and previsic 2014 this comprises of four high pressure hp cylinders and a low pressure reservoir designed to prevent cavitation forehand et al 2016 the flow drives a hydraulic motor which is connected to an induction generator the produced electrical power is fed into the national grid after the voltage is stepped up through a transformer as can be seen from fig 1 the input variables to the controller are the generated power p the displacement and velocity at the pto x pto and x pto respectively and the wave elevation ζ from which the sea state is derived the controller then adjusts the flow in the hydraulic circuit by opening or closing the valves connected to the accumulators this corresponds to changing the damping and stiffness in the system 2 2 optimum reactive control in reactive control the controller force is calculated as the sum of a damping and a stiffness term 19 1 f pto t b pto x pto t c pto x pto t where x pto is the displacement at the pto it is assumed that the pto damping and stiffness coefficients b pto and c pto respectively can be modified by changing the pressure within the hydraulic circuit by varying b pto and c pto directly the developed algorithm can be easily applied also to other pto systems such as electromechanical or direct drive in reality the pto force is saturated with a limit f max due to the generator rating as shown in fig 6 in section 4 1 the generated power p can be calculated as 2 p gen t f pto t x pto t and the power fed into the grid is given by 3 p t η p gen if p gen 0 a p gen η if p gen 0 b for simplicity in 3 a single measure is employed for the overall efficiency of the pto unit η 80 neary and previsic 2014 in 2 p gen is the generated power from 3 it is clear that with reactive control not only is power extracted from the waves but during part of the wave cycle it is also fed into the environment in order to increase the motions of the device through resonance and thus increase energy absorption salter et al 2002 from this behaviour comes the name of the algorithm reactive control the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients that result in maximum energy extraction depend on the wave period in regular waves tedeschi et al 2011 or the energy wave period t e in irregular waves if the force saturation is included the optimum b pto and c pto values become also functions of the significant wave height h s similarly the maximum displacement at the pto which is of interest to prevent failures in extreme waves is also a function of the sea state given by h s and t e the state of the art optimum reactive control algorithm employs a tabular approach where the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients are stored in a table for the main sea states that are encountered at the operational site given by the combinations of a number of discrete values of b pto and c pto during the operation of the wec the controller tries to achieve the prescribed pto stiffness and damping coefficients in the current sea state through the hydraulic pto system the optimal coefficients are usually pre calculated using an optimization algorithm such as the nelder mead simplex algorithm as in nambiar 2015 with a time domain hydrodynamic model for this reason this technique can be affected by modelling errors and it cannot account for changes in the device response with time e g due to ageing or marine biofouling 3 reinforcement learning control in reinforcement learning the controller learns an optimal behaviour or policy from direct interaction with the environment in this work the on line off policy q learning algorithm sutton and barto 1998 is selected as in anderlini 2016 with this strategy at each time step n the agent which is in a specific state s n selects an action a n as a result of the interaction with the surrounding environment the controller lands in a new state s n 1 while observing a reward r n 1 which depends on the outcome of the chosen action the action selection modelled as a markov decision process depends on the value function which is a measure of the expected future reward by considering present as well as future rewards rl is able to learn the optimal policy with time for the maximization of the total reward sutton and barto 1998 model free rl techniques employ the action value table q which presents an entry for every combination of discrete states and actions for instance q s n a n represents the action value for the current state and action the one step update of the q learning algorithm is given by sutton and barto 1998 4 q n 1 s n a n q n s n a n α n r n 1 γ max a a q n s n 1 a q n s n a n where α n is defined as the learning rate which determines the proportion of previous learning that is retained in the update of the action value table and γ n is the discount factor which can be used to stress either current or future rewards 3 1 application to the reactive control of wave energy converters fig 2 shows how q learning is used to learn the optimal combination of pto damping and stiffness coefficients in each sea state without relying on any internal models of the device dynamics at each step of the algorithm the controller selects a step change in the coefficients action which is implemented by the pto unit agent after interaction with the waves the environment is represented by the point absorber subjected to ocean waves the controller receives a reward which is a function of the generated power and moves to a new state as given by the significant wave height the energy wave period and the pto damping and stiffness coefficients the generated power must be averaged over multiple wave cycles so as to ensure transient effects from step changes in b pto and c pto do not affect the learning process in particular a longer time is required in irregular waves due to their random nature hence the averaging is performed over a time horizon h during which the state s n and action an are constant as a result the time steps of the q learning algorithm now have length h as a new action is selected there is an immediate change of state to s n 1 and a new averaging process 3 1 1 state space as aforementioned the selected state variables are the significant wave height the energy wave period and the pto damping and stiffness coefficients hence the adopted rl state space is given by 5 s s s i j k l h s i t e j b pto k b pto l i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k l 1 l the choice of i j k and l is based on a compromise between avoiding slow convergence associated with large values and ensuring sufficient learning accuracy which may be affected by small values in particular due to the extra state variable as compared with resistive control anderlini 2016 the learning time can become an issue with reactive control if large values are selected i and j are usually determined by the wave resource at the deployment site typical ranges of the significant wave height and energy wave period are h s 0 9 m and t e 5 14 s in steps of 1m and 1s respectively holthuijsen 2007 with a hydraulic pto system k and l are set by the number of accumulators 3 1 2 action space for reactive control the action is a combination of increase decrease or not change the pto damping and stiffness coefficients this gives 9 possible actions as opposed to only 3 in the case of resistive control anderlini 2016 it has been preferred however to vary only one variable at a time in order to limit the action state space thus decreasing the size of the q table this has a direct consequence on the overall learning time the action space a is now given by 6 a a δ b pto 0 0 δ c pto 0 0 δ b pto 0 0 δ c pto where δ b pto and δ c pto are predefined step changes in the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively the rl states corresponding to the minimum or maximum pto damping and stiffness coefficients i e b pto 1 b pto k c pto 1 and c pto l present a smaller action state to prevent the controller from exceeding the state space boundary for instance for c pto l the action δ c pto is invalid 3 1 3 reward in this work the same reward function which represents the goal the controller needs to maximise as in anderlini 2016 is used as shown in fig 2 the reward is dependent on the absorbed power nevertheless the significant wave height can have stronger influence on the mean generated power p avg than variations in b pto and c pto as a result p avg h s 2 is used instead because the absorbed power is proportional to the square of the significant wave height holthuijsen 2007 additionally in order to help the learning process by filtering out the noise associated with random seas the reward function is in fact based on the mean value of a number m of p avg values which are themselves time averaged for each rl state this is necessary because of the discretization of the state variables and the stochastic nature of irregular waves hence the m most recent p avg h s 2 values are stored for each rl state in a matrix r which presents at most n s m entries so as to prevent memory issues where n s is the total number of states n s i j k l thus the mean value corresponding to each state can be calculated and then expressed with the vector m r s m m 1 m end of size n s with indicating the averaging process in this vector the states are arranged with a vectorised version of 5 so that the discrete values of b pto correspond to the innermost loop c pto the inner middle loop t e the outer middle loop and h s the outermost loop in order to speed up the learning process it is advantageous to present a cost function that is equal to one at the optimum and zero everywhere else this is achieved by first normalizing the values of m by the maximum in each sea state i e for the same h s and t e this means that the maximum value is searched between the indices o floor s n 1 k l k l 1 and p floor s n 1 k l k l k l of the vector m then the normalized values should be raised to a very high power u 25 so that the optimum will present a value of one and the other terms will tend to zero this process is necessary because the location of the optimum is unknown and results in the algorithm giving greater importance to the optimum over suboptimal pto coefficients even if they result in mean generated power with only a slightly smaller magnitude fig 3 enables the user to fully understand this point which is of primary importance in the derivation of a suitable reward function for the control of wecs as an example in fig 3 the reward function is assumed to be given by a weibull distribution holthuijsen 2007 with scale and shape parameters 0 6 and 1 5 respectively whose values are normalized from fig 3 it is clear that a greater value of u corresponds to a more pronounced peakiness however a plateau is reached for large values additionally with reactive control negative mean power values are possible which may present a magnitude greater than the maximum power by which the corresponding value in m is normalized in this case it is best not to raise them to a power so that a preliminary reward function is given by 7 w s n m s n max s o p m s u if m s n 0 a m s n max s o p m s if m s n 0 b for greater clarity the calculation of the reward function is shown graphically in fig 4 for the final step of the rl algorithm using the simulation in fig 10 in section 5 2 as is described in section 5 2 this data is generated from running the algorithm in an 8 h long wave trace in one sea state of irregular waves which simulates the behaviour of the controller in a realistic scenario looking at the table r it is possible to make two observations firstly despite the length of the wave trace being analysed which corresponds to the duration of the controller operation not all rl states i e rows of the table present fully m entries which means they have been encountered for less than m times with m 25 in this simulation secondly even for each state the values of p avg h s 2 can present a wide range due to the variation in wave energy for the same discrete sea state this is the main reason behind selecting a relatively large value of m which should result in outliers playing a minor role in the calculation of the vector of the mean values m in fig 4 only one sea state is used so that all entries of m are normalized with respect to the maximum power however if more sea states were present it would be sufficient to update the portion of m corresponding to the current sea state only as defined by indices o and p in 7 finally fig 4 shows that the use of a high value of the power u where u 25 is used in this case results in a smaller reward being associated with suboptimal combinations of the pto damping and stiffness coefficients as expected from fig 3 furthermore some combinations of pto damping and stiffness coefficients may result in large motions in extreme waves that may lead to failure for this reason a penalty 2 is returned whenever the magnitude of the maximum displacement at the pto exceeds a set value x pto max hence the complete reward function is given by 8 r n 1 w s n if max x pto x pto max a 2 if max x pto x pto max b 3 1 4 exploration strategy learning rate and discount factor particularly at the start of the learning process it is advantageous for the agent to try unseen actions in new states which is a process known as exploration as the learning progresses the controller can shift towards the selection of actions that result in greater reward exploitation since there is greater confidence in their values in this work this has been achieved through an ϵ greedy exploration strategy which results in the following action selection at each step of the q learning algorithm sutton and barto 1998 9 a n argmax a a q n s n a with probability 1 ϵ n a random action with probability ϵ n b in order to ensure exploration at the start and then shift the focus to exploitation the exploration rate ϵ n 0 1 is calculated as 10 ϵ n ϵ 0 if n 0 a ϵ 0 n if n 0 b where n i 1 5 n n s n a i n min ϵ with n a 5 indicating the number of actions n is the matrix containing the count of the number of visits to each state action pair n min ϵ is the minimum number of visits to each state for an initial random exploration and ϵ 0 is the initial exploration rate the selection of n min ϵ and ϵ 0 should be based on a compromise higher values of these variables ensure greater exploration with ϵ 0 1 indicating completely random initial actions and thus increase the chances of the algorithm converging towards the optimum behaviour at the same time lower values particularly for n min ϵ reduce the time during which random actions are taken with the wec exhibiting suboptimal performance hence values of n min ϵ 25 and ϵ 0 0 6 have been selected as a good choice for the specific case study being analysed in this work if a greater number of rl states is used the value of n min ϵ should be increased similarly the learning rate α n 0 1 should also decrease as the learning goes on nevertheless a slower decay is sought in order to ensure the controller keeps on updating the q table throughout the exploration stage 11 α n α 0 if n n s n a n n min α a α 0 n n s n a n if n n s n a n n min α b where n min α indicates the number of visits to each state action pair before reducing the learning rate as for the exploration rate a higher learning rate aids the learning process but a slower decay slows the convergence time of the state action value function sutton and barto 1998 it is common practice to select the learning rate to be lower than the exploration rate for this reason α 0 0 4 is chosen additionally n min α n min ϵ should be selected because the decay of the exploration rate depends on the number of visits to each state for any actions while that of the learning rate on the number of visits to each state action pair in the case of the presented reactive control there are 5 actions for each state so that n min α n min ϵ 5 is chosen the learning and exploration rates should be reset on a predefined regular basis so as to account for changes in the wec dynamics over time e g due to marine growth or non critical subsystem failure furthermore a discount factor γ 0 95 is employed this is used to discount only slightly the future rewards the q learning algorithm receives 3 2 algorithm the proposed q learning algorithm for the reactive control of wecs can be seen in fig 5 the first step consists of the initialization of all variables q and n are matrices of dimensions n s n a r is a vector of vectors whose dimensions are at most n s m with m 10 in regular waves and m 25 in irregular waves as in anderlini 2016 the entries of r are pre calculated in a run in a similar wave trace whilst taking random actions it is expected that r will be pre initialized using simulations also for the full scale device as the wec begins to operate r will be updated using actual sensor data in addition since some combinations of pto damping and stiffness coefficients can result in very large motions it is necessary to initialize the q table during a pre training stage using simulations in order to prevent failure in extreme waves after the initialization stage the algorithm is run indefinitely until maintenance is due at every time step the selected pto damping and stiffness coefficients are implemented by the controller through the pto system furthermore the generated power and the displacement at the pto are sampled in order to update respectively the mean absorbed power and the maximum displacement value in each time horizon in particular the power averaging is performed only after 8 t e have passed in order to remove transient effects due to change in b pto or c pto a longer time is required than for resistive control in anderlini 2016 since a change in pto stiffness coefficient can cause large motions additionally the time horizon lasts 20 t e in both regular and irregular waves this results in a speed up in convergence as compared with 30 t z in anderlini 2016 whilst still ensuring the algorithm is stable from fig 5 the q learning update at the end of each episode can be seen the values of the significant wave height and energy wave period are computed using spectral analysis and fast fourier transforms fft from the record of the wave elevation with a unidirectional wave spectrum for simplicity holthuijsen 2007 4 simulation system 4 1 hydrodynamic model the analysed wec is described in section 2 1 and shown in fig 1 greater information on the device and its dimensions and properties can be found in neary and previsic 2014 previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 assuming linear wave theory and small body motions the response of the device can be obtained from the superposition of the inertial hydrostatic viscous radiation diffraction and incident forces in addition to the control force falnes 2005 the two body problem can be thus modelled with a twelve degree of freedom model however by considering only planar motion i e surge heave and pitch and the axisymmetric geometry of both float and reaction plate which means heave is decoupled from surge and pitch falnes 2005 it is possible to simplify the model to the coupled heave degrees of freedom of the two bodies therefore using cummins formulation for the radiation force cummins 1962 it is possible to express the equations of motion of the device in the time domain with the following matrix notation 12 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ cx t f ex t f pto t f v t m is the inertia matrix which can be obtained using the data in previsic et al 2014 and c the stiffness matrix the calculation of the heave hydrostatic stiffness for the float is standard falnes 2005 whose dimensions can be found in previsic et al 2014 with the sea water density ρ 1025 kg m 3 and the gravitational acceleration g 9 81m s 2 the reaction plate and spar do not present any hydrostatic stiffness because they are fully submerged nevertheless a stiffness term of 10 mn m which is likely to be provided by the mooring system is specified in order to prevent an unstable behaviour with reactive control in 12 k is the radiation impulse response function matrix and a the added mass matrix at infinite wave frequency these variables can be computed using the commercial program wamit where the geometry is created following the dimensions in previsic et al 2014 in particular panels are included at the waterline within the float contour so as to remove the effects of irregular frequencies wamit 2013 furthermore the bottom is left with a hole where the top of the spar fits similarly the top of the spar is left without panels care has been taken in ensuring there is a match in the position of the points lying on the inner border of the bottom of the float and on the outer border of the top of the spar to prevent errors in the solution this arrangement results in incorrect volume and hydrostatic calculations but in an accurate computation of the radiation and diffraction coefficients in addition the use of dipoles on the reaction plate has been found to result in instabilities in the radiation approximation described hereafter for this reason it has been preferred to model the reaction plate as a thicker plate with a thickness of 3m 1 10th of the diameter previsic et al 2014 this approximation has been found to have only a minor effect on the radiation coefficients in heave in 12 f ex is the excitation force vector which is calculated from the convolution of the excitation impulse response function also obtained via wamit and the wave elevation as described in falnes 2005 according to newton s 3 rd law of action and reaction f pto f pto f pto t is the controller force vector with f pto being computed as in 1 for this simple case the displacement and velocity at the pto can be obtained from the difference in the displacement and velocity of the two bodies x pto t x 3 t x 9 t where 3 and 9 indicate the heave degree of freedom of the float and reaction plate respectively according to standard practice the viscous drag force f v can be calculated with morison s equation morison et al 1950 while no drag force has been modelled on the water piercing float its contribution is expected to be non negligible on the motions of the reaction plate since the magnitude of the velocity of the reaction plate is relatively small in all sea states analysed in this article a constant drag coefficient c d 5 is employed taken from previsic et al 2014 fig 6 shows the expression of 12 in a block diagram in order to reduce the computational requirements of the hydrodynamic model the radiation convolution integral is approximated by a state space formulation as in anderlini 2016 frequency domain system identification is employed so as to obtain state space matrices a ss b ss c ss and d ss according to the procedure described by forehand et al 2016 with d ss 0 the matrix d is used to calculate the viscous drag force all its entries are zero except for d 9 9 0 5 c d ρ π r plate 2 where r plate 15 m is the radius of the reaction plate previsic et al 2014 in addition the hydrodynamic model in fig 6 has been solved numerically using a first order accurate euler scheme with a sampling time of δ t 0 1 s 4 2 simulation model numerical simulations have been run for the reference model 3 two body point absorber whose dimensions can be found in previsic et al 2014 the maximum pto force that can be exerted due to the generator rating has been assumed to be f max 1 mn while the magnitude of the maximum displacement at the pto has been limited to x pto max 5 m the program employed for the simulations is summarized in fig 7 while a buoy will record the wave elevation in practice as shown in fig 1 a wave model is used to generate the wave elevation time series in fig 7 on the one hand the wave elevation is used to obtain h s and t e on the other hand it is required for the calculation of the wave excitation force through the diffraction convolution integral falnes 2005 in order to generate the wave elevation in irregular waves the amplitude wave spectrum s ω needs to be specified for a number of circular wave frequencies holthuijsen 2007 ω the individual wave components are superimposed to calculate ζ each having a wave amplitude a ω 2 s ω δ ω where δ ω is the circular frequency step falnes 2005 δ ω should be selected smaller than the nyquist frequency in order to prevent a repetition of the wave trace franklin et al 2008 this is particularly problematic since it is evident from section 5 2 that very long wave traces are required for the rl algorithm to converge for this reason it has been preferred to generate the wave trace as the combination of 15 min long wave traces where a different seed for the random number generator is used for each one furthermore a 20 point filter is used over the last and first 20s of each trace in order to smoothen the connection therefore δ ω 0 005 rad s has been used since it meets the nyquist criterion franklin et al 2008 which has been possible by fitting the diffraction coefficients generated by wamit with a high order polynomial for simplicity the pto damping coefficient is assumed to range from 0 to 4 2mns m in steps of 1 4mns m so that k 4 similarly the pto stiffness coefficient is taken to range from 3 6mn m to 0mn m in steps of 1 2mn m so that l 4 these values have been selected as they fully enclose the optimal coefficients for the analysed sea states as a result of the choice of pto damping and stiffness coefficients 16 rl states are used when a single sea state as given by h s and t e is considered nevertheless for a more realistic implementation a finer resolution and a wider range are expected 5 simulation results the learning capabilities of the algorithm are assessed in both regular and irregular waves since the same time horizon length has been selected in both cases the same wave trace length of 8h has been employed as opposed to anderlini 2016 where a longer time series was required in irregular waves the hydrodynamic model is initialized for 15min to prevent numerical instabilities although this trace is not reported in the plots additionally the rl response is validated against optimal reactive control whose coefficients are obtained from nelder mead simplex optimizations nambiar 2015 in 20 min long wave traces 5 1 regular waves a single sea state i e i j 1 has been analysed in regular waves with unit amplitude and a wave period of 8s fig 8 a and b compare the curves of the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively with time as selected by the q learning algorithm against the optimal values the difference in the corresponding mean absorbed power and the optimal mean generated power of 260 5kw can be seen in fig 8c in addition the reward function is plotted against the pto damping and stiffness coefficients in fig 9 for the same sea state in particular two values have been used for u the power of the normalized power in 7 note that because the displacement limit is not reached r w in this case 7 and 8 the case of u 1 corresponds to purely the normalized mean generated power values while u 25 is used in the actual cost function in this article 5 2 irregular waves similarly a single sea state with a significant wave height of 2m and a peak wave period of 9 25s is considered in irregular waves as a proof of concept from the fft analysis the energy wave period for the generated wave trace is 8s as per the regular waves case i j 1 so that the rl problem reduces to 16 states in fig 10 a and b it is possible to see the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively adopted by the rl control scheme as compared with the optimal values in this sea state fig 10c shows the difference in the corresponding mean absorbed power with the mean generated power obtained by using the optimal coefficients being 90 582kw 6 discussion 6 1 regular waves as is clear from fig 8 in regular waves the q learning algorithm learns the optimal pto coefficients in approximately six hours from a random start q 0 this is almost double the time required by the control scheme for resistive control in anderlini 2016 mainly due to the longer time horizon employed 20 t e as opposed to 10 t z with the energy wave period being typically greater than the zero crossing mean wave period in fact a shorter time horizon may be used considering the deterministic nature of regular waves additionally the convergence time is strongly dependent on the number of discrete b pto and c pto values employed with only 16 states currently being used in fig 8 it is also interesting to notice the random initial behaviour of the controller due to the selected exploration strategy which enables the agent to visit most states as the learning progresses the exploration rate tends to zero and the algorithm chooses the optimal exploitative actions in order to meet the requirements of the linear wave theory assumption of the hydrodynamic model a short wave height has been chosen as a result the prescribed maximum pto displacement is never exceeded hence the penalty term in 8 is not applied if it were the controller would be expected to select a higher pto damping coefficient as in anderlini 2016 for resistive control conversely a pto stiffness coefficient with a smaller if not zero magnitude is forecast as the controller tries to move away from resonance on the other hand the force reaches the saturation limit even in this mild sea state however a bang bang behaviour similar to the one in anderlini 2016 is not observed with reactive control in fig 9 it is interesting to compare the developed cost function u 25 with the original normalized generated mean power surface u 1 for the same sea state as can be seen raising the non dimensional power values to a high power results in a much peakier reward function similar to what is observed in fig 3 for an example function this is highly desirable since it enables the controller to learn more quickly what the optimal action is as there is a more significant gain associated with it as compared with suboptimal solutions this results in a considerable speed up in the convergence time as opposed to the case of u 1 even higher values of the power u may be required for a finer mesh of pto damping and stiffness coefficients since this can present a flatter region around the optimum as aforementioned this approach is necessary because the actual position of the optimum is unknown with the best reward function in terms of convergence time being the one that presenting a value of 1 at the optimum and 0 everywhere else it is important to notice that raising negative normalized mean generated power values to a high value of u is strongly undesirable this would have the effect of decreasing the magnitude of the reward as for positive power values but in this case it would actually mean increasing the reward associated with suboptimal points it would be even worse to use an even value for u since it would turn negative mean generated power values into positive ones thus teaching the controller a completely wrong policy hence positive values of u for negative normalized mean generated power values must be avoided at all costs 6 2 irregular waves from fig 10 it is evident that the developed statistical reward function is effective in ensuring convergence in irregular waves as well despite their stochastic nature furthermore since the same horizon time length is employed as per the regular waves run the learning time is no greater as opposed to the study by anderlini 2016 nevertheless the challenge that irregular waves pose to the convergence of the correct action selection can be understood by comparing fig 8c and fig 10c where the much more oscillatory nature of the mean absorbed power in irregular waves is clear a typical sea state has a duration that ranges between 30min and 6h holthuijsen 2007 hence even though the learning time is smaller than in anderlini 2016 despite the larger number of states convergence is still unlikely to be achieved before there is a variation in the significant wave height and energy wave period however as shown in anderlini 2016 for irregular waves with multiple sea states the q learning algorithm applied to the control of wecs is able to pick up the learning process from where it left off the last time it encountered a particular sea state this represents the main advantage of reinforcement learning over traditional optimization algorithms which would be unable to identify whether a change in the cost function is due to a change in the pto damping or stiffness coefficients or due to noise in the wave energy in a realistic application a finer grid of b pto and c pto values would be desired in order to deal with a large range of sea states nevertheless this may increase the learning time excessively the q table is expected to be pre initialized through numerical simulations in order to prevent selecting pto settings that result in excessive motions in energetic sea states which could be a real problem with reactive control in addition the exploration and learning rates should be reset every season so as to check if there have been variations in the device response over time e g due to slow marine growth or abrupt non critical subsystems failure since the operational life of wec technologies is envisioned to be 20 25 years a relatively poor performance during the initial stages of operation should be more than offset by increases in the absorbed wave power throughout a devices operating life through the removal of modelling errors finally it is important to understand that rl is proposed as a method to remove the dependence of existing wec control strategies from hydrodynamic models in rl the controller is independent of the plant in this work a hydrodynamic model based on potential flow theory with some non linear viscous effects is used to simulate the plant nevertheless as shown for instance in anderlini in preparation for resistive control rl control is able to converge towards the optimal policy even in the presence of strong non linear effects associated with the pto system hence due to its model free nature rl is expected to perform well even when applied to non linear numerical models such as cfd or even in experimental or prototype testing however the overall controller performance is only as good as the control scheme itself with reactive control representing a significant improvement over resistive control treated in the previous study anderlini 2016 7 conclusions the authors have presented an on line model free strategy for the reactive control of wecs using rl building on a previous study on resistive control the algorithm has been validated through a numerical model of a two body point absorber which assumes linear wave theory in both regular and irregular waves the controller is shown to learn the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients that result in maximum energy absorption in order to achieve convergence in irregular waves a statistical reward function has been developed which averages over multiple mean absorbed power values in each sea state as the control scheme is independent of internal models of the device response it is simple to implement on a real full scale wec additionally it can adapt to variations in the machine conditions over time e g due to ageing or marine biofouling although the q table has been randomly initialized in a real application it is expected to be pre calculated through simulations in order to prevent the adoption of actions that may cause failures in extreme waves the action values will then be slowly substituted by the actual measured data during operation with corresponding necessary adjustments finally this method which has already been generalised to the application to multi body devices in this work since a previous study anderlini 2016 can be further extended to the treatment of arrays of devices acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the energy technologies institute eti and

23712,in this article reinforcement learning is used to obtain optimal reactive control of a two body point absorber in particular the q learning algorithm is adopted for the maximization of the energy extraction in each sea state the controller damping and stiffness coefficients are varied in steps observing the associated reward which corresponds to an increase in the absorbed power or penalty owing to large displacements the generated power is averaged over a time horizon spanning several wave cycles due to the periodicity of ocean waves discarding the transient effects at the start of each new episode the model of a two body point absorber is developed in order to validate the control strategy in both regular and irregular waves in all analysed sea states the controller learns the optimal damping and stiffness coefficients furthermore the scheme is independent of internal models of the device response which means that it can adapt to variations in the unit dynamics with time and does not suffer from modelling errors keywords reinforcement learning rl q learning reactive control point absorber wave energy converter wec 1 introduction wave power is a renewable energy resource that can considerably contribute to the future energy generation thus reducing society s dependence on fossil fuels although a potential of up to 2 1tw of power has been estimated globally gunn and stock williams 2012 wave energy converter wec devices are not economically viable yet despite a large number of different designs having been suggested falcão 2010 the design of an effective control strategy is fundamental in order to address this problem since it can result in substantial gains in absorbed energy without additional hardware costs over the years different control strategies have been proposed for the maximization of power extraction of wecs a review of the first studies can be found in salter et al 2002 while ringwood et al 2014 presents a review of recent techniques from hydrodynamic considerations complex conjugate control would theoretically provide optimal energy absorption by achieving resonance between the wec and the incident waves salter et al 2002 nevertheless delivering optimal control may be infeasible in reality due to the associated excessive motions and loads in extreme waves hence alternative suboptimal control schemes have been implemented which include physical constraints on the motions forces and power rating of the device ringwood et al 2014 latching declutching model predictive and simple but effective control are instances of real time wec control schemes firstly suggested by budal and falnes 1977 latching control achieves resonance conditions by adjusting the time period when the machine is locked in place through a dedicated mechanism babarit et al 2004 babarit and clément 2006 during the remaining part of the wave cycle the device motions are linearly damped declutching control presents a similar concept but in this case the power take off pto system is disconnected during part of the wave cycle through a by pass valve with hydraulic ptos as opposed to being fixed in place babarit et al 2009 model predictive control applies at each time step the force that is expected to result in maximum energy absorption over a future time horizon brekken 2011 hals et al 2011 li and belmont 2014a richter et al 2014 simple but effective control obtains an estimate for the optimal controller force by modelling the current excitation force as a narrow banded function fusco and ringwood 2013 these control strategies can include constrains on the motions and loading of wecs while it is hard to scale latching control to farms of wecs model predictive control has been successfully implemented for multi body devices and even small array problems richter et al 2013 oetinger and magaña 2014 li and belmont 2014b amann and magaña 2015 oetinger et al 2015 however model predictive control presents high computational requirements simple but effective control results in similar performance but with a simpler implementation ringwood et al 2014 nevertheless these methods are strongly affected by the accuracy of the prediction of the future wave excitation force usually over a short time horizon as well as of the model of the machine dynamics ringwood et al 2014 resistive and reactive control represent alternative types of schemes that rely on time averaged sea states so that stationary wave conditions are assumed salter et al 2002 numerical simulations are performed so as to obtain the pto damping resistive control or combination of damping and stiffness reactive control that result in maximum energy absorption in each sea state nambiar 2015 it is possible to include force saturation within the numerical model and displacement constraints in the cost function on the one hand these techniques may present a lower efficiency as compared with on line control schemes on the other hand resistive and reactive control are conceptually simple to understand and they present much lower computational costs than real time methods furthermore they are easily scalable to multi body or multiple device problems as for instance shown by nambiar 2015 the aforementioned schemes suffer from a significant problem the optimal control action is determined based on internal models of the body dynamics therefore modelling errors can severely affect the performance of these algorithms with significant drops in efficiency in addition these control strategies do not account for changes in the device dynamics over time e g due to slow marine growth or sudden non critical subsystem failures for these reasons the authors have proposed the application of reinforcement learning rl to resistive control in a previous work anderlini 2016 with this machine learning algorithm the controller learns the optimal pto damping coefficient in every sea state directly from experience penalties for large displacements are included to prevent failures in extreme waves in this article the developed control strategy based on rl is generalised to reactive control although wecs are expected to be deployed in arrays so as to exploit the advantage of economies of scale nambiar 2015 we consider a single axisymmetric device for simplicity in particular a more realistic wec than that in anderlini 2016 is analysed a two body point absorber similar to the reference model 3 in neary and previsic 2014 previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 point absorbers which extract energy by resisting the motions of a small floating body subject to wave loading through a pto system represent a well understood and simple offshore wec technology falcão 2010 the performance of the algorithm is assessed in both regular and irregular waves 2 optimal reactive control of a point absorber 2 1 system description in this work the reference model 3 point absorber developed by sandia national laboratories is used as a case study this decision is based on its realistic design while it is still possible to approximate its motions with a simple model furthermore it is well documented in the literature the development of the wec is described in neary and previsic 2014 in detail previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 present experimental measurements that have been used to quantify its performance the device is a floating moored axisymmetric point absorber that comprises of two bodies whose relative motion due to wave excitation results in absorbed energy the selected point absorber features a hydraulic pto system as shown in fig 1 as envisioned by neary and previsic 2014 the mechanical energy associated with the relative motion between the float and the reaction plate is converted into electrical energy through a hydraulic stage the advantages of a hydraulic pto unit whose design is inspired by henderson 2006 falcão 2007 forehand et al 2016 are its robustness capacity for energy storage and speed control furthermore no expensive fully rated power converters are necessary because through the pto system it is possible to control the output current forehand et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 the point absorber comprises of two bodies a float and a reaction plate connected to a vertical spar the wave excitation causes the float and reaction plate to move however the oscillations of the reaction plate present a much lower magnitude than the float because of the higher inertia viscous drag and depth of the plate hence the motion difference is used to drive a two way single degree of freedom ram that pumps high pressure oil into the circuit a rectifying valve prevents flow reversal furthermore the flow is smoothed out through a gas accumulator system in the reference model 3 neary and previsic 2014 this comprises of four high pressure hp cylinders and a low pressure reservoir designed to prevent cavitation forehand et al 2016 the flow drives a hydraulic motor which is connected to an induction generator the produced electrical power is fed into the national grid after the voltage is stepped up through a transformer as can be seen from fig 1 the input variables to the controller are the generated power p the displacement and velocity at the pto x pto and x pto respectively and the wave elevation ζ from which the sea state is derived the controller then adjusts the flow in the hydraulic circuit by opening or closing the valves connected to the accumulators this corresponds to changing the damping and stiffness in the system 2 2 optimum reactive control in reactive control the controller force is calculated as the sum of a damping and a stiffness term 19 1 f pto t b pto x pto t c pto x pto t where x pto is the displacement at the pto it is assumed that the pto damping and stiffness coefficients b pto and c pto respectively can be modified by changing the pressure within the hydraulic circuit by varying b pto and c pto directly the developed algorithm can be easily applied also to other pto systems such as electromechanical or direct drive in reality the pto force is saturated with a limit f max due to the generator rating as shown in fig 6 in section 4 1 the generated power p can be calculated as 2 p gen t f pto t x pto t and the power fed into the grid is given by 3 p t η p gen if p gen 0 a p gen η if p gen 0 b for simplicity in 3 a single measure is employed for the overall efficiency of the pto unit η 80 neary and previsic 2014 in 2 p gen is the generated power from 3 it is clear that with reactive control not only is power extracted from the waves but during part of the wave cycle it is also fed into the environment in order to increase the motions of the device through resonance and thus increase energy absorption salter et al 2002 from this behaviour comes the name of the algorithm reactive control the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients that result in maximum energy extraction depend on the wave period in regular waves tedeschi et al 2011 or the energy wave period t e in irregular waves if the force saturation is included the optimum b pto and c pto values become also functions of the significant wave height h s similarly the maximum displacement at the pto which is of interest to prevent failures in extreme waves is also a function of the sea state given by h s and t e the state of the art optimum reactive control algorithm employs a tabular approach where the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients are stored in a table for the main sea states that are encountered at the operational site given by the combinations of a number of discrete values of b pto and c pto during the operation of the wec the controller tries to achieve the prescribed pto stiffness and damping coefficients in the current sea state through the hydraulic pto system the optimal coefficients are usually pre calculated using an optimization algorithm such as the nelder mead simplex algorithm as in nambiar 2015 with a time domain hydrodynamic model for this reason this technique can be affected by modelling errors and it cannot account for changes in the device response with time e g due to ageing or marine biofouling 3 reinforcement learning control in reinforcement learning the controller learns an optimal behaviour or policy from direct interaction with the environment in this work the on line off policy q learning algorithm sutton and barto 1998 is selected as in anderlini 2016 with this strategy at each time step n the agent which is in a specific state s n selects an action a n as a result of the interaction with the surrounding environment the controller lands in a new state s n 1 while observing a reward r n 1 which depends on the outcome of the chosen action the action selection modelled as a markov decision process depends on the value function which is a measure of the expected future reward by considering present as well as future rewards rl is able to learn the optimal policy with time for the maximization of the total reward sutton and barto 1998 model free rl techniques employ the action value table q which presents an entry for every combination of discrete states and actions for instance q s n a n represents the action value for the current state and action the one step update of the q learning algorithm is given by sutton and barto 1998 4 q n 1 s n a n q n s n a n α n r n 1 γ max a a q n s n 1 a q n s n a n where α n is defined as the learning rate which determines the proportion of previous learning that is retained in the update of the action value table and γ n is the discount factor which can be used to stress either current or future rewards 3 1 application to the reactive control of wave energy converters fig 2 shows how q learning is used to learn the optimal combination of pto damping and stiffness coefficients in each sea state without relying on any internal models of the device dynamics at each step of the algorithm the controller selects a step change in the coefficients action which is implemented by the pto unit agent after interaction with the waves the environment is represented by the point absorber subjected to ocean waves the controller receives a reward which is a function of the generated power and moves to a new state as given by the significant wave height the energy wave period and the pto damping and stiffness coefficients the generated power must be averaged over multiple wave cycles so as to ensure transient effects from step changes in b pto and c pto do not affect the learning process in particular a longer time is required in irregular waves due to their random nature hence the averaging is performed over a time horizon h during which the state s n and action an are constant as a result the time steps of the q learning algorithm now have length h as a new action is selected there is an immediate change of state to s n 1 and a new averaging process 3 1 1 state space as aforementioned the selected state variables are the significant wave height the energy wave period and the pto damping and stiffness coefficients hence the adopted rl state space is given by 5 s s s i j k l h s i t e j b pto k b pto l i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k l 1 l the choice of i j k and l is based on a compromise between avoiding slow convergence associated with large values and ensuring sufficient learning accuracy which may be affected by small values in particular due to the extra state variable as compared with resistive control anderlini 2016 the learning time can become an issue with reactive control if large values are selected i and j are usually determined by the wave resource at the deployment site typical ranges of the significant wave height and energy wave period are h s 0 9 m and t e 5 14 s in steps of 1m and 1s respectively holthuijsen 2007 with a hydraulic pto system k and l are set by the number of accumulators 3 1 2 action space for reactive control the action is a combination of increase decrease or not change the pto damping and stiffness coefficients this gives 9 possible actions as opposed to only 3 in the case of resistive control anderlini 2016 it has been preferred however to vary only one variable at a time in order to limit the action state space thus decreasing the size of the q table this has a direct consequence on the overall learning time the action space a is now given by 6 a a δ b pto 0 0 δ c pto 0 0 δ b pto 0 0 δ c pto where δ b pto and δ c pto are predefined step changes in the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively the rl states corresponding to the minimum or maximum pto damping and stiffness coefficients i e b pto 1 b pto k c pto 1 and c pto l present a smaller action state to prevent the controller from exceeding the state space boundary for instance for c pto l the action δ c pto is invalid 3 1 3 reward in this work the same reward function which represents the goal the controller needs to maximise as in anderlini 2016 is used as shown in fig 2 the reward is dependent on the absorbed power nevertheless the significant wave height can have stronger influence on the mean generated power p avg than variations in b pto and c pto as a result p avg h s 2 is used instead because the absorbed power is proportional to the square of the significant wave height holthuijsen 2007 additionally in order to help the learning process by filtering out the noise associated with random seas the reward function is in fact based on the mean value of a number m of p avg values which are themselves time averaged for each rl state this is necessary because of the discretization of the state variables and the stochastic nature of irregular waves hence the m most recent p avg h s 2 values are stored for each rl state in a matrix r which presents at most n s m entries so as to prevent memory issues where n s is the total number of states n s i j k l thus the mean value corresponding to each state can be calculated and then expressed with the vector m r s m m 1 m end of size n s with indicating the averaging process in this vector the states are arranged with a vectorised version of 5 so that the discrete values of b pto correspond to the innermost loop c pto the inner middle loop t e the outer middle loop and h s the outermost loop in order to speed up the learning process it is advantageous to present a cost function that is equal to one at the optimum and zero everywhere else this is achieved by first normalizing the values of m by the maximum in each sea state i e for the same h s and t e this means that the maximum value is searched between the indices o floor s n 1 k l k l 1 and p floor s n 1 k l k l k l of the vector m then the normalized values should be raised to a very high power u 25 so that the optimum will present a value of one and the other terms will tend to zero this process is necessary because the location of the optimum is unknown and results in the algorithm giving greater importance to the optimum over suboptimal pto coefficients even if they result in mean generated power with only a slightly smaller magnitude fig 3 enables the user to fully understand this point which is of primary importance in the derivation of a suitable reward function for the control of wecs as an example in fig 3 the reward function is assumed to be given by a weibull distribution holthuijsen 2007 with scale and shape parameters 0 6 and 1 5 respectively whose values are normalized from fig 3 it is clear that a greater value of u corresponds to a more pronounced peakiness however a plateau is reached for large values additionally with reactive control negative mean power values are possible which may present a magnitude greater than the maximum power by which the corresponding value in m is normalized in this case it is best not to raise them to a power so that a preliminary reward function is given by 7 w s n m s n max s o p m s u if m s n 0 a m s n max s o p m s if m s n 0 b for greater clarity the calculation of the reward function is shown graphically in fig 4 for the final step of the rl algorithm using the simulation in fig 10 in section 5 2 as is described in section 5 2 this data is generated from running the algorithm in an 8 h long wave trace in one sea state of irregular waves which simulates the behaviour of the controller in a realistic scenario looking at the table r it is possible to make two observations firstly despite the length of the wave trace being analysed which corresponds to the duration of the controller operation not all rl states i e rows of the table present fully m entries which means they have been encountered for less than m times with m 25 in this simulation secondly even for each state the values of p avg h s 2 can present a wide range due to the variation in wave energy for the same discrete sea state this is the main reason behind selecting a relatively large value of m which should result in outliers playing a minor role in the calculation of the vector of the mean values m in fig 4 only one sea state is used so that all entries of m are normalized with respect to the maximum power however if more sea states were present it would be sufficient to update the portion of m corresponding to the current sea state only as defined by indices o and p in 7 finally fig 4 shows that the use of a high value of the power u where u 25 is used in this case results in a smaller reward being associated with suboptimal combinations of the pto damping and stiffness coefficients as expected from fig 3 furthermore some combinations of pto damping and stiffness coefficients may result in large motions in extreme waves that may lead to failure for this reason a penalty 2 is returned whenever the magnitude of the maximum displacement at the pto exceeds a set value x pto max hence the complete reward function is given by 8 r n 1 w s n if max x pto x pto max a 2 if max x pto x pto max b 3 1 4 exploration strategy learning rate and discount factor particularly at the start of the learning process it is advantageous for the agent to try unseen actions in new states which is a process known as exploration as the learning progresses the controller can shift towards the selection of actions that result in greater reward exploitation since there is greater confidence in their values in this work this has been achieved through an ϵ greedy exploration strategy which results in the following action selection at each step of the q learning algorithm sutton and barto 1998 9 a n argmax a a q n s n a with probability 1 ϵ n a random action with probability ϵ n b in order to ensure exploration at the start and then shift the focus to exploitation the exploration rate ϵ n 0 1 is calculated as 10 ϵ n ϵ 0 if n 0 a ϵ 0 n if n 0 b where n i 1 5 n n s n a i n min ϵ with n a 5 indicating the number of actions n is the matrix containing the count of the number of visits to each state action pair n min ϵ is the minimum number of visits to each state for an initial random exploration and ϵ 0 is the initial exploration rate the selection of n min ϵ and ϵ 0 should be based on a compromise higher values of these variables ensure greater exploration with ϵ 0 1 indicating completely random initial actions and thus increase the chances of the algorithm converging towards the optimum behaviour at the same time lower values particularly for n min ϵ reduce the time during which random actions are taken with the wec exhibiting suboptimal performance hence values of n min ϵ 25 and ϵ 0 0 6 have been selected as a good choice for the specific case study being analysed in this work if a greater number of rl states is used the value of n min ϵ should be increased similarly the learning rate α n 0 1 should also decrease as the learning goes on nevertheless a slower decay is sought in order to ensure the controller keeps on updating the q table throughout the exploration stage 11 α n α 0 if n n s n a n n min α a α 0 n n s n a n if n n s n a n n min α b where n min α indicates the number of visits to each state action pair before reducing the learning rate as for the exploration rate a higher learning rate aids the learning process but a slower decay slows the convergence time of the state action value function sutton and barto 1998 it is common practice to select the learning rate to be lower than the exploration rate for this reason α 0 0 4 is chosen additionally n min α n min ϵ should be selected because the decay of the exploration rate depends on the number of visits to each state for any actions while that of the learning rate on the number of visits to each state action pair in the case of the presented reactive control there are 5 actions for each state so that n min α n min ϵ 5 is chosen the learning and exploration rates should be reset on a predefined regular basis so as to account for changes in the wec dynamics over time e g due to marine growth or non critical subsystem failure furthermore a discount factor γ 0 95 is employed this is used to discount only slightly the future rewards the q learning algorithm receives 3 2 algorithm the proposed q learning algorithm for the reactive control of wecs can be seen in fig 5 the first step consists of the initialization of all variables q and n are matrices of dimensions n s n a r is a vector of vectors whose dimensions are at most n s m with m 10 in regular waves and m 25 in irregular waves as in anderlini 2016 the entries of r are pre calculated in a run in a similar wave trace whilst taking random actions it is expected that r will be pre initialized using simulations also for the full scale device as the wec begins to operate r will be updated using actual sensor data in addition since some combinations of pto damping and stiffness coefficients can result in very large motions it is necessary to initialize the q table during a pre training stage using simulations in order to prevent failure in extreme waves after the initialization stage the algorithm is run indefinitely until maintenance is due at every time step the selected pto damping and stiffness coefficients are implemented by the controller through the pto system furthermore the generated power and the displacement at the pto are sampled in order to update respectively the mean absorbed power and the maximum displacement value in each time horizon in particular the power averaging is performed only after 8 t e have passed in order to remove transient effects due to change in b pto or c pto a longer time is required than for resistive control in anderlini 2016 since a change in pto stiffness coefficient can cause large motions additionally the time horizon lasts 20 t e in both regular and irregular waves this results in a speed up in convergence as compared with 30 t z in anderlini 2016 whilst still ensuring the algorithm is stable from fig 5 the q learning update at the end of each episode can be seen the values of the significant wave height and energy wave period are computed using spectral analysis and fast fourier transforms fft from the record of the wave elevation with a unidirectional wave spectrum for simplicity holthuijsen 2007 4 simulation system 4 1 hydrodynamic model the analysed wec is described in section 2 1 and shown in fig 1 greater information on the device and its dimensions and properties can be found in neary and previsic 2014 previsic et al 2014 and yu et al 2015 assuming linear wave theory and small body motions the response of the device can be obtained from the superposition of the inertial hydrostatic viscous radiation diffraction and incident forces in addition to the control force falnes 2005 the two body problem can be thus modelled with a twelve degree of freedom model however by considering only planar motion i e surge heave and pitch and the axisymmetric geometry of both float and reaction plate which means heave is decoupled from surge and pitch falnes 2005 it is possible to simplify the model to the coupled heave degrees of freedom of the two bodies therefore using cummins formulation for the radiation force cummins 1962 it is possible to express the equations of motion of the device in the time domain with the following matrix notation 12 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ cx t f ex t f pto t f v t m is the inertia matrix which can be obtained using the data in previsic et al 2014 and c the stiffness matrix the calculation of the heave hydrostatic stiffness for the float is standard falnes 2005 whose dimensions can be found in previsic et al 2014 with the sea water density ρ 1025 kg m 3 and the gravitational acceleration g 9 81m s 2 the reaction plate and spar do not present any hydrostatic stiffness because they are fully submerged nevertheless a stiffness term of 10 mn m which is likely to be provided by the mooring system is specified in order to prevent an unstable behaviour with reactive control in 12 k is the radiation impulse response function matrix and a the added mass matrix at infinite wave frequency these variables can be computed using the commercial program wamit where the geometry is created following the dimensions in previsic et al 2014 in particular panels are included at the waterline within the float contour so as to remove the effects of irregular frequencies wamit 2013 furthermore the bottom is left with a hole where the top of the spar fits similarly the top of the spar is left without panels care has been taken in ensuring there is a match in the position of the points lying on the inner border of the bottom of the float and on the outer border of the top of the spar to prevent errors in the solution this arrangement results in incorrect volume and hydrostatic calculations but in an accurate computation of the radiation and diffraction coefficients in addition the use of dipoles on the reaction plate has been found to result in instabilities in the radiation approximation described hereafter for this reason it has been preferred to model the reaction plate as a thicker plate with a thickness of 3m 1 10th of the diameter previsic et al 2014 this approximation has been found to have only a minor effect on the radiation coefficients in heave in 12 f ex is the excitation force vector which is calculated from the convolution of the excitation impulse response function also obtained via wamit and the wave elevation as described in falnes 2005 according to newton s 3 rd law of action and reaction f pto f pto f pto t is the controller force vector with f pto being computed as in 1 for this simple case the displacement and velocity at the pto can be obtained from the difference in the displacement and velocity of the two bodies x pto t x 3 t x 9 t where 3 and 9 indicate the heave degree of freedom of the float and reaction plate respectively according to standard practice the viscous drag force f v can be calculated with morison s equation morison et al 1950 while no drag force has been modelled on the water piercing float its contribution is expected to be non negligible on the motions of the reaction plate since the magnitude of the velocity of the reaction plate is relatively small in all sea states analysed in this article a constant drag coefficient c d 5 is employed taken from previsic et al 2014 fig 6 shows the expression of 12 in a block diagram in order to reduce the computational requirements of the hydrodynamic model the radiation convolution integral is approximated by a state space formulation as in anderlini 2016 frequency domain system identification is employed so as to obtain state space matrices a ss b ss c ss and d ss according to the procedure described by forehand et al 2016 with d ss 0 the matrix d is used to calculate the viscous drag force all its entries are zero except for d 9 9 0 5 c d ρ π r plate 2 where r plate 15 m is the radius of the reaction plate previsic et al 2014 in addition the hydrodynamic model in fig 6 has been solved numerically using a first order accurate euler scheme with a sampling time of δ t 0 1 s 4 2 simulation model numerical simulations have been run for the reference model 3 two body point absorber whose dimensions can be found in previsic et al 2014 the maximum pto force that can be exerted due to the generator rating has been assumed to be f max 1 mn while the magnitude of the maximum displacement at the pto has been limited to x pto max 5 m the program employed for the simulations is summarized in fig 7 while a buoy will record the wave elevation in practice as shown in fig 1 a wave model is used to generate the wave elevation time series in fig 7 on the one hand the wave elevation is used to obtain h s and t e on the other hand it is required for the calculation of the wave excitation force through the diffraction convolution integral falnes 2005 in order to generate the wave elevation in irregular waves the amplitude wave spectrum s ω needs to be specified for a number of circular wave frequencies holthuijsen 2007 ω the individual wave components are superimposed to calculate ζ each having a wave amplitude a ω 2 s ω δ ω where δ ω is the circular frequency step falnes 2005 δ ω should be selected smaller than the nyquist frequency in order to prevent a repetition of the wave trace franklin et al 2008 this is particularly problematic since it is evident from section 5 2 that very long wave traces are required for the rl algorithm to converge for this reason it has been preferred to generate the wave trace as the combination of 15 min long wave traces where a different seed for the random number generator is used for each one furthermore a 20 point filter is used over the last and first 20s of each trace in order to smoothen the connection therefore δ ω 0 005 rad s has been used since it meets the nyquist criterion franklin et al 2008 which has been possible by fitting the diffraction coefficients generated by wamit with a high order polynomial for simplicity the pto damping coefficient is assumed to range from 0 to 4 2mns m in steps of 1 4mns m so that k 4 similarly the pto stiffness coefficient is taken to range from 3 6mn m to 0mn m in steps of 1 2mn m so that l 4 these values have been selected as they fully enclose the optimal coefficients for the analysed sea states as a result of the choice of pto damping and stiffness coefficients 16 rl states are used when a single sea state as given by h s and t e is considered nevertheless for a more realistic implementation a finer resolution and a wider range are expected 5 simulation results the learning capabilities of the algorithm are assessed in both regular and irregular waves since the same time horizon length has been selected in both cases the same wave trace length of 8h has been employed as opposed to anderlini 2016 where a longer time series was required in irregular waves the hydrodynamic model is initialized for 15min to prevent numerical instabilities although this trace is not reported in the plots additionally the rl response is validated against optimal reactive control whose coefficients are obtained from nelder mead simplex optimizations nambiar 2015 in 20 min long wave traces 5 1 regular waves a single sea state i e i j 1 has been analysed in regular waves with unit amplitude and a wave period of 8s fig 8 a and b compare the curves of the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively with time as selected by the q learning algorithm against the optimal values the difference in the corresponding mean absorbed power and the optimal mean generated power of 260 5kw can be seen in fig 8c in addition the reward function is plotted against the pto damping and stiffness coefficients in fig 9 for the same sea state in particular two values have been used for u the power of the normalized power in 7 note that because the displacement limit is not reached r w in this case 7 and 8 the case of u 1 corresponds to purely the normalized mean generated power values while u 25 is used in the actual cost function in this article 5 2 irregular waves similarly a single sea state with a significant wave height of 2m and a peak wave period of 9 25s is considered in irregular waves as a proof of concept from the fft analysis the energy wave period for the generated wave trace is 8s as per the regular waves case i j 1 so that the rl problem reduces to 16 states in fig 10 a and b it is possible to see the pto damping and stiffness coefficients respectively adopted by the rl control scheme as compared with the optimal values in this sea state fig 10c shows the difference in the corresponding mean absorbed power with the mean generated power obtained by using the optimal coefficients being 90 582kw 6 discussion 6 1 regular waves as is clear from fig 8 in regular waves the q learning algorithm learns the optimal pto coefficients in approximately six hours from a random start q 0 this is almost double the time required by the control scheme for resistive control in anderlini 2016 mainly due to the longer time horizon employed 20 t e as opposed to 10 t z with the energy wave period being typically greater than the zero crossing mean wave period in fact a shorter time horizon may be used considering the deterministic nature of regular waves additionally the convergence time is strongly dependent on the number of discrete b pto and c pto values employed with only 16 states currently being used in fig 8 it is also interesting to notice the random initial behaviour of the controller due to the selected exploration strategy which enables the agent to visit most states as the learning progresses the exploration rate tends to zero and the algorithm chooses the optimal exploitative actions in order to meet the requirements of the linear wave theory assumption of the hydrodynamic model a short wave height has been chosen as a result the prescribed maximum pto displacement is never exceeded hence the penalty term in 8 is not applied if it were the controller would be expected to select a higher pto damping coefficient as in anderlini 2016 for resistive control conversely a pto stiffness coefficient with a smaller if not zero magnitude is forecast as the controller tries to move away from resonance on the other hand the force reaches the saturation limit even in this mild sea state however a bang bang behaviour similar to the one in anderlini 2016 is not observed with reactive control in fig 9 it is interesting to compare the developed cost function u 25 with the original normalized generated mean power surface u 1 for the same sea state as can be seen raising the non dimensional power values to a high power results in a much peakier reward function similar to what is observed in fig 3 for an example function this is highly desirable since it enables the controller to learn more quickly what the optimal action is as there is a more significant gain associated with it as compared with suboptimal solutions this results in a considerable speed up in the convergence time as opposed to the case of u 1 even higher values of the power u may be required for a finer mesh of pto damping and stiffness coefficients since this can present a flatter region around the optimum as aforementioned this approach is necessary because the actual position of the optimum is unknown with the best reward function in terms of convergence time being the one that presenting a value of 1 at the optimum and 0 everywhere else it is important to notice that raising negative normalized mean generated power values to a high value of u is strongly undesirable this would have the effect of decreasing the magnitude of the reward as for positive power values but in this case it would actually mean increasing the reward associated with suboptimal points it would be even worse to use an even value for u since it would turn negative mean generated power values into positive ones thus teaching the controller a completely wrong policy hence positive values of u for negative normalized mean generated power values must be avoided at all costs 6 2 irregular waves from fig 10 it is evident that the developed statistical reward function is effective in ensuring convergence in irregular waves as well despite their stochastic nature furthermore since the same horizon time length is employed as per the regular waves run the learning time is no greater as opposed to the study by anderlini 2016 nevertheless the challenge that irregular waves pose to the convergence of the correct action selection can be understood by comparing fig 8c and fig 10c where the much more oscillatory nature of the mean absorbed power in irregular waves is clear a typical sea state has a duration that ranges between 30min and 6h holthuijsen 2007 hence even though the learning time is smaller than in anderlini 2016 despite the larger number of states convergence is still unlikely to be achieved before there is a variation in the significant wave height and energy wave period however as shown in anderlini 2016 for irregular waves with multiple sea states the q learning algorithm applied to the control of wecs is able to pick up the learning process from where it left off the last time it encountered a particular sea state this represents the main advantage of reinforcement learning over traditional optimization algorithms which would be unable to identify whether a change in the cost function is due to a change in the pto damping or stiffness coefficients or due to noise in the wave energy in a realistic application a finer grid of b pto and c pto values would be desired in order to deal with a large range of sea states nevertheless this may increase the learning time excessively the q table is expected to be pre initialized through numerical simulations in order to prevent selecting pto settings that result in excessive motions in energetic sea states which could be a real problem with reactive control in addition the exploration and learning rates should be reset every season so as to check if there have been variations in the device response over time e g due to slow marine growth or abrupt non critical subsystems failure since the operational life of wec technologies is envisioned to be 20 25 years a relatively poor performance during the initial stages of operation should be more than offset by increases in the absorbed wave power throughout a devices operating life through the removal of modelling errors finally it is important to understand that rl is proposed as a method to remove the dependence of existing wec control strategies from hydrodynamic models in rl the controller is independent of the plant in this work a hydrodynamic model based on potential flow theory with some non linear viscous effects is used to simulate the plant nevertheless as shown for instance in anderlini in preparation for resistive control rl control is able to converge towards the optimal policy even in the presence of strong non linear effects associated with the pto system hence due to its model free nature rl is expected to perform well even when applied to non linear numerical models such as cfd or even in experimental or prototype testing however the overall controller performance is only as good as the control scheme itself with reactive control representing a significant improvement over resistive control treated in the previous study anderlini 2016 7 conclusions the authors have presented an on line model free strategy for the reactive control of wecs using rl building on a previous study on resistive control the algorithm has been validated through a numerical model of a two body point absorber which assumes linear wave theory in both regular and irregular waves the controller is shown to learn the optimal pto damping and stiffness coefficients that result in maximum energy absorption in order to achieve convergence in irregular waves a statistical reward function has been developed which averages over multiple mean absorbed power values in each sea state as the control scheme is independent of internal models of the device response it is simple to implement on a real full scale wec additionally it can adapt to variations in the machine conditions over time e g due to ageing or marine biofouling although the q table has been randomly initialized in a real application it is expected to be pre calculated through simulations in order to prevent the adoption of actions that may cause failures in extreme waves the action values will then be slowly substituted by the actual measured data during operation with corresponding necessary adjustments finally this method which has already been generalised to the application to multi body devices in this work since a previous study anderlini 2016 can be further extended to the treatment of arrays of devices acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the energy technologies institute eti and

offshore structures 1 introduction since the first full scale measurement system for offshore platforms was put into practice by the bmt company in 1987 peters et al 1990 field monitoring has been widely developed in the gulf of mexico the north sea the ocean adjacent to brazil and west african waters to record the environmental parameters structural responses riser tension tendon tension shapes of mooring systems etc peng and zhi 2012 prototype measurements of offshore platforms in the south china sea and the bohai sea have been conducted since the 1990s by shanghai jiao tong university hu et al 2011 and dalian university of technology du et al 2014 respectively to date many platforms worldwide have been synchronously equipped with monitoring systems during the construction of the platforms a significant number of field monitoring projects for offshore platforms have been developed by oil and gas companies and institutions all over the world table 1 shows the typical monitoring projects of offshore platforms since 1996 as the exploitation of marine resources moves into deeper water floating platforms for drilling or production may be subjected to an extreme environmental condition and the safety of personals and platforms is a priority position in platform design and operation compared with the assumptions and simplification in numerical analysis and the limitations in physical model tests field monitoring of offshore structures can directly obtain raw data in real time enabling the timely detection of structural failures safety assessments and predictions of performance changes and the remaining structural life du et al 2014 moreover field monitoring can verify the design parameters and provide a database for post project analysis peters et al 1990 due to the complex environment loads and complicated failure mechanisms of the riser and mooring systems field monitoring has become an effective method for obtaining real time tracking and feedback information based on a specialized monitoring system to reduce failure risk during installation operations at sea field monitoring can provide necessary operational support these factors all contribute to the popularity of research on field monitoring this paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent developments in field monitoring for offshore structures noteworthy

offshore construction operations and integrity management field monitoring in other ocean related fields such as the health monitoring of submarine pipelines and ocean ecological environment monitoring are briefly described in section 5 conclusions and further research directions are noted at the end 2 monitoring scopes and sensing technologies an integrated field monitoring system of an offshore structures should provide tracking and feedback information on the metocean structural motions and operational status to obtain a comprehensive understanding of structural dynamic behavior to calculate the accumulated damage and to assess the overall safety status as the fundamental elements of the monitoring system sensors with satisfactory performance are essential to ensure the reliability of monitoring systems thus the precision durability and stability aspects of sensors are discussed in this section 2 1 metocean metocean factors are complicated when combined with wind waves currents and sometimes internal waves and ice structural responses can be significant when a platform is subjected to extreme environmental conditions which will result in serious consequences such as ecocatastrophes or even deaths therefore it is essential to conduct the matocean monitoring 2 1 1 wind wind speed and direction are primary inputs for evaluating floating system responses qu and shi 2013 as crane operations and helicopters are susceptible to wind loads a vane anemometer is widely used to detect the speed and direction of the wind while an acoustic anemometer with high reliability is preferable in hurricane qu et al 2013 different types of anemometers are listed in table 2 2 1 2 waves the significant height and peak period of waves are the primary factors that influence platform responses and can be easily measured by a wave buoy edwards et al 2005 two wave buoys the motion reference unit mru and the differential global positioning system dgps used in the smart 800 buoy are described by krogstad et al 1999 in addition x band radar is also available to measure wave parameters borge and soares 2000 reichert et al 2006 it is possible to install the x band radar even on a movable platform and from there to scan the sea surface with high temporal and spatial resolutions it estimates the directional wave spectra with a range of several kilometers based on the characteristics of the site where it is installed by analyzing the spatial and temporal changes of the radar backscatter from the sea surface it can determine the directional wave and even surface current information in 1994 the x band wamos ⅱ radar was installed on the 2 4 k spar platform in the north sea to measure wave characteristics with high precision irani et al 2007 additionally air gap sensors were used to measure the air gap between the lower deck and the sea level and the wave height information can also derived from the measured data the configuration and number of air gap sensors are recommended by edwards et al 2005 the wave buoy microwave radar air gap sensor and x band radar are shown in fig 1 comparisons between the different wave measurement sensors are listed in table 3 2 1 3 current long slender structures are susceptible to current in deep water and the response of risers and mooring systems to currents can sometimes be destructive deepwater current observation around platforms is essential and feasible through the installation of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps govea et al 2006 there are three types of adcps the 38 khz ocean surveyor os adcp 75 khz long ranger lr adcp and the 300 khz horizontal h adcp as shown in fig 2 the 38 khz os adcp provides the deepest penetration with a range of up to 1100 m and is widely installed in deep water the h adcp is always installed on the platforms to measure the current profile with a small tilt the lr adcp is deployed looking downward from a heave plate with a range of up to 750 m current monitoring with these three types of adcp packages can achieve an overall view of the current within a 4000 foot water depth edwards et al 2005 the deployment of the three types of adcp is illustrated in fig 3 brown et al 2005 provided the details of the development for the measurement of currents through water depths of up to 3 000 m by integrating a number of adcps deployed off a structure in the water column and on the sea bed to obtain a profile of the currents through the whole water column single point current measurement instruments offer another approach for collecting current data at various depths by using a mooring to support the sensors point measurement sensors such as rotary vanes and paddle wheels are installed within the water column or near the bottom although the sensor itself is inexpensive the backup facilities used to deploy and operate the sensor far outweigh the benefit in most occasions a regular point measurement sensor can obtain current information only at its depth while the complete current profile information can be measured by an adcp lan and qu 2011 the contrasts between adcps and point measurement are also introduced by campman et al 2005 2 1 4 internal waves internal waves are defined as gravity waves propagating within a density stratified water column and have been detected for a long time elachi and apel 1976 osborne and burch 1980 zheng et al 1993 the occurrence of the internal waves has been confirmed in many places in asian marginal seas such as in the south china sea andaman sea and sulu sea these waves can propagate several hundred kilometers and transport tremendous energy with turbulence and mixing which have a strong effect on structural responses and may even lead to blooms or death internal waves have been observed by many high resolution satellite images such as synthetic aperture radar sar images and optical images of spot in sar images based on the sensitivity to the ocean internal waves associated with sea surface roughness variations a bright band followed immediately by a dark band demonstrates a depression internal wave packet while a dark band followed by a bright band can be identified as an elevation internal wave packet hsu and liu 1999 in satellite optical images the sea surface manifestations of the internal wave must be identified to lie inside or outside the sunglint area or just in the transition zone the rough front line is identified as a bright line when the imaged area lies outside the sunglint area and as a dark line when it lies inside this area mitnik et al 2000 optical imaging requires cloudfree or partially cloudfree weather conditions and is strongly dependent on the viewing geometry however radar imagery is almost independent of weather conditions these high resolution satellite images are usually expensive and uneconomical however sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs ocean color imagers have been developed based on the changes in surface chlorophyll chl concentrations caused by internal waves silva et al 2002 these images have been applied in the sulu sea and are free but have a lower spatial resolution ho et al 2006 the internal wave images acquired by different kinds of sensors are shown in fig 4 2 1 5 ice ice is one of the key environmental factors in high latitude regions primary parameters of sea ice including ice edge location ice concentration ice thickness ice topography and roughness are supposed to be monitored when a platform operates in ice vinje et al 1998 conducted some ice thickness observations obtained by moored upward looking sonars ulss in fram strait to study the thickness distribution and annual cycle of ice leaving the arctic ocean afterwards the sea ice retrieval system of the hy la satellite was constructed by luo et al 2004 and the data of the hy 1a were applied to the sea ice monitoring and forecasting for the bohai sea of china for the first time moreover sar imagery with different frequency bands is widely used to gather information about the state of the sea ice cover in polar regions scheuchl et al 2004 dierking and busche 2006 ice loads generated by wind waves and current may be significant however there is no well developed method for the numerical simulation or model testing of ice loads instead many institutions use prototype measurement as a primary method in the ice force researches prototype measurements of ice force were conducted in certain cold regions such as bohai sea in china wang 2011 and most of the arctic offshore regions it is still difficult to obtain the complete real time ice force data and there are few relevant details of the measurement technologies in the early stage an esso sensor was used to measure the displacement response of the sensor under ice load then the change in the electrical capacitance of the panel is measured and the ice pressure on the sensor is calculated however the results are non linear and susceptible to electromagnetic interference these factors and other issues prompted the emergence and development of the medof metge and pilkington 1983 pilkington et al 1983 frederking et al 2002 and epr templeton 1980 chen 1981 sensors which are more reliable more sensitive and less expensive in addition to normal loads the sensors can be instrumented with strain gauges to measure the shear loads exerted on them by the ice additionally hexpack sensors use a strain gauge to measure the pressure change inside the rigid material to obtain the pressure on the box in the ice situation graham et al 1983 although the configurations and design philosophies of these sensors are different they are all embedded pressure sensors 2 1 6 tide it is quite common to take advantage of the tidal cycle for offshore operation such as the floatover installation tide level monitoring is currently very important for the operator and is achieved by averaging pressure data acquired from a tide gauge luo et al 2015 monitored the tide level in a floatover installation project with the tide gauge installed inside a pump casing on the jacket and the pump casing can be used for wave filtering the measuring principle of tide level is shown in fig 5 the water level h can be obtained via eq 1 as given below 1 p p 0 ρ g h where p is the pressure measured by the pressure transducer p 0 represents the barometric pressure ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the tide level is the difference between the water level and amphidromic point 2 1 7 other measurements most field monitoring systems of offshore structures include other important metocean parameters such as atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity and even storm surges with the support of the monitored information mentioned above the normal work and operation of the instruments are ensured in the working platforms at sea 2 2 structural motions offshore structures are subjected to harsh marine environments and have complex motion modes structure position and motions are of great interest to the operators the position of a structure can be accurately measured by a dgps liagre et al 2008 tang et al 2013 gps base stations were installed on the jacket and two gps mobile stations were installed longitudinally on the hull by locating the three dimensional coordinates of the three gpss and the known baseline length the angle between the baseline and geographic north can be calculated zhu 2014 a platform in deep water such as a semi submersible platform can be measured by a real time kinematic rtk system with the base station onshore wang 2015 in addition the inertial navigation systems inss composed of gyroscopes and accelerometers can be used to monitor the inclinations and orientation of structures with high reliability due to being free from outside interferences however the drift error of the gyroscope and the zero deviation of the accelerometer are the most direct and important factors affecting the accuracy of the ins the error of data collected from the ins may accumulate so it usually works in conjunction with dgps to ensure precision qu et al 2013 it is also accepted that an accelerometer and an inclinometer are necessary to guarantee redundancy li et al 2006 the properties and characteristics of different sensors are summarized in table 4 the sway and surge of deep water platforms in the gulf of mexico have been recorded by dgps reichert et al 2006 measurements of floater kinematics based on accelerometers angular rate sensors and dgps was conducted by gkaras et al 2008 full scale measurements for an fpso on the six degrees of freedom were developed by hu et al 2011 in their study the acceleration sensors measured the local acceleration in three directions gps installed on an open deck measured the horizontal position of the fpso moreover the movement of the nanhai tiaozhan fps of the lh11 1 oil field was measured by dgps while its rotation was recorded by the inss installed on the roof where the wind sensor locates qu et al 2013 2 3 structural operational status offshore structures are always working under complex and extremely adverse circumstances affecting the safety of the platform the corrosion and marine growth monitoring of platform hulls the tension and fatigue monitoring of risers and mooring lines as well as the operational status monitoring of other detailed structures are highlighted in field monitoring to reduce the failure risks 2 3 1 platform hull corrosion has been established as the predominant factor causing the widespread premature deterioration of the platform hull especially of the structures located in the spray splash zone the spray splash zone is the region of alternate wetting and drying formed by the action of tides and waves and is the most serious corrosion area corrosion monitoring can be divided into two major categories i e the offline monitoring and the online monitoring chen et al 2010 wu et al 2015 offline monitoring including the ultrasonic method and magnetic leakage method detects the corrosion status of structures or equipment at certain time intervals and can be used to control the risk and prevent the accidents in contrast online monitoring is the continuous or regular automatic monitoring of the corrosion status in addition to the weight loss method electrochemical measurement resistance probe and inductance probe techniques are also the effective methods in online corrosion monitoring chen et al 2010 presented the current corrosion monitoring technology for offshore platforms mainly in the following ways the alternating current field method acfm the field signature method fsm the underwater robot probe the imaging technology and the preset monitoring system shi and tian 2011 developed a set of ultrasonic corrosion monitoring systems to detect the corrosion of a pillar the platform hull submerged in the sea will eventually host a community of marine organisms growing on and associated with its surface the marine growth or biofouling is comprised of a variety of species depending on the location depth and configuration of the structure which will have consequences for structural integrity hydrodynamic efficiency and survivability of devices and may also lead to the growth of non native or invasive species ideally the biofouling sensors would need to incorporate capabilities that can indicate volume extent exact location and type of biofouling in order to determine the best course of mitigation action the simplest method of monitoring marine growth is with the employment of marine scientists specially trained and experienced in characterizing fouling assemblages the visual surveys settlement plates plankton net sampling in situ monitoring rov and close up underwater photography can all be used to parameterize the extent of biofouling on a structure stephen et al 1996 fiber optics can also be applied to monitor the marine growth some technologies take advantage of a continual light source being deflected by fouling organisms to measure deposition wong et al 2003 farhat et al 2015 produced oxygen sensors by mapping the two dimensional distribution of o2 concentrations and o2 decrease rates in the membrane where biofouling occurs which can help to better understand exactly where the hotpots might be and lead to more effective mitigation strategies ore catapult 2016 presented a report about feasibility of sensor development for monitoring marine growth all the sensing technologies and corresponding considerations were introduced and summarized 2 3 2 riser in most tlp and spar platforms the top tensioned risers ttrs supported by buoyancy are developed the ttr monitoring system ttrms presented by edwards et al 2005 consists of three strain gage compression load cells for each riser which are exposed to measurement the loads with a range of 1500 kips the resulting composite accuracy in the tension range of interest was 1 or better the fatigue performance monitoring of a riser requires the monitoring of the dynamic and static strain levels undergone by the riser during the entire life cycle and can be accomplished with a measurement package which is rov retrievable and deployable a sensor system based on fiber optic technology is designed to evaluate a riser s performance and fatigue life by eni e p inaudi et al 2007 the system consists of an underwater sensing network an interconnection system and the appropriate surface equipment thethi et al 2005 presented a riser fatigue monitoring strategy and implemented it on a ttr of the deepwater gom spar a standalone logger monitoring system was adopted to measure the fatigue damage accumulation in the riser and the conductor system below the mud line as shown in fig 6 morrison and dean 2007 invented the apparatuses and methods for monitoring the stress in steel catenary risers scrs using fiber optic sensors which can be pre installed on the new risers or post installed on the existing risers a typical scr instrumentation including the strain gauges the motion sensors and the flex joint angle measurements is illustrated in fig 7 in addition the subsea strain sensor assembly is shown in fig 8 another riser monitoring assembly was developed by allen and pinto 2008 to monitor and manage a riser extending between subsea well equipment and a floating platform flexible risers are the composite structures consisting of several metal amours and polymeric layers and are widely used in offshore platforms due to their excellent performance and simpler mounting and operation than their rigid counterparts the feasibility of using fiber bragg grating fbg sensing technology for strain monitoring in flexible risers was demonstrated by andersen et al 2001 jacques et al 2010 applied non destructive testing ndt techniques to a flexible riser in a full scale dynamic loading test comparisons were conducted with the readings from fiber optic sensors based on the bragg gratings and the acoustic emission studies prescott and brower 2005 williams 2007 feng 2013 brower et al 2013 show that the fiber optic sensors are ideally suited for subsea applications and have been widely used in the field monitoring for offshore structures due to their high multiplexing capability immunization to electromagnetic interference little signal loss small size and corrosion resistance apart from the riser top tension measurement and riser fatigue performance measurement as slender structures risers are susceptible to the current in deep water therefore the measurement of vortex induced vibration viv is essential in the field monitoring of risers howells and lim 1999 described the full scale test and monitoring programmes with respect to the riser vivs based on their work recommendations for monitoring viv response were defined and alternative methods for viv design were proposed the researchers of 2h offshore developed a standalone subsea monitoring instrument integrating temperature pressure acceleration inclination and angular velocity sensors into one package to record the viv response peng and zhi 2012 in another study sensors for strains and accelerations from the norwegian deepwater programme ndp experiments were installed on an instrumented riser to examine the characteristics of the viv response shi et al 2012 many other field monitoring studies were conducted regarding the viv of risers beynet et al 2008 natarajan et al 2006 2 3 3 mooring line with an increase in mooring line failures over the last decade the status monitoring of mooring lines is commonly involved in a field monitoring system it is known that there are two kinds of mooring line tension monitoring technologies the direct tension measurement and the inclinometer based tension calculation chen 2015 for the former one the mooring systems with the fixed chainstoppers are outfitted with load cells underneath their base however the measured loads at the chainstopper are highly inaccurate for the friction in the fairleads the latter one can derive an approximation of the mooring line tension by measuring the angle of the mooring line at or near the top connection to the platform ukani et al 2012 minnebo et al 2014 proposed an alternative and cost effective solution using an accurate position monitoring system based on a dgps system with the appropriate software and data analysis this system can provide information on mooring performance and even mooring line failure tendon tension measurements are of great importance for the weight distribution and real time operation of a tlp to ensure the safety peng and zhi 2012 a study edwards et al 2005 used three underwater compression load cells installed on a tendon to monitor the tension and the sensor configuration was introduced in detail measurement units of tendon tension monitoring systems consist of porch based units and in line units in porch based units each tension tendon has three load cells distributed evenly along the porch ring with two strain gauges in each cell to obtain redundant information the in line units are composed of two sensors welded to the forging the former one can be installed to measure tension during the construction of a tlp while the latter one can be placed in position without regular calibration liu et al 2016 the viv phenomena of tendons under the action of currents and the irregular motions of the platform will cause alternating stresses in tendons under these stresses small defects in the tendon may spread and then result in fatigue damage li and gerretsen 2011 developed a viv inference technology termed as viv detector the underlying idea is to use the tension measurements of a tubular to infer its bending responses due to vortex shedding 2 3 4 other detailed structures operational status monitoring of other detailed structures such as s lay stinger soft yoke mooring system and weldments were conducted in many field monitoring projects submarine pipelines are laid onto the seabed by the s lay method as illustrated in fig 9 a real time onboard monitoring system for the stinger is recommended to guarantee the safety of the pipelaying process the monitoring items includes the relative angle between the vessel and the stinger stress at the joint of the vessel and the stinger shape of the pipe on the stinger and loads on the rollers song et al 2010 divided the s lay stinger monitoring into shape monitoring stress monitoring roller load monitoring water depth monitoring and submarine topography monitoring the applied sensors and corresponding installation positions are described in table 5 soft yoke mooring system are a cost effective and reliable solution for permanently mooring fso fpso in shallow water this single point mooring system includes a soft yoke for mooring a vessel directly to a fixed tower typically soft yoke mooring system are composed of a counter weight mooring legs an a frame structure a yoke nose etc wu et al 2016 installed fbg gauges on two mooring legs for short term restore force measurements of the soft yoke the layout of the fbg gauges on the mooring legs is presented as shown in fig 10 fan et al 2015 designed a comprehensive field monitoring system for the soft yoke mooring system in bohai bay over a long time of monitoring certain common phenomena such as transverse oscillation and stern spin behavior was discovered in three fpsos the deformation problem with respect to the platform hull and detailed structures mentioned above may affect the platform structural integrity and cause loss of production thus it is very important to monitor its occurrences deformation monitoring for offshore structures facilities can be accomplished with several measurement technologies tiltmeters gps and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar are the three most common techniques for monitoring surface deformation davis et al 2008 tiltmeters measure the deformation gradient rather than the deformation itself so the gradient needs to be integrated to calculate the actual deformation the precision achieved with gps is far lower than with tilt but is nonetheless remarkable the insar is an effective way to measure vertical changes in the offshore structures by comparing the distance from a satellite to a ground point on the offshore structures taken at different times matori et al 2014 ferretti et al 2001 developed a new technique of insar called persistent scatterer interferometry psi to improve the ability of insar which can detect deformation using a large number of sar images over the same area the characteristics of different deformation monitoring techniques are listed in table 6 premature failures of weldments have been a common occurrence at high temperature due to creep deformation creep deformation and damage mechanisms driving failure of weldments are not well understood due to the variation in composition microstructure properties as well as the influence of geometry residual stress primary load and environment the deformation in a small region cannot be measured by a conventional displacement gauge in consideration of the difficulties in measuring long term localized creep deformation tu et al 2002 developed a new techniques utilizing the merits of quartz optical fiber and a computer image processing technique with which strain distributions and evolutions in the weldments are obtained in another investigation carried out by sakanashi et al 2016 a digital image correlation dic based system has been developed for long term high temperature creep strain measurement in order to characterize the material deformation behavior of separate regions of a multi pass weld it had been demonstrated that a dic monitoring technique can provide measurements of local variations of elastic plastic and creep strain in inhomogeneous materials at elevated temperature 3 design of a monitoring system field monitoring of an offshore structures is a complex undertaking with multiple facilities working together good stability durability compatibility and credibility performances are essential for an efficient monitoring system in addition making the system compact with less interference on the platform is of great interest to the designer the designs of monitoring systems are composed of the following three parts 3 1 optimization of sensor placement the location and number of the selected sensors need to be determined precisely based on multiple optimal objects which is a complex mathematical problem peng and zhi 2012 fig 11 shows a typical installation layout of a full sensor system the aim of the study is to obtain the most accurate measurement information with the minimum number of sensors and the considerations can be classified into four types where the damage is most likely to occur should be evaluated and the motion data are of greatest concern taking the scr as an example the two regions of the scr experiencing the highest stresses and fatigue damage are the hang off location and the touchdown zone tdz podskarbi et al 2007 thus the monitoring should focus on these locations for the flexible joints monitoring should include internal pressure temperature tension and cyclic rotation thethi and an 2008 the optimal location of sensors for a measurement target should be calculated by using an optimization method the principle behind the sensor placement is to have a sufficient extent of the sensors to capture the entire mode of response natarajan et al 2006 developed a sensor placement approach to obtain the dynamic behavior of risers through a linear regression method based on the modal decomposition additionally the connection between different apparatuses of the monitoring system should be within easy reach to ensure the electricity supply and data transmission finally the installation location of different apparatuses should exhibit the most appropriate conditions for example an anemometer should be installed at a top position to avoid contaminated wind different types of adcps should be installed at different water depths and a closed room is preferred to protect the facilities from sunshine and rain sometimes temperature and humidity factors are also considered to ensure the reliability of the apparatus 3 2 integrated marine monitoring systems immss the imms is developed to solve the problems of the measurement frequency not being synchronized between the sensors and the sensors having different data storage formats to improve the management of a large number of sensors yuan 2013 unlike the in house tests field monitoring cannot control any experimental elements and the frequency of each kind of information occurrence is uncertain to solve the problem of unifying different frequency information two aspects of hardware and software should be considered to ensure synchronized of data collection wu et al 2013 the purpose of this step is to make the management of the monitoring system more intelligent and systematic and the measurement information more synchronized and integrated sufficient reliability is required to ensure the long term operation of the system simple operation less maintenance and high redundancy are also essential to an effective system fig 12 shows a schematic overview of a typical imms the following functionalities should be considered when imms software is designed data acquisition and storage real time data display provision of real time data access from the shore side workstations real time curve of motion display metocean display in real time platform offsets and attitude display history data retrieval automatic generation of daily reports an efficient imms offers simple data acquisition search and storage and allows display screens to provide meaningful information and operator interaction via a user friendly interface as shown in fig 13 furthermore in certain exceptional cases safety evaluation anomaly inspection and early warning are also required to satisfy safety requirements zhang et al 2010 presented a design of common data acquisition systems for marine environment monitoring the systems are capable of marine monitoring data collection real time display analysis and information management the design of an aquatic monitoring integrated system was conducted to provide the development process of the integrated monitoring system the hardware monitoring programmes and the pc software designs wei and zhang 1999 3 3 independent remote monitoring system irms the irms consists of two parts measuring device controls and independent energy controls which is an entirely independent backup system with limited capability designed to transmit critical marine data to onshore workstations during evacuation in hurricane conditions apparatuses of satellite communications and power supplies are developed to enable near real time data transmission back to shore to obtain the comprehensive measurement information it is key to ensure power supply during emergency evacuations when the platform cannot supply power as normal an irms makes it possible to obtain all of the process information under extreme sea conditions as the basis of research on damage mechanisms and design assessment of platform structures it is commonly believed that the design of an irms should follow the below principles von aschwege et al 2007 in the case of an emergency evacuation the battery has enough battery life to support the system the communication system should have a sufficient data transfer rate to ensure real time data transmission the system should have the ability to be remotely controlled and easily operated from shore the system should offer simple data acquisition retrieval access and storage capabilities the system design should be simple with the characteristics of reasonable layout and high reliability stanford university and the massachusetts institute of technology collaborated to develop a new generation of internet based remote monitoring systems the dm2000 system and the pds system in the united states which are the third generation system of condition monitoring and safety assessment are capable of simultaneous online monitoring and fault diagnosis of multiple devices with remote communication capability wei and zhang 1999 ou et al 2001 shanghai jiao tong university developed a shore based control center with real time data processing abilities which is shown in fig 14 additional design and operational considerations of irmss as well as hardware and configuration were illustrated in detail by von aschwege et al 2007 for mexico deepwater floating production systems as shown in fig 15 4 applications of field monitoring for offshore structures field monitoring is the most direct way to obtain the actual response of structures and real time parameters of the marine environment particularly in extreme conditions which is considered invaluable to operators and designers thus a large number of field monitoring projects for offshore structures have been conducted all over the world the applications of these programmes are extensive as detailed in the following 4 1 construction of the database in traditional studies such as numerical simulations and model tests there are inevitably hypotheses simplifications and limitations of experimental conditions raw data from extreme events are very rare field monitoring can be developed to record performance data that will yield valuable comparisons of actual and predicted responses then further understanding of the design assumptions and methodologies can be obtained the results can give an indication of how much conservative the original design is and can also guide certain minor adjustments for future platform design for the reasons mentioned above it is essential to build a database to record the characteristics of the running platform and parameters of sea conditions teigen and haver 1998 presented comparisons between full scale measurements and numerical predictions for the heidrun tlp and a general verification analysis was developed to compare long term measured response characteristics with references established during the design phase the conclusion was that the measured responses agreed very well with the computed values karunakaran et al 1999 compared measurements with the calculated natural frequency the design stiffness and simulated platform responses a full scale data comparison of the measurements and analytical predictions for the horn mountain spar in hurricane isidore and another summer storm was also performed by tahar et al 2005 the conclusion was that the uncoupled analytical models for spar behavior predict the wave frequency responses accurately on the other hand riser coupling has an influence on the slowly varying responses another study assessed the horn mountain spar in hurricane ivan was conducted xu et al 2007 both the environment and spar responses in the hurricane were measured analyzed results were compared to the measurements of the spar responses in the hurricane and the findings confirm both the robustness of the current spar design practice and the accuracy of the analysis tools gupta et al 2008 presented a determination of riser tensioner properties from full scale data recorded on the holstein spar production facility in hurricane season perryman et al 2009 introduced the measurements of sea states and motions of the holstein spar in extreme seas the data from two major hurricanes rita and ike were recorded and the measured responses were compared to hindcast predictions predictions were also made for potential environments using a post rita hindcast a preliminary analysis of the statistics of an approximately one year air gap measurement for a semi submersible in the south china sea was performed by ge et al 2016b the air gap extreme could be predicted by fitting the probability density and cumulative probability distribution curve there are many related studies prislin et al 1999 van and vanden 2007 perego et al 2005 tahar et al 2006 halkyard et al 2004 showing that the recorded data from the field monitoring have a wide range of applications to verify design practices and improve analysis tools 4 2 safety evaluation and early warning aggressive schedules to meet first oil and financial budgets commitments in times of ever increasing construction costs can lead to oversights in the design process and fabrication and installation errors thethi and an 2008 the risks for a deepwater platform in service may include the following aspects as built or installation anomalies long term and extreme environment data at the site coupled motion behavior with risers or the mooring system non conservative hydrodynamic response prediction material degradation with time changes in service or operating conditions the failure of offshore structures will not only lead to direct economic losses and casualties but also cause environmental pollution and political effects with the continuous development of structural parameter identification damage analysis and safety assessment as well as further improvements in sensor technologies monitoring apparatuses and computer technology safety evaluation and early warning are highly valued by the industry peng and zhi 2012 divided structural safety evaluation and early warning into three levels threshold calibration and damage threshold monitoring compares measured data to alert levels to determine whether key performance indicators have reached a critical or near critical level cook et al 2006 once the alert level has been reached the safety warning and operational steps should be triggered calibration monitoring verifies the design assumptions and tools while damage monitoring is performed in real time to avoid structural damage evolution goldsmith et al 2007 established high and medium alert levels or so called key performance indicators kpis based on design analysis and operating data measured data are compared with these alert levels and when an alert level is reached further response evaluation or inspection of the components in question is recommended the motions air gap and hot point strains of hysy981 were measured by shanghai jiao tong university to evaluate the operational performance if the monitoring data reach the set threshold the system will automatically make an alarm 4 3 safeguarding of offshore construction operations offshore operations of oil and gas exploration are of high cost and high risk field monitoring as a safeguard of offshore construction operations can effectively reduce the risk and ensure the safety of the personnel and equipment the primary function of the monitoring system is to provide real time information in an easily understandable format as the operational decision support for operators normally site environment information consisting of wind wave tide and sometimes current is collected the measurements of the position and attitude of the platform are essential during operations moreover the key point strain and the relative distance between structures are measured in specific operational situations field monitoring for offshore construction operations is different from normal full scale measurements outstanding precision and excellent reliability are required data must be displayed and analyzed in real time and any emergency must be quickly identified and evaluated furthermore given the high cost and high added value of offshore operations decisions must be balanced against cost and safety two jacket launching monitoring projects fig 16 and seven floatover installation monitoring projects fig 17 were conducted by shanghai jiao tong university chen 2014 he et al 2014 hu et al 2016 during the jacket launching operations the metocean and loads on the side rocker were measured the information on the attitude and motions of the jacket was also provided in real time including the following parameters jacket launching depth jacket launching angle jacket maximum pitch angle jacket maximum horizontal stroke barge maximum horizontal stroke the measured data mentioned above provide essential indicators for the operator which plays an important role in ensuring operation safety during the processes of floatover installation the metocean including information on the wind current waves and tide was measured at the site in addition the track and motions of the barge were also monitored and displayed in real time at the control center additionally the force of collision with respect to the fender and jacket cushions was also provided to support the floatover installation such as the collision force monitoring system developed by ge et al 2016a to monitor the stress response of the jacket legs in the lufeng7 2 topside floatover installation in this system mounted fiber grating strain sensors were installed on the jacket legs 4 4 integrity management the offshore oil and gas industry has come to realize that there are too many instances of premature failure leading to serious consequences in response to this situation there has been rapid growth in integrity management related research and development allen 2015 studied the integrity management of structures floating systems and subsea assets the three major components of floating system integrity management include marine monitoring platform inspections and marine assurance engineering geyer et al 2009 a generic integrity management system taken from dnv rp f116 veritas 2009 includes risk assessment and planning inspection testing and monitoring integrity assessments and mitigation intervention and repair the fundamental purpose of integrity management is to identify and manage risks that could impact the health and safety of personnel or cause structural fatigue fig 18 provides a detail of the life cycle integrated management process field monitoring of marine data is a critical component of the integrated management programme for floating systems and the value of marine monitoring was presented by du et al 2014 and irani et al 2007 particularly in terms of how it contributes to the following operating facilities in a safe manner assessing and verifying in place performance minimizing down time and lost production conducting forensic investigation maximizing future tieback capacity goldsmith et al 2007 described the role of offshore monitoring in an integrity management programme and demonstrated that the development of alert levels based on potential failure modes of the riser system is key gordon et al 2014 presented mooring integrity management and noted that monitoring is an important part of mooring integrity and should be enforced as a viable means to address the condition of the mooring system along with inspection programmes 5 cases of monitoring in other ocean related fields from the above discussion a comprehensive review of recent development in the field monitoring of offshore structures is provided however field monitoring in the ocean is performed not only for offshore platforms but also in other fields such as health monitoring of a submarine pipeline and ocean ecological environment monitoring to a certain extent their measurement methods and principles are consistent therefore it is essential to obtain a general understanding of other field monitoring activities 5 1 health monitoring of submarine pipelines submarine pipeline systems play an important role in transporting oil from offshore to land however offshore pipeline systems collapse occasionally which inevitably leads to oil leakage environmental pollution and enormous economic loss from the investigation performed by the china national offshore oil crop cnooc the primary causes of pipeline failure are corrosion impulses and free spanning vibration jin et al 2003 corrosion failure can be prevented by the annual corrosion inspections it is worth noting that the free spanning vibration plays a dominant role in the accidents of a pipeline system when the frequency of the environment is close to the natural frequency of a pipeline a resonance phenomenon occurs consequently high stress damage or fatigue damage can occur which poses a serious threat to the safety of the pipeline to ensure the safety of a submarine pipeline system a health monitoring system is applied to measure the strain and temperature along the pipeline the free spanning vibration frequency is also recorded to predict the failure in early applications the smart pig method ultrasonic detection technique magnetic flux leakage method ultrasound wave method eddy current and pressure difference method were used in submarine pipeline monitoring systems kishawy and gabbar 2010 however with the development of fiber optic sensors numerous new studies on monitoring technologies for submarine pipeline systems have been conducted jin et al 2003 developed a health monitoring system with distributed fiber optic sensors dofss applying wavelength division multiplex wdm technology and dofss in series for long distance measurement which has the function of diagnosis and auto alarm if free spanning vibration occurs or the strain reaches the set alarm level caution will be taken the system is composed of three parts as shown in fig 19 additionally scour is initiated by flow action that removes the cover and exposes pipelines to the waves and currents therefore scour monitoring for submarine pipelines was developed zhao et al 2012 designed a novel scour monitoring system of a three index estimator tie based on active thermometry to identify the surrounding media using tie analysis a thermal cable deployed parallel to the pipeline was used to generate heat and synchronously measure temperature with ds18b20s as shown in fig 20 the temperature time histories were acquired and the identification of free spans was achieved moreover an integrated autoregressive moving average arma model algorithm was developed for the structural health monitoring of offshore pipelines by bao et al 2013 this algorithm can provide accurate identification of damage locations and offshore pipeline damage 5 2 ocean ecological environment monitoring currently the anthropogenic impact on the ocean during the development of marine resources contributes significantly to the pollution of individual ocean zones which reduces the natural capacity of ocean ecosystems for reproduction and self regulation the ecological monitoring of marine ecosystems comprising geophysical and biotic monitoring is a comprehensible universal method for widely covering the elements of the biosphere israel and tsiban 1981 ocean ecological environment monitoring technology constitutes the technical support of marine resource development which is of great significance to marine economic development and resource exploration the primary parameters currently monitored include the following liu and wang 2001 hydrometeorological parameters of the ocean the velocity and direction of the wind current water temperature air pressure waves etc water quality parameters in the biological state solvent oxygen ph value salinity chlorophyll content organic matter phenol content etc physical and chemical parameters various nutrients nitrates nitrites phosphates etc various heavy metals etc nuclear radiation marine environmental monitoring technology has always involved on site sampling and chemical analysis in the laboratory to monitor a variety of harmful substances however taking the complexity of the marine environment into consideration field monitoring is required for automatic long term and continuous measurement of certain critical parameters such as temperature ph do salinity and turbidity to study the intrinsic relationships among them the united states japan france norway russia and other countries have developed field monitoring sensors for ocean ecological environments table 7 summarizes the marine environmental monitoring technologies liu and wang 2001 6 conclusion and suggestions with the development of marine resource exploitation moving into deep water field monitoring has drawn the increasing attention worldwide increasingly more offshore structures will be fabricated and installed with monitoring systems which will further encourage the development of sensor technologies and monitoring systems based on the previous and continuing accumulation of knowledge suggestions for further studies on field monitoring are as follows a smaller and lighter monitoring instruments with less power requirement and higher accuracy are needed to ensure their practicability durability and credibility particularly for the long term offshore monitoring additionally the synchronization of the clock in the sensor package and data fusion technology of multi reference units are also worth examining moreover it has been shown that fiber optic sensors are ideally suited for multi parameter measurements with high capability so strengthening the development and application of fiber optic sensors should be a focus of future research b the optimization of sensor placement should be improved to reduce the difficulties in layout and installation correspondingly the rov technology of subsea installation on the lower segment of structures in deepwater should be developed distributed sensing technology and improved deployment and packaging should be performed in advance additionally multi measurement modules should be highly coordinated with each other and data integration between different measurement units and intelligent user interface displays are highlighted in the design of immss for unknown reasons there is always wireless signal loss during the process of remote data transmission complete storage and streaming of data from platforms to onshore workstations should be developed to ensure real time display and post processing which is crucial for irmss c taking into account the similarity of the measurement principles a mature field monitoring system of offshore structures can be applied to and greatly impact other areas of marine monitoring and play a great role given the significant costs in many applications it has been difficult to quantify the benefits such as for the strain measurement systems for long term application in deepwater and construction of the database designers should balance the accuracy and cost to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy d with the continuous development of field monitoring for offshore structures and related technology maturing a set of systematic and comprehensive instructions for technology and design should be developed to standardize these complex undertakings to provide support for future field monitoring projects as part of the structures the field monitoring systems will be adopted by increasingly more new deep sea platforms which will promote the development of ocean engineering to deeper water acknowledgment this work was supported by

23713,this paper presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art developments in the field monitoring of offshore structures the field monitoring of offshore structures plays a vital role in

offshore structures 1 introduction since the first full scale measurement system for offshore platforms was put into practice by the bmt company in 1987 peters et al 1990 field monitoring has been widely developed in the gulf of mexico the north sea the ocean adjacent to brazil and west african waters to record the environmental parameters structural responses riser tension tendon tension shapes of mooring systems etc peng and zhi 2012 prototype measurements of offshore platforms in the south china sea and the bohai sea have been conducted since the 1990s by shanghai jiao tong university hu et al 2011 and dalian university of technology du et al 2014 respectively to date many platforms worldwide have been synchronously equipped with monitoring systems during the construction of the platforms a significant number of field monitoring projects for offshore platforms have been developed by oil and gas companies and institutions all over the world table 1 shows the typical monitoring projects of offshore platforms since 1996 as the exploitation of marine resources moves into deeper water floating platforms for drilling or production may be subjected to an extreme environmental condition and the safety of personals and platforms is a priority position in platform design and operation compared with the assumptions and simplification in numerical analysis and the limitations in physical model tests field monitoring of offshore structures can directly obtain raw data in real time enabling the timely detection of structural failures safety assessments and predictions of performance changes and the remaining structural life du et al 2014 moreover field monitoring can verify the design parameters and provide a database for post project analysis peters et al 1990 due to the complex environment loads and complicated failure mechanisms of the riser and mooring systems field monitoring has become an effective method for obtaining real time tracking and feedback information based on a specialized monitoring system to reduce failure risk during installation operations at sea field monitoring can provide necessary operational support these factors all contribute to the popularity of research on field monitoring this paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent developments in field monitoring for offshore structures noteworthy monitoring scopes and related sensing technologies including sensing the metocean structural motions and structural operational status are discussed in section 2 then the designs of the monitoring systems are described with respect to optimization of sensor placement integrated marine monitoring systems immss and independent remote monitoring systems irmss in section 3 next the applications of offshore structures field monitoring are discussed in section 4 these applications can be divided into four parts construction of the database safety evaluation and early warning safeguarding of offshore construction operations and integrity management field monitoring in other ocean related fields such as the health monitoring of submarine pipelines and ocean ecological environment monitoring are briefly described in section 5 conclusions and further research directions are noted at the end 2 monitoring scopes and sensing technologies an integrated field monitoring system of an offshore structures should provide tracking and feedback information on the metocean structural motions and operational status to obtain a comprehensive understanding of structural dynamic behavior to calculate the accumulated damage and to assess the overall safety status as the fundamental elements of the monitoring system sensors with satisfactory performance are essential to ensure the reliability of monitoring systems thus the precision durability and stability aspects of sensors are discussed in this section 2 1 metocean metocean factors are complicated when combined with wind waves currents and sometimes internal waves and ice structural responses can be significant when a platform is subjected to extreme environmental conditions which will result in serious consequences such as ecocatastrophes or even deaths therefore it is essential to conduct the matocean monitoring 2 1 1 wind wind speed and direction are primary inputs for evaluating floating system responses qu and shi 2013 as crane operations and helicopters are susceptible to wind loads a vane anemometer is widely used to detect the speed and direction of the wind while an acoustic anemometer with high reliability is preferable in hurricane qu et al 2013 different types of anemometers are listed in table 2 2 1 2 waves the significant height and peak period of waves are the primary factors that influence platform responses and can be easily measured by a wave buoy edwards et al 2005 two wave buoys the motion reference unit mru and the differential global positioning system dgps used in the smart 800 buoy are described by krogstad et al 1999 in addition x band radar is also available to measure wave parameters borge and soares 2000 reichert et al 2006 it is possible to install the x band radar even on a movable platform and from there to scan the sea surface with high temporal and spatial resolutions it estimates the directional wave spectra with a range of several kilometers based on the characteristics of the site where it is installed by analyzing the spatial and temporal changes of the radar backscatter from the sea surface it can determine the directional wave and even surface current information in 1994 the x band wamos ⅱ radar was installed on the 2 4 k spar platform in the north sea to measure wave characteristics with high precision irani et al 2007 additionally air gap sensors were used to measure the air gap between the lower deck and the sea level and the wave height information can also derived from the measured data the configuration and number of air gap sensors are recommended by edwards et al 2005 the wave buoy microwave radar air gap sensor and x band radar are shown in fig 1 comparisons between the different wave measurement sensors are listed in table 3 2 1 3 current long slender structures are susceptible to current in deep water and the response of risers and mooring systems to currents can sometimes be destructive deepwater current observation around platforms is essential and feasible through the installation of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps govea et al 2006 there are three types of adcps the 38 khz ocean surveyor os adcp 75 khz long ranger lr adcp and the 300 khz horizontal h adcp as shown in fig 2 the 38 khz os adcp provides the deepest penetration with a range of up to 1100 m and is widely installed in deep water the h adcp is always installed on the platforms to measure the current profile with a small tilt the lr adcp is deployed looking downward from a heave plate with a range of up to 750 m current monitoring with these three types of adcp packages can achieve an overall view of the current within a 4000 foot water depth edwards et al 2005 the deployment of the three types of adcp is illustrated in fig 3 brown et al 2005 provided the details of the development for the measurement of currents through water depths of up to 3 000 m by integrating a number of adcps deployed off a structure in the water column and on the sea bed to obtain a profile of the currents through the whole water column single point current measurement instruments offer another approach for collecting current data at various depths by using a mooring to support the sensors point measurement sensors such as rotary vanes and paddle wheels are installed within the water column or near the bottom although the sensor itself is inexpensive the backup facilities used to deploy and operate the sensor far outweigh the benefit in most occasions a regular point measurement sensor can obtain current information only at its depth while the complete current profile information can be measured by an adcp lan and qu 2011 the contrasts between adcps and point measurement are also introduced by campman et al 2005 2 1 4 internal waves internal waves are defined as gravity waves propagating within a density stratified water column and have been detected for a long time elachi and apel 1976 osborne and burch 1980 zheng et al 1993 the occurrence of the internal waves has been confirmed in many places in asian marginal seas such as in the south china sea andaman sea and sulu sea these waves can propagate several hundred kilometers and transport tremendous energy with turbulence and mixing which have a strong effect on structural responses and may even lead to blooms or death internal waves have been observed by many high resolution satellite images such as synthetic aperture radar sar images and optical images of spot in sar images based on the sensitivity to the ocean internal waves associated with sea surface roughness variations a bright band followed immediately by a dark band demonstrates a depression internal wave packet while a dark band followed by a bright band can be identified as an elevation internal wave packet hsu and liu 1999 in satellite optical images the sea surface manifestations of the internal wave must be identified to lie inside or outside the sunglint area or just in the transition zone the rough front line is identified as a bright line when the imaged area lies outside the sunglint area and as a dark line when it lies inside this area mitnik et al 2000 optical imaging requires cloudfree or partially cloudfree weather conditions and is strongly dependent on the viewing geometry however radar imagery is almost independent of weather conditions these high resolution satellite images are usually expensive and uneconomical however sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs ocean color imagers have been developed based on the changes in surface chlorophyll chl concentrations caused by internal waves silva et al 2002 these images have been applied in the sulu sea and are free but have a lower spatial resolution ho et al 2006 the internal wave images acquired by different kinds of sensors are shown in fig 4 2 1 5 ice ice is one of the key environmental factors in high latitude regions primary parameters of sea ice including ice edge location ice concentration ice thickness ice topography and roughness are supposed to be monitored when a platform operates in ice vinje et al 1998 conducted some ice thickness observations obtained by moored upward looking sonars ulss in fram strait to study the thickness distribution and annual cycle of ice leaving the arctic ocean afterwards the sea ice retrieval system of the hy la satellite was constructed by luo et al 2004 and the data of the hy 1a were applied to the sea ice monitoring and forecasting for the bohai sea of china for the first time moreover sar imagery with different frequency bands is widely used to gather information about the state of the sea ice cover in polar regions scheuchl et al 2004 dierking and busche 2006 ice loads generated by wind waves and current may be significant however there is no well developed method for the numerical simulation or model testing of ice loads instead many institutions use prototype measurement as a primary method in the ice force researches prototype measurements of ice force were conducted in certain cold regions such as bohai sea in china wang 2011 and most of the arctic offshore regions it is still difficult to obtain the complete real time ice force data and there are few relevant details of the measurement technologies in the early stage an esso sensor was used to measure the displacement response of the sensor under ice load then the change in the electrical capacitance of the panel is measured and the ice pressure on the sensor is calculated however the results are non linear and susceptible to electromagnetic interference these factors and other issues prompted the emergence and development of the medof metge and pilkington 1983 pilkington et al 1983 frederking et al 2002 and epr templeton 1980 chen 1981 sensors which are more reliable more sensitive and less expensive in addition to normal loads the sensors can be instrumented with strain gauges to measure the shear loads exerted on them by the ice additionally hexpack sensors use a strain gauge to measure the pressure change inside the rigid material to obtain the pressure on the box in the ice situation graham et al 1983 although the configurations and design philosophies of these sensors are different they are all embedded pressure sensors 2 1 6 tide it is quite common to take advantage of the tidal cycle for offshore operation such as the floatover installation tide level monitoring is currently very important for the operator and is achieved by averaging pressure data acquired from a tide gauge luo et al 2015 monitored the tide level in a floatover installation project with the tide gauge installed inside a pump casing on the jacket and the pump casing can be used for wave filtering the measuring principle of tide level is shown in fig 5 the water level h can be obtained via eq 1 as given below 1 p p 0 ρ g h where p is the pressure measured by the pressure transducer p 0 represents the barometric pressure ρ is the sea water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the tide level is the difference between the water level and amphidromic point 2 1 7 other measurements most field monitoring systems of offshore structures include other important metocean parameters such as atmospheric pressure air temperature humidity and even storm surges with the support of the monitored information mentioned above the normal work and operation of the instruments are ensured in the working platforms at sea 2 2 structural motions offshore structures are subjected to harsh marine environments and have complex motion modes structure position and motions are of great interest to the operators the position of a structure can be accurately measured by a dgps liagre et al 2008 tang et al 2013 gps base stations were installed on the jacket and two gps mobile stations were installed longitudinally on the hull by locating the three dimensional coordinates of the three gpss and the known baseline length the angle between the baseline and geographic north can be calculated zhu 2014 a platform in deep water such as a semi submersible platform can be measured by a real time kinematic rtk system with the base station onshore wang 2015 in addition the inertial navigation systems inss composed of gyroscopes and accelerometers can be used to monitor the inclinations and orientation of structures with high reliability due to being free from outside interferences however the drift error of the gyroscope and the zero deviation of the accelerometer are the most direct and important factors affecting the accuracy of the ins the error of data collected from the ins may accumulate so it usually works in conjunction with dgps to ensure precision qu et al 2013 it is also accepted that an accelerometer and an inclinometer are necessary to guarantee redundancy li et al 2006 the properties and characteristics of different sensors are summarized in table 4 the sway and surge of deep water platforms in the gulf of mexico have been recorded by dgps reichert et al 2006 measurements of floater kinematics based on accelerometers angular rate sensors and dgps was conducted by gkaras et al 2008 full scale measurements for an fpso on the six degrees of freedom were developed by hu et al 2011 in their study the acceleration sensors measured the local acceleration in three directions gps installed on an open deck measured the horizontal position of the fpso moreover the movement of the nanhai tiaozhan fps of the lh11 1 oil field was measured by dgps while its rotation was recorded by the inss installed on the roof where the wind sensor locates qu et al 2013 2 3 structural operational status offshore structures are always working under complex and extremely adverse circumstances affecting the safety of the platform the corrosion and marine growth monitoring of platform hulls the tension and fatigue monitoring of risers and mooring lines as well as the operational status monitoring of other detailed structures are highlighted in field monitoring to reduce the failure risks 2 3 1 platform hull corrosion has been established as the predominant factor causing the widespread premature deterioration of the platform hull especially of the structures located in the spray splash zone the spray splash zone is the region of alternate wetting and drying formed by the action of tides and waves and is the most serious corrosion area corrosion monitoring can be divided into two major categories i e the offline monitoring and the online monitoring chen et al 2010 wu et al 2015 offline monitoring including the ultrasonic method and magnetic leakage method detects the corrosion status of structures or equipment at certain time intervals and can be used to control the risk and prevent the accidents in contrast online monitoring is the continuous or regular automatic monitoring of the corrosion status in addition to the weight loss method electrochemical measurement resistance probe and inductance probe techniques are also the effective methods in online corrosion monitoring chen et al 2010 presented the current corrosion monitoring technology for offshore platforms mainly in the following ways the alternating current field method acfm the field signature method fsm the underwater robot probe the imaging technology and the preset monitoring system shi and tian 2011 developed a set of ultrasonic corrosion monitoring systems to detect the corrosion of a pillar the platform hull submerged in the sea will eventually host a community of marine organisms growing on and associated with its surface the marine growth or biofouling is comprised of a variety of species depending on the location depth and configuration of the structure which will have consequences for structural integrity hydrodynamic efficiency and survivability of devices and may also lead to the growth of non native or invasive species ideally the biofouling sensors would need to incorporate capabilities that can indicate volume extent exact location and type of biofouling in order to determine the best course of mitigation action the simplest method of monitoring marine growth is with the employment of marine scientists specially trained and experienced in characterizing fouling assemblages the visual surveys settlement plates plankton net sampling in situ monitoring rov and close up underwater photography can all be used to parameterize the extent of biofouling on a structure stephen et al 1996 fiber optics can also be applied to monitor the marine growth some technologies take advantage of a continual light source being deflected by fouling organisms to measure deposition wong et al 2003 farhat et al 2015 produced oxygen sensors by mapping the two dimensional distribution of o2 concentrations and o2 decrease rates in the membrane where biofouling occurs which can help to better understand exactly where the hotpots might be and lead to more effective mitigation strategies ore catapult 2016 presented a report about feasibility of sensor development for monitoring marine growth all the sensing technologies and corresponding considerations were introduced and summarized 2 3 2 riser in most tlp and spar platforms the top tensioned risers ttrs supported by buoyancy are developed the ttr monitoring system ttrms presented by edwards et al 2005 consists of three strain gage compression load cells for each riser which are exposed to measurement the loads with a range of 1500 kips the resulting composite accuracy in the tension range of interest was 1 or better the fatigue performance monitoring of a riser requires the monitoring of the dynamic and static strain levels undergone by the riser during the entire life cycle and can be accomplished with a measurement package which is rov retrievable and deployable a sensor system based on fiber optic technology is designed to evaluate a riser s performance and fatigue life by eni e p inaudi et al 2007 the system consists of an underwater sensing network an interconnection system and the appropriate surface equipment thethi et al 2005 presented a riser fatigue monitoring strategy and implemented it on a ttr of the deepwater gom spar a standalone logger monitoring system was adopted to measure the fatigue damage accumulation in the riser and the conductor system below the mud line as shown in fig 6 morrison and dean 2007 invented the apparatuses and methods for monitoring the stress in steel catenary risers scrs using fiber optic sensors which can be pre installed on the new risers or post installed on the existing risers a typical scr instrumentation including the strain gauges the motion sensors and the flex joint angle measurements is illustrated in fig 7 in addition the subsea strain sensor assembly is shown in fig 8 another riser monitoring assembly was developed by allen and pinto 2008 to monitor and manage a riser extending between subsea well equipment and a floating platform flexible risers are the composite structures consisting of several metal amours and polymeric layers and are widely used in offshore platforms due to their excellent performance and simpler mounting and operation than their rigid counterparts the feasibility of using fiber bragg grating fbg sensing technology for strain monitoring in flexible risers was demonstrated by andersen et al 2001 jacques et al 2010 applied non destructive testing ndt techniques to a flexible riser in a full scale dynamic loading test comparisons were conducted with the readings from fiber optic sensors based on the bragg gratings and the acoustic emission studies prescott and brower 2005 williams 2007 feng 2013 brower et al 2013 show that the fiber optic sensors are ideally suited for subsea applications and have been widely used in the field monitoring for offshore structures due to their high multiplexing capability immunization to electromagnetic interference little signal loss small size and corrosion resistance apart from the riser top tension measurement and riser fatigue performance measurement as slender structures risers are susceptible to the current in deep water therefore the measurement of vortex induced vibration viv is essential in the field monitoring of risers howells and lim 1999 described the full scale test and monitoring programmes with respect to the riser vivs based on their work recommendations for monitoring viv response were defined and alternative methods for viv design were proposed the researchers of 2h offshore developed a standalone subsea monitoring instrument integrating temperature pressure acceleration inclination and angular velocity sensors into one package to record the viv response peng and zhi 2012 in another study sensors for strains and accelerations from the norwegian deepwater programme ndp experiments were installed on an instrumented riser to examine the characteristics of the viv response shi et al 2012 many other field monitoring studies were conducted regarding the viv of risers beynet et al 2008 natarajan et al 2006 2 3 3 mooring line with an increase in mooring line failures over the last decade the status monitoring of mooring lines is commonly involved in a field monitoring system it is known that there are two kinds of mooring line tension monitoring technologies the direct tension measurement and the inclinometer based tension calculation chen 2015 for the former one the mooring systems with the fixed chainstoppers are outfitted with load cells underneath their base however the measured loads at the chainstopper are highly inaccurate for the friction in the fairleads the latter one can derive an approximation of the mooring line tension by measuring the angle of the mooring line at or near the top connection to the platform ukani et al 2012 minnebo et al 2014 proposed an alternative and cost effective solution using an accurate position monitoring system based on a dgps system with the appropriate software and data analysis this system can provide information on mooring performance and even mooring line failure tendon tension measurements are of great importance for the weight distribution and real time operation of a tlp to ensure the safety peng and zhi 2012 a study edwards et al 2005 used three underwater compression load cells installed on a tendon to monitor the tension and the sensor configuration was introduced in detail measurement units of tendon tension monitoring systems consist of porch based units and in line units in porch based units each tension tendon has three load cells distributed evenly along the porch ring with two strain gauges in each cell to obtain redundant information the in line units are composed of two sensors welded to the forging the former one can be installed to measure tension during the construction of a tlp while the latter one can be placed in position without regular calibration liu et al 2016 the viv phenomena of tendons under the action of currents and the irregular motions of the platform will cause alternating stresses in tendons under these stresses small defects in the tendon may spread and then result in fatigue damage li and gerretsen 2011 developed a viv inference technology termed as viv detector the underlying idea is to use the tension measurements of a tubular to infer its bending responses due to vortex shedding 2 3 4 other detailed structures operational status monitoring of other detailed structures such as s lay stinger soft yoke mooring system and weldments were conducted in many field monitoring projects submarine pipelines are laid onto the seabed by the s lay method as illustrated in fig 9 a real time onboard monitoring system for the stinger is recommended to guarantee the safety of the pipelaying process the monitoring items includes the relative angle between the vessel and the stinger stress at the joint of the vessel and the stinger shape of the pipe on the stinger and loads on the rollers song et al 2010 divided the s lay stinger monitoring into shape monitoring stress monitoring roller load monitoring water depth monitoring and submarine topography monitoring the applied sensors and corresponding installation positions are described in table 5 soft yoke mooring system are a cost effective and reliable solution for permanently mooring fso fpso in shallow water this single point mooring system includes a soft yoke for mooring a vessel directly to a fixed tower typically soft yoke mooring system are composed of a counter weight mooring legs an a frame structure a yoke nose etc wu et al 2016 installed fbg gauges on two mooring legs for short term restore force measurements of the soft yoke the layout of the fbg gauges on the mooring legs is presented as shown in fig 10 fan et al 2015 designed a comprehensive field monitoring system for the soft yoke mooring system in bohai bay over a long time of monitoring certain common phenomena such as transverse oscillation and stern spin behavior was discovered in three fpsos the deformation problem with respect to the platform hull and detailed structures mentioned above may affect the platform structural integrity and cause loss of production thus it is very important to monitor its occurrences deformation monitoring for offshore structures facilities can be accomplished with several measurement technologies tiltmeters gps and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar are the three most common techniques for monitoring surface deformation davis et al 2008 tiltmeters measure the deformation gradient rather than the deformation itself so the gradient needs to be integrated to calculate the actual deformation the precision achieved with gps is far lower than with tilt but is nonetheless remarkable the insar is an effective way to measure vertical changes in the offshore structures by comparing the distance from a satellite to a ground point on the offshore structures taken at different times matori et al 2014 ferretti et al 2001 developed a new technique of insar called persistent scatterer interferometry psi to improve the ability of insar which can detect deformation using a large number of sar images over the same area the characteristics of different deformation monitoring techniques are listed in table 6 premature failures of weldments have been a common occurrence at high temperature due to creep deformation creep deformation and damage mechanisms driving failure of weldments are not well understood due to the variation in composition microstructure properties as well as the influence of geometry residual stress primary load and environment the deformation in a small region cannot be measured by a conventional displacement gauge in consideration of the difficulties in measuring long term localized creep deformation tu et al 2002 developed a new techniques utilizing the merits of quartz optical fiber and a computer image processing technique with which strain distributions and evolutions in the weldments are obtained in another investigation carried out by sakanashi et al 2016 a digital image correlation dic based system has been developed for long term high temperature creep strain measurement in order to characterize the material deformation behavior of separate regions of a multi pass weld it had been demonstrated that a dic monitoring technique can provide measurements of local variations of elastic plastic and creep strain in inhomogeneous materials at elevated temperature 3 design of a monitoring system field monitoring of an offshore structures is a complex undertaking with multiple facilities working together good stability durability compatibility and credibility performances are essential for an efficient monitoring system in addition making the system compact with less interference on the platform is of great interest to the designer the designs of monitoring systems are composed of the following three parts 3 1 optimization of sensor placement the location and number of the selected sensors need to be determined precisely based on multiple optimal objects which is a complex mathematical problem peng and zhi 2012 fig 11 shows a typical installation layout of a full sensor system the aim of the study is to obtain the most accurate measurement information with the minimum number of sensors and the considerations can be classified into four types where the damage is most likely to occur should be evaluated and the motion data are of greatest concern taking the scr as an example the two regions of the scr experiencing the highest stresses and fatigue damage are the hang off location and the touchdown zone tdz podskarbi et al 2007 thus the monitoring should focus on these locations for the flexible joints monitoring should include internal pressure temperature tension and cyclic rotation thethi and an 2008 the optimal location of sensors for a measurement target should be calculated by using an optimization method the principle behind the sensor placement is to have a sufficient extent of the sensors to capture the entire mode of response natarajan et al 2006 developed a sensor placement approach to obtain the dynamic behavior of risers through a linear regression method based on the modal decomposition additionally the connection between different apparatuses of the monitoring system should be within easy reach to ensure the electricity supply and data transmission finally the installation location of different apparatuses should exhibit the most appropriate conditions for example an anemometer should be installed at a top position to avoid contaminated wind different types of adcps should be installed at different water depths and a closed room is preferred to protect the facilities from sunshine and rain sometimes temperature and humidity factors are also considered to ensure the reliability of the apparatus 3 2 integrated marine monitoring systems immss the imms is developed to solve the problems of the measurement frequency not being synchronized between the sensors and the sensors having different data storage formats to improve the management of a large number of sensors yuan 2013 unlike the in house tests field monitoring cannot control any experimental elements and the frequency of each kind of information occurrence is uncertain to solve the problem of unifying different frequency information two aspects of hardware and software should be considered to ensure synchronized of data collection wu et al 2013 the purpose of this step is to make the management of the monitoring system more intelligent and systematic and the measurement information more synchronized and integrated sufficient reliability is required to ensure the long term operation of the system simple operation less maintenance and high redundancy are also essential to an effective system fig 12 shows a schematic overview of a typical imms the following functionalities should be considered when imms software is designed data acquisition and storage real time data display provision of real time data access from the shore side workstations real time curve of motion display metocean display in real time platform offsets and attitude display history data retrieval automatic generation of daily reports an efficient imms offers simple data acquisition search and storage and allows display screens to provide meaningful information and operator interaction via a user friendly interface as shown in fig 13 furthermore in certain exceptional cases safety evaluation anomaly inspection and early warning are also required to satisfy safety requirements zhang et al 2010 presented a design of common data acquisition systems for marine environment monitoring the systems are capable of marine monitoring data collection real time display analysis and information management the design of an aquatic monitoring integrated system was conducted to provide the development process of the integrated monitoring system the hardware monitoring programmes and the pc software designs wei and zhang 1999 3 3 independent remote monitoring system irms the irms consists of two parts measuring device controls and independent energy controls which is an entirely independent backup system with limited capability designed to transmit critical marine data to onshore workstations during evacuation in hurricane conditions apparatuses of satellite communications and power supplies are developed to enable near real time data transmission back to shore to obtain the comprehensive measurement information it is key to ensure power supply during emergency evacuations when the platform cannot supply power as normal an irms makes it possible to obtain all of the process information under extreme sea conditions as the basis of research on damage mechanisms and design assessment of platform structures it is commonly believed that the design of an irms should follow the below principles von aschwege et al 2007 in the case of an emergency evacuation the battery has enough battery life to support the system the communication system should have a sufficient data transfer rate to ensure real time data transmission the system should have the ability to be remotely controlled and easily operated from shore the system should offer simple data acquisition retrieval access and storage capabilities the system design should be simple with the characteristics of reasonable layout and high reliability stanford university and the massachusetts institute of technology collaborated to develop a new generation of internet based remote monitoring systems the dm2000 system and the pds system in the united states which are the third generation system of condition monitoring and safety assessment are capable of simultaneous online monitoring and fault diagnosis of multiple devices with remote communication capability wei and zhang 1999 ou et al 2001 shanghai jiao tong university developed a shore based control center with real time data processing abilities which is shown in fig 14 additional design and operational considerations of irmss as well as hardware and configuration were illustrated in detail by von aschwege et al 2007 for mexico deepwater floating production systems as shown in fig 15 4 applications of field monitoring for offshore structures field monitoring is the most direct way to obtain the actual response of structures and real time parameters of the marine environment particularly in extreme conditions which is considered invaluable to operators and designers thus a large number of field monitoring projects for offshore structures have been conducted all over the world the applications of these programmes are extensive as detailed in the following 4 1 construction of the database in traditional studies such as numerical simulations and model tests there are inevitably hypotheses simplifications and limitations of experimental conditions raw data from extreme events are very rare field monitoring can be developed to record performance data that will yield valuable comparisons of actual and predicted responses then further understanding of the design assumptions and methodologies can be obtained the results can give an indication of how much conservative the original design is and can also guide certain minor adjustments for future platform design for the reasons mentioned above it is essential to build a database to record the characteristics of the running platform and parameters of sea conditions teigen and haver 1998 presented comparisons between full scale measurements and numerical predictions for the heidrun tlp and a general verification analysis was developed to compare long term measured response characteristics with references established during the design phase the conclusion was that the measured responses agreed very well with the computed values karunakaran et al 1999 compared measurements with the calculated natural frequency the design stiffness and simulated platform responses a full scale data comparison of the measurements and analytical predictions for the horn mountain spar in hurricane isidore and another summer storm was also performed by tahar et al 2005 the conclusion was that the uncoupled analytical models for spar behavior predict the wave frequency responses accurately on the other hand riser coupling has an influence on the slowly varying responses another study assessed the horn mountain spar in hurricane ivan was conducted xu et al 2007 both the environment and spar responses in the hurricane were measured analyzed results were compared to the measurements of the spar responses in the hurricane and the findings confirm both the robustness of the current spar design practice and the accuracy of the analysis tools gupta et al 2008 presented a determination of riser tensioner properties from full scale data recorded on the holstein spar production facility in hurricane season perryman et al 2009 introduced the measurements of sea states and motions of the holstein spar in extreme seas the data from two major hurricanes rita and ike were recorded and the measured responses were compared to hindcast predictions predictions were also made for potential environments using a post rita hindcast a preliminary analysis of the statistics of an approximately one year air gap measurement for a semi submersible in the south china sea was performed by ge et al 2016b the air gap extreme could be predicted by fitting the probability density and cumulative probability distribution curve there are many related studies prislin et al 1999 van and vanden 2007 perego et al 2005 tahar et al 2006 halkyard et al 2004 showing that the recorded data from the field monitoring have a wide range of applications to verify design practices and improve analysis tools 4 2 safety evaluation and early warning aggressive schedules to meet first oil and financial budgets commitments in times of ever increasing construction costs can lead to oversights in the design process and fabrication and installation errors thethi and an 2008 the risks for a deepwater platform in service may include the following aspects as built or installation anomalies long term and extreme environment data at the site coupled motion behavior with risers or the mooring system non conservative hydrodynamic response prediction material degradation with time changes in service or operating conditions the failure of offshore structures will not only lead to direct economic losses and casualties but also cause environmental pollution and political effects with the continuous development of structural parameter identification damage analysis and safety assessment as well as further improvements in sensor technologies monitoring apparatuses and computer technology safety evaluation and early warning are highly valued by the industry peng and zhi 2012 divided structural safety evaluation and early warning into three levels threshold calibration and damage threshold monitoring compares measured data to alert levels to determine whether key performance indicators have reached a critical or near critical level cook et al 2006 once the alert level has been reached the safety warning and operational steps should be triggered calibration monitoring verifies the design assumptions and tools while damage monitoring is performed in real time to avoid structural damage evolution goldsmith et al 2007 established high and medium alert levels or so called key performance indicators kpis based on design analysis and operating data measured data are compared with these alert levels and when an alert level is reached further response evaluation or inspection of the components in question is recommended the motions air gap and hot point strains of hysy981 were measured by shanghai jiao tong university to evaluate the operational performance if the monitoring data reach the set threshold the system will automatically make an alarm 4 3 safeguarding of offshore construction operations offshore operations of oil and gas exploration are of high cost and high risk field monitoring as a safeguard of offshore construction operations can effectively reduce the risk and ensure the safety of the personnel and equipment the primary function of the monitoring system is to provide real time information in an easily understandable format as the operational decision support for operators normally site environment information consisting of wind wave tide and sometimes current is collected the measurements of the position and attitude of the platform are essential during operations moreover the key point strain and the relative distance between structures are measured in specific operational situations field monitoring for offshore construction operations is different from normal full scale measurements outstanding precision and excellent reliability are required data must be displayed and analyzed in real time and any emergency must be quickly identified and evaluated furthermore given the high cost and high added value of offshore operations decisions must be balanced against cost and safety two jacket launching monitoring projects fig 16 and seven floatover installation monitoring projects fig 17 were conducted by shanghai jiao tong university chen 2014 he et al 2014 hu et al 2016 during the jacket launching operations the metocean and loads on the side rocker were measured the information on the attitude and motions of the jacket was also provided in real time including the following parameters jacket launching depth jacket launching angle jacket maximum pitch angle jacket maximum horizontal stroke barge maximum horizontal stroke the measured data mentioned above provide essential indicators for the operator which plays an important role in ensuring operation safety during the processes of floatover installation the metocean including information on the wind current waves and tide was measured at the site in addition the track and motions of the barge were also monitored and displayed in real time at the control center additionally the force of collision with respect to the fender and jacket cushions was also provided to support the floatover installation such as the collision force monitoring system developed by ge et al 2016a to monitor the stress response of the jacket legs in the lufeng7 2 topside floatover installation in this system mounted fiber grating strain sensors were installed on the jacket legs 4 4 integrity management the offshore oil and gas industry has come to realize that there are too many instances of premature failure leading to serious consequences in response to this situation there has been rapid growth in integrity management related research and development allen 2015 studied the integrity management of structures floating systems and subsea assets the three major components of floating system integrity management include marine monitoring platform inspections and marine assurance engineering geyer et al 2009 a generic integrity management system taken from dnv rp f116 veritas 2009 includes risk assessment and planning inspection testing and monitoring integrity assessments and mitigation intervention and repair the fundamental purpose of integrity management is to identify and manage risks that could impact the health and safety of personnel or cause structural fatigue fig 18 provides a detail of the life cycle integrated management process field monitoring of marine data is a critical component of the integrated management programme for floating systems and the value of marine monitoring was presented by du et al 2014 and irani et al 2007 particularly in terms of how it contributes to the following operating facilities in a safe manner assessing and verifying in place performance minimizing down time and lost production conducting forensic investigation maximizing future tieback capacity goldsmith et al 2007 described the role of offshore monitoring in an integrity management programme and demonstrated that the development of alert levels based on potential failure modes of the riser system is key gordon et al 2014 presented mooring integrity management and noted that monitoring is an important part of mooring integrity and should be enforced as a viable means to address the condition of the mooring system along with inspection programmes 5 cases of monitoring in other ocean related fields from the above discussion a comprehensive review of recent development in the field monitoring of offshore structures is provided however field monitoring in the ocean is performed not only for offshore platforms but also in other fields such as health monitoring of a submarine pipeline and ocean ecological environment monitoring to a certain extent their measurement methods and principles are consistent therefore it is essential to obtain a general understanding of other field monitoring activities 5 1 health monitoring of submarine pipelines submarine pipeline systems play an important role in transporting oil from offshore to land however offshore pipeline systems collapse occasionally which inevitably leads to oil leakage environmental pollution and enormous economic loss from the investigation performed by the china national offshore oil crop cnooc the primary causes of pipeline failure are corrosion impulses and free spanning vibration jin et al 2003 corrosion failure can be prevented by the annual corrosion inspections it is worth noting that the free spanning vibration plays a dominant role in the accidents of a pipeline system when the frequency of the environment is close to the natural frequency of a pipeline a resonance phenomenon occurs consequently high stress damage or fatigue damage can occur which poses a serious threat to the safety of the pipeline to ensure the safety of a submarine pipeline system a health monitoring system is applied to measure the strain and temperature along the pipeline the free spanning vibration frequency is also recorded to predict the failure in early applications the smart pig method ultrasonic detection technique magnetic flux leakage method ultrasound wave method eddy current and pressure difference method were used in submarine pipeline monitoring systems kishawy and gabbar 2010 however with the development of fiber optic sensors numerous new studies on monitoring technologies for submarine pipeline systems have been conducted jin et al 2003 developed a health monitoring system with distributed fiber optic sensors dofss applying wavelength division multiplex wdm technology and dofss in series for long distance measurement which has the function of diagnosis and auto alarm if free spanning vibration occurs or the strain reaches the set alarm level caution will be taken the system is composed of three parts as shown in fig 19 additionally scour is initiated by flow action that removes the cover and exposes pipelines to the waves and currents therefore scour monitoring for submarine pipelines was developed zhao et al 2012 designed a novel scour monitoring system of a three index estimator tie based on active thermometry to identify the surrounding media using tie analysis a thermal cable deployed parallel to the pipeline was used to generate heat and synchronously measure temperature with ds18b20s as shown in fig 20 the temperature time histories were acquired and the identification of free spans was achieved moreover an integrated autoregressive moving average arma model algorithm was developed for the structural health monitoring of offshore pipelines by bao et al 2013 this algorithm can provide accurate identification of damage locations and offshore pipeline damage 5 2 ocean ecological environment monitoring currently the anthropogenic impact on the ocean during the development of marine resources contributes significantly to the pollution of individual ocean zones which reduces the natural capacity of ocean ecosystems for reproduction and self regulation the ecological monitoring of marine ecosystems comprising geophysical and biotic monitoring is a comprehensible universal method for widely covering the elements of the biosphere israel and tsiban 1981 ocean ecological environment monitoring technology constitutes the technical support of marine resource development which is of great significance to marine economic development and resource exploration the primary parameters currently monitored include the following liu and wang 2001 hydrometeorological parameters of the ocean the velocity and direction of the wind current water temperature air pressure waves etc water quality parameters in the biological state solvent oxygen ph value salinity chlorophyll content organic matter phenol content etc physical and chemical parameters various nutrients nitrates nitrites phosphates etc various heavy metals etc nuclear radiation marine environmental monitoring technology has always involved on site sampling and chemical analysis in the laboratory to monitor a variety of harmful substances however taking the complexity of the marine environment into consideration field monitoring is required for automatic long term and continuous measurement of certain critical parameters such as temperature ph do salinity and turbidity to study the intrinsic relationships among them the united states japan france norway russia and other countries have developed field monitoring sensors for ocean ecological environments table 7 summarizes the marine environmental monitoring technologies liu and wang 2001 6 conclusion and suggestions with the development of marine resource exploitation moving into deep water field monitoring has drawn the increasing attention worldwide increasingly more offshore structures will be fabricated and installed with monitoring systems which will further encourage the development of sensor technologies and monitoring systems based on the previous and continuing accumulation of knowledge suggestions for further studies on field monitoring are as follows a smaller and lighter monitoring instruments with less power requirement and higher accuracy are needed to ensure their practicability durability and credibility particularly for the long term offshore monitoring additionally the synchronization of the clock in the sensor package and data fusion technology of multi reference units are also worth examining moreover it has been shown that fiber optic sensors are ideally suited for multi parameter measurements with high capability so strengthening the development and application of fiber optic sensors should be a focus of future research b the optimization of sensor placement should be improved to reduce the difficulties in layout and installation correspondingly the rov technology of subsea installation on the lower segment of structures in deepwater should be developed distributed sensing technology and improved deployment and packaging should be performed in advance additionally multi measurement modules should be highly coordinated with each other and data integration between different measurement units and intelligent user interface displays are highlighted in the design of immss for unknown reasons there is always wireless signal loss during the process of remote data transmission complete storage and streaming of data from platforms to onshore workstations should be developed to ensure real time display and post processing which is crucial for irmss c taking into account the similarity of the measurement principles a mature field monitoring system of offshore structures can be applied to and greatly impact other areas of marine monitoring and play a great role given the significant costs in many applications it has been difficult to quantify the benefits such as for the strain measurement systems for long term application in deepwater and construction of the database designers should balance the accuracy and cost to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy d with the continuous development of field monitoring for offshore structures and related technology maturing a set of systematic and comprehensive instructions for technology and design should be developed to standardize these complex undertakings to provide support for future field monitoring projects as part of the structures the

23714,in order to solve the practical application problems of high output energy and difficult cancellation of nonlinear function in the backstepping algorithm for ship course keeping control a closed loop gain shaping algorithm is employed to design the linear part of nonlinear backstepping controller firstly then the backstepping algorithm is linear reduced by ignoring the nonlinear part of the controller secondly a novel nonlinear decoration algorithm with sine function deduced from nonlinear feedback algorithm is proposed where the sine function was embedded into the back of original linear controller then taking training ship yukun of dalian maritime university as a test object the simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the results show the advantages of robustness energy saving and safety in course keeping practice compared with nonlinear feedback and the standard feedback the energy cost performance specifications mia of the proposed nonlinear decoration algorithm are reduced by 31 5 and 15 7 respectively meanwhile the response performance specification mae and the smoothness performance specification mtv also show the satisfactory control effects keywords ship motion control course keeping backstepping nonlinear decoration closed loop gain shaping 1 introduction due to unique advantage in dealing with nonlinear control problems the backstepping algorithm has received enormous amount of attention from many researchers and become the research hotspot in the field of the ship motion control in the last 10 years zhang 2012 zhang et al 2015a research in this field has been carried out to increase its adaptability or robustness by hybrid control methods in dovgobrod 2012 the backstepping algorithm and nonlinear adaptive control strategy were applied to design a nonlinear path following controller based on nonlinear ship motion model in harl and balakrishnan 2012 and liu et al 2013 the backstepping algorithm combined with the sliding mode algorithm was successfully applied to solve the ship motion control problem in ren and liu 2013 the ship motion control solution was presented by combining the backstepping algorithm and adaptive neural network a ship course keeping control system based on adaptive backstepping algorithm was also reported in witkowska and smierzchalski 2012 in chen and tan 2013 the combined algorithm of adaptive backstepping algorithm and fuzzy logic algorithm was proposed to solve the course keeping control problem of the surface vessels in du et al 2014 combining the dynamic surface control and nussbaum gain function with backstepping algorithm an adaptive nonlinear control strategy was proposed for the nonlinear ship course keeping control system with parameter uncertainties and completely unknown control coefficient then the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was demonstrated by ship simulation tests an adaptive backstepping controller was proposed in park and kim 2014 for auto berthing of a cruise ship under wind loads in yuan et al 2016 the neural networks were adopted to determine the parameters of the unknown part of ideal virtual backstepping control to solve the problem of course control for underactuated surface ship then the stability for the convergence of course tracking errors had been proven based on lyapunov stability theory in chu et al 2016 under the backstepping design framework an adaptive neural network control law was constructed based on the output of local recurrent neural network and state estimation for a class of remotely operated vehicles in while in klinger wihelm et al 2017 the modified backstepping controller was to account for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation of an unmanned surface vehicle with uncertain displacement and drag the core of the work in zhang et al 2015a was that the problems of high output energy and the difficulty in nonlinear function cancellation were basically solved through utilizing the ship course keeping controller based on the combination of nonlinear feedback algorithm and backstepping algorithm it is noted that nonlinear feedback control scheme can not significantly change the output performance of control by itself but it can achieve equivalent control effect with lower control energy the target of linear feedback control is to design a control law u f e e where f e is a nonlinear function about the feedback error e the target of nonlinear feedback control is to design a control law u f e g e where g e is a nonlinear function of e note that in zhang 2011 a nonlinear feedback was simply proved through the taylor series expansion to the first order form which indicated the effective energy saving performance in its application to ship course keeping autopilot in zhang and zhang 2016 a nonlinear feedback function was proved by descriptive function theory and also indicated the satisfactory energy saving effect on the application of ship course keeping control theoretically u f e g e is definitely equivalent to u i e e sometimes the deduction of i e is very complex and difficult to obtain however the basic design idea of nonlinear feedback control is that under the premise of f e having been obtained the nonlinear feedback driving function g e is selected to substitute the original linear feedback variable e for the purpose of energy saving inspired by the formula u f e e and u f e g e this note tries to exploit a formula h u f e e with the same effect of u f e g e taking a metaphor u f e g e means taking photos after makeup using the same camera of u f e e while h u f e e equals to handling photos with the help of decosama after taking photographs their final effects should be similar therefore the control performance of h u f e e called nonlinear decoration is studied in this note on the basis of nonlinear algorithm zhang et al 2015a 2016 this research is to design the linear part of nonlinear backstepping controller by using a closed loop gain shaping algorithm and a sine function as a nonlinear decoration function finally the nonlinear ship model and the complex mathematical model are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm 2 nonlinear ship model in this section the training ship yukun of dalian maritime university dmu is taken as an example because of its substantial sea trials which are convenient to verify the precision of the nonlinear ship model adopted the ship s main particulars are shown in table 1 zhang et al 2016 this note adopts a response model considering rudder servo system to represent the nonlinear ship model which is composed by a first order nomoto model with a nonlinear feedback compensating item zhang and jin 2013 the rudder servo system is composed of the maximum rudder angle saturation limit the maximum rudder speed limit and the integral element which is also shown in table 1 as is shown in fig 1 the nonlinear nomoto model is employed in this simulation to compare with the full scale turning test zhang and jin 2013 the sea condition of starboard turning test is shown as follows average wind direction was 039 the wind speed was 7 8 m s the current speed was 0 8 m s the current direction was 153 shan and li 2014 while the sea condition of port turning full scale test is shown as follows average wind direction was 003 the relative wind speed was 10 1 m s it should be noted that the navigation speed reduced from 15kn to 7 2kn when the ship turned to port 270 the ship experiment shows that the turning ability index k is proportional to the navigation speed while following index t and nonlinear parameters α β are inversely proportional to navigation speed the accuracy of the ship model can be presented by the conformity function c m that is defined in eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 c m min s d r d max s d r d 100 where s d is the advance diameter s d ad or transverse diameter s d td of the simulation r d is the advance diameter r d ad or transverse diameter r d td of the real ship turning test c m is conformity function the comparison of ship turning test with the rudder angle δ 30 are showed in fig 1 and table 2 the parameters compensation technology of speed reduction is employed for turning simulation zhang 2012 for starboard turning the simulation advance diameter s d ad is 4 1l while the real ship turning test r d ad is 4 6l so c m ad 89 13 the simulation transverse diameter s d td is 4 26l while the real ship r d td is 4 5l so c m td 96 67 meanwhile for port turning the simulation advance diameter s d ad is 3 65l while the real ship turning test r d ad is 4 43l so c m ad 82 39 the simulation transverse diameter s d td is 4 2l while the real ship r d td is 3 39l so c m td 80 71 the average conformity c m in port and starboard turning test is 86 73 hence the conformity of simulation are satisfactory with large inertia and nonlinearity even though there are some discrepancy due to the simplified nomoto ship model itself which is satisfactory and easy to use for course keeping control 3 backstepping algorithm 3 1 the principle of backstepping algorithm aiming at uncertain system backstepping algorithm is a systematic approach for controller synthesis the basic design idea of this algorithm is to decompose the complex nonlinear system into several subsystems whose number does not exceed the system order and then lyapunov function is respectively designed for each subsystem the virtual control law of each subsystem can be obtained under the premise of each subsystem with certain convergence in the design of the next subsystem the virtual control law of the former subsystem is treated as the tracking target for the next subsystem the rest can be done in the same manner finally the actual control law of the whole closed loop system is obtained and the convergence of the closed loop system is guaranteed by the lyapunov stability analysis method at the same time case1 the nonlinear ship model is ψ k t α ψ β ψ 3 k t δ wherein ψ is the output of heading angle δ is the input of rudder angle k and t are the ship maneuverability indexes α and β are nonlinear parameters the control law u is designed for ship model through backstepping algorithm which makes the ship to track set course ψ r to facilitate the processing of algorithm we define x 1 ψ x 2 r ψ system output y ψ r control input u δ f x 2 k t h x 2 h x 2 α x 2 β x 2 3 b k t the nonlinear ship model can be rewritten into the form of eq 2 the control design consists of two steps as follows 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u y x 1 step 1 at this step we define the errors as e 1 x 1 ψ r e 2 x 2 ϕ e 1 where ϕ e 1 is a virtual control law differentiating e 1 as 3 e 1 x 1 ψ r x 2 ψ r e 2 ϕ e 1 ψ r to design the virtual control law ϕ e 1 ψ r k 1 e 1 k 1 r eq 3 can be simplified to e 1 k 1 e 1 e 2 where k 1 is the designed parameters of controller then we consider the first lyapunov function candidate as 4 v 1 1 2 e 1 2 5 v 1 k 1 e 1 2 e 1 e 2 step 2 the derivative of e 2 is 6 e 2 x 2 ϕ e 1 f x 2 b u ϕ e 1 constructing the second lyapunov function candidate based on eq 6 7 v 2 v 1 1 2 e 2 2 8 v 2 k 1 e 1 2 e 2 e 1 f x 2 b u ϕ e 1 v 2 0 can be guaranteed by the control law eq 9 9 u 1 b ϕ e 1 e 1 f x 2 k 2 e 2 k 2 r where k 2 is the designed parameters of controller substituting eq 9 into eq 8 10 v 2 k 1 e 1 2 k 2 e 2 2 0 e 1 0 e 2 0 according to lyapunov theorem the designed control law can make the system asymptotically stable at equilibrium point x 1 ψ r x 2 ψ r based on eq 2 10 the control output u can be designed as 11 u t k k t h x 2 1 k 1 k 2 x 1 ψ r k 1 k 2 x 2 ψ r ψ r 3 2 nonlinear feedback improved backstepping algorithm assuming 12 e 1 x 1 ψ r e 2 x 2 if the controller can stabilize the state variables e 1 and e 2 the original system reaches the uniform asymptotic stability at the equilibrium point shown in eq 13 13 x 1 ψ r x 2 0 a lyapunov function can be structured according to zhang 2010 which is performed as 14 v 1 1 2 e 2 2 the differential relationship between e 1 and e 2 has been considered which possesses a certain universality if e 2 is stabilized on the equilibrium point of zero e 1 is stabilized simultaneously v 1 contains the information of e 1 implicitly so as to ensure the proper control scheme and stabilize the e 1 e 2 simultaneously though v 1 does not contain e 1 directly 15 v 1 e 2 e 2 16 v 1 0 to make v 1 0 the designed control scheme u is constructed as follows 17 u 1 b f x 2 k 1 sin ω e 1 where ω k 1 are the designed parameters of controller which satisfy k 1 0 ω 0 1 the taylor series expansion is retained to the term of third order arunnehru and paramasivam 2014 are utilized eq 18 is derived 18 sin ω e 1 ω e 1 ω e 1 3 3 substituting eq 18 into eq 17 we obtain eq 19 by combining eqs 2 12 and 17 19 v 1 e 2 f x 2 b u e 2 f x 2 b 1 b f x 2 k 1 ω e 1 k 1 ω 3 e 1 3 6 2 x 2 f x 2 k 1 ω e 1 e 2 k 1 ω 3 e 1 3 e 2 6 2 b α x 2 2 β x 2 4 k 1 ω x 1 ψ r h h x 2 k 1 ω 3 6 x 1 ψ r h 3 h 3 x 2 2 b α x 2 2 β x 2 2 k 1 ω h x 2 2 k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 2 b α k 1 ω h x 2 2 2 b β k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 where b α β h are positive h is the sample time note that the first item of v 1 20 2 b α k 1 ω h x 2 2 0 in marine practice ω 0 1 h 1 s if taking k 1 0 6 then eq 20 can be derived 21 k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 0 1 in a general way b 5 10 5 β 10 3 in marine practice van 1982 zhang and jin 2013 therefore 2 b β 0 1 in this article b k t 0 2 102 63 1 95 10 3 β 8467 29 therefore 2 b β 33 the latter item of v 1 follows that 22 2 b β k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 0 combining eqs 20 22 we obtain 23 v 1 0 in summary the system will reach uniform asymptotic stability at the equilibrium point of x 1 ψ r x 2 0 the control scheme of eq 17 meets the requirements and reserves the nonlinear item of the system without normal cancellation the procedure of nonlinear controller design has been reduced from two steps to one step by choosing the simple lyapunov candidate function rather than the conventional backstepping construction approach in addition eq 24 is formulated in zhang 2010 24 u 1 b f x 2 k 1 e 1 comparing eq 24 with eq 17 the sine function of e 1 with the same controller is constructed which makes up a new mode of nonlinear feedback 3 3 nonlinear robust control for ship course keeping according to the theorems given in zhang et al 2015a if the two parameters of control law eq 11 are taken as k p 1 k 1 k 2 1 3 k ρ k d k 1 k 2 t 3 k wherein ρ is a parameter to adjust the response speed of the control system 0 ρ 10 then the designed nonlinear controller for ship course keeping has strong robustness its essence is that the linear part of backstepping nonlinear controller is replaced by its equivalent robust controller designed on the basis of closed loop gain shaping algorithm zhang et al 2015a therefore eq 11 can be considered as a nonlinear pd controller which the physical meaning is more explicit and the parameters adjusting is more simple for the reason that the proportional and differential coefficient can be determined by the ship maneuverability index k t and system adjusting parameter ρ 4 linear reduction of backstepping algorithm and nonlinear decoration 4 1 problems in the practical application from the zhang et al 2015a the nonlinear part of the nonlinear controller in eq 10 is canceled against the nonlinear part of ship model but there existed two problems in the practical application 1 it is difficult to implement the cancellation of nonlinear function of the actual controller and ship model due to the time varying nonlinear model parameters which caused by mathematical model perturbation under the circumstance of sea condition interference ship draft and navigation speed changes for problem 1 this note still adopts the scheme that the cancellation part of the nonlinear function is ignored and the nonlinear backstepping algorithm is reduced to a linear controller then a set of controller parameters is selected to guarantee robust performance of the system and the control effect of the controller then the control law can be shown as eq 25 25 u t k 1 k 1 k 2 e k 1 k 2 e t k k p e k d e where e ψ r ψ 2 the high output energy of controller in the practice of navigation ships are often affected by high frequency disturbances such as strong and uncertain winds and waves thus the high frequency interferences easily lead to the high output energy of controller especially when the high frequency interferences are not taken into account for control law design for problem 2 a kind of nonlinear processing technique with sine function decoration is adopted which is different from the nonlinear feedback in zhang et al 2015a the sine function decoration is sin ω u f e e aiming to obtain the same control effect with low control energy the nonlinear decoration technique itself does not change the output performance of the control but it can guarantee to reduce the control energy with the same control law in other words it can achieve the same control effect with minor control action under the unchanged control law the effects demonstration process of nonlinear decoration driven by sine function to the closed system can be analyzed by taylor series expansion to first order form which is similar to the proof given in zhang 2012 although the control law is reduced to a linear control law the final control law is still in the category of nonlinear control due to the introduction of nonlinear decoration technique as is shown in fig 2 a novel nonlinear decoration algorithm with sine function deduced from nonlinear feedback algorithm is proposed by changing the sequence of sine function and the linear reduction of backstepping controller k c and then the sine function is embedded into the back of original linear controller the sin ω e is utilized to nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration backstepping algorithm wherein ω is the system frequency and the numerical value of ω should be less than 1 in order to avoid the influence of high frequency wave action interference whose frequency spectrum lies in the range of 0 3 1 25 rad s 4 2 effect on nonlinear control system decorated by sine function in the stability analysis the first order closed loop system is usually stable if the time constant is positive while in marine practice the time constant is absolute positive value then the effects on nonlinear control system decorated by sine function are analyzed by the final value theorem and closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory therefore the stability proofs are as follows 1 effect on the steady state of the closed loop system let the reference input signal be a step signal whose amplitude is ψ r the effects of nonlinear decoration to static performance are analyzed on the condition of that the change of the original control output u is so small that sin ω u ω u establishes the maximum rudder angle is 35 which is equal to 0 61 rad and is a pretty small value in order to simplify the analysis the linear ship motion model is constructed as g k s t s 1 the output heading angle ψ of steady state system is obtained directly by the final value theorem given below ψ lim s 0 s g k c ω 1 g k c ω ψ r s lim s 0 k s t s 1 t k k p k d s ω 1 k s t s 1 t k k p k d s ω ψ r 26 k t k p ω k t k p ω ψ r ψ r therefore nonlinear control decorated by sine function has no extra effect on the steady state of the system because the output error of the steady state is 0 2 effect on the dynamic performance of the closed loop system the transfer function from the input ψ r to the output ψ of the system is 27 ψ ψ r g k c ω 1 g k c ω for ship course keeping problem sea wave action can be categorized to high frequency disturbance generally ω 1 is taken in eq 27 to shy away the wave high frequency spectrum according to closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory the open loop transfer matrix g k c satisfies robust performance high gain in low frequency zone and low gain in high frequency zone zhang 2012 therefore eq 27 is compared to the closed loop transfer function g k c 1 g k c of a standard feedback system and the introduction of ω has no much extra effect to the dynamic performance of the system because of the high gain in low frequency zone 3 effect on the control output of the closed loop system the transfer function from the input ψ r to the output δ of the system is 28 δ ψ r k c ω 1 g k c ω similar analysis as eq 27 the value of k c ω is reduced more significantly than g k c ω in eq 28 therefore the introduction of ω can reduce the control output 4 sin ω u ω u will not be established if e is too large it is difficult to prove the effect of nonlinear control driven by sine function this case is not discussed in this note 5 simulation studies and analysis in this section the simulink toolbox is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed controller in matlab environment the control effects of course keeping for ships and energy saving situation are analyzed in the case of nonlinear feedback and standard feedback based on backstepping algorithm nonlinear decoration and nonlinear feedback based on linear reduced backstepping algorithm and nonlinear decoration and standard feedback based on complex mathematical model 5 1 course keeping control based on nonlinear feedback algorithm taking k 1 0 0015 ω 0 6 in the control scheme eq 17 and ψ r 050 then we can obtain results for comparison under two different control schemes which are shown in fig 3 and table 3 fig 3 b indicates that the heading overshoot is eliminated as well as the settling time t s drops to 133s from 140s under the nonlinear feedback backstepping control fig 3 a and table 3 show that the maximum rudder angle δ max drops to 20 2 from 34 5 while the mean rudder angle δ falls to 0 67 from 0 98 36 1 down to provide further quantification three prevalent performance specifications eq 29 are employed to evaluate the closed loop performances zhang et al 2015a zhang and zhang 2016 that is mean absolute error mae mean integral absolute mia and mean total variation mtv of the control 29 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ r y t d t m i a 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t d t m t v 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t u t 1 d t mae is used to measure the response performance of the system output and mia and mtv of the control input rudder angle δ measure the energy cost and the smoothness of the corresponding algorithm table 3 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results it is noted that the response performance specification mae is obviously increased by 34 7 however the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 30 2 while the smoothness performance specification mtv is obviously reduced by 47 therefore compared to the standard backstepping the nonlinear feedback improved backstepping algorithm has the obvious effects of quick response energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation 5 2 course keeping control based on nonlinear decoration algorithm in this section the wind and wave disturbances are taken into account in the simulation environment consequently the rudder model and sea interference perturbation considered in this simulation is to verify the robustness performance of the controller considering that the output performance of the designed controller should be verified in a higher sea state in this note the wind disturbance is considered as the white noise kallstrom 1982 for wave disturbance a simplified transfer function model shown in eq 30 is capable of simulating it under the beaufort scale 6 which is a second order oscillating system driven by a gaussian white noise zhang and jin 2013 30 ψ h 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 w h where w h s ψ h are the gaussian white noise laplace operator and high frequency wave disturbance as is shown in fig 4 ψ h directly acts on the ship heading angle ψ the simulation diagram is shown in fig 4 the linear reduction of backstepping controller is the same with zhang et al 2015a the simulation controller is designed on the linear reduction of backstepping algorithm based on sine function decoration ρ 4 ω 0 25 rad s comparative simulation results with the experiment results in zhang et al 2015a are shown in fig 5 fig 5 demonstrates the simulation results of the course keeping utilizing the nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration the set course is

table 4 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is noted that the response performance specification mae is increased by 3 3 however the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 31 5 while the smoothness performance specification mtv is obviously reduced by 29 therefore compared to the nonlinear feedback the nonlinear decoration algorithm has the obvious effects of energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation in addition the rudder servo system characteristics are not taken into consideration when the controller is designed but taken when simulation which equals to take a model perturbation into account for the control system the sea state 6 has also been taken into consideration wave disturbance and fluctuating wind disturbance therefore the simulation results not only satisfy navigation practice but also verify the effectiveness of the nonlinear decoration algorithm 5 3 the effectiveness of the nonlinear decoration algorithm on complex mathematical model as mentioned above the nonlinear decoration algorithm is tested on a nomoto

the above mentioned nonlinear decoration control algorithm is exerted on the controlling of the maneuvering modeling group mmg ship mathematic model eq 31 of ship dynamics which can denote a situation similar to the motion of a full scale ship fossen 2011 to some extent if the improved control algorithm still works its robustness is further proved 31 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r x w m m y v m m x

085 the initial heading 000 ρ 5 ω 0 5 ψ r 050 we can get the comparison results under two different control schemes which are shown in fig 6 based on the mathematical model of ship dynamics both control schemes achieve a good course keeping performance compared with the standard feedback algorithm in fig 6 the nonlinear decoration algorithm can quickly track the set course without overshoot and static error the average rudder angle and maximum angle are reduced by 17 9 and 54 4 respectively table 5 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is noted that the mae is increased by 27 the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 15 7 and mtv is obviously reduced by 28 3 therefore compared to the standard feedback the nonlinear decoration algorithm on complex mathematical model has the obvious effects of energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation moreover this simulation also demonstrates the robustness of the proposed algorithm which is employed on nonlinear nomoto model and mmg ship mathematic model 6 conclusions a novel nonlinear backstepping algorithm the combination of sine function decoration and linear reduction is proposed in this note which successfully solves problems of the nonlinear function cancellation and high

course keeping compared with the standard feedback algorithm the nonlinear feedback algorithm has the response performance specification increased by 34 7 but the energy cost performance specification reduced by 30 2 and the smoothness performance specification reduced by 47 meanwhile compared with the nonlinear feedback algorithm the nonlinear decoration algorithm has the response performance

15 7 and the smoothness performance specification reduced by 28 3 the proposed algorithm has the advantages of robustness energy saving and safety in course keeping practice which contributes to the safe navigation meanwhile the results of simulation also show that if the sine function of nonlinear feedback is directly employed for nonlinear decoration controller the effect of course keeping is not satisfactory but the control effect can recover to the same level as the nonlinear feedback when ω is decreased which indicates that the energy saving is achieved by sacrificing a certain amount of system bandwidth in addition since the control effect of the two controller are not that good when set course exceeds 050 it is necessary to further reduce ω to improve the performance for energy

show the satisfactory control effects keywords ship motion control course keeping backstepping nonlinear decoration closed loop gain shaping 1 introduction due to unique advantage in dealing with nonlinear control problems the backstepping algorithm has received enormous amount of attention from many researchers and become the research hotspot in the field of the ship motion control in the last 10 years zhang 2012 zhang et al 2015a research in this field has been carried out to increase its adaptability or robustness by hybrid control methods in dovgobrod 2012 the backstepping algorithm and nonlinear adaptive control strategy were applied to design a nonlinear path following controller based on nonlinear ship motion model in harl and balakrishnan 2012 and liu et al 2013 the backstepping algorithm combined with the sliding mode algorithm was successfully applied to solve the ship motion control problem in ren and liu 2013 the ship motion control solution was presented by combining the backstepping algorithm and adaptive neural network a ship course keeping control system based on adaptive backstepping algorithm was also reported in witkowska and smierzchalski 2012 in chen and tan 2013 the combined algorithm of adaptive backstepping algorithm and fuzzy logic algorithm was proposed to solve the course keeping control problem of the surface vessels in du et al 2014 combining the dynamic surface control and nussbaum gain function with backstepping algorithm an adaptive nonlinear control strategy was proposed for the nonlinear ship course keeping control system with parameter uncertainties and completely unknown control coefficient then the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was demonstrated by ship simulation tests an adaptive backstepping controller was proposed in park and kim 2014 for auto berthing of a cruise ship under wind loads in yuan et al 2016 the neural networks were adopted to determine the parameters of the unknown part of ideal virtual backstepping control to solve the problem of course control for underactuated surface ship then the stability for the convergence of course tracking errors had been proven based on lyapunov stability theory in chu et al 2016 under the backstepping design framework an adaptive neural network control law was constructed based on the output of local recurrent neural network and state estimation for a class of remotely operated vehicles in while in klinger wihelm et al 2017 the modified backstepping controller was to account for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation of an unmanned surface vehicle with uncertain displacement and drag the core of the work in zhang et al 2015a was that the problems of high output energy and the difficulty in nonlinear function cancellation were basically solved through utilizing the ship course keeping controller based on the combination of nonlinear feedback algorithm and backstepping algorithm it is noted that nonlinear feedback control scheme can not significantly change the output performance of control by itself but it can achieve equivalent control effect with lower control energy the target of linear feedback control is to design a control law u f e e where f e is a nonlinear function about the feedback error e the target of nonlinear feedback control is to design a control law u f e g e where g e is a nonlinear function of e note that in zhang 2011 a nonlinear feedback was simply proved through the taylor series expansion to the first order form which indicated the effective energy saving performance in its application to ship course keeping autopilot in zhang and zhang 2016 a nonlinear feedback function was proved by descriptive function theory and also indicated the satisfactory energy saving effect on the application of ship course keeping control theoretically u f e g e is definitely equivalent to u i e e sometimes the deduction of i e is very complex and difficult to obtain however the basic design idea of nonlinear feedback control is that under the premise of f e having been obtained the nonlinear feedback driving function g e is selected to substitute the original linear feedback variable e for the purpose of energy saving inspired by the formula u f e e and u f e g e this note tries to exploit a formula h u f e e with the same effect of u f e g e taking a metaphor u f e g e means taking photos after makeup using the same camera of u f e e while h u f e e equals to handling photos with the help of decosama after taking photographs their final effects should be similar therefore the control performance of h u f e e called nonlinear decoration is studied in this note on the basis of nonlinear algorithm zhang et al 2015a 2016 this research is to design the linear part of nonlinear backstepping controller by using a closed loop gain shaping algorithm and a sine function as a nonlinear decoration function finally the nonlinear ship model and the complex mathematical model are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm 2 nonlinear ship model in this section the training ship yukun of dalian maritime university dmu is taken as an example because of its substantial sea trials which are convenient to verify the precision of the nonlinear ship model adopted the ship s main particulars are shown in table 1 zhang et al 2016 this note adopts a response model considering rudder servo system to represent the nonlinear ship model which is composed by a first order nomoto model with a nonlinear feedback compensating item zhang and jin 2013 the rudder servo system is composed of the maximum rudder angle saturation limit the maximum rudder speed limit and the integral element which is also shown in table 1 as is shown in fig 1 the nonlinear nomoto model is employed in this simulation to compare with the full scale turning test zhang and jin 2013 the sea condition of starboard turning test is shown as follows average wind direction was 039 the wind speed was 7 8 m s the current speed was 0 8 m s the current direction was 153 shan and li 2014 while the sea condition of port turning full scale test is shown as follows average wind direction was 003 the relative wind speed was 10 1 m s it should be noted that the navigation speed reduced from 15kn to 7 2kn when the ship turned to port 270 the ship experiment shows that the turning ability index k is proportional to the navigation speed while following index t and nonlinear parameters α β are inversely proportional to navigation speed the accuracy of the ship model can be presented by the conformity function c m that is defined in eq 1 zhang et al 2017 1 c m min s d r d max s d r d 100 where s d is the advance diameter s d ad or transverse diameter s d td of the simulation r d is the advance diameter r d ad or transverse diameter r d td of the real ship turning test c m is conformity function the comparison of ship turning test with the rudder angle δ 30 are showed in fig 1 and table 2 the parameters compensation technology of speed reduction is employed for turning simulation zhang 2012 for starboard turning the simulation advance diameter s d ad is 4 1l while the real ship turning test r d ad is 4 6l so c m ad 89 13 the simulation transverse diameter s d td is 4 26l while the real ship r d td is 4 5l so c m td 96 67 meanwhile for port turning the simulation advance diameter s d ad is 3 65l while the real ship turning test r d ad is 4 43l so c m ad 82 39 the simulation transverse diameter s d td is 4 2l while the real ship r d td is 3 39l so c m td 80 71 the average conformity c m in port and starboard turning test is 86 73 hence the conformity of simulation are satisfactory with large inertia and nonlinearity even though there are some discrepancy due to the simplified nomoto ship model itself which is satisfactory and easy to use for course keeping control 3 backstepping algorithm 3 1 the principle of backstepping algorithm aiming at uncertain system backstepping algorithm is a systematic approach for controller synthesis the basic design idea of this algorithm is to decompose the complex nonlinear system into several subsystems whose number does not exceed the system order and then lyapunov function is respectively designed for each subsystem the virtual control law of each subsystem can be obtained under the premise of each subsystem with certain convergence in the design of the next subsystem the virtual control law of the former subsystem is treated as the tracking target for the next subsystem the rest can be done in the same manner finally the actual control law of the whole closed loop system is obtained and the convergence of the closed loop system is guaranteed by the lyapunov stability analysis method at the same time case1 the nonlinear ship model is ψ k t α ψ β ψ 3 k t δ wherein ψ is the output of heading angle δ is the input of rudder angle k and t are the ship maneuverability indexes α and β are nonlinear parameters the control law u is designed for ship model through backstepping algorithm which makes the ship to track set course ψ r to facilitate the processing of algorithm we define x 1 ψ x 2 r ψ system output y ψ r control input u δ f x 2 k t h x 2 h x 2 α x 2 β x 2 3 b k t the nonlinear ship model can be rewritten into the form of eq 2 the control design consists of two steps as follows 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u y x 1 step 1 at this step we define the errors as e 1 x 1 ψ r e 2 x 2 ϕ e 1 where ϕ e 1 is a virtual control law differentiating e 1 as 3 e 1 x 1 ψ r x 2 ψ r e 2 ϕ e 1 ψ r to design the virtual control law ϕ e 1 ψ r k 1 e 1 k 1 r eq 3 can be simplified to e 1 k 1 e 1 e 2 where k 1 is the designed parameters of controller then we consider the first lyapunov function candidate as 4 v 1 1 2 e 1 2 5 v 1 k 1 e 1 2 e 1 e 2 step 2 the derivative of e 2 is 6 e 2 x 2 ϕ e 1 f x 2 b u ϕ e 1 constructing the second lyapunov function candidate based on eq 6 7 v 2 v 1 1 2 e 2 2 8 v 2 k 1 e 1 2 e 2 e 1 f x 2 b u ϕ e 1 v 2 0 can be guaranteed by the control law eq 9 9 u 1 b ϕ e 1 e 1 f x 2 k 2 e 2 k 2 r where k 2 is the designed parameters of controller substituting eq 9 into eq 8 10 v 2 k 1 e 1 2 k 2 e 2 2 0 e 1 0 e 2 0 according to lyapunov theorem the designed control law can make the system asymptotically stable at equilibrium point x 1 ψ r x 2 ψ r based on eq 2 10 the control output u can be designed as 11 u t k k t h x 2 1 k 1 k 2 x 1 ψ r k 1 k 2 x 2 ψ r ψ r 3 2 nonlinear feedback improved backstepping algorithm assuming 12 e 1 x 1 ψ r e 2 x 2 if the controller can stabilize the state variables e 1 and e 2 the original system reaches the uniform asymptotic stability at the equilibrium point shown in eq 13 13 x 1 ψ r x 2 0 a lyapunov function can be structured according to zhang 2010 which is performed as 14 v 1 1 2 e 2 2 the differential relationship between e 1 and e 2 has been considered which possesses a certain universality if e 2 is stabilized on the equilibrium point of zero e 1 is stabilized simultaneously v 1 contains the information of e 1 implicitly so as to ensure the proper control scheme and stabilize the e 1 e 2 simultaneously though v 1 does not contain e 1 directly 15 v 1 e 2 e 2 16 v 1 0 to make v 1 0 the designed control scheme u is constructed as follows 17 u 1 b f x 2 k 1 sin ω e 1 where ω k 1 are the designed parameters of controller which satisfy k 1 0 ω 0 1 the taylor series expansion is retained to the term of third order arunnehru and paramasivam 2014 are utilized eq 18 is derived 18 sin ω e 1 ω e 1 ω e 1 3 3 substituting eq 18 into eq 17 we obtain eq 19 by combining eqs 2 12 and 17 19 v 1 e 2 f x 2 b u e 2 f x 2 b 1 b f x 2 k 1 ω e 1 k 1 ω 3 e 1 3 6 2 x 2 f x 2 k 1 ω e 1 e 2 k 1 ω 3 e 1 3 e 2 6 2 b α x 2 2 β x 2 4 k 1 ω x 1 ψ r h h x 2 k 1 ω 3 6 x 1 ψ r h 3 h 3 x 2 2 b α x 2 2 β x 2 2 k 1 ω h x 2 2 k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 2 b α k 1 ω h x 2 2 2 b β k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 where b α β h are positive h is the sample time note that the first item of v 1 20 2 b α k 1 ω h x 2 2 0 in marine practice ω 0 1 h 1 s if taking k 1 0 6 then eq

therefore 2 b β 33 the latter item of v 1 follows that 22 2 b β k 1 ω 3 h 3 6 x 2 4 0 combining eqs 20 22 we obtain 23 v 1 0 in summary the system will reach uniform asymptotic stability at the equilibrium point of x 1 ψ r x 2 0 the control scheme of eq 17 meets the requirements and reserves the nonlinear item of the system without normal cancellation the procedure of nonlinear controller design has been reduced from two steps to one step by choosing the simple lyapunov candidate function rather than the conventional backstepping construction approach in addition eq 24 is formulated in zhang 2010 24 u 1 b f x 2 k 1 e 1 comparing eq 24 with eq 17 the sine function of e 1 with the same controller is constructed which makes up a new mode of nonlinear feedback 3 3 nonlinear robust control for ship course keeping according to the theorems given in zhang et al 2015a if the two parameters of control law eq 11 are taken as k p 1 k 1 k 2 1 3 k ρ k d k 1 k 2 t 3 k wherein ρ is a parameter to adjust the response speed of the control system 0 ρ 10 then the designed nonlinear controller for ship course keeping has strong robustness its essence is that the linear part of backstepping nonlinear controller is replaced by its equivalent robust controller designed on the basis of closed loop gain shaping algorithm zhang et al 2015a therefore eq 11 can be considered as a nonlinear pd controller which the physical meaning is more explicit and the parameters adjusting is more simple for the reason that the proportional and differential coefficient can be determined by the ship maneuverability index k t and system adjusting parameter ρ 4 linear reduction of backstepping algorithm and nonlinear decoration 4 1 problems in the practical application from the zhang et al 2015a the nonlinear part of the nonlinear controller in eq 10 is canceled against the nonlinear part of ship model but there existed two problems in the practical application 1 it is difficult to implement the cancellation of nonlinear function of the actual controller and ship model due to the time varying nonlinear model parameters which caused by mathematical model perturbation under the circumstance of sea condition interference ship draft and navigation speed changes for problem 1 this note still adopts the scheme that the cancellation part of the nonlinear function is ignored and the nonlinear backstepping algorithm is reduced to a linear controller then a set of controller parameters is selected to guarantee robust performance of the system and the control effect of the controller then the control law can be shown as eq 25 25 u t k 1 k 1 k 2 e k 1 k 2 e t k k p e k d e where e ψ r ψ 2 the high output energy of controller in the practice of navigation ships are often affected by high frequency disturbances such as strong and uncertain winds and waves thus the high frequency interferences easily lead to the high output energy of controller especially when the high frequency interferences are not taken into account for control law design for problem 2 a kind of nonlinear processing technique with sine function decoration is adopted which is different from the nonlinear feedback in zhang et al 2015a the sine function decoration is sin ω u f e e aiming to obtain the same control effect with low control energy the nonlinear decoration technique itself does not change the output performance of the control but it can guarantee to reduce the control energy with the same control law in other words it can achieve the same control effect with minor control action under the unchanged control law the effects demonstration process of nonlinear decoration driven by sine function to the closed system can be analyzed by taylor series expansion to first order form which is similar to the proof given in zhang 2012 although the control law is reduced to a linear control law the final control law is still in the category of nonlinear control due to the introduction of nonlinear decoration technique as is shown in fig 2 a novel nonlinear decoration algorithm with sine function deduced from nonlinear feedback algorithm is proposed by changing the sequence of sine function and the linear reduction of backstepping controller k c and then the sine function is embedded into the back of original linear controller the sin ω e is utilized to nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration backstepping algorithm wherein ω is the system frequency and the numerical value of ω should be less than 1 in order to avoid the influence of high frequency wave action interference whose frequency spectrum lies in the range of 0 3 1 25 rad s 4 2 effect on nonlinear control system decorated by sine function in the stability analysis the first order closed loop system is usually stable if the time constant is positive while in marine practice the time constant is absolute positive value then the effects on nonlinear control system decorated by sine function are analyzed by the final value theorem and closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory therefore the stability proofs are as follows 1 effect on the steady state of the closed loop system let the reference input signal be a step signal whose amplitude is ψ r the effects of nonlinear decoration to static performance are analyzed on the condition of that the change of the original control output u is so small that sin ω u ω u establishes the maximum rudder angle is 35 which is equal to 0 61 rad and is a pretty small value in order to simplify the analysis the linear ship motion model is constructed as g k s t s 1 the output heading angle ψ of steady state system is obtained directly by the final value theorem given below ψ lim s 0 s g k c ω 1 g k c ω ψ r s lim s 0 k s t s 1 t k k p k d s ω 1 k s t s 1 t k k p k d s ω ψ r 26 k t k p ω k t k p ω ψ r ψ r therefore nonlinear control decorated by sine function has no extra effect on the steady state of the system because the output error of the steady state is 0 2 effect on the dynamic performance of the closed loop system the transfer function from the input ψ r to the output ψ of the system is 27 ψ ψ r g k c ω 1 g k c ω for ship course keeping problem sea wave action can be categorized to high frequency disturbance generally ω 1 is taken in eq 27 to shy away the wave high frequency spectrum according to closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory the open loop transfer matrix g k c satisfies robust performance high gain in low frequency zone and low gain in high frequency zone zhang 2012 therefore eq 27 is compared to the closed loop transfer function g k c 1 g k c of a standard feedback system and the introduction of ω has no much extra effect to the dynamic performance of the system because of the high gain in low frequency zone 3 effect on the control output of the closed loop system the transfer function from the input ψ r to the output δ of the system is 28 δ ψ r k c ω 1 g k c ω similar analysis as eq 27 the value of k c ω is reduced more significantly than g k c ω in eq 28 therefore the introduction of ω can reduce the control output 4 sin ω u ω u will not be established if e is too large it is difficult to prove the effect of nonlinear control driven by sine function this case is not discussed in this note 5 simulation studies and analysis in this section the simulink toolbox is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed controller in matlab environment the control effects of course keeping for ships and energy saving situation are analyzed in the case of nonlinear feedback and standard feedback based on backstepping algorithm nonlinear decoration and nonlinear feedback based on linear reduced backstepping algorithm and nonlinear decoration and standard feedback based on complex mathematical model 5 1 course keeping control based on nonlinear feedback algorithm taking k 1 0 0015 ω 0 6 in the control scheme eq 17 and ψ r 050 then we can obtain results for comparison under two different control schemes which are shown in fig 3 and table 3 fig 3 b indicates that the heading overshoot is eliminated as well as the settling time t s drops to 133s from 140s under the nonlinear feedback backstepping control fig 3 a and table 3 show that the maximum rudder angle δ max drops to 20 2 from 34 5 while the mean rudder angle δ falls to 0 67 from 0 98 36 1 down to provide further quantification three prevalent performance specifications eq 29 are employed to evaluate the closed loop performances zhang et al 2015a zhang and zhang 2016 that is mean absolute error mae mean integral absolute mia and mean total variation mtv of the control 29 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ r y t d t m i a 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t d t m t v 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t u t 1 d t mae is used to measure the response performance of the system output and mia and mtv of the control input rudder angle δ measure the energy cost and the smoothness of the corresponding algorithm table 3 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results it is noted that the response performance specification mae is obviously increased by 34 7 however the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 30 2 while the smoothness performance specification mtv is obviously reduced by 47 therefore compared to the standard backstepping the nonlinear feedback improved backstepping algorithm has the obvious effects of quick response energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation 5 2 course keeping control based on nonlinear decoration algorithm in this section the wind and wave disturbances are taken into account in the simulation environment consequently the rudder model and sea interference perturbation considered in this simulation is to verify the robustness performance of the controller considering that the output performance of the designed controller should be verified in a higher sea state in this note the wind disturbance is considered as the white noise kallstrom 1982 for wave disturbance a simplified transfer function model shown in eq 30 is capable of simulating it under the beaufort scale 6 which is a second order oscillating system driven by a gaussian white noise zhang and jin 2013 30 ψ h 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 w h where w h s ψ h are the gaussian white noise laplace operator and high frequency wave disturbance as is shown in fig 4 ψ h directly acts on the ship heading angle ψ the simulation diagram is shown in fig 4 the linear reduction of backstepping controller is the same with zhang et al 2015a the simulation controller is designed on the linear reduction of backstepping algorithm based on sine function decoration ρ 4 ω 0 25 rad s comparative simulation results with the experiment results in zhang et al 2015a are shown in fig 5 fig 5 demonstrates the simulation results of the course keeping utilizing the nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration the set course is 050 and the nonlinear feedback algorithm can quickly track the set course without overshoot and static error the regulation time is 106s and the average rudder angle is 2 76 compared with the nonlinear feedback algorithm the simulation result curve of nonlinear decoration algorithm is relatively smoother which shows slightly better performance the average rudder angle is reduced to 1 8 table 4 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is noted that the response performance specification mae is increased by 3 3 however the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 31 5 while the smoothness performance specification mtv is obviously reduced by 29 therefore compared to the nonlinear feedback the nonlinear decoration algorithm has the obvious effects of energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation in addition the rudder servo system characteristics are not taken into consideration when the controller is designed but taken when simulation which equals to take a model perturbation into account for the control system the sea state 6 has also been taken into consideration wave disturbance and fluctuating wind disturbance therefore the simulation results not only satisfy navigation practice but also verify the effectiveness of the nonlinear decoration algorithm 5 3 the effectiveness of the nonlinear decoration algorithm on complex mathematical model as mentioned above the nonlinear decoration algorithm is tested on a nomoto model with a nonlinear item and the effectiveness of algorithm has been affirmed the nonlinear feedback control algorithm on complex mathematical model was verified in zhang et al 2017 in this section the above mentioned nonlinear decoration control algorithm is exerted on the controlling of the maneuvering modeling group mmg ship mathematic model eq 31 of ship dynamics which can denote a situation similar to the motion of a full scale ship fossen 2011 to some extent if the improved control algorithm still works its robustness is further proved 31 m m x u m m y v r x h x p x r x w m m y v m m x

085 the initial heading 000 ρ 5 ω 0 5 ψ r 050 we can get the comparison results under two different control schemes which are shown in fig 6 based on the mathematical model of ship dynamics both control schemes achieve a good course keeping performance compared with the standard feedback algorithm in fig 6 the nonlinear decoration algorithm can quickly track the set course without overshoot and static error the average rudder angle and maximum angle are reduced by 17 9 and 54 4 respectively table 5 gives a quantitative comparison of the above control simulations results and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm it is noted that the mae is increased by 27 the energy cost performance specification mia is reduced by 15 7 and mtv is obviously reduced by 28 3 therefore compared to the standard feedback the nonlinear decoration algorithm on complex mathematical model has the obvious effects of energy saving and smoothness which contributes to the safe navigation moreover this simulation also demonstrates the robustness of the proposed algorithm which is employed on nonlinear nomoto model and mmg ship mathematic model 6 conclusions a novel nonlinear backstepping algorithm the combination of sine function decoration and linear reduction is proposed in this note which successfully solves problems of the nonlinear function cancellation and high control energy in the process of conventional backstepping training ship yukun is taken for simulation and the results demonstrate that the control algorithm presents satisfactory effects on ship course keeping compared with the standard feedback algorithm the nonlinear feedback algorithm has the response performance specification increased by 34 7 but the energy cost performance specification reduced by 30 2 and the smoothness performance specification reduced by 47 meanwhile compared with the nonlinear feedback algorithm the nonlinear decoration algorithm has the response performance specification increased by 3 3 but the energy cost performance specification reduced by 31 5 and the smoothness performance specification reduced by 29 furthermore compared with the standard feedback algorithm on complex mathematical model the proposed nonlinear decoration algorithm has the response performance specification increased by 27 but the energy cost performance specification reduced by 15 7 and the smoothness performance specification reduced by 28 3 the proposed algorithm has the advantages of robustness energy saving and safety in course keeping practice which contributes to the safe navigation meanwhile the results of simulation also show that if the sine function of nonlinear feedback is directly employed for nonlinear decoration controller the effect of course keeping is not satisfactory but the control effect can recover to the same level as the nonlinear feedback when ω is decreased which indicates that the energy saving is achieved by sacrificing a certain amount of system bandwidth in addition since the control effect of the two controller are not that good when set course exceeds 050 it is necessary to further reduce ω to improve the performance for energy saving in navigation future research will be focused on how to further reduce the steering frequency acknowledgments we are grateful to the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to
