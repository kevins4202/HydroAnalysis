10340,water pricing has been identified as a generally valid water supply policy to help solve problems of water scarcity and competition as for the non agricultural sectors in the last three decades water pricing has been widely discussed in and promoted with regard to the irrigation management though in the actual practice its effectiveness is quite controversial this is particularly true in semi arid regions where conjunctive use of collective facilities and on farm groundwater pumps may cause conflicts and mismanagement of water resources under such circumstances irrigation water pricing policies are not easy to deploy and implement effectively due to potential occurrence of side and unintended effects in this framework the present work aims at investigating the impact at the district scale of water pricing policies on both surface water sw and groundwater gw resources in this regard a model which deals with the analysis of farmers decision concerning water source selection is proposed the analysis is carried out keeping capital asset as given also with the aim to elicit the relevance of on farm irrigation water cost on resources use during the irrigation season reference is made to an intensive agricultural district in southern italy conjunctively supplied by collective schemes managed by the local irrigation board and on farm individual groundwater pumping systems the proposed model was built along with local stakeholders in order to i underline the relationship between the water tariff applied for collective supply service and the irrigation source selection during the irrigation season and ii the relevance of the conjunctive use of gw based on pumping cost convenience and service standards needed to fulfill the irrigation requirements the results have been then integrated into a quantitative water balance model and a scenario analysis used to show the potential side impacts that a restrictive sw tariff policy applied during drought periods may have on the gw state in different hydrological conditions keywords water pricing strategies water allocation criteria integrated water management for irrigation groundwater exploitation 1 introduction sustainable water resources management is a complex environmental policy issue and requires taking into account interests related to using sharing and preserving an increasingly limited resource portoghese et al 2013 the role of irrigated agriculture is highly relevant in this direction since it is crucial for the socio economic welfare but at the same time it represents the largest exploiter of water resources fao 2014 an increasing level of conflict between different water users and uses is observed particularly in the mediterranean area jury and vaux 2007 due to the growing pressures such as water scarcity climatic conditions poor governance and socio economic needs portoghese et al 2015 pluchinotta et al 2018 integrated water resource management iwrm methods and tools are often invoked to understand how different water managers and users perceive water resources issues and behave consequently giordano et al 2013 and to predict potential long term impacts on water resources bouwer 2000 in fact purely technical criteria are no longer sufficient to address the challenges related to water management in a given system pahl wostl 2007 specifically for irrigation systems the existence of interconnections among several different issues e g economic social and environmental and among multiple actors strongly affect its dynamic evolution giordano et al 2015 traditional processes to support water resources management are based on a merely technical approach and rely on a limited knowledge of system complexity e g the individual behavior of actors thus often resulting in highly uncertain and potentially ineffective options e g portoghese et al 2013 de vito et al 2017 giannoccaro et al 2013 the key issue to consider in policy and decision making processes related to water resources management is that water is a natural resource linked to basic human needs and distributed from a spatial point of view used by several different actors and owned by no one furthermore the use of common resources such as groundwater without a complete awareness of the multidimensional implications of individual actions and decisions is typically responsible for problems of overexploitation and free riding pluchinotta et al 2018 water cannot be considered as a traditional marketable good and therefore poor designing processes can lead to poor allocations momeni et al 2019 though water saving in agriculture is among the objectives of the succeeding cap reforms giannoccaro and berbel 2011 found that farmer s decision on the extent of irrigation water use across mediterranean eu members is only slightly influenced by the cap reform also considering the extreme no cap support scenario although water is not regarded as a market good one of the most widely used policies to decrease water consumption is water pricing as experienced in different studies which focus on the potential effects in terms of farmers awareness raising and support for shifting towards different cropping patterns berbel et al 2019 momeni et al 2019 additionally specific water pricing strategies could be a valuable solution to deal with extreme conditions e g in drought periods to attain an efficient water consumption however water pricing is a complex problem related to the definition of the actual value of water for irrigation that intertwines with economic social and environmental factors e g ziolkowska 2015 assuming a competitive and unregulated water extraction regime the temporal and spatial variability of external drivers results in inefficient pricing and misallocation of resources katic and grafton 2012 consequently it is necessary to build a solid knowledge base on the multidimensional implications of water pricing strategies to support an adequate design of economic instruments and policies to help limit water overexploitation de vito et al 2017 dono et al 2010 focusing on domestic industrial and energy uses water pricing policies mainly aim to affect the behavior of users ensuring that they pay for the service that the available water fulfills their demand and that the resources are used appropriately and sustainably as required also by the water framework directive ec 2000 concerning the agricultural sector molle and berkoff 2007 reviewed the history of ideas and experiences in irrigation water pricing thus identifying the striking gaps between theory and practice and analyzing constraints on the effectiveness of irrigation pricing policies the overall picture that emerges is that too often stated policy objectives are based on analogy with water supply and energy sectors making this extrapolation very misleading given the particular characteristic of the irrigation sector despite the theoretical advantages that could be achieved e g efficient water use sustainable financial management pricing irrigation water is not easy to deploy effectively in fact water authorities need a clear identification of the results to achieve the performance and potential impacts that different pricing instruments have and the preconditions that enable them to work additionally pricing instruments are built under assumptions that often do not hold in reality and their introduction may lead to a number of adverse behaviors unintended consequences and side effects that are often neglected davidson et al 2019 among these if water is distributed through collective facilities managed by a central authority uncontrolled extractions of groundwater may result where this resource is available dono et al 2010 and negative impacts on incomes may occur e g giannoccaro et al 2010 despite these effects clearly depend on the specific water pricing scheme adopted a general evidence is that fulfilling the environmental objectives while limiting intense social and economic negative impacts is not straightforward cortignani et al 2018 in this regard adequately understanding and representing the behavior of farmers in terms of water use and allocation may help assessing the impacts of potential adaptation measures implemented in reaction to policies and or changes in water availability graveline 2016 within this framework the present work is focused on the analysis of an intensive agricultural district in the southern italy the capitanata district where irrigation demand is jointly fulfilled by on farm groundwater gw wells and a collective network supplied by surface water sw the objective of the study is threefold i to describe in a structured way the effect of different tariffs of collective service on farmers decisions related water source selection wss during the irrigation season ii to quantitatively describe the potential impacts of the wss on both collective sw and on farm gw withdrawals through a global water balance model iii to understand the implications on system sustainability specifically in terms of groundwater overexploitation analyzing the effects of different sw pricing policies going further into details the selection process of a specific irrigation source by farmers i is quantitatively described in the present work as a function of some key drivers e g water pricing quality of the irrigation service etc from the methodological point of view starting from the evidences of individual interviews a model capable to simulate farmers decisions regarding wss and to describe water allocation patterns is developed and validated using data series the model is then integrated in a quantitative water balance model ii with the purpose of informing policy and decision makers about iii the multiple potential impacts of different water pricing strategies due to the strong interconnectedness between sw and gw systems after a short overview of the case study the adopted modeling approach is described in the following section the application of the model in the case study is then described in section 3 together with the results on the sw and gw volumes allocated for irrigation throughout the investigated period including the effects on gw stock under different water pricing and groundwater recharge scenarios some remarks on the presented model and its potential use for basin scale water management are reported in the discussion section 4 followed by the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study concerns the capitanata area which represents a highly developed agricultural area and is the largest irrigated area of puglia southern italy the agricultural area is approximately 500 000 ha in which wheat olives vegetables and grapes are widely cultivated the annual irrigation requirement is fulfilled through both a collective network managed by the local irrigation board and on farm individual groundwater pumping systems surface water uptake and distribution in the irrigation district is managed by the reclamation and irrigation board of capitanata cbc which is a governing and technical body ruled by farmers representatives nowadays the cbc manages 441 579 ha of the whole agricultural area and comprises two main irrigation districts one in the northern part fortore irrigation district and one in the southern part sinistra ofanto irrigation district both equipped with modern pressurized pipe networks as far as concerns the fortore district the area currently equipped with the water distribution network is about 110 000 ha approximately 40 an average of 45 500 ha of this area is irrigated annually through the sw distribution network while the remaining part within the cbc irrigation supply domain is irrigated directly by the farmers using the private wells as usually happens for the rest of the cbc domain outside the sw supply area lamaddalena et al 2004 levidow et al 2014 the total irrigation need over this area is on average 171 000 mm3 corresponding to a unit irrigation of 3800 m3 ha while the allocation guaranteed by the cbc is only 2050 m3 ha which is given by the average sw stock in ordinary years 103 mm3 divided by the average irrigated area in the cbc irrigation census including water losses in such context the underperformance of cbc supply system is mainly due to a water shortage and limited water supply through the cbc water distribution network b high irrigation water demand due to adopted cropping patterns over the greatest part of the cbc c inadequate performances of the water distribution network during the periods of higher water demand d incomplete water distribution network the cbc board is aware that the sw supply allows an average satisfaction degree below 50 and that gw extractions are operated by the associated farmers 30 800 associates as a complementary supply source farmers are allowed to pump gw even in the cbc supply area provided that they have a legal license issued by regional government as a result there are growing concerns on the state of gw guyennon et al 2016 a volumetric water tariff scheme is applied in the cbc district in which irrigation water charges aim to support a cost recovery for system operation and management a mixed payment scheme is adopted and specifically 24 of cbc revenue comes from the fixed component related to the farm irrigated area reported in the cbc irrigation census while the remaining 76 comes from the applied volumetric block tariff with an average unit payment of 0 14 m3 according to recent financial reports 2 2 conceptual model of water allocation dynamics the model proposed in the present paper is one of the main results of a multi step approach that has been implemented by the same research group in the study area with the general objective of analyzing irrigation practices through the involvement of relevant stakeholders trying to get a deep insight into the multidimensional impacts related to water use e g environmental economic social etc the whole process is summarized in the following fig 1 an interview based approach was adopted with the key actors involved in the problem of water resources management for irrigation in the study area the main objective of the interviews was to describe the district scale dynamics related to irrigation practices more specifically semi structured interviews involving both local farmers and decision makers from the cbc were performed between 2011 and 2017 in order to define their main objectives and concerns related to irrigation practices the key drivers of system evolution the current strategies and alternatives to act on the state of the system giordano et al 2013 giordano et al 2015 de vito et al 2019 the approach was used to identify and formalize the general rules of behavior for the stakeholders the results of the interviews have been then structured using qualitative semi quantitative system dynamics tools i e causal loop diagrams and stock and flows models as discussed in pluchinotta et al 2018 2019 de vito et al 2019 a workshop with the same stakeholders was also organized to contribute to model building and validation this first phase of the modeling process was specifically oriented to support understanding and unraveling the high complexity of the system which is affected by a dense network of relationships among different stakeholders having different roles and interests but all strongly influencing the evolution of the system this helped building a global picture of the system taking jointly into account the environmental agricultural social and economic implications of irrigation practices but revealing that water pricing strategies have a crucial role in driving system evolution and need further investigation starting from the global model the present work provides a quantitative analysis of one of the key dynamics that were identified and discussed more in detail in the system i e the impact of water pricing policies on the water source selection by the farmers the irrigation source selection depends on multiple factors such as mainly i the irrigation demand the climate variability the tariff scheme of the collective supply service the standard of irrigation service i e the accessibility to the irrigation supply points the level and stability of pipe pressure the flow rate and its stability at each point of delivery the on demand of irrigation the quality of supplied water the guarantee of supply the pumping cost of on farm groundwater wells for instance the access to the sw collective facilities is provided by about 30 000 delivery points operating with on demand water supply during the irrigation season april september making the cbc service more efficient than on farm gw irrigation and therefore preferable as long as sw is available and affordable during the season however the sw collective service is strongly affected by the winter rainfall pattern before every irrigation season whereas the use on farm groundwater wells is perceived as less variable the behavior of cbc managers concerning their yearly decisions on the irrigation tariff plans was analyzed with specific reference to the water availability in the reservoirs at the beginning of the irrigation season and on other key variables e g expected irrigation water demand seasonal climate pattern an increasing block tariff is established so that during the irrigation season each farmer pays an increasing unit price swcost m3 according to specific volume thresholds of cumulated unit irrigation m3 ha during the season with a minimum tariff corresponding to the first threshold which guarantees almost all seasons the basic water allotment bwa for most users the other volume thresholds are meant to gradually decrease accessibility to sw use the consequence of the block tariff scheme applied by the cbc leads farmers to use cbc waters at lower allotment 2050 m3 ha in general without overcoming the lowest tariff threshold and then to use on farm gw wells to fulfill the further irrigation needs this is in line with the cbc policy which aims at allocating all the available water to most of the associated farmers giannoccaro et al 2010 the cbc decision rules were derived from the analysis of the available irrigation tariff plans 2000 2012 and afterwards were applied to extrapolate the tariff plans for the years between 1993 and 1999 based on hydrological conditions in the reservoirs since the tariff plans were not available in those years as already pointed out the cbc irrigation board is aware both of the medium term irrigation needs resulting from the updates of irrigation census and of the expected seasonal irrigation needs derived farmers communication before the beginning of each irrigation season moreover the cbc performs a continuous monitoring of the key meteorological and hydrological variables including water levels in the reservoir during the year to support matching the seasonal trends of irrigation demand and the sw availability therefore the irrigation managing board is timely updated on the situation and hence on the degree of demand fulfillment consequently in regular hydrologic seasons the cbc board recognizes a 50 water demand fulfillment through collective systems which is in good agreement with the average demand fulfillment around 47 from sw supply estimated from the combination of data on the sw availability with modeled irrigation needs during the study period 1993 2012 with a standard deviation of 22 the above reported conditions have brought farmers to increase groundwater exploitation to meet the irrigation demand causing a serious depletion of gw stock this is related to the large number of licensed wells for irrigation reported in the database of the regional water authority 3200 wells with an average discharge of 5 7 l s the indirect effect of sw tariff on gw use is investigated through the quantitative hydrological model proposed in the following 2 3 water source selection model wss as far as the irrigation service is concerned the interviews with farmers highlighted that the sw supply is by far preferred thanks to the high density of the cbc network the availability of a pressurized on demand service and the good water quality pluchinotta et al 2018 conversely on farm wells have in most cases poor water quality and limited discharge with additional operations needed for water filtering irrigation tanks filling and pressurization of irrigation systems most of the interviewed farmers declared the use of gw pumping only after the cumulated irrigation reaches the first tariff threshold in case of ordinary sw supply however some farmers declared the use of gw extraction as complementary source even before reaching the volume threshold of 2050 m3 ha therefore though the sw supply was identified as the preferred option under fair conditions of sw availability gw withdrawals are perceived as a means to fulfill the irrigation demand thus suggesting the hypothesis that the cbc pricing policy may exert an impact on groundwater resources exploitation that needs careful investigation the proposed wss model attempts to estimate in a given irrigation district and time of the irrigation season the degree of irrigation demand that is satisfied from the collective irrigation network sw and the complementary irrigation supply satisfied by on farm groundwater pumping gw the wss model aims at simulating farmers choices for the irrigation water sources under different hydrologic economic and agricultural constraints though some simplifying assumptions are needed for model implementation in particular i both sw and gw resources are considered fully available to all farmers in the whole study area ii farmers are assumed to provide irrigation water when needed for an optimal agronomic response iii gw resource is virtually unlimited during the irrigation season though an increase of pumping cost due to the water table lowering is considered iv gw quality with reference to salt content is also invariant in such a context our hypothesis is that farmer s decision on source selection relies on operational cost minimization pursue for water under these conditions the starting point of the irrigation source selection is the definition of suitable cost functions considering hydrological technical and economic constraints and their variability in space and time specifically the gw pumping cost function has to take into account both water table depth and groundwater yield as the main parameters which may be quite variable in space and time as in the following eq 1 1 gw cost x y t c t h 1 x y t h 2 x y 367 2 η c gw fix x y m 3 eq 1 is meant to express the unit average cost of gw for irrigation m3 as the sum between the variable and the fixed costs divided by seasonal average groundwater withdrawal the variable cost is the product of the mechanical work of submerged pumps in kwh m3 by the unit energy cost c t in kwh in which the total head is given by the sum of water table depth including pumping drawdown in the borehole below the soil surface h1 i e the dynamic gw depth and the required head pressure h2 of the adopted irrigation system and η is the overall pumping efficiency assuming the variability in gw depth drawdown and pumping wells features from the case study details in table 1 an average variable cost of 0 09 m3 is estimated for an energy cost of 0 25 kwh the fixed costs c gw fix due to license fee maintenance and depreciation of the pumping plant is assumed to be equal on average to 0 01 m3 scale effects are neglected the sw collective cost function mainly depending on the cbc volumetric pricing scheme is intended to represent the different cost components of the farm scale irrigation service supplied by surface water eq 2 2 sw cost x y t t x y i x y t 1 c sw fix x y m 3 starting from the above determinants eq 2 reports the unit average cost function at time t given by the unit tariff t m3 which depends on the cumulated irrigation volume in the previous time steps of the irrigation season t 1 added to the fixed costs charged by the irrigation board for the access to the sw supply facilities c sw fix the variability of i t and c sw fix with space is introduced to identify a specific farm in the study region with its irrigated cropping area which are associated to the fixed cost the tariff t is based on blocks which are variable from year to year depending on the hydrological state of the reservoirs feeding the collective water scheme and is designed to discourage farmers uptake from the cbc network when the first block threshold is exceeded this is due to the fact that cbc allocation is planned for an equal share of 2050 m3 to each irrigated hectare in the served area the rates per block increase as the time evolution of the reservoir storage during ordinary irrigation seasons often turns to water scarcity conditions except when extraordinary precipitation in the late spring changes this tendency during drought years the scarcity pricing approach is much more restrictive in terms of unit water costs and block thresholds the gw and sw cost functions described above were used during a second round of semi structured interviews with both farmers and cbc managers to support a systematic analysis based on climatic data and cropping pattern variability aiming to define robust relationships between water demand patterns and water accessibility perception over a 20 year period the evidences are reported in the form of a quantitative model scheme putting together farmers decision modes water managers rules and their combined effects on groundwater storage variability in the long term fig 2 in practice the proposed model scheme has been developed taking into account different sub models ranging from hydrological drivers to decision rules and their ultimate impacts of the gw stock which is considered as an overall sustainability indicator of the gw sw conjunctive use the following paragraphs provide a more detailed analysis of the single sub models of the global model plotted in fig 2 in case of conjunctive use of sw and gw resources particular attention was given to the analysis of farmers behavior with respect to water supply for irrigation which was found to be sensitive to some technical and economic factors such as gw depth and water pricing scheme as well as the standards of the irrigation service the conjunctive use of gw wells is first complementary and then becomes substitutive for the sake of simplicity the wss model adopts a territorial approach to integrate the choice model with the water balance model of the sw reservoir and the underground resource which are territorial by nature the determinant variable of the wss model is defined as the unit cost ratio cr x y t between sw cost x y t and gw cost x y t the following eq 3 defines the fraction of the irrigation demand satisfied from surface water supply and is characterized by a decreasing quadratic trend to simulate farmers decision to progressively switch from sw to gw during the irrigation season as the increasing block tariff drives to less convenient unit water price the wss model equation has the following structure eq 3 3 sw sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 cr 2 2 cr m sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 cr sw m cr m 2 sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 where sw m is the sw value when cr is minimal i e when sw cost is minimal conversely sw m is the sw value when cr is maximum i e when sw cost is the highest compared to a steady low gw cost similarly given gw cost at a given time and location cr m is the value of cr when sw cost is minimal and cr m is the value of cr when sw cost is maximum the quadratic function is therefore used firstly to represent some degree of variability in the behavior of different farmers with their peculiarities secondly the function allows simulating the marked reduction in withdrawals from the cbc when the first threshold is exceeded the wss function is represented in fig 3 considering a continuous increase of cr this functional form was built starting from the interviews with the famers but it has been quantitatively validated with a comparison with the reservoir water balance as explained in the following section as such the wss function reflects the attitude of farmers to prefer groundwater source gw with respect to surface water sw as the sw cost gets higher i e with an increasing cr representing the effects of gw depth as well as of sw pricing scheme in combination with the irrigation need of a given farm during the irrigation season as such sw supply is preferred over gw pumping until their cost ratio cr is below 2 5 another key driver for irrigation cost assessment at farm scale is obviously the crop water demand which is variable on a seasonal and inter annual basis mainly according to climate variability cropping extension and patterns and irrigation techniques similarly at the district scale the size of irrigated land and cropping patterns are among the major determinants of irrigation water needs and consequently of water resources exploitation at basin scale to account for cropping pattern changes over time a specific subset of representative crops was selected crops having higher water requirement and or covering a wider area were only taken into account with their temporal variabilities according to data by the italian statistical service namely processing tomatoes 19 000 30 000 ha grapes 28 500 44 200 ha olives 52 500 55 000 ha peaches 2800 4400 ha and vegetables 2200 3100 ha the annual irrigation requirements i rrd were estimated accordingly for the main crops in the study area using cropwat by fao allen et al 1998 for the investigated period and compared to those provided by cbc irrigation advise and a few interviews with farmers dated 2017 table 2 spatially averaged soil hydraulic properties were considered for the irrigation requirement estimation while the efficiency of the irrigation systems was estimated considering drip irrigation efficiency set to 0 9 with an additional reduction coefficient applied to take into account both deficit irrigation techniques e g for olives and the practice of reducing irrigated areas to have higher unit water volumes available from the sw system all these parameterizations were based on farmers interviews and allowed predicting the consumptive water use starting from the agronomic irrigation requirement estimated through cropwat throughout the period of interest fig 4 overall annual irrigation requirement is compared in the same figure to sw irrigation supply resulting from the reservoir monthly water balance calculations 2 4 aquifer water balance conceptual model to jointly analyze the dynamics of groundwater volume and irrigation water uses a conceptual water balance model of the study area has been implemented guyennon et al 2016 for the period of interest the water balance of the aquifer system fig 2 was evaluated applying a lumped conceptual scheme to the groundwater reservoir as a whole under the effect of variable irrigation practices and reservoir management rules the input terms are the following a the irrigation demand related to the variability of climate and cropping pattern b the available surface water stock and consequent supply management rules c the groundwater recharge computed by the gmat monthly soil water balance model portoghese et al 2005 d the monthly groundwater abstractions from individual on farm wells estimated using the wss model e the groundwater outflow as discharge to sea and baseflow to the river network whose monthly rate is assumed to be proportional under the linear reservoir hypothesis to the volume stored in the aquifer guyennon et al 2016 the historical records of climate and cropping patterns were included in the implemented model allowing to estimate the variability of groundwater balance as a lumped stock and flow system this simplified approach compared to other physically based distributed gw models allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of gw storage to climate and sw tariff variations including other variations in crops and water management models 3 results 3 1 parameterization and validation of the wss function the present study was performed over a 20 years period 1993 2012 for which most of the needed datasets were available namely i climate information reporting two drought events with severe deficit of the sw collective supply followed by above average rainfall years ii a concurrent hydrological dataset including the reservoir water balance and gw table measurements iii time series of the cropping patterns for the whole basin referring both to the district area equipped with the cbc network and to the outside area during this period large areal variations mostly due to the cap reform implementation between 2000 and 2009 were observed for both durum wheat between 282 000 ha in 2002 and 165 000 ha in 2011 and for processing tomato between 30 000 ha in 2000 and 19 000 ha in 2012 as well as for the other crop types for which an adjustment toward more profitable productions was observed zingaro et al 2017 following the cbc decision rule detailed in section 2 2 the sw pricing scheme from year to year was defined according to the volume stored in the reservoir in march when the wet season is almost over considering the marked climate variability of the investigated region 4 different pricing schemes were adopted during period 1993 2012 which correspond to distinct cr patterns the block tariff thresholds commonly observed during the study period are reported in fig 5 together with the cr steps for different gw depths shallow average and deep i e respectively 20 m 40 m and 70 m for the case study application in the capitanata plain the parameters of the wss function were defined according to the discrete tariff thresholds of the sw tariff plans and gw unit average costs corresponding to an average dynamic depth of the water table around 40 m in case of regular climatic and hydrologic conditions when the reservoir is full and the irrigation season can be operated normally starting from swm 0 9 the wss function predicts step wise decreases in sw reliance according to the increasing sw unit cost as the seasonally cumulated irrigation exceed the bwa however in case of years with limited water availability i e 2000 2007 and 2008 sw is accessed up to the bwa and then sw supply is thus drastically reduced fig 5 with swm 0 05 as the unit sw cost becomes unaffordable as such the parameterized wss function allows to simulate the source selection criteria depending on the irrigation demand and tariff thresholds and to quantify the growing preference for groundwater source gw during the irrigation season when the sw cost becomes less convenient fig 6a the validation of the wss model was performed by comparing the simulated irrigation supply from sw facilities with the overall uptake volume operated by the cbc for irrigation purposes fig 6c measured monthly uptake values were modified considering a conveyance efficiency of 87 guyennon et al 2016 to take into account water losses in the pressurized network the results of this comparison show a good agreement r2 0 91 see fig 6c proving a reliable reconstruction of farmers allocation from both sw and gw under different tariff and or climate conditions 3 2 modeled irrigation water balance in conjunctive sw gw allocation schemes the wss model was validated for the period 1993 2012 through the dataset collected in zingaro et al 2017 related to the cropping pattern variability along with the climate records and the reservoir water budgets starting from the monthly time series of cropwat irrigation requirements i rrd the wss model allowed estimating monthly gw abstraction cumulated over the entire district as well as sw uptake volumes from the reservoir during each month of the irrigation season spatially averaged cr values were set as input to wss function yielding gw and sw over the whole district area simulated monthly time series of sw and gw uptakes are plotted in fig 7 along with sw uptakes derived from the reservoir operation record for the same period clearly sw exploitation resulted variable according to reservoir storage and consequent volumetric tariff adjustments in both simulated and observed sw uptakes under the extreme conditions of failure in the ws storage i e 2001 and 2002 the model correctly satisfied the irrigation needs solely through gw uptake similarly higher gw exploitation mean gw 76 was estimated in years with reduced reservoir storage i e 2000 2007 and 2008 while under regular climatic and hydrological conditions lower pressure on gw resources is estimated mean gw 40 with sw supply system assuring 60 of the district irrigation demand 3 3 impacts of water pricing and irrigation demand on gw storage dynamics although gw protection is out of the scope of cbc water management strategy the level of tapping into the gw is 56 on average in conjunctive use areas while in extreme drought years and outside the cbc collective service area farmers rely on gw extraction to cover 100 of their irrigation needs the validation of gw component in the overall model scheme in fig 2 was provided in terms of monthly gw storage volume guyennon et al 2016 using gw records from the regional monitoring network passarella et al 2017 water table depth measurements from the 55 monitoring wells were adopted as representative of the entire aquifer domain and then converted into estimates of gw storage fig 8 for each gw campaign covering the period 2001 2009 point measurements were scaled by the effective porosity and then summarized using box whisker plots the comparison between simulated and observation based gw storage variability substantially proves the good performance of the overall modeling chain fig 8 despite the temporal stationarity of rainfall during the study period which included severe drought episodes in 2001 2002 and 2008 followed by wet years with full recovery of rainfall deficits a permanent loss in gw volume of about 20 was observed at the end of the period in other terms the negative impacts of drought years on gw storage are emphasized by the concurrent reduced gw recharge and increased withdrawal this mechanism is clearly driven by climatic variability and irrigation demand patterns but on the other side accessibility to sw and gw resources may indeed have an important role to test the sensitivity of gw balance simulations to climate and water tariff variations a few scenarios were defined by altering the adopted time series table 3 in particular the effects on gw storage due to cbc pricing policy were evaluated by adopting a 50 increase in sw tariffs s1 while the effect of climate on gw storage was investigated by a 10 reduction on precipitation s2 furthermore the s1 water pricing scenario was combined with the climate scenario s2 in the combined s3 scenario for each of the three scenarios the trends of gw volumes are presented in the following fig 9 with the aim of highlighting the differences between scenarios in terms of impacts on gw storage with respect to the s0 condition which corresponds to the historical baseline more specifically the first two scenarios respectively the 50 increase of water pricing levels s1 and the climate induced decrease in gw recharge s2 were found to yield quite similar results on the dynamic of gw storage so that they could be associated to an almost equivalent impact i e an overall 25 reduction of the gw stock compared to the baseline s0 in 20 years in other words according to this modeling study farmers are expected to react to the increase of sw prices by increasing gw exploitation thus causing similar impacts on gw quantitative state as those caused by a 10 reduction in precipitation consequently the worst but not totally unlikely scenario resulting from the combination of s1 and s2 namely the scenario s3 is expected to cause a 67 reduction on gw storage in about 20 years overall these scenario simulations have further demonstrated the capability of the adopted modeling scheme to investigate the combined effects of climate variations farmers choices and management rules on the sustainability of gw resources 4 discussion the present work argues that a sustainable management of water resources in complex socio hydrological contexts needs a thorough analysis of water exploitation mechanisms including the potential side effects that irrigation water pricing strategies might have on water source selection and use a wss function is built for the purpose in a system with a conjunctive use of sw and gw considering both the gw pumping cost and the sw collective tariff with specific reference to the proposed case study the capitanata area both qualitative and quantitative evidences suggest that the sw is preferred over gw until the cost ratio cr of 2 5 is exceeded and that a relevant exploitation of gw occurs ranging from 56 on average in conjunctive use areas to 100 in drought years and outside the cbc collective service area results feed a water balance model which highlights through a scenario analysis performed in different climate and sw pricing conditions the occurrence of potentially unsustainable conditions for the system evidence is specifically provided of the potential onset of side effects in terms of gw overexploitation as a consequence of the implementation of specific sw water pricing strategies the activities contribute to provide an answer to the specific research questions raised in the introduction first of all concerning the role of irrigation water pricing on the farmers decisions related to water source selection and use although it is well known that water policies could be a valuable option to affect the users behavior and to improve efficiency it should be carefully considered that they may have unintended consequences and side effects for example with specific reference to the case study the sw pricing policies implemented in drought years by the irrigation board which are meant to allocate scarce water volume may rather drive farmers towards a potential overexploitation of gw resources through individual on farm wells there are both qualitative i e from semi structured individual interviews and quantitative evidences i e data related to sw supply confirming this during a production season the proposed work provides a solid description of these results although it should be highlighted that the system is characterized by a high complexity which cannot be fully unraveled by the model just to make an example the market conditions which are indirectly taken into account through the crop pattern and therefore the irrigation requirements as well as the farm size type are also relevant issues of farmers decisions and could have a significant impact on the selection of a specific water source secondly the information collected regarding water use and the process of source selection has been structured in a quantitative wss function which models the economic convenience driving farmers either towards sw or gw under specific conditions during a given irrigation season this function has been then included in an aquifer balance model in order to quantitatively assess the potential effect of sw collective pricing strategies and gw variable cost on the state of gw resources despite the mentioned model assumptions the impact of sw collective pricing strategies on the overexploitation of gw resources particularly during dry years clearly emerges this may drive the system along with other issues such as the effects of climate change towards unsustainable conditions additional efforts are needed however in exploring the effects of other policies e g supporting crop change that can be implemented along with or instead of pricing strategies producing better systemic effects lastly one of the key general evidences from the modeling process and from the scenario analysis is that in such complex socio hydrological systems the implementation of specific sectoral actions and strategies may have unintended consequences on the system as a whole understanding the side effects e g of a restrictive sw pricing policy on gw uptake is not straightforward but definitely relevant at a strategic level the model despite the needed assumptions and simplifications could help decision makers dealing with a complex issues such as irrigation water management in a more systemic way results can be used to support raising the awareness regarding the potential multiple effects that policies and strategies may have on the system as a whole and drive towards the selection of effective solutions although the evidences from the specific case study may allow drawing some general considerations and conclusions on the different effects of water pricing strategies on irrigation systems additional efforts are needed to replicate a similar approach in other contexts and in even more complex conditions 5 conclusions the present work proposes an insight into the issue of sustainable water resources use for irrigation considering a district with both sw and gw availability collective and individual on farm services respectively the focus is specifically on the influence that variable costs for irrigation water can have on source selection during the irrigation season an intuitive wss function to describe water source selection is built to formally reflect the evidences of the interviews as well as the data series of all relevant variables thet takes jointly into account the crop water demand along with the average gw pumping cost and the sw collective tariff with its variation in different hydrological conditions based on the wss function gw balance simulations are performed in different scenarios showing potential unsustainable conditions although the model in its current form provides a simplification of some dynamics results highlight the relevance of systemic approaches for an effective and sustainable management of gw resources and the need to take into account the multiple interactions among decision makers physical systems policies and local conditions in this direction the role of the proposed model could be highly relevant to understand system evolution and to explicitly consider potential side effects or unintended consequences of actions mainly in a threefold direction i providing indications on the impacts of possible changes in the sw tariff system ii identifying potential tipping points for the gw system under specific climatic and resources use conditions iii providing a structured support for the identification of suitable policies for an integrated sw and gw management future research activities will follow these research

10340,water pricing has been identified as a generally valid water supply policy to help solve problems of water scarcity and competition as for the non agricultural sectors in the last three decades water pricing has been widely discussed in and promoted with regard to the irrigation management though in the actual practice its effectiveness is quite controversial this is particularly true in semi arid regions where conjunctive use of collective facilities and on farm groundwater pumps may cause conflicts and mismanagement of water resources under such circumstances irrigation water pricing policies are not easy to deploy and implement effectively due to potential occurrence of side and unintended effects in this framework the present work aims at investigating the impact at the district scale of water pricing policies on both surface water sw and groundwater gw resources in this regard a model which deals with the analysis of farmers decision concerning water source selection is proposed the analysis is carried out keeping capital asset as given also with the aim to elicit the relevance of on farm irrigation water cost on resources use during the irrigation season reference is made to an intensive agricultural district in southern italy conjunctively supplied by collective schemes managed by the local irrigation board and on farm individual groundwater pumping systems the proposed model was built along with local stakeholders in order to i underline the relationship between the water tariff applied for collective supply service and the irrigation source selection during the irrigation season and ii the relevance of the conjunctive use of gw based on pumping cost convenience and service standards needed to fulfill the irrigation requirements the results have been then integrated into a quantitative water balance model and a scenario analysis used to show the potential side impacts that a restrictive sw tariff policy applied during drought periods may have on the gw state in different hydrological conditions keywords water pricing strategies water allocation criteria integrated water management for irrigation groundwater exploitation 1 introduction sustainable water resources management is a complex environmental policy issue and requires taking into account interests related to using sharing and preserving an increasingly limited resource portoghese et al 2013 the role of irrigated agriculture is highly relevant in this direction since it is crucial for the socio economic welfare but at the same time it represents the largest exploiter of water resources fao 2014 an increasing level of conflict between different water users and uses is observed particularly in the mediterranean area jury and vaux 2007 due to the growing pressures such as water scarcity climatic conditions poor governance and socio economic needs portoghese et al 2015 pluchinotta et al 2018 integrated water resource management iwrm methods and tools are often invoked to understand how different water managers and users perceive water resources issues and behave consequently giordano et al 2013 and to predict potential long term impacts on water resources bouwer 2000 in fact purely technical criteria are no longer sufficient to address the challenges related to water management in a given system pahl wostl 2007 specifically for irrigation systems the existence of interconnections among several different issues e g economic social and environmental and among multiple actors strongly affect its dynamic evolution giordano et al 2015 traditional processes to support water resources management are based on a merely technical approach and rely on a limited knowledge of system complexity e g the individual behavior of actors thus often resulting in highly uncertain and potentially ineffective options e g portoghese et al 2013 de vito et al 2017 giannoccaro et al 2013 the key issue to consider in policy and decision making processes related to water resources management is that water is a natural resource linked to basic human needs and distributed from a spatial point of view used by several different actors and owned by no one furthermore the use of common resources such as groundwater without a complete awareness of the multidimensional implications of individual actions and decisions is typically responsible for problems of overexploitation and free riding pluchinotta et al 2018 water cannot be considered as a traditional marketable good and therefore poor designing processes can lead to poor allocations momeni et al 2019 though water saving in agriculture is among the objectives of the succeeding cap reforms giannoccaro and berbel 2011 found that farmer s decision on the extent of irrigation water use across mediterranean eu members is only slightly influenced by the cap reform also considering the extreme no cap support scenario although water is not regarded as a market good one of the most widely used policies to decrease water consumption is water pricing as experienced in different studies which focus on the potential effects in terms of farmers awareness raising and support for shifting towards different cropping patterns berbel et al 2019 momeni et al 2019 additionally specific water pricing strategies could be a valuable solution to deal with extreme conditions e g in drought periods to attain an efficient water consumption however water pricing is a complex problem related to the definition of the actual value of water for irrigation that intertwines with economic social and environmental factors e g ziolkowska 2015 assuming a competitive and unregulated water extraction regime the temporal and spatial variability of external drivers results in inefficient pricing and misallocation of resources katic and grafton 2012 consequently it is necessary to build a solid knowledge base on the multidimensional implications of water pricing strategies to support an adequate design of economic instruments and policies to help limit water overexploitation de vito et al 2017 dono et al 2010 focusing on domestic industrial and energy uses water pricing policies mainly aim to affect the behavior of users ensuring that they pay for the service that the available water fulfills their demand and that the resources are used appropriately and sustainably as required also by the water framework directive ec 2000 concerning the agricultural sector molle and berkoff 2007 reviewed the history of ideas and experiences in irrigation water pricing thus identifying the striking gaps between theory and practice and analyzing constraints on the effectiveness of irrigation pricing policies the overall picture that emerges is that too often stated policy objectives are based on analogy with water supply and energy sectors making this extrapolation very misleading given the particular characteristic of the irrigation sector despite the theoretical advantages that could be achieved e g efficient water use sustainable financial management pricing irrigation water is not easy to deploy effectively in fact water authorities need a clear identification of the results to achieve the performance and potential impacts that different pricing instruments have and the preconditions that enable them to work additionally pricing instruments are built under assumptions that often do not hold in reality and their introduction may lead to a number of adverse behaviors unintended consequences and side effects that are often neglected davidson et al 2019 among these if water is distributed through collective facilities managed by a central authority uncontrolled extractions of groundwater may result where this resource is available dono et al 2010 and negative impacts on incomes may occur e g giannoccaro et al 2010 despite these effects clearly depend on the specific water pricing scheme adopted a general evidence is that fulfilling the environmental objectives while limiting intense social and economic negative impacts is not straightforward cortignani et al 2018 in this regard adequately understanding and representing the behavior of farmers in terms of water use and allocation may help assessing the impacts of potential adaptation measures implemented in reaction to policies and or changes in water availability graveline 2016 within this framework the present work is focused on the analysis of an intensive agricultural district in the southern italy the capitanata district where irrigation demand is jointly fulfilled by on farm groundwater gw wells and a collective network supplied by surface water sw the objective of the study is threefold i to describe in a structured way the effect of different tariffs of collective service on farmers decisions related water source selection wss during the irrigation season ii to quantitatively describe the potential impacts of the wss on both collective sw and on farm gw withdrawals through a global water balance model iii to understand the implications on system sustainability specifically in terms of groundwater overexploitation analyzing the effects of different sw pricing policies going further into details the selection process of a specific irrigation source by farmers i is quantitatively described in the present work as a function of some key drivers e g water pricing quality of the irrigation service etc from the methodological point of view starting from the evidences of individual interviews a model capable to simulate farmers decisions regarding wss and to describe water allocation patterns is developed and validated using data series the model is then integrated in a quantitative water balance model ii with the purpose of informing policy and decision makers about iii the multiple potential impacts of different water pricing strategies due to the strong interconnectedness between sw and gw systems after a short overview of the case study the adopted modeling approach is described in the following section the application of the model in the case study is then described in section 3 together with the results on the sw and gw volumes allocated for irrigation throughout the investigated period including the effects on gw stock under different water pricing and groundwater recharge scenarios some remarks on the presented model and its potential use for basin scale water management are reported in the discussion section 4 followed by the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study concerns the capitanata area which represents a highly developed agricultural area and is the largest irrigated area of puglia southern italy the agricultural area is approximately 500 000 ha in which wheat olives vegetables and grapes are widely cultivated the annual irrigation requirement is fulfilled through both a collective network managed by the local irrigation board and on farm individual groundwater pumping systems surface water uptake and distribution in the irrigation district is managed by the reclamation and irrigation board of capitanata cbc which is a governing and technical body ruled by farmers representatives nowadays the cbc manages 441 579 ha of the whole agricultural area and comprises two main irrigation districts one in the northern part fortore irrigation district and one in the southern part sinistra ofanto irrigation district both equipped with modern pressurized pipe networks as far as concerns the fortore district the area currently equipped with the water distribution network is about 110 000 ha approximately 40 an average of 45 500 ha of this area is irrigated annually through the sw distribution network while the remaining part within the cbc irrigation supply domain is irrigated directly by the farmers using the private wells as usually happens for the rest of the cbc domain outside the sw supply area lamaddalena et al 2004 levidow et al 2014 the total irrigation need over this area is on average 171 000 mm3 corresponding to a unit irrigation of 3800 m3 ha while the allocation guaranteed by the cbc is only 2050 m3 ha which is given by the average sw stock in ordinary years 103 mm3 divided by the average irrigated area in the cbc irrigation census including water losses in such context the underperformance of cbc supply system is mainly due to a water shortage and limited water supply through the cbc water distribution network b high irrigation water demand due to adopted cropping patterns over the greatest part of the cbc c inadequate performances of the water distribution network during the periods of higher water demand d incomplete water distribution network the cbc board is aware that the sw supply allows an average satisfaction degree below 50 and that gw extractions are operated by the associated farmers 30 800 associates as a complementary supply source farmers are allowed to pump gw even in the cbc supply area provided that they have a legal license issued by regional government as a result there are growing concerns on the state of gw guyennon et al 2016 a volumetric water tariff scheme is applied in the cbc district in which irrigation water charges aim to support a cost recovery for system operation and management a mixed payment scheme is adopted and specifically 24 of cbc revenue comes from the fixed component related to the farm irrigated area reported in the cbc irrigation census while the remaining 76 comes from the applied volumetric block tariff with an average unit payment of 0 14 m3 according to recent financial reports 2 2 conceptual model of water allocation dynamics the model proposed in the present paper is one of the main results of a multi step approach that has been implemented by the same research group in the study area with the general objective of analyzing irrigation practices through the involvement of relevant stakeholders trying to get a deep insight into the multidimensional impacts related to water use e g environmental economic social etc the whole process is summarized in the following fig 1 an interview based approach was adopted with the key actors involved in the problem of water resources management for irrigation in the study area the main objective of the interviews was to describe the district scale dynamics related to irrigation practices more specifically semi structured interviews involving both local farmers and decision makers from the cbc were performed between 2011 and 2017 in order to define their main objectives and concerns related to irrigation practices the key drivers of system evolution the current strategies and alternatives to act on the state of the system giordano et al 2013 giordano et al 2015 de vito et al 2019 the approach was used to identify and formalize the general rules of behavior for the stakeholders the results of the interviews have been then structured using qualitative semi quantitative system dynamics tools i e causal loop diagrams and stock and flows models as discussed in pluchinotta et al 2018 2019 de vito et al 2019 a workshop with the same stakeholders was also organized to contribute to model building and validation this first phase of the modeling process was specifically oriented to support understanding and unraveling the high complexity of the system which is affected by a dense network of relationships among different stakeholders having different roles and interests but all strongly influencing the evolution of the system this helped building a global picture of the system taking jointly into account the environmental agricultural social and economic implications of irrigation practices but revealing that water pricing strategies have a crucial role in driving system evolution and need further investigation starting from the global model the present work provides a quantitative analysis of one of the key dynamics that were identified and discussed more in detail in the system i e the impact of water pricing policies on the water source selection by the farmers the irrigation source selection depends on multiple factors such as mainly i the irrigation demand the climate variability the tariff scheme of the collective supply service the standard of irrigation service i e the accessibility to the irrigation supply points the level and stability of pipe pressure the flow rate and its stability at each point of delivery the on demand of irrigation the quality of supplied water the guarantee of supply the pumping cost of on farm groundwater wells for instance the access to the sw collective facilities is provided by about 30 000 delivery points operating with on demand water supply during the irrigation season april september making the cbc service more efficient than on farm gw irrigation and therefore preferable as long as sw is available and affordable during the season however the sw collective service is strongly affected by the winter rainfall pattern before every irrigation season whereas the use on farm groundwater wells is perceived as less variable the behavior of cbc managers concerning their yearly decisions on the irrigation tariff plans was analyzed with specific reference to the water availability in the reservoirs at the beginning of the irrigation season and on other key variables e g expected irrigation water demand seasonal climate pattern an increasing block tariff is established so that during the irrigation season each farmer pays an increasing unit price swcost m3 according to specific volume thresholds of cumulated unit irrigation m3 ha during the season with a minimum tariff corresponding to the first threshold which guarantees almost all seasons the basic water allotment bwa for most users the other volume thresholds are meant to gradually decrease accessibility to sw use the consequence of the block tariff scheme applied by the cbc leads farmers to use cbc waters at lower allotment 2050 m3 ha in general without overcoming the lowest tariff threshold and then to use on farm gw wells to fulfill the further irrigation needs this is in line with the cbc policy which aims at allocating all the available water to most of the associated farmers giannoccaro et al 2010 the cbc decision rules were derived from the analysis of the available irrigation tariff plans 2000 2012 and afterwards were applied to extrapolate the tariff plans for the years between 1993 and 1999 based on hydrological conditions in the reservoirs since the tariff plans were not available in those years as already pointed out the cbc irrigation board is aware both of the medium term irrigation needs resulting from the updates of irrigation census and of the expected seasonal irrigation needs derived farmers communication before the beginning of each irrigation season moreover the cbc performs a continuous monitoring of the key meteorological and hydrological variables including water levels in the reservoir during the year to support matching the seasonal trends of irrigation demand and the sw availability therefore the irrigation managing board is timely updated on the situation and hence on the degree of demand fulfillment consequently in regular hydrologic seasons the cbc board recognizes a 50 water demand fulfillment through collective systems which is in good agreement with the average demand fulfillment around 47 from sw supply estimated from the combination of data on the sw availability with modeled irrigation needs during the study period 1993 2012 with a standard deviation of 22 the above reported conditions have brought farmers to increase groundwater exploitation to meet the irrigation demand causing a serious depletion of gw stock this is related to the large number of licensed wells for irrigation reported in the database of the regional water authority 3200 wells with an average discharge of 5 7 l s the indirect effect of sw tariff on gw use is investigated through the quantitative hydrological model proposed in the following 2 3 water source selection model wss as far as the irrigation service is concerned the interviews with farmers highlighted that the sw supply is by far preferred thanks to the high density of the cbc network the availability of a pressurized on demand service and the good water quality pluchinotta et al 2018 conversely on farm wells have in most cases poor water quality and limited discharge with additional operations needed for water filtering irrigation tanks filling and pressurization of irrigation systems most of the interviewed farmers declared the use of gw pumping only after the cumulated irrigation reaches the first tariff threshold in case of ordinary sw supply however some farmers declared the use of gw extraction as complementary source even before reaching the volume threshold of 2050 m3 ha therefore though the sw supply was identified as the preferred option under fair conditions of sw availability gw withdrawals are perceived as a means to fulfill the irrigation demand thus suggesting the hypothesis that the cbc pricing policy may exert an impact on groundwater resources exploitation that needs careful investigation the proposed wss model attempts to estimate in a given irrigation district and time of the irrigation season the degree of irrigation demand that is satisfied from the collective irrigation network sw and the complementary irrigation supply satisfied by on farm groundwater pumping gw the wss model aims at simulating farmers choices for the irrigation water sources under different hydrologic economic and agricultural constraints though some simplifying assumptions are needed for model implementation in particular i both sw and gw resources are considered fully available to all farmers in the whole study area ii farmers are assumed to provide irrigation water when needed for an optimal agronomic response iii gw resource is virtually unlimited during the irrigation season though an increase of pumping cost due to the water table lowering is considered iv gw quality with reference to salt content is also invariant in such a context our hypothesis is that farmer s decision on source selection relies on operational cost minimization pursue for water under these conditions the starting point of the irrigation source selection is the definition of suitable cost functions considering hydrological technical and economic constraints and their variability in space and time specifically the gw pumping cost function has to take into account both water table depth and groundwater yield as the main parameters which may be quite variable in space and time as in the following eq 1 1 gw cost x y t c t h 1 x y t h 2 x y 367 2 η c gw fix x y m 3 eq 1 is meant to express the unit average cost of gw for irrigation m3 as the sum between the variable and the fixed costs divided by seasonal average groundwater withdrawal the variable cost is the product of the mechanical work of submerged pumps in kwh m3 by the unit energy cost c t in kwh in which the total head is given by the sum of water table depth including pumping drawdown in the borehole below the soil surface h1 i e the dynamic gw depth and the required head pressure h2 of the adopted irrigation system and η is the overall pumping efficiency assuming the variability in gw depth drawdown and pumping wells features from the case study details in table 1 an average variable cost of 0 09 m3 is estimated for an energy cost of 0 25 kwh the fixed costs c gw fix due to license fee maintenance and depreciation of the pumping plant is assumed to be equal on average to 0 01 m3 scale effects are neglected the sw collective cost function mainly depending on the cbc volumetric pricing scheme is intended to represent the different cost components of the farm scale irrigation service supplied by surface water eq 2 2 sw cost x y t t x y i x y t 1 c sw fix x y m 3 starting from the above determinants eq 2 reports the unit average cost function at time t given by the unit tariff t m3 which depends on the cumulated irrigation volume in the previous time steps of the irrigation season t 1 added to the fixed costs charged by the irrigation board for the access to the sw supply facilities c sw fix the variability of i t and c sw fix with space is introduced to identify a specific farm in the study region with its irrigated cropping area which are associated to the fixed cost the tariff t is based on blocks which are variable from year to year depending on the hydrological state of the reservoirs feeding the collective water scheme and is designed to discourage farmers uptake from the cbc network when the first block threshold is exceeded this is due to the fact that cbc allocation is planned for an equal share of 2050 m3 to each irrigated hectare in the served area the rates per block increase as the time evolution of the reservoir storage during ordinary irrigation seasons often turns to water scarcity conditions except when extraordinary precipitation in the late spring changes this tendency during drought years the scarcity pricing approach is much more restrictive in terms of unit water costs and block thresholds the gw and sw cost functions described above were used during a second round of semi structured interviews with both farmers and cbc managers to support a systematic analysis based on climatic data and cropping pattern variability aiming to define robust relationships between water demand patterns and water accessibility perception over a 20 year period the evidences are reported in the form of a quantitative model scheme putting together farmers decision modes water managers rules and their combined effects on groundwater storage variability in the long term fig 2 in practice the proposed model scheme has been developed taking into account different sub models ranging from hydrological drivers to decision rules and their ultimate impacts of the gw stock which is considered as an overall sustainability indicator of the gw sw conjunctive use the following paragraphs provide a more detailed analysis of the single sub models of the global model plotted in fig 2 in case of conjunctive use of sw and gw resources particular attention was given to the analysis of farmers behavior with respect to water supply for irrigation which was found to be sensitive to some technical and economic factors such as gw depth and water pricing scheme as well as the standards of the irrigation service the conjunctive use of gw wells is first complementary and then becomes substitutive for the sake of simplicity the wss model adopts a territorial approach to integrate the choice model with the water balance model of the sw reservoir and the underground resource which are territorial by nature the determinant variable of the wss model is defined as the unit cost ratio cr x y t between sw cost x y t and gw cost x y t the following eq 3 defines the fraction of the irrigation demand satisfied from surface water supply and is characterized by a decreasing quadratic trend to simulate farmers decision to progressively switch from sw to gw during the irrigation season as the increasing block tariff drives to less convenient unit water price the wss model equation has the following structure eq 3 3 sw sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 cr 2 2 cr m sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 cr sw m cr m 2 sw m sw m cr m cr m 2 where sw m is the sw value when cr is minimal i e when sw cost is minimal conversely sw m is the sw value when cr is maximum i e when sw cost is the highest compared to a steady low gw cost similarly given gw cost at a given time and location cr m is the value of cr when sw cost is minimal and cr m is the value of cr when sw cost is maximum the quadratic function is therefore used firstly to represent some degree of variability in the behavior of different farmers with their peculiarities secondly the function allows simulating the marked reduction in withdrawals from the cbc when the first threshold is exceeded the wss function is represented in fig 3 considering a continuous increase of cr this functional form was built starting from the interviews with the famers but it has been quantitatively validated with a comparison with the reservoir water balance as explained in the following section as such the wss function reflects the attitude of farmers to prefer groundwater source gw with respect to surface water sw as the sw cost gets higher i e with an increasing cr representing the effects of gw depth as well as of sw pricing scheme in combination with the irrigation need of a given farm during the irrigation season as such sw supply is preferred over gw pumping until their cost ratio cr is below 2 5 another key driver for irrigation cost assessment at farm scale is obviously the crop water demand which is variable on a seasonal and inter annual basis mainly according to climate variability cropping extension and patterns and irrigation techniques similarly at the district scale the size of irrigated land and cropping patterns are among the major determinants of irrigation water needs and consequently of water resources exploitation at basin scale to account for cropping pattern changes over time a specific subset of representative crops was selected crops having higher water requirement and or covering a wider area were only taken into account with their temporal variabilities according to data by the italian statistical service namely processing tomatoes 19 000 30 000 ha grapes 28 500 44 200 ha olives 52 500 55 000 ha peaches 2800 4400 ha and vegetables 2200 3100 ha the annual irrigation requirements i rrd were estimated accordingly for the main crops in the study area using cropwat by fao allen et al 1998 for the investigated period and compared to those provided by cbc irrigation advise and a few interviews with farmers dated 2017 table 2 spatially averaged soil hydraulic properties were considered for the irrigation requirement estimation while the efficiency of the irrigation systems was estimated considering drip irrigation efficiency set to 0 9 with an additional reduction coefficient applied to take into account both deficit irrigation techniques e g for olives and the practice of reducing irrigated areas to have higher unit water volumes available from the sw system all these parameterizations were based on farmers interviews and allowed predicting the consumptive water use starting from the agronomic irrigation requirement estimated through cropwat throughout the period of interest fig 4 overall annual irrigation requirement is compared in the same figure to sw irrigation supply resulting from the reservoir monthly water balance calculations 2 4 aquifer water balance conceptual model to jointly analyze the dynamics of groundwater volume and irrigation water uses a conceptual water balance model of the study area has been implemented guyennon et al 2016 for the period of interest the water balance of the aquifer system fig 2 was evaluated applying a lumped conceptual scheme to the groundwater reservoir as a whole under the effect of variable irrigation practices and reservoir management rules the input terms are the following a the irrigation demand related to the variability of climate and cropping pattern b the available surface water stock and consequent supply management rules c the groundwater recharge computed by the gmat monthly soil water balance model portoghese et al 2005 d the monthly groundwater abstractions from individual on farm wells estimated using the wss model e the groundwater outflow as discharge to sea and baseflow to the river network whose monthly rate is assumed to be proportional under the linear reservoir hypothesis to the volume stored in the aquifer guyennon et al 2016 the historical records of climate and cropping patterns were included in the implemented model allowing to estimate the variability of groundwater balance as a lumped stock and flow system this simplified approach compared to other physically based distributed gw models allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of gw storage to climate and sw tariff variations including other variations in crops and water management models 3 results 3 1 parameterization and validation of the wss function the present study was performed over a 20 years period 1993 2012 for which most of the needed datasets were available namely i climate information reporting two drought events with severe deficit of the sw collective supply followed by above average rainfall years ii a concurrent hydrological dataset including the reservoir water balance and gw table measurements iii time series of the cropping patterns for the whole basin referring both to the district area equipped with the cbc network and to the outside area during this period large areal variations mostly due to the cap reform implementation between 2000 and 2009 were observed for both durum wheat between 282 000 ha in 2002 and 165 000 ha in 2011 and for processing tomato between 30 000 ha in 2000 and 19 000 ha in 2012 as well as for the other crop types for which an adjustment toward more profitable productions was observed zingaro et al 2017 following the cbc decision rule detailed in section 2 2 the sw pricing scheme from year to year was defined according to the volume stored in the reservoir in march when the wet season is almost over considering the marked climate variability of the investigated region 4 different pricing schemes were adopted during period 1993 2012 which correspond to distinct cr patterns the block tariff thresholds commonly observed during the study period are reported in fig 5 together with the cr steps for different gw depths shallow average and deep i e respectively 20 m 40 m and 70 m for the case study application in the capitanata plain the parameters of the wss function were defined according to the discrete tariff thresholds of the sw tariff plans and gw unit average costs corresponding to an average dynamic depth of the water table around 40 m in case of regular climatic and hydrologic conditions when the reservoir is full and the irrigation season can be operated normally starting from swm 0 9 the wss function predicts step wise decreases in sw reliance according to the increasing sw unit cost as the seasonally cumulated irrigation exceed the bwa however in case of years with limited water availability i e 2000 2007 and 2008 sw is accessed up to the bwa and then sw supply is thus drastically reduced fig 5 with swm 0 05 as the unit sw cost becomes unaffordable as such the parameterized wss function allows to simulate the source selection criteria depending on the irrigation demand and tariff thresholds and to quantify the growing preference for groundwater source gw during the irrigation season when the sw cost becomes less convenient fig 6a the validation of the wss model was performed by comparing the simulated irrigation supply from sw facilities with the overall uptake volume operated by the cbc for irrigation purposes fig 6c measured monthly uptake values were modified considering a conveyance efficiency of 87 guyennon et al 2016 to take into account water losses in the pressurized network the results of this comparison show a good agreement r2 0 91 see fig 6c proving a reliable reconstruction of farmers allocation from both sw and gw under different tariff and or climate conditions 3 2 modeled irrigation water balance in conjunctive sw gw allocation schemes the wss model was validated for the period 1993 2012 through the dataset collected in zingaro et al 2017 related to the cropping pattern variability along with the climate records and the reservoir water budgets starting from the monthly time series of cropwat irrigation requirements i rrd the wss model allowed estimating monthly gw abstraction cumulated over the entire district as well as sw uptake volumes from the reservoir during each month of the irrigation season spatially averaged cr values were set as input to wss function yielding gw and sw over the whole district area simulated monthly time series of sw and gw uptakes are plotted in fig 7 along with sw uptakes derived from the reservoir operation record for the same period clearly sw exploitation resulted variable according to reservoir storage and consequent volumetric tariff adjustments in both simulated and observed sw uptakes under the extreme conditions of failure in the ws storage i e 2001 and 2002 the model correctly satisfied the irrigation needs solely through gw uptake similarly higher gw exploitation mean gw 76 was estimated in years with reduced reservoir storage i e 2000 2007 and 2008 while under regular climatic and hydrological conditions lower pressure on gw resources is estimated mean gw 40 with sw supply system assuring 60 of the district irrigation demand 3 3 impacts of water pricing and irrigation demand on gw storage dynamics although gw protection is out of the scope of cbc water management strategy the level of tapping into the gw is 56 on average in conjunctive use areas while in extreme drought years and outside the cbc collective service area farmers rely on gw extraction to cover 100 of their irrigation needs the validation of gw component in the overall model scheme in fig 2 was provided in terms of monthly gw storage volume guyennon et al 2016 using gw records from the regional monitoring network passarella et al 2017 water table depth measurements from the 55 monitoring wells were adopted as representative of the entire aquifer domain and then converted into estimates of gw storage fig 8 for each gw campaign covering the period 2001 2009 point measurements were scaled by the effective porosity and then summarized using box whisker plots the comparison between simulated and observation based gw storage variability substantially proves the good performance of the overall modeling chain fig 8 despite the temporal stationarity of rainfall during the study period which included severe drought episodes in 2001 2002 and 2008 followed by wet years with full recovery of rainfall deficits a permanent loss in gw volume of about 20 was observed at the end of the period in other terms the negative impacts of drought years on gw storage are emphasized by the concurrent reduced gw recharge and increased withdrawal this mechanism is clearly driven by climatic variability and irrigation demand patterns but on the other side accessibility to sw and gw resources may indeed have an important role to test the sensitivity of gw balance simulations to climate and water tariff variations a few scenarios were defined by altering the adopted time series table 3 in particular the effects on gw storage due to cbc pricing policy were evaluated by adopting a 50 increase in sw tariffs s1 while the effect of climate on gw storage was investigated by a 10 reduction on precipitation s2 furthermore the s1 water pricing scenario was combined with the climate scenario s2 in the combined s3 scenario for each of the three scenarios the trends of gw volumes are presented in the following fig 9 with the aim of highlighting the differences between scenarios in terms of impacts on gw storage with respect to the s0 condition which corresponds to the historical baseline more specifically the first two scenarios respectively the 50 increase of water pricing levels s1 and the climate induced decrease in gw recharge s2 were found to yield quite similar results on the dynamic of gw storage so that they could be associated to an almost equivalent impact i e an overall 25 reduction of the gw stock compared to the baseline s0 in 20 years in other words according to this modeling study farmers are expected to react to the increase of sw prices by increasing gw exploitation thus causing similar impacts on gw quantitative state as those caused by a 10 reduction in precipitation consequently the worst but not totally unlikely scenario resulting from the combination of s1 and s2 namely the scenario s3 is expected to cause a 67 reduction on gw storage in about 20 years overall these scenario simulations have further demonstrated the capability of the adopted modeling scheme to investigate the combined effects of climate variations farmers choices and management rules on the sustainability of gw resources 4 discussion the present work argues that a sustainable management of water resources in complex socio hydrological contexts needs a thorough analysis of water exploitation mechanisms including the potential side effects that irrigation water pricing strategies might have on water source selection and use a wss function is built for the purpose in a system with a conjunctive use of sw and gw considering both the gw pumping cost and the sw collective tariff with specific reference to the proposed case study the capitanata area both qualitative and quantitative evidences suggest that the sw is preferred over gw until the cost ratio cr of 2 5 is exceeded and that a relevant exploitation of gw occurs ranging from 56 on average in conjunctive use areas to 100 in drought years and outside the cbc collective service area results feed a water balance model which highlights through a scenario analysis performed in different climate and sw pricing conditions the occurrence of potentially unsustainable conditions for the system evidence is specifically provided of the potential onset of side effects in terms of gw overexploitation as a consequence of the implementation of specific sw water pricing strategies the activities contribute to provide an answer to the specific research questions raised in the introduction first of all concerning the role of irrigation water pricing on the farmers decisions related to water source selection and use although it is well known that water policies could be a valuable option to affect the users behavior and to improve efficiency it should be carefully considered that they may have unintended consequences and side effects for example with specific reference to the case study the sw pricing policies implemented in drought years by the irrigation board which are meant to allocate scarce water volume may rather drive farmers towards a potential overexploitation of gw resources through individual on farm wells there are both qualitative i e from semi structured individual interviews and quantitative evidences i e data related to sw supply confirming this during a production season the proposed work provides a solid description of these results although it should be highlighted that the system is characterized by a high complexity which cannot be fully unraveled by the model just to make an example the market conditions which are indirectly taken into account through the crop pattern and therefore the irrigation requirements as well as the farm size type are also relevant issues of farmers decisions and could have a significant impact on the selection of a specific water source secondly the information collected regarding water use and the process of source selection has been structured in a quantitative wss function which models the economic convenience driving farmers either towards sw or gw under specific conditions during a given irrigation season this function has been then included in an aquifer balance model in order to quantitatively assess the potential effect of sw collective pricing strategies and gw variable cost on the state of gw resources despite the mentioned model assumptions the impact of sw collective pricing strategies on the overexploitation of gw resources particularly during dry years clearly emerges this may drive the system along with other issues such as the effects of climate change towards unsustainable conditions additional efforts are needed however in exploring the effects of other policies e g supporting crop change that can be implemented along with or instead of pricing strategies producing better systemic effects lastly one of the key general evidences from the modeling process and from the scenario analysis is that in such complex socio hydrological systems the implementation of specific sectoral actions and strategies may have unintended consequences on the system as a whole understanding the side effects e g of a restrictive sw pricing policy on gw uptake is not straightforward but definitely relevant at a strategic level the model despite the needed assumptions and simplifications could help decision makers dealing with a complex issues such as irrigation water management in a more systemic way results can be used to support raising the awareness regarding the potential multiple effects that policies and strategies may have on the system as a whole and drive towards the selection of effective solutions although the evidences from the specific case study may allow drawing some general considerations and conclusions on the different effects of water pricing strategies on irrigation systems additional efforts are needed to replicate a similar approach in other contexts and in even more complex conditions 5 conclusions the present work proposes an insight into the issue of sustainable water resources use for irrigation considering a district with both sw and gw availability collective and individual on farm services respectively the focus is specifically on the influence that variable costs for irrigation water can have on source selection during the irrigation season an intuitive wss function to describe water source selection is built to formally reflect the evidences of the interviews as well as the data series of all relevant variables thet takes jointly into account the crop water demand along with the average gw pumping cost and the sw collective tariff with its variation in different hydrological conditions based on the wss function gw balance simulations are performed in different scenarios showing potential unsustainable conditions although the model in its current form provides a simplification of some dynamics results highlight the relevance of systemic approaches for an effective and sustainable management of gw resources and the need to take into account the multiple interactions among decision makers physical systems policies and local conditions in this direction the role of the proposed model could be highly relevant to understand system evolution and to explicitly consider potential side effects or unintended consequences of actions mainly in a threefold direction i providing indications on the impacts of possible changes in the sw tariff system ii identifying potential tipping points for the gw system under specific climatic and resources use conditions iii providing a structured support for the identification of suitable policies for an integrated sw and gw management future research activities will follow these research

10341,the information of reference evapotranspiration et0 is vital for optimizing irrigation scheduling planning water resources and assessing hydrological drought however accurate estimation of et0 is difficult if long term or complete climatic variables are unavailable especially in developing countries like china this study proposed a novel hybrid extreme gradient boosting xgb model with the whale optimization algorithm woa to estimate daily et0 at four stations in the arid region and four stations in the humid region of china particularly its performances were evaluated under the local and three external scenarios with seven incomplete combinations of maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin relative humidity rh wind speed u2 relative sunshine duration n n and extra terrestrial radiation ra for the period 1966 2015 the results showed that u2 was the most influencing variable for daily et0 estimation in the arid region followed by n n and rh while n n was more important than rh and u2 in the humid region locally trained and tested woa xgb models greatly outperformed their corresponding simplified fao 56 pm models with the average decrease in root mean square error rmse by 40 1 and 38 9 in the arid and humid regions respectively compared with local woa xgb models the prediction accuracy of externally trained woa xgb models with local or external testing data decreased by 18 1 or 69 9 in the arid region and 16 8 or 67 9 in the humid region respectively however external woa xgb models with synthetic testing data from the target and adjacent stations overall improved the prediction accuracy of local woa xgb models by 5 7 and 9 6 in the arid and humid regions respectively the results indicated that external woa xgb models with local testing data produced acceptable daily et0 estimates however when synthetic data were employed during testing external woa xgb models gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were comparable to or even better than local woa xgb models this is a promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily et0 when lack of long term historical or complete recent data graphical abstract ga1 keywords reference evapotranspiration extreme gradient boosting whale optimization algorithm cross station fao 56 penman monteith 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc refers to the loss of water to the atmosphere through evaporation from soil and vegetation surfaces and transpiration of plant leaves allen et al 1998 yan et al 2017 etc is a critical parameter to determine crop water requirement which is crucial for designing irrigation scheduling and efficiently managing agricultural water resources koudahe et al 2018 wu et al 2019a particularly at the semi arid locations with water resources shortage and limited or uneven rainfall allen et al 1998 although etc can be monitored by ventilated chambers zhang et al 2018 weighing lysimeters liu et al 2017 rafi et al 2019 and eddy covariance systems paw u et al 1995 suvočarev et al 2019 baldocchi 2020 the installation and maintenance of those equipment are expensive and difficult and the measurements are also not applicable at various temporal and spatial scales these largely restrict their applications in agricultural production especially in developing countries like china alternatively etc can be calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 with seasonal crop coefficients kc as per the recommendations of the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 jamshidi et al 2020 kc represents the ratio of etc to et0 and is determined by the crop canopy characteristics and environmental factors allen et al 1998 et0 is defined as the evapotranspiration et of a hypothesized reference grass with plant height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the process based fao 56 penman monteith model fao 56 pm explicitly considers both the physiological and aerodynamical parameters which is worldwide recommended as a universal standard method to calculate et0 and calibrate other et0 models due to its good accuracy under various climatic conditions gao et al 2017 djaman et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 as per allen et al 1998 the meteorological variables influencing the evapotranspiration process mainly include global solar radiation rs ambient temperature tmax and tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 however there is a major drawback of the fao 56 pm model that is it needs large amounts of climatic variables the installation and maintenance of automatic weather stations can be expensive and complex exner kittridge and rains 2010 valiantzas 2015 and the widespread use of this model has been thus greatly limited particularly in developing countries shiri 2017 yamaç and todorovic 2020 córdova et al 2015 koudahe et al 2018 djaman et al 2019 therefore several empirical and semi empirical models using fewer meteorological variables have been developed for estimating et0 e g temperature based models ahooghalandari et al 2016 hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based models droogers and allen 2002 priestley and taylor 1972 valiantzas 2013 and mass transfer type models shiri 2018 valipour 2014 in addition et0 can be determined by the fao 56 pm equation with estimated meteorological variables when the observed data are missing as recommended by the fao djaman et al 2019 sentelhas et al 2010 venancio et al 2019 nevertheless these models are most suitable for estimating weekly and monthly et0 but not effective on a daily scale fan et al 2018a therefore developing models for estimating daily et0 from fewer meteorological variables with adequate accuracy is essentially necessary et0 is a complicated and non linear phenomenon which is considered to be a function of several meteorological variables negm et al 2018 althoff et al 2019 wang et al 2019 l zhang et al 2019 x zhang et al 2019 yamaç and todorovic 2020 with advancements in computational resources and emerging artificial intelligence and data mining researchers have applied machine learning models in et0 estimation to improve its estimation accuracy in data limited regions as a result of their outstanding performances for modeling the non linear relations of et0 and its driving factors such as artificial neural networks

more economical and less time consuming methodologies are very important when using machine learning techniques for et0 estimation yamaç and todorovic 2020 recently a novel and efficient tree based machine learning model i e extreme gradient boosting xgb was proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 the xgb model weights and superimpose all the weak classifiers for creating strong classifiers the estimation error thus greatly decreases and the classification result with better prediction accuracy can be attained jia et al 2019 it is capable of preventing the model from over fitting during training and cutting down the computational costs by automated parallel computation it is a widespread and efficient gradient boosting system for data mining in various fields zhang et al 2018a guo et al 2019 jia et al 2019 nobre and neves 2019 yu 2019 zhang 2019 zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2021 and it has also been used to estimate daily et0 for instance fan et al 2018a evaluated the performances of xgb models in predicting daily et0 from various meteorological combinations the results showed that the xgb model exhibited similar performance to the kernel based svm and elm models with regard to model accuracy and stability while the computational time was significantly reduced wu et al 2019a compared the capability of the xgb model in modeling monthly mean daily et0 in the jiangxi province of china using tmax tmin and ra and indicated the proposed model yielded better monthly et0 estimates than the other models in local applications therefore the xgb model is suitable for daily et0 estimation in data limited regions considering its satisfactory accuracy stability and low computation costs accurate estimation of et0 is still difficult when long term or complete climatic variables are unavailable especially in developing countries like china nowadays it is increasingly popular to use climatic data from the adjacent weather station or composite data from multiple weather stations for estimating et0 at the target station lu et al 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 shiri 2018 shiri et al 2019 valiantzas 2015 wu et al 2019b pasupa and thamwiwatthana 2013 indicated that the costs of sensor installations would increase when the crop field size was very large and it was necessary to take existing climatic data at the nearby station to estimate et0 and improve the data utilization efficiency when lack of long term historical climatic data supplementing data from the adjacent stations can be effective in estimating et0 at a station of interests fan et al 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 feng et al 2017 explored two soft computing models to estimate daily et0 with local or external ambient temperatures and the extra terrestrial radiation data they found that this approach worked well in various climatic zones however valiantzas 2015 reported that the site specific models could not be necessarily applicable elsewhere with various climates the application of machine learning models trained by local dataset in other areas with similar climates may also yield large uncertainties huang et al 2019 wu et al 2019b in order to improve the estimation accuracy of et0 using external data many researchers have tried to test the performances of soft computing models under external application scenarios fan et al 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 shiri et al 2019 shiri et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 assessed the performance of the gep model in estimating et0 in the coastal environment of iran they argued that the accuracy difference of local and cross station models largely depended on the meteorological characteristics of the target station and the meteorological inputs the proposed gep model did not need to be trained when large amounts of meteorological variables were accessible at other locations karimi et al 2017 investigated the performances of gep and svm models in estimating et0 in humid areas of south korea and found that both models could fulfill the task using meteorological data from ancillary stations mehdizadeh 2018 revealed that the mars model was superior to the gep model in estimating daily et0 in iran and the performances of external models confirmed the results obtained from the local models feng et al 2017 used the rfs and grnn models to estimate daily et0 in the sichuan province of china under cross station scenarios and identified that both models were capable of accurately estimating et0 in this region wu et al 2019a compared the capability of several soft computing algorithms for modeling monthly et0 using tmax tmin and ra at fifteen sites in a humid area of china the results indicated that the mars svm and knea models obtained more accurate et0 estimates than the other models when using air temperatures from nearby stations overall machine learning models with various meteorological combinations under local and external scenarios showed diverse performances in various climatic regions the xgb model has multiple parameters than other widely applied soft computing models such as ann and svm models there are still problems in tuning parameters while the parameter optimization of the xgb model for daily et0 prediction has not been reported yet in addition to the authors knowledge there is a lack of comprehensive comparison between the local model and various external models in predicting daily et0 under various meteorological combinations especially their performances in distinct climatic regions the appropriate strategies for estimating daily et0 at a station lack of historical or complete meteorological data have not been reported yet particularly across china and other developing countries therefore the aims of this study were to 1 proposed a hybrid xgb model with a novel bio inspired algorithm i e the whale optimization algorithm woa for accurate estimation of daily et0 at eight stations in the arid and humid regions of china with limited climatic variables and compare its performances to the simplified fao 56 pm models under various meteorological combinations 2 further evaluate the performances of the proposed woa xgb model for estimating daily et0 under three external scenarios that is the woa xgb model was trained with various meteorological data from the adjacent station by assuming no long term historical or complete recent data were available at the target station while the trained model was further applied to estimate daily et0 at a station with meteorological data i from the target station ii from the adjacent station and ⅲ from both target and adjacent stations respectively this study can provide a promising strategy for more accurately estimating daily et0 in data limited regions especially when lacking historical or complete data 2

meteorological combinations and model scenarios 2 4 1 fao 56 pm model for calculating daily et0 with complete meteorological data the fao 56 pm model recommended by allen et al 1998 was used to calculate daily et0 with complete meteorological data at each of the eight weather stations in the arid and humid regions which provided the reference data for testing the simplified fao 56 pm and woa xgb models due to the absence of experimental et0 data detailed calculation procedures can be found in allen et al 1998 2 4 2 simplified fao 56 pm models for estimating daily et0 with incomplete meteorological data to explore the influences of various input variables on the estimation of daily et0 and further verify the applicability of the proposed woa xgb model and the strategies for

fao 56 pm models and data during 2006 2015 were used for model testing when relative humidity data were missing actual vapor pressure ea was estimated based on tmax and tmin as follows 9 e a 0 611 exp

trained using various local meteorological data from 1966 to 2005 and tested using local data during 2006 2015 three external woa xgb models were also developed where meteorological data from the adjacent station arid region station 51365 station 51367 station 51573 station 51581 humid region station 57574 station 57581 station 58519 station 58606 were used to train the woa xgb model assuming long term historical climatic variables were unavailable at a weather station while the trained woa xgb model was further tested with climatic variables 1 from the target station assuming recent climatic records were accessible 2 from the adjacent station assuming no accessible climatic variables at all at the target station and 3 from both the target and adjacent stations by replacing the missing data at the target station with those from the adjacent station to ensure a complete meteorological input fig 2 gives an example scheme showing the applications of local and external woa xgb

and three external woa xgb models for estimating daily et0 with various meteorological variables in the arid and humid regions of china are presented in fig 4 overall the external woa xgb model with adjacent testing data performed worst among the models in both the arid rmse 0 554 0 986 mm d 1 and humid 0 526 0 820 mm d 1 regions followed by the corresponding simplified fao 56 pm model with rmse ranging 0 262 1 340 mm d 1 and 0 411 0 870 mm d 1 in the arid and humid regions respectively the local woa xgb model showed satisfying daily et0 estimates in the arid rmse 0 139 0 626 mm d 1 and humid rmse 0 159 0 676 mm d 1 regions which was superior to the external xgb model with local testing data with rmse ranging 0 128 0 756 mm d 1 and 0 234 0 662 mm d 1 in the arid and humid regions respectively among all the models the external xgb model tested with combined local and external data performed best arid rmse 0 132 0 602 mm d 1 humid 0 159 0 527 mm d 1 which was comparable to or even slightly outperformed the local woa xgb model relative to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of local woa xgb and three external woa xgb models increased by 40 1 29 3 1 7 and 43 6 in terms of average rmse in the arid region while the corresponding values were 38 9 28 6 2 6 and 44 8 in the humid region respectively the scatter plots of the fao 56 pm et0 and estimated et0 by the local and three external woa xgb models with various meteorological variables at two representative stations in the arid station 51581 and humid station 58606 regions of china are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen from the figures that the local woa xgb model and the external xgb model with both local and external testing data generally showed less scattered points than the other two models further highlighting the superiority of these two models 4 discussion 4 1 influences of various climatic variables on daily et0 estimation in the arid and humid regions of china the type of the meteorological variables have great impact on the estimation accuracy of simplified fao 56 pm local and external woa xgb models for predicting daily et0 in both the arid and humid regions the simplified fao 56 pm and woa xgb models generally performed worst when only ambient temperature and extra terrestrial radiation data were available in the arid and humid regions this means that models with only temperature data would yield undesirable daily et0 estimates but these data are most widely available around the world feng et al 2017 sanikhani et al 2019 therefore the local woa xgb model or the external model with combined local and external testing data produced acceptable et0 values at sites lack of other climatic data like u2 rh and rs or n previous studies have indicated that more meteorological inputs overall improved the estimation accuracy of empirical and soft computing models for of daily et0 estimation feng et al 2017 fan et al 2018a but this is not the case all the time the estimation accuracy of et0 is largely determined by the type rather than the number of input data as the contributions of various climatic parameters on et0 estimation can vary in different climates or regions in this study models with wind speed generally performed better than the other meteorological combinations in the arid region even better than those with sunshine duration highlighting the significance of wind speed in the aird region however models with sunshine duration were overall superior to those with the other meteorological variables indicating that sunshine duration was more important in the humid region models with ambient temperature and wind speed outperformed those with ambient temperature and relative humidity in the arid region and vice versa in the humid region these indicated that wind speed exhibited a more influential effect on the estimation of daily et0 than relative humidity in the arid region while relative humidity was more important than wind speed in the humid region except air temperature the importance of meteorological variables for estimating daily et0 followed the order u2 n n rh in the arid region and n n rh u2 in the humid region this result generally agreed with the study of fan et al 2018a who found that n or rs was more influential compared with rh and u2 for estimating daily et0 across the sub tropical areas of china and vice versa in the other regions 4 2 performance of the woa algorithm optimized xgb model for predicting daily et0 when the same meteorological variables were used at a station the local woa xgb model performed much better than the corresponding simplified fao 56 pm model compared to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of the local woa xgb model increased by 40 1 and 38 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid and humid regions respectively this highlighted the excellence of the woa xgb model for mapping the complex and nonlinear relationships between et0 and its driving variables the superiority of machine learning models over empirical models for estimating et0 has been extensively reported especially the hybrid models with bio inspired or pre processing algorithms fan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 for instance ozkan et al 2011 explored the hybrid ann model with the artificial bee colony abc algorithm for estimating daily et0 and found it was superior alternative to the classical back propagation ann model shiri 2018 coupled the rfs algorithm with wavelet transform for estimating et0 and found that the proposed wrf model showed better estimation accuracy than the standalone rfs model kisi and alizamir 2018 investigated the capability of hybrid elm model with the wavelet transform algorithm welm for estimating daily et0 it was found that the proposed welm model outperformed the wavelet ann elm online sequential elm and ann models in the present study a novel woa algorithm was first time used to optimize the xgb model due to the optimization of the woa algorithm the estimation accuracy of the conventional xgb model has been improved data not shown here relative to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of local woa xgb model increased by 40 1 and 38 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid and humid regions respectively despite the xgb model is sensitive to outliers and extreme values and difficult to scale up these results indicate that the proposed woa xgb model is a promising approach to estimate daily et0 in the arid and humid regions of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates 4 3 comparison of local and external woa xgb models for estimating daily et0 the local woa xgb model showed slightly better daily et0 estimates than the external woa xgb model with local testing data but it was much better than the external woa xgb model with adjacent testing data however due to the meteorological data complement by the adjacent station the external woa xgb model with combined local and external data generally produced comparable or slightly better daily et0 estimates than the local woa xgb model compared with the local woa xgb model the prediction accuracy of the external woa xgb models with local or external data decreased by 18 1 or 69 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid region and 16 8 or 67 9 in the humid region respectively even though the complete meteorological variables n n tmax tmin ra rh and u2 form the adjacent station were used in the external woa xgb model during testing undesirable daily et0 estimates were obtained these results were comparable to or even worse than those of the local woa xgb model with only tmax tmin ra data when no local data were available at all the woa xgb models developed and tested with data from the external station also gave comparable daily et0 estimates to those of the simplified fao 56pm model in despite of low accuracy this indicated that the application of external woa xgb model with external testing data was highly undesirable for the estimation of daily et0 however the woa xgb model can produce satisfactory daily et0 estimates using the external woa xgb model with local testing data when long term history variables were unavailable at a station shiri et al 2013 used the anfis model for estimating et0 across two areas in iran and argued that global cross station models trained using both the non humid and humid data successfully estimated et0 shiri et al 2015a 2015b explored the capability of locally and externally trained neuro fuzzy and neural networks models for estimating et0 and revealed that the external models were useful alternatives to the local models however the external woa xgb models with both the local and external data increased the estimation accuracy by 5 7 and 9 6 in the arid and humid regions respectively this is particularly significant because a suitable training of the woa xgb model requires the availability of historical data to ensure a suitable input output mapping which is always impossible at many worldwide locations due to data scarcity fan et al 2018a landeras et al 2018 wang et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 thus developing woa xgb models with data from an adjacent station is a promising strategy for estimating local et0 4 4 effects of replacing missing data by those from the adjacent station on daily et0 estimation when lack of complete climatic variables previous studies have mainly established machine learning models to estimate et0 based on limited local data or using complete data from cross stations if possible feng et al 2017 ferreira et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 yamaç and todorovic 2020 however a combination of local and external testing data for estimating et0 has not been reported yet as we mentioned earlier when the local meteorological data were combined with data from the adjacent station to ensure complete meteorological inputs the external woa xgb model gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were mostly comparable to or even better than those of the local woa xgb model this is a very promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily et0 especially when there is a lack of historical data or only limited local meteorological data are available however the effects of replacing various missing testing data by those from the adjacent station may differ in various climatic regions as shown in fig 4 although u2 was the most influencing factor for estimating daily et0 in the arid region the inclusion of u2 from the adjacent station did not improve or even worsened the estimation accuracy of the external woa xgb model while replacing the missing n n or rh by that from the adjacent station generally improved the estimation accuracy in the humid region the inclusion of n n from the adjacent station did not improve or even worsened the estimation accuracy of the external woa xgb model in spite of its significance on daily et0 estimation while replacing the missing rh or u2 by that from the adjacent station generally improved the estimation accuracy these indicated that u2 was more spatially variable than n and rh in the arid region while n was more spatially variable than n n and rh in the arid region therefore for the proposed strategy an adjacent station with similar climate to that of the target station has to be used to train the corresponding model the spatial and temporal variability of meteorological variables in a region has to be considered when incorporating external data for daily et0 estimation in the present study the three nearest stations among the stations within a radius of 150 km from the target station were first identified the station with the lowest arid index difference relative to the target station was then selected as the adjacent station in the external cases of shiri et al 2015a 2015b the nearest station among the stations within a radius of 350 km from the target station was first identified within an area of 120 km width from this station the station with the lowest wind speed difference relative to the target station was finally chosen as the adjacent station however lu et al 2018 recommended a distance less than 100 km between two adjacent stations to develop external models for estimating daily pan evaporation ep with satisfying prediction accuracy in a humid region of china therefore how to select a representative adjacent station is controversial and needs further investigation kiafar et al 2017 trained the gep model using the data from hyper arid humid stations and tested the model using data from humid hyper arid stations for daily et0 estimation and obtained satisfactory results in these hyper arid and humid regions however the external woa xgb models were assessed in the arid and humid regions separately in the present study and a testing of the woa xgb model with mixed data from both the arid and humid stations needs to be conducted in future studies 5 conclusions a novel hybrid extreme gradient boosting xgb model with the whale optimization algorithm woa was proposed to estimate daily et0 in the arid and humid regions of china under the local and three external scenarios the results revealed that the importance of meteorological variables for estimating daily et0 followed the order u2 n n rh in the arid region and n n rh u2 in the humid region local woa xgb models outperformed the corresponding simplified fao 56 pm models compared with local woa xgb models the estimation accuracy of external data trained woa xgb models with local or external testing data decreased however the external woa xgb model with combined local and external testing data improved the accuracy of local woa xgb models in the arid and humid regions the results indicated that the proposed woa xgb model trained with external data and tested with local data produced satisfactory daily et0 estimates however when synthetic data from the target and adjacent stations were used external woa xgb models gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were comparable to or even better than local woa xgb models this is a promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily

10341,the information of reference evapotranspiration et0 is vital for optimizing irrigation scheduling planning water resources and assessing hydrological drought however accurate estimation of et0 is difficult if long term or complete climatic variables are unavailable especially in developing countries like china this study proposed a novel hybrid extreme gradient boosting xgb model with the whale optimization algorithm woa to estimate daily et0 at four stations in the arid region and four stations in the humid region of china particularly its performances were evaluated under the local and three external scenarios with seven incomplete combinations of maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin relative humidity rh wind speed u2 relative sunshine duration n n and extra terrestrial radiation ra for the period 1966 2015 the results showed that u2 was the most influencing variable for daily et0 estimation in the arid region followed by n n and rh while n n was more important than rh and u2 in the humid region locally trained and tested woa xgb models greatly outperformed their corresponding simplified fao 56 pm models with the average decrease in root mean square error rmse by 40 1 and 38 9 in the arid and humid regions respectively compared with local woa xgb models the prediction accuracy of externally trained woa xgb models with local or external testing data decreased by 18 1 or 69 9 in the arid region and 16 8 or 67 9 in the humid region respectively however external woa xgb models with synthetic testing data from the target and adjacent stations overall improved the prediction accuracy of local woa xgb models by 5 7 and 9 6 in the arid and humid regions respectively the results indicated that external woa xgb models with local testing data produced acceptable daily et0 estimates however when synthetic data were employed during testing external woa xgb models gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were comparable to or even better than local woa xgb models this is a promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily et0 when lack of long term historical or complete recent data graphical abstract ga1 keywords reference evapotranspiration extreme gradient boosting whale optimization algorithm cross station fao 56 penman monteith 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration etc refers to the loss of water

requirement which is crucial for designing irrigation scheduling and efficiently managing agricultural water resources koudahe et al 2018 wu et al 2019a particularly at the semi arid locations with water resources shortage and limited or uneven rainfall allen et al 1998 although etc can be monitored by ventilated chambers zhang et al 2018 weighing lysimeters liu et al 2017 rafi et al 2019 and eddy covariance systems paw u et al 1995 suvočarev et al 2019 baldocchi 2020 the installation and maintenance of those equipment are expensive and difficult and the measurements are also not applicable at various temporal and spatial scales these largely restrict their applications in agricultural production especially in developing countries like china alternatively etc can be calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 with seasonal crop coefficients kc as per the recommendations of the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 jamshidi et al 2020 kc represents the ratio of etc to et0 and is determined by the crop canopy characteristics and environmental factors allen et al 1998 et0 is defined as the evapotranspiration et of a hypothesized reference grass with plant height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 the process based fao 56 penman monteith model fao 56 pm explicitly considers both the physiological and aerodynamical parameters which is worldwide recommended as a universal standard method to calculate et0 and calibrate other et0 models due to its good accuracy under various climatic conditions gao et al 2017 djaman et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 as per allen et al 1998 the meteorological variables influencing the evapotranspiration process mainly include global solar radiation rs ambient temperature tmax and tmin relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 however there is a major drawback of the fao 56 pm model that is it needs large amounts of climatic variables the installation and maintenance of automatic weather stations can be expensive and complex exner kittridge and rains 2010 valiantzas 2015 and the widespread use of this model has been thus greatly limited

priestley and taylor 1972 valiantzas 2013 and mass transfer type models shiri 2018 valipour 2014 in addition et0 can be determined by the fao 56 pm equation with estimated meteorological variables when the observed data are missing as recommended by the fao djaman et al 2019 sentelhas et al 2010 venancio et al 2019 nevertheless these models are most suitable for estimating weekly and monthly

more economical and less time consuming methodologies are very important when using machine learning techniques for et0 estimation yamaç and todorovic 2020 recently a novel and efficient tree based machine learning model i e extreme gradient boosting xgb was proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 the xgb model weights and superimpose all the weak classifiers for creating strong classifiers the estimation error thus greatly decreases and the classification result with better prediction accuracy can be attained jia et al 2019 it is capable of preventing the model from over fitting during training and cutting down the computational costs by automated parallel computation it is a widespread and efficient gradient boosting system for data mining in various fields zhang et al 2018a guo et al 2019 jia et al 2019 nobre and neves 2019 yu 2019 zhang 2019 zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2021 and it has also been used to estimate daily et0 for instance fan et al 2018a evaluated the performances of xgb models in predicting daily et0 from various meteorological combinations the results showed that the xgb model exhibited similar performance to the kernel based svm and elm models with regard to model accuracy and stability while the computational time was significantly reduced wu et al 2019a compared the capability of the xgb model in modeling monthly mean daily et0 in the jiangxi province of china using tmax tmin and ra and indicated the proposed model yielded better monthly et0 estimates than the other models in local applications therefore the xgb model is suitable for daily et0 estimation in data limited regions considering its satisfactory accuracy stability and low computation costs accurate estimation of et0 is still difficult when long term or complete climatic variables are unavailable especially in developing countries like china nowadays it is increasingly popular to use climatic data from the adjacent weather station or composite data from multiple weather stations for estimating et0 at the target station lu et al 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 shiri 2018 shiri et al 2019 valiantzas 2015 wu et al 2019b pasupa and thamwiwatthana 2013 indicated that the costs of sensor installations would increase when the crop field size was very large and it was necessary to take existing climatic data at the nearby station to estimate et0 and improve the data utilization efficiency when lack of long term historical climatic data supplementing data from the adjacent stations can be effective in estimating et0 at a station of interests fan et al 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 feng et al 2017 explored two soft computing models to estimate daily et0 with local or external ambient temperatures and the extra terrestrial radiation data they found that this approach worked well in various climatic zones however valiantzas 2015 reported that the site specific models could not be necessarily applicable elsewhere with various climates the application of machine learning models trained by local dataset in other areas with similar climates may also yield large uncertainties huang et al 2019 wu et al 2019b in order to improve the estimation accuracy of et0 using external data many researchers have tried to test the performances of soft computing models under external application scenarios fan et al 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 shiri et al 2019 shiri et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 assessed the performance of the gep model in estimating et0 in the coastal environment of iran they argued that the accuracy difference of local and cross station models largely depended on the meteorological characteristics of the target station and the meteorological inputs the proposed gep model did not need to be trained when large amounts of meteorological variables were accessible at other locations karimi et al 2017 investigated the performances of gep and svm models in estimating et0 in humid areas of south korea and found that both models could fulfill the task using meteorological data from ancillary stations mehdizadeh 2018 revealed that the mars model was superior to the gep model in estimating daily et0 in iran and the performances of external models confirmed the results obtained from the local models feng et al 2017 used the rfs and grnn models to estimate daily et0 in the sichuan province of china under cross station scenarios and identified that both models were capable of accurately estimating et0 in this region wu et al 2019a compared the capability of several soft computing algorithms for modeling monthly et0 using tmax tmin and ra at fifteen sites in a humid area of china the results indicated that the mars svm and knea models obtained more accurate et0 estimates than the other models when using air temperatures from nearby stations overall machine learning models with various meteorological combinations under local and external scenarios showed diverse performances in various climatic regions the xgb model has multiple parameters than other widely applied soft computing models such as ann and svm models there are still problems in tuning parameters while the parameter optimization of the xgb model for daily et0 prediction has not been reported yet in addition to the authors knowledge there is a lack of comprehensive comparison between the local model and various external models in predicting daily et0 under various meteorological combinations especially their performances in distinct climatic regions the appropriate strategies for estimating daily et0 at a station lack of historical or complete meteorological data have not been reported yet particularly across china and other developing countries therefore the aims of this study were to 1 proposed a hybrid xgb model with a novel bio inspired algorithm i e the whale optimization algorithm woa for accurate estimation of daily et0 at eight stations in the arid and humid regions of china with limited climatic variables and compare its performances to the simplified fao 56 pm models under various meteorological combinations 2 further evaluate the performances of the proposed woa xgb model for estimating daily et0 under three external scenarios that is the woa xgb model was trained with various meteorological data from the adjacent station by assuming no long term historical or complete recent data were available at the target station while the trained model was further applied to estimate daily et0 at a station with meteorological data i from the target station ii from the adjacent station and ⅲ from both target and adjacent stations respectively this study can provide a promising strategy for more accurately estimating daily et0 in data limited regions especially when lacking historical or complete data 2

n l y i y i k 1 t ω f i where l is the loss function n is the observation number and ω is the regularization term which is expressed as 3 ω f γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where ω is a score vector λ is a regularization parameter and γ is the mini loss the detailed information on the xgb model is given in chen and guestrin 2016 2 3 whale optimization algorithm woa the woa algorithm was developed by

meteorological combinations and model scenarios 2 4 1 fao 56 pm model for calculating daily et0 with complete meteorological data the fao 56 pm model recommended by allen et al 1998 was used to calculate daily et0 with complete meteorological data at each of the eight weather stations in the arid and humid regions which provided the reference data for testing the simplified fao 56 pm and woa

fao 56 pm models and data during 2006 2015 were used for model testing when relative humidity data were missing actual vapor pressure ea was estimated based on tmax and tmin as follows 9 e a 0 611 exp

rmse 0 159 0 676 mm d 1 regions which was superior to the external xgb model with local testing data with rmse ranging 0 128 0 756 mm d 1 and 0 234 0 662 mm d 1 in the arid and humid regions respectively among all the models the external xgb model tested with combined local and external data performed best arid rmse 0 132 0 602 mm d 1 humid 0 159 0 527 mm d 1 which was comparable to or even slightly outperformed the local woa xgb model relative to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of local woa xgb and three external woa xgb models increased by 40 1 29 3 1 7 and 43 6 in terms of average rmse in the arid region while the corresponding values were 38 9 28 6 2 6 and 44 8 in the humid region respectively the scatter plots of the fao 56 pm et0 and estimated et0 by the local and three external woa xgb models with various meteorological variables at two representative stations in the arid station 51581 and humid station 58606 regions of china are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively it can be seen from the figures that the local woa xgb model and the external xgb model with both local and external testing data generally showed less scattered points than the other two models further highlighting the superiority of these two models 4 discussion 4 1 influences of various climatic variables on daily et0 estimation in the arid and humid regions of china the type of the meteorological variables have great impact on the estimation accuracy of simplified fao 56 pm local and external woa xgb models for predicting daily et0 in both the arid and humid regions the simplified fao 56 pm and woa xgb models generally performed worst when only ambient temperature and extra terrestrial radiation data were available in the arid and humid regions this means that models with only temperature data would yield undesirable daily et0 estimates but these data are most widely available around the world feng et al 2017 sanikhani et al 2019 therefore the local woa xgb model or the external model with combined local and external testing data produced acceptable et0 values at sites lack of other climatic data like u2 rh and rs or n previous studies have indicated that more meteorological inputs overall improved the estimation accuracy of empirical and soft computing models for of daily et0 estimation feng et al 2017 fan et al 2018a but this is not the case all the time the estimation accuracy of et0 is largely determined by the type rather than the number of input data as the contributions of various climatic parameters on et0 estimation can vary in different climates or regions in this study models with wind speed generally performed better than the other meteorological combinations in the arid region even better than those with sunshine duration highlighting the significance of wind speed in the aird region however models with sunshine duration were overall superior to those with the other meteorological variables indicating that sunshine duration was more important in the humid region models with ambient temperature and wind speed outperformed those with ambient temperature and relative humidity in the arid region and vice versa in the humid region these indicated that wind speed exhibited a more influential effect on the estimation of daily et0 than relative humidity in the arid region while relative humidity was more important than wind speed in the humid region except air temperature the importance of meteorological variables for estimating daily et0 followed the order u2 n n rh in the arid region and n n rh u2 in the humid region this result generally agreed with the study of fan et al 2018a who found that n or rs was more influential compared with rh and u2 for estimating daily et0 across the sub tropical areas of china and vice versa in the other regions 4 2 performance of the woa algorithm optimized xgb model for predicting daily et0 when the same meteorological variables were used at a station the local woa xgb model performed much better than the corresponding simplified fao 56 pm model compared to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of the local woa xgb model increased by 40 1 and 38 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid and humid regions respectively this highlighted the excellence of the woa xgb model for mapping the complex and nonlinear relationships between et0 and its driving variables the superiority of machine learning models over empirical models for estimating et0 has been extensively reported especially the hybrid models with bio inspired or pre processing algorithms fan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 for instance ozkan et al 2011 explored the hybrid ann model with the artificial bee colony abc algorithm for estimating daily et0 and found it was superior alternative to the classical back propagation ann model shiri 2018 coupled the rfs algorithm with wavelet transform for estimating et0 and found that the proposed wrf model showed better estimation accuracy than the standalone rfs model kisi and alizamir 2018 investigated the capability of hybrid elm model with the wavelet transform algorithm welm for estimating daily et0 it was found that the proposed welm model outperformed the wavelet ann elm online sequential elm and ann models in the present study a novel woa algorithm was first time used to optimize the xgb model due to the optimization of the woa algorithm the estimation accuracy of the conventional xgb model has been improved data not shown here relative to the simplified fao 56 pm model the estimation accuracy of local woa xgb model increased by 40 1 and 38 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid and humid regions respectively despite the xgb model is sensitive to outliers and extreme values and difficult to scale up these results indicate that the proposed woa xgb model is a promising approach to estimate daily et0 in the arid and humid regions of china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates 4 3 comparison of local and external woa xgb models for estimating daily et0 the local woa xgb model showed slightly better daily et0 estimates than the external woa xgb model with local testing data but it was much better than the external woa xgb model with adjacent testing data however due to the meteorological data complement by the adjacent station the external woa xgb model with combined local and external data generally produced comparable or slightly better daily et0 estimates than the local woa xgb model compared with the local woa xgb model the prediction accuracy of the external woa xgb models with local or external data decreased by 18 1 or 69 9 in terms of average rmse in the arid region and 16 8 or 67 9 in the humid region respectively even though the complete meteorological variables n n tmax tmin ra rh and u2 form the adjacent station were used in the external woa xgb model during testing undesirable daily et0 estimates were obtained these results were comparable to or even worse than those of the local woa xgb model with only tmax tmin ra data when no local data were available at all the woa xgb models developed and tested with data from the external station also gave comparable daily et0 estimates to those of the simplified fao 56pm model in despite of low accuracy this indicated that the application of external woa xgb model with external testing data was highly undesirable for the estimation of daily et0 however the woa xgb model can produce satisfactory daily et0 estimates using the external woa xgb model with local testing data when long term history variables were unavailable at a station shiri et al 2013 used the anfis model for estimating et0 across two areas in iran and argued that global cross station models trained using both the non humid and humid data successfully estimated et0 shiri et al 2015a 2015b explored the capability of locally and externally trained neuro fuzzy and neural networks models for estimating et0 and revealed that the external models were useful alternatives to the local models however the external woa xgb models with both the local and external data increased the estimation accuracy by 5 7 and 9 6 in the arid and humid regions respectively this is particularly significant because a suitable training of the woa xgb model requires the availability of historical data to ensure a suitable input output mapping which is always impossible at many worldwide locations due to data scarcity fan et al 2018a landeras et al 2018 wang et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 thus developing woa xgb models with data from an adjacent station is a promising strategy for estimating local et0 4 4 effects of replacing missing data by those from the adjacent station on daily et0 estimation when lack of complete climatic variables previous studies have mainly established machine learning models to estimate et0 based on limited local data or using complete data from cross stations if possible feng et al 2017 ferreira et al 2019 sanikhani et al 2019 yamaç and todorovic 2020 however a combination of local and external testing data for estimating et0 has not been reported yet as we mentioned earlier when the local meteorological data were combined with data from the adjacent station to ensure complete meteorological inputs the external woa xgb model gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were mostly comparable to or even better than those of the local woa xgb model this is a very promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily et0 especially when there is a lack of historical data or only limited local meteorological data are available however the effects of replacing various missing testing data by those from the adjacent station may differ in various climatic regions as shown in fig 4 although u2 was the most influencing factor for estimating daily et0 in the arid region the inclusion of u2 from the adjacent station did not improve or even worsened the estimation accuracy of the external woa xgb model while replacing the missing n n or rh by that from the adjacent station generally improved the estimation accuracy in the humid region the inclusion of n n from the adjacent station did not improve or even worsened the estimation accuracy of the external woa xgb model in spite of its significance on daily et0 estimation while replacing the missing rh or u2 by that from the adjacent station generally improved the estimation accuracy these indicated that u2 was more spatially variable than n and rh in the arid region while n was more spatially variable than n n and rh in the arid region therefore for the proposed strategy an adjacent station with similar climate to that of the target station has to be used to train the corresponding model the spatial and temporal variability of meteorological variables in a region has to be considered when incorporating external data for daily et0 estimation in the present study the three nearest stations among the stations within a radius of 150 km from the target station were first identified the station with the lowest arid index difference relative to the target station was then selected as the adjacent station in the external cases of shiri et al 2015a 2015b the nearest station among the stations within a radius of 350 km from the target station was first identified within an area of 120 km width from this station the station with the lowest wind speed difference relative to the target station was finally chosen as the adjacent station however lu et al 2018 recommended a distance less than 100 km between two adjacent stations to develop external models for estimating daily pan evaporation ep with satisfying prediction accuracy in a humid region of china therefore how to select a representative adjacent station is controversial and needs further investigation kiafar et al 2017 trained the gep model using the data from hyper arid humid stations and tested the model using data from humid hyper arid stations for daily et0 estimation and obtained satisfactory results in these hyper arid and humid regions however the external woa xgb models were assessed in the arid and humid regions separately in the present study and a testing of the woa xgb model with mixed data from both the arid and humid stations needs to be conducted in future studies 5 conclusions a novel hybrid extreme gradient boosting xgb model with the whale optimization algorithm woa was proposed to estimate daily et0 in the arid and humid regions of china under the local and three external scenarios the results revealed that the importance of meteorological variables for estimating daily et0 followed the order u2 n n rh in the arid region and n n rh u2 in the humid region local woa xgb models outperformed the corresponding simplified fao 56 pm models compared with local woa xgb models the estimation accuracy of external data trained woa xgb models with local or external testing data decreased however the external woa xgb model with combined local and external testing data improved the accuracy of local woa xgb models in the arid and humid regions the results indicated that the proposed woa xgb model trained with external data and tested with local data produced satisfactory daily et0 estimates however when synthetic data from the target and adjacent stations were used external woa xgb models gave excellent daily et0 estimates which were comparable to or even better than local woa xgb models this is a promising strategy that allows more accurate estimation of daily

10342,rubber hevea brasiliensis plantations have been facing a double challenge of land degradation and seasonal drought in southeast asia various cash crops are recently interplanted with rubber trees to face these issues however the water relations between rubber trees and the intercrops remain poorly understood this study aims to evaluate the influences of three cash intercrops namely two herbaceous plants amomum villosum and alpinia oxyphylla and a woody beverage coffea arabica on rubber water utilization through both spatial and temporal scales we investigated the plant water absorption dynamics root biomass and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei throughout a whole year 2017 2018 the results showed that rubber trees 43 5 2 6 and intercrops 69 1 3 2 highly depended on soil water from the 0 20 cm depths an interspeciﬁc water competition occurred in all the rubber based agroforestry practices because of their similar water source and root distribution in the vertical soil

availability than the other intercrops suggesting its suitability as an intercrop for rubber trees alpinia oxyphylla a oxyphylla played a moderate role on soil water retention amomum a villosum however aggravated the soil water deﬁcit in the agroforestry practice given the differences in water relations to rubber trees the introduction of woody crops rather than herbaceous crops can improve the resistance of rubber plantation to the frequent drought stress in this region keywords agroforestry system interspeciﬁc competition root biomass soil moisture water utilization 1 introduction nowadays the south east asia region has become the largest latex production base in the world fox et al 2014 a widespread rubber hevea brasiliensis willd ex a juss muell arg monoculture has replaced 4 700 000 ha of natural ecosystems in this region li and fox 2012 zhang et al 2019 what is more it is predicted that the area of higher altitudes 600 m dedicated to rubber will double or triple by 2050 fox et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 this expansion of rubber monoculture is a main driving factor behind the severe land degradation in the uplands of china laos myanmar thailand and vietnam ziegler et al 2009 thus the rubber based agroforestry systems has been recently established to provide a promising solution for the sustainable development of rubber cultivation lin 2010 hammond et al 2017 chen et al 2019 these tree based systems are artificial farming practices of deliberately integrating trees with cash crops to benefit from the resulting ecological and economic interactions van noordwijk et al 2015 pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2017 xishuangbanna region is one of the major rubber planting areas in south east asia which has been currently experiencing a dramatic downward trend in fog frequency and stream flow due to the land cover transition liu et al 2007 tan et al 2011 different types of rubber agroforestry practices are implemented to balance the negative ecological consequences and the economic benefits iqbal et al 2006 snoeck et al 2013 smajgl et al 2015 these rubber crop agroforestry practices will make the maximum use of limited water resources during the drought periods schwendenmann et al 2010 with the potential to minimize water competition among the co occurring species nevertheless not all of the agroforestry practices have the same impact on the water utilization of rubber trees a strong interspecific competition for water resources can exist in the agroforestry practices carr and lockwood 2011 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and this competition may affect both the growth and latex yields of rubber trees in spite of the efforts over the last decades the evaluation of the trade offs between additional values and competition effects of intercrops on the main species remains very challenging to agro ecologists smajgl et al 2015 burgess et al 2019 to date most of the previous studies in xishuangbanna mainly focus on the effects of intercrops on controlling surface runoff soil erosion and soil nutrient loss in the rubber based agroforestry practices liu et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 stable isotopes of hydrogen δ 2h and oxygen δ 18o are commonly used to investigate the water soil plant relations in different ecosystems schwendenmann et al 2010 wu et al 2016 hardanto et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the underlying assumption is that xylem water of plants has no isotopic fractionation from soil water during the root water uptake process ehleringer and dawson 1992 based on the δ 2h and δ 18o in water pools wu et al 2016 found that rubber trees exhibit a relatively higher range of plasticity in depth of water uptake than the intercropped shrubs hardanto et al 2017 showed that rubber trees in the jungle stands take up water from deeper soil strata than in the monoculture the intercrops might also have both positive and negative impacts on the rubber trees intrinsic water use efficiency wuei depending on the intensity of water competition wu et al 2016 2019 it should be noticed that species mixtures with contrasting root patterns will explore larger soil volumes to improve the efficiency of water utilization van noordwijk et al 2015 therefore studies on the characteristics of root depth will give a better understanding of the water utilization in rubber agroforestry practices on the perspective of sustainable agriculture this study aims to characterize the water use strategies of rubber trees and three prevailing intercrops in xishuangbanna namely amomum amomum villosum lour alpinia oxyphylla alpinia oxyphylla miq and coffee coffea arabica l amomum a villosum is a perennial herbaceous plant species of zingiberaceae family and its seeds chinese medicine name sharen have medicinal values of anti inflammation and gastrointestinal protection wang et al 2018 alpinia oxyphylla a oxyphylla is also a perennial herb known for its medicinal properties for hundreds of years in southern china its fruits chinese medicine name yizhi have anti inflammatory effects on osteoarthritis lee et al 2019 the fruits of coffee c arabica can be used to produce a very popular beverage which have the potential to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases bitter et al 2020 the commonality of these intercrops is that they all exhibit good economic benefits and broad market prospects even so the successful application of these intercropping practices still relies on the knowledge of water relations between plants which remain poorly understood the main objective of this study is to characterize the water relations between rubber trees and the intercrops through both spatial vertical pattern and temporal seasonal pattern scales we hypothesized that 1 rubber trees would have more flexible water sources than the cash crops and 2 the wuei of rubber trees would be distinctly affected by the herbaceous and woody intercrops the findings of this study will provide a scientific database for the reasonable selection of intercrops in the rubber based agroforestry practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 general methodology in xishuangbanna a 6 9ha zone was established

4 fine root measurements the fine roots of rubber trees and intercrops were excavated when there was less rainfall at the end of october 2017 six soil profiles n 6 were dug in each of the four treatments three near the rubber rows and the other three close to the mid rows of rubber trees the roots were collected using the traditional diameter class approach mccormack et al 2014 kou et al

three suberized twigs of rubber and coffee n 3 were sampled every 30 45 days between august 2017 and july 2018 at the same time three n 3 root crowns i e the connection between the above and belowground tissues were collected for the herbaceous species of amomum and alpinia oxyphylla barnard et al 2006 the phloem tissues were removed to avoid the isotopic contamination ehleringer and dawson 1992 soil samples were collected using a bucket auger 4 cm in diameter at three random locations n 3 from seven soil depths 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 110 and 110 160 cm with the same bucket auger soil water content swc of 0 160 cm depths was determined from the weight loss of samples at 105 c for 48 h groundwater was sampled monthly from a deep well 40 m about 1 5 km away from the experimental fields during the study periods 102 rain samples were collected using a polyethylene bottle attached to a steel funnel yang et al 2018 all the water samples were cryogenically extracted using a vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica united technology limited inc beijing china the fully sun exposed leaves of rubber trees and the intercrops 50 80 were collected on the dates of xylem and soil sample collection the bulk leaves were divided into three equal parts n 3 oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and ﬁnely smashed using a pulverizer wu et al 2019 powders of the bulk leaves were filtered by 100 mesh sieves sealed in zip lock bags and stored in a glass dryer until the δ 13c measurements several studies have revealed that the δ 13c of plant bulk leaves depends on the ratio between the partial pressures of co2 in chloroplasts and in ambient air which can be construed as a relative index of leaf level intrinsic water use efficiency wuei farquhar et al 1989 cernusak et al 2008 kanpanon et al 2015 there is also a strong positive relationship between the bulk leaf δ 13c and wuei among c3 photosynthesis plants ehleringer and dawson 1992 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 therefore maintaining high bulk leaf δ 13c for plants conducts to high levels of wuei the δ 2h and δ 18o in water samples were analyzed using the delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer combined with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientiﬁc bremen germany to avoid any memory effect the 1st injection n 4 of the auto sampler as1310 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany was discarded for each measurement the δ 13c of bulk leaves were measured using a flash combustion elemental analyzer flash ea coupled with the delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientiﬁc bremen germany the precision of δ 2h δ 18o and δ 13c measurements were 0 4 0 14 and 0 03 respectively 2 6 models and statistical analyses the budyko s

contribution proportions of the potential source water in this study the potential water sources of different species were first defined as the water from the seven soil layers 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 110 and 110 160 cm afterwards the water uptake depths of rubber trees were assumed to be down to 0 160 cm based on the root investigation see section 3 3 accordingly the water uptake depths were restricted to 0 50 cm for amomum 0 70 cm for alpinia oxyphylla and 0 160 cm for coffee because we did not sample the soil water of 40 50 cm and 60 70 cm the isotopic values of these missing layers were obtained by linear fitness of the adjacent layers ground water was excluded from the potential water sources because of the deep water depth 10 m the parameters of mixsiar model were specified with fixed effect treatment siar process residual mcmc normal and no discrimination 0 a simple sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influences of soil depth assumption i e the soil sampling depth vs the root depth of different plants on water source prediction for comparison outputs of the model f 0 5 cm f 5 10 cm and f 110 160 cm were subjectively combined into shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 160 cm layers the relative difference in soil water content rdsw was calculated for the three rubber based agroforestry practices it was achieved by assuming that the intercrops caused greater swc fluctuations in the agroforestry practices i e rav rao and rca compared to the monoculture rm this hypothesis was reasonable because these treatments had similar geological properties and management practices the positive or negative values of rdsw refer to facilitate or competitive roles of different intercrops on rubber trees in this study rdsw of the 0 20

performed utilizing the spss 17 0 probability level p 0 05 one way analysis of variance anova including duncan d was used to analyze the differences in ai rld isotopes rdsw and source water contributions repeated measures two way anova was used to evaluate the effects of soil depth and season on swc geometric mean regression gmr was used for the fitting of regression equation because both of the two variables were random and subjected to measurement errors 3 results 3 1 drought stress and soil wetness at the experimental site the multi year 2008 2017 means of budyko s aridity

and 20 60 cm depths decreased noticeably for all treatments during the dry season p 0 05 this trend of shallow swc was in line with the annual ai no significant differences of swc in the 60 160 cm depths happened between the rainy season and dry season the mean swc was higher in rao 21 81 1 70 and rca 22 19 2 48 than rm 20 50 2 49 while it was lower in rav 20 38 1 97 than rm p 0 05 3 2 isotopic characteristics of different water pools the isotopic composition of soil water changed with both season and depth especially in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers figs 2 and s2 the δ 2h and δ 18o of these two soil layers progressively became positive from the rainy season to dry season with similar patterns the isotopic values of precipitation were more positive δ 2h 33 4 17 6 δ 18o 5 18 2 13 during the dry season and gradually turned negative δ 2h 55 1 23 8 δ 18o 7 60 3 36 toward the rainy season p 0 001 the isotopic values of the 60 160 cm soil water were close to those of groundwater δ 2h 60 8 1 3 δ 18o 9 27 0 43 which experienced little changes during the whole study period of 2017 2018 compared to rm the three agroforestry practices of rav rao and rca significantly depleted the isotopic compositions of soil water in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm depths p 0 05 furthermore the isotopic values of soil water were more depleted in rca than the other treatments in the 60 160 cm soil layers however no significant differences in soil water δ 2h and δ 18o occurred among treatments for all the plants the isotopic values of xylem water varied within the ranges of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o figs 3 and s3 rubber trees generally had more positive xylem water δ 2h and δ 18o during the dry season table 2 in addition xylem δ 2h and δ 18o of the rubber trees differed significantly among treatments p 0 05 among these treatments the isotopic differences of rubber xylem δ 2h and δ 18o were lower during the rainy season this isotopic pattern i e more positive xylem δ 2h and δ 18o in the dry season was also applicable to the intercrops of amomum alpinia oxyphylla and coffee positive linear relationships existed between the xylem isotopic compositions of rubber trees and those of amomum in rav y 0 6x 1 3 r 2 0 07 p 0 503 alpinia oxyphylla in rao y 1 3x 2 5 r 2 0 59 p 0 05 and coffee in rca y 1 1x 1 6 r 2 0 51 p 0 05 indicating similar water sources between rubber trees and the intercrops 3 3 water uptake depth for plants in the agroforestry practices the depths of plant water uptake could be determined using the isotopic intersections between xylem water and soil water profiles figs 3 and s3 in this way the rubber trees mainly derived water from the 0 40 cm soil layers during the dry season and from the 0 20 cm soil layers during the rainy season the switch of water source to deep soil layers was most pronounced for the rubber trees in rm amomum mainly took up soil water from the 0 20 cm depths during the whole study period of 2017 2018 another herbaceous species of alpinia oxyphylla could derive soil water to a depth about 40 cm as a deep rooted plant coffee trees had the ability to absorb water from soil layers of more than 40 cm in fact rubber trees and the intercrops might acquire water from shallow and or deep soil strata e g may 2018 in all the treatments when the isotopic intersections were more than one between the xylem water and soil water profiles the mixsiar model predicted that the mean contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water to rubber trees was 40 5 14 6 68 6 in rm 45 3 15 8 81 8 in rav 41 3 16 5 58 7 in rao and 46 7 13 7 71 3 in rca meanwhile the percentage of water uptake from the 0 20 cm depths was 73 7 34 3 93 1 for amomum 69 3 51 1 95 3 for alpinia oxyphylla and 64 3 36 9 97 6 for coffee trees these partitioning results were acquired according to the actual root length of crops in the rubber practices the contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water would be undervalued by 7 9 4 0 23 2 for amomum and 12 4 1 5 31 0 for alpinia oxyphylla if the root depths of these intercrops were roughly assumed as 160 cm p 0 05 note that rubber trees still heavily depended on the 0 20 cm soil water under seasonal drought stress the mean contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water to rubber trees also slightly increased 1 2 2 1 during the rainy season except for rao 5 9 meanwhile all the intercrops heavily depended on the 0 20 cm soil water during both the dry and rainy seasons 3 4 fine root distribution and its relationship with plant water uptake the vertical root length density rld showed that rubber trees and all the intercrops were mainly shallow rooted fig 4 the mean rld of rubber trees 0 22 0 20 cm cm 3 did not significantly differ between treatments p 0 51 with 60 5 74 5 of their fine roots distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layers however the fine roots of amomum 0 11 0 08 cm cm 3 and alpinia oxyphylla 0 35 0 30 cm cm 3 were restricted to 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm depths respectively the fine roots of coffee 0 46 0 62 cm cm 3 penetrated the soil till a depth of 160 cm moreover the fine roots of coffee were more plentiful 3 68 cm cm 3 than rubber trees 1 31 cm cm 3 in the 0 20 cm soil layers a positive linear relationship y 7 7x 128 9 r 2 0 26 p 0 05 existed between the source water contribution and swc in the 0 160 cm soil layers fig 5 however the correlations were not significant when rubber trees p 0 19 and the intercrops p 0 17 were considered separately for rubber trees and the intercrops the values of the source water contribution exhibited positive correlations with the root diameter p 0 001 root length density p 0 001 and root surface area density p 0 001 3 5 leaf δ13c and rdsw in the rubber agroforestry practices the bulk leaf δ 13c of rubber trees exhibited similar seasonal trends in both the monoculture and agroforestry practices fig 6a nevertheless the mean δ 13c values of rubber trees were ranked in descending order as 30 71 1 17 in rca 30 74 0 59 in rm 31 51 1 28 in rav and 31 75 0 94 in rao i e rca rm rav rao meanwhile the values of rubber δ 13c significantly differed between rm and rav p 0 05 as well as between rm and rao p 0 001 the bulk leaf δ 13c of rubber trees was not significant different between rm and rca p 0 85 and between rav and rao p 0 41 overall rubber trees maintained higher δ 13c values during the dry season δ 13c 30 79 1 12 than the rainy season δ 13c 31 65 0 99 p 0 05 this phenomenon was more apparent in rav and rca the bulk leaf δ 13c of the intercrops was presented as a reference in this study fig s4 no significant difference occurred between the bulk leaf δ 13c of amomum 30 99 1 28 and alpinia oxyphylla 31 19 0 57 the bulk leaf δ 13c 34 56 0 41 was significantly lower for coffee than the two herbaceous species p 0 001 the relative difference in soil water content rdsw of the 0 160 cm soil layers was negative 0 01 0 09 in rav during the study periods fig 6b compared to rav overall positive values of rdsw were observed in rao 0 06 0 07 and rca 0 08 0 07 p 0 05 to better explain the water utilization characteristics of plants a schematic representation of source water contribution bulk leaf δ 13c and rwsd is summarized for the rubber trees and intercrops fig 7 during the dry season a noticeable decline in rdsw of 0 20 cm was observed in rav 0 06 0 04 and rao 0 03 0 03 p 0 05 indicating more shallow soil water loss in these two agroforestry practices in rav the values of rdsw were also negative in the 20 60 cm 0 06 0 09 p 0 37 and 60 160 cm 0 07 0 07 p 0 05 soil layers during the drought periods meanwhile the rdsw values of 0 20 cm depths were significantly higher in rao and rca than rav under drought stress p 0 05 during the rainy season the values of rdsw were positive in rca 0 13 0 07 rao 0 10 0 04 and rav 0 06 0 04 however there were no significant differences in rdsw of 0 20 20 60 and 60 160 cm depths between treatments during the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 vertical patterns of water relations in different agroforestry practices the results of this study showed that the intercrops favorably affected soil water retention in the rubber based agroforestry practices table 1 this finding was also confirmed by the vertical signatures of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o figs 2 and s2 the ranges of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o in this study were similar to those reported by liu et al 2014 wu et al 2019 and yang et al 2020 in the same region theoretically soil water evaporation should result in more positive δ values because of the rayleigh distillation gat 1996 brooks et al 2010 dawson and simonin 2011 the δ 2h and δ 18o of shallow 0 20 cm and middle 20 60 cm soil layers were more positive in rm compared to the other three agroforestry practices it reflected that surface soil water in the agroforestry practices has less evaporation due to the cover shading of intercrops lin 2010 hardanto et al 2017 soil water evaporation is always regarded as an ineffective source of water loss because it does not directly contribute to crop yields in agricultural lands carr and lockwood 2011 yang et al 2018 therefore the effect of water retention is not only beneficial for soil water supplies but is also an advantage for the increasing of plant water use efficiency furthermore the other hydrologic processes such as canopy interception can also influence the status of soil water for example liu et al 2018 found that the throughfall amounts are reported to be closely related to the canopy structures in the rubber tea camellia sinensis and the rubber cocoa coffea arabica agroforestry practices as a result the canopy interception of multiple canopies may result in a high spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and rainfall erosivity in the rubber plantations liu et al 2018 the plants highly depended on water from the 0 20 cm soil layers despite the various functional traits in our agroforestry practices figs 3 and s3 the rubber trees took up 43 5 2 6 40 5 46 7 of their water from the 0 20 cm soil layers accordingly the three intercrops derived 69 1 3 2 64 3 73 7 of their water from 0 to 20 cm soil layers during the whole study periods plant species having contrasting water sources always coexist in various ecosystems jackson et al 1995 meinzer et al 1999 drake and franks 2003 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 this complementary water use is beneficial for the temporal and spatial partitioning of vertical water resources van noordwijk et al 2015 schwendenmann et al 2015 however a serious competition of shallow water sources had been detected in this study as also reported in other plant communities meinzer et al 1999 rossatto et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the plant water use characteristics in this region were related to the abundance of surface soil water supply table 1 therefore most plants with shallow rooted systems may have interspecific water competition and rely on surface soil water drake and franks 2003 goldsmith et al 2012 goldberg et al 2017 the rubber trees seemed to be able to tap the deeper 20 60 cm soil water during the drought periods yet this plasticity for deep water uptake was not as strong as those of previous studies liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 for instance liu et al 2014 found that the water uptake depth of rubber trees increases markedly 70 cm when soil moisture is gradually depleted in the late dry season wu et al 2016 also demonstrated that rubber trees can switch their main water source 75 to the 50 110 cm soil water during the dry season our results showed that 67 4 4 8 of the rubbers fine roots were concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil profiles fig 4 in this study the positive relationships between the source water contribution and root characteristics could offer some evidences for this view fig 5 a previous research also found the positive upward opening relationships between source water contribution and root length density in a semiarid revegetated ecosystem gao et al 2018 however the contribution of water sources decreases exponentially with the increase of root length density in their analysis gao et al 2018 one possible explanation is that the ﬁne root system of different species is morphologically chemically and functionally heterogeneous pregitzer et al 2002 kou et al 2018 to our limited knowledge it was the first report that directly investigated the fine root distribution of rubber trees in this area which provided valuable evidence on the water competition relations between rubber trees and their intercrops 4 2 seasonal dynamics of water relations in different agroforestry practices the ideal habitat for rubber trees should have plenty of monthly rainfall 100 mm and small temperature fluctuation 24 28 c iqbal et al 2006 liu et al 2016 however our study site is located in the tropical area of south east asia where the non native rubber trees experience a 6month long drought period fig 1 the total amount of monthly rainfall during the dry months of 2017 2018 november to april was less than 100 mm 8 85 mm as a result the swc in all the treatments sharply declined during the dry season p 0 05 table 1 the soil moisture during the dry season was more plentiful in rao p 0 12 and rca p 0 05 compared to rm thus the intercrops of alpinia oxyphylla and coffee likely had beneficial effects on the promotion of soil water availability which provided further cases for the positive role of intercrops in soil water retention in the rubber based agroforestry practices burgess et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 on the contrary the soil moisture was even worse in rav than in the rubber monoculture p 0 05 implying a negative impact of amomum on rubber trees i e the role of interspecific water competition soil water retention additional irrigation should be applied if amomum is used as a intercrop with rubber trees the water absorbing proportion from 0 to 20 cm soil layers to rubber trees slightly increased from 41 1 19 1 november april to 46 5 14 3 may october when the monthly rainfall is more abundant 102 334 mm during the rainy season figs 3 and s3 meanwhile amomum also improved the utilization of 0 20 cm soil water 68 5 22 1 to 80 1 10 8 during the season transform p 0 05 similarly alpinia oxyphylla increased the 0 20 cm water absorbing proportion between the dry season 67 7 4 0 and the rainy season 70 7 13 5 these findings are consistent with the results of several other studies dodd et al 1998 zegada lizarazu et al 2007 asbjornsen et al 2008 which suggested that the herbaceous species are more dependent on rainfall recharged soil water than do tall trees coffee trees were less dependent on the 0 20 cm soil water during the rainy season 59 9 19 3 than the dry season 67 7 15 8 several studies showed that plants can adjust their water resource after heavy rainfall events or irrigation campaigns west et al 2007 zegada lizarazu et al 2007 liu et al 2014 indeed this ability to quickly switch and absorb rainwater will put plants at an advantage if an interspecific water competition occurs during the drought periods sekiya and yano 2002 however the surface water e g rainwater or stream may not be a reliable long term water source for some species that are always subjected to seasonal drought ehleringer and dawson 1992 brooks et al 2010 the contrasting water uptake patterns of herbaceous and woody species suggested that these intercrops might have specific influences on rubber trees it will be possible to assess the impacts of drought stress on plant water use strategies if the source water partitioning and the measurement of intrinsic water use efficiency wuei are combined ehleringer and dawson 1992 meanwhile the stable carbon isotopes i e an indicator of plant wuei of coexisting c3 plants can be analyzed to characterize the water relations between plants living in the same environmental condition cernusak et al 2008 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 here the values of bulk leaf δ 13c 30 79 1 12 showed that rubber trees improved their wuei during the dry season than the rainy season 31 65 0 99 figs 6 and 7 a high wuei is likely a feedback of the rubber trees to the drought stress wu et al 2016 and it may enhance the normal growth of rubber trees during the drought periods which in turn will lead to a high latex yield during the subsequent rainy season δ 13c 31 81 29 59 this phenomenon principally occurs because the raising water use efficiency will lower the transpiration induced water loss of plants under drought stress emmerich 2007 yu et al 2008 monson et al 2010 therefore a high wuei likely ensures the normal physiological activity of rubber trees during the dry season snoeck et al 2013 kanpanon et al 2015 hondrade et al 2017 nonetheless rubber trees had lower bulk leaf δ 13c during the rainy season because of the relatively plentiful supply of shallow soil water table 2 this could be described as a wasteful water use behavior which is be beneficial for high latex yields of rubber trees during the non drought periods wu et al 2016 4 3 implications in xishuangbanna yunnan province southwestern china maintaining consistent water supply remains one of the biggest challenges in the rubber plantations the drought stress will always enhance the intense interspecific water competition among coexisting species when the rainfall recharged soil water is not available for shallow rooted plants dawson 1996 meinzer et al 1999 yang et al 2018 even so rubber trees are commonly referred as water pumps because of their high water uptake tan et al 2011 in this context there is an ideal expectation that rubber trees and the intercrops will always share the limited water through temporal and or spatial partitioning of resource utilization liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 2019 however our previous results revealed that the complementary water use did not occur between rubber trees and the intercrops of galangal alpinia officinarum tea camellia sinensis and cocoa theobroma cacao the results of this study also showed that all the intercrops i e amomum alpinia oxyphylla and coffee competed for shallow soil water resources with rubber trees during the whole study period of 2017 2018 fig 7 nevertheless the unfavorable interspecific water competition between rubber trees and intercrops can be partly compensated by the increasing effects of plant shades i e multiple layered canopies and rainfall inﬁltration zhu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 coffee seem an appropriate intercrop to rubber plantation because of its positive impacts on soil water availability on the contrary amomum would exacerbate the soil water shortages in the rubber plantation thus it is important to identify the main crop species and its optimal growing environment before establishing an agroforestry practice lin 2010 gao et al 2018 in the rubber based agroforestry practices the overstory trees remain the primary species in terms of economic returns while the intercrops represent just subsidiary species that are mainly used to provide additional benefits iqbal et al 2006 smajgl et al 2015 chen et al 2019 as a result the growth of rubber trees should not be hindered by the intercropping practices in xishuangbanna only few studies have explored the seasonal dynamics of water sources for rubber trees liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 2019 yang et al 2020 the water relation between rubber trees and other intercrops should be more explored in this region 5 conclusions the interspecific water relations between rubber trees and three intercrops described in this study allow us to concluded that 1 rubber trees exhibited a weak plasticity in the depth of water uptake relying on 0 20 cm soil water during both the dry and rainy seasons meanwhile all of the intercrops exhibited interspecific competition for shallow soil water with the rubber trees 2 both of rubber trees and intercrops were shallow rooted in the 0 160 cm soil profiles specifically 60 5 74 5 of the rubbers fine roots concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil strata 3 all rubber trees maintained higher intrinsic wuei during the dry season than the rainy season 4 application of coffee trees had the best facilitation effect on the water acquisition of rubber trees while growing amomum significantly decreased soil water content in the rubber agroforestry practices authors contributions b y l s

10342,rubber hevea brasiliensis plantations have been facing a double challenge of land degradation and seasonal drought in southeast asia various cash crops are recently interplanted with rubber trees to face these issues however the water relations between rubber trees and the intercrops remain poorly understood this study aims to evaluate the influences of three cash intercrops namely two herbaceous plants amomum villosum and alpinia oxyphylla and a woody beverage coffea arabica on rubber water utilization through both spatial and temporal scales we investigated the plant water absorption dynamics root biomass and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei throughout a whole year 2017 2018 the results showed that rubber trees 43 5 2 6 and intercrops 69 1 3 2 highly depended on soil water from the 0 20 cm depths an interspeciﬁc water competition occurred in all the rubber based agroforestry practices because of their similar water source and root distribution in the vertical soil

availability than the other intercrops suggesting its suitability as an intercrop for rubber trees alpinia oxyphylla a oxyphylla played a moderate role on soil water retention amomum a villosum however aggravated the soil water deﬁcit in the agroforestry practice given the differences in water relations to rubber trees the introduction of woody crops rather than herbaceous crops can improve the resistance of rubber plantation to the frequent drought stress in this region keywords agroforestry system interspeciﬁc competition root biomass soil moisture water utilization 1 introduction nowadays the south east asia region has become the largest latex production base in the world fox et al 2014 a widespread rubber hevea brasiliensis willd ex a juss muell arg monoculture has replaced 4 700 000 ha of natural ecosystems in this region li and fox 2012 zhang et al 2019 what is more it is predicted that the area of higher altitudes 600 m dedicated to rubber will double or triple by 2050 fox et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 this expansion of rubber monoculture is a main driving factor behind the severe land degradation in the uplands of china laos myanmar thailand and vietnam ziegler et al 2009 thus the rubber based agroforestry systems has been recently established to provide a promising solution for the sustainable development of rubber cultivation lin 2010 hammond et al 2017 chen et al 2019 these tree based systems are artificial farming practices of deliberately integrating trees with cash crops to benefit from the resulting ecological and economic interactions van noordwijk et al 2015 pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2017 xishuangbanna region is one of the major rubber planting areas in south east asia which has been currently experiencing a dramatic downward trend in fog frequency and stream flow due to the land cover transition liu et al 2007 tan et al 2011 different types of rubber agroforestry practices are implemented to balance the negative ecological consequences and the economic benefits iqbal et al 2006 snoeck et al 2013 smajgl et al 2015 these rubber crop agroforestry practices will make the maximum use of limited water resources during the drought periods schwendenmann et al 2010 with the potential to minimize water competition among the co occurring species nevertheless not all of the agroforestry practices have the same impact on the water utilization of rubber trees a strong interspecific competition for water resources can exist in the agroforestry practices carr and lockwood 2011 gao et al 2018 yang et al 2020 and this competition may affect both the growth and latex yields of rubber trees in spite of the efforts over the last decades the evaluation of the trade offs between additional values and competition effects of intercrops on the main species remains very challenging to agro ecologists smajgl et al 2015 burgess et al 2019 to date most of the previous studies in xishuangbanna mainly focus on the effects of intercrops on controlling surface runoff soil erosion and soil nutrient loss in the rubber based agroforestry practices liu et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 stable isotopes of hydrogen δ 2h and oxygen δ 18o are commonly used to investigate the water soil plant relations in different ecosystems schwendenmann et al 2010 wu et al 2016 hardanto et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the underlying assumption is that xylem water of plants has no isotopic fractionation from soil water during the root water uptake process ehleringer and dawson 1992 based on the δ 2h and δ 18o in water pools wu et al 2016 found that rubber trees exhibit a relatively higher range of plasticity in depth of water uptake than the intercropped shrubs hardanto et al 2017 showed that rubber trees in the jungle stands take up water from deeper soil strata than in the monoculture the intercrops might also have both positive and negative impacts on the rubber trees intrinsic water use efficiency wuei depending on the intensity of water competition wu et al 2016 2019 it should be noticed that species mixtures with contrasting root patterns will explore larger soil volumes to improve the efficiency of water utilization van noordwijk et al 2015 therefore studies on the characteristics of root depth will give a better understanding of the water utilization in rubber agroforestry practices on the perspective of sustainable agriculture this study aims to characterize the water use strategies of rubber trees and three prevailing intercrops in xishuangbanna namely amomum amomum villosum lour alpinia oxyphylla alpinia oxyphylla miq and coffee coffea arabica l amomum a villosum is a perennial herbaceous plant species of zingiberaceae family and its seeds chinese medicine name sharen have medicinal values of anti inflammation and gastrointestinal protection wang et al 2018 alpinia oxyphylla a oxyphylla is also a perennial herb known for its medicinal properties for hundreds of years in southern china its fruits chinese medicine name yizhi have anti inflammatory effects on osteoarthritis lee et al 2019 the fruits of coffee c arabica can be used to produce a very popular beverage which have the potential to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases bitter et al 2020 the commonality of these intercrops is that they all exhibit good economic benefits and broad market prospects even so the successful application of these intercropping practices still relies on the knowledge of water relations between plants which remain poorly understood the main objective of this study is to characterize the water relations between rubber trees and the intercrops through both spatial vertical pattern and temporal seasonal pattern scales we hypothesized that 1 rubber trees would have more flexible water sources than the cash crops and 2 the wuei of rubber trees would be distinctly affected by the herbaceous and woody intercrops the findings of this study will provide a scientific database for the reasonable selection of intercrops in the rubber based agroforestry practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 general methodology in xishuangbanna a 6 9ha zone was established

practices are about 150 300 m the four rubber practices i e rm rav rao and rca were treated as randomized treatments in this study which had gentle slopes after 10 years of similar field managements 2 4 fine root measurements the fine roots of rubber trees and intercrops were excavated when there was less rainfall at the end of october 2017 six soil profiles n 6 were dug in each of the four treatments three near the rubber rows and the other three close to the mid rows of rubber trees the roots were collected using the traditional diameter class approach mccormack et al 2014 kou et al 2018 in brief the soil cuboids of 0 160 cm depths 15 cm length 15 cm width were dug first at 10 cm increments 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm then at 20 cm increments 30 50 50 70 70 90 90 110 and 110 130 cm and at 30 cm increments 130 160 cm all the elastic and flexible roots were manually picked out from soil cuboids flushed with water in 20 mesh sieves and separated according to the following root classes rubber dark brown exterior coarsely structured with latex amomum alpinia oxyphylla while exterior with fibrous roots and coffee faint yellow exterior finer structured with small root diameters for this step the roots of rubber trees were found in all the soil cuboids 9 depths 6 replicates 4 treatments however the roots of intercrops were not accessible in some of the soil cuboids the total

three suberized twigs of rubber and coffee n 3 were sampled every 30 45 days between august 2017 and july 2018 at the same time three n 3 root crowns i e the connection between the above and belowground tissues were collected for the herbaceous species of amomum and alpinia oxyphylla barnard et al 2006 the phloem tissues were removed to avoid the isotopic contamination ehleringer and dawson 1992 soil samples were collected using a bucket auger 4 cm in diameter at three random locations n 3 from seven soil depths 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 110 and 110 160 cm with the same bucket auger soil water content swc of 0 160 cm depths was determined from the weight loss of samples at 105 c for 48 h groundwater was sampled monthly from a deep well 40 m about 1 5 km away from the experimental fields during the study periods 102 rain samples were collected using a polyethylene bottle attached to a steel funnel yang et al 2018 all the water samples were cryogenically extracted using a vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica united technology limited inc beijing china the fully sun exposed leaves of rubber trees and the intercrops 50 80 were collected on the dates of xylem and soil sample collection the bulk leaves were divided into three equal parts n 3 oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and ﬁnely smashed using a pulverizer wu et al 2019 powders of the bulk leaves were filtered by 100 mesh sieves sealed in zip lock bags and stored in a glass dryer until the δ 13c measurements several studies have revealed that the δ 13c of plant bulk leaves depends on the ratio between the partial pressures of co2 in chloroplasts and in ambient air which can be construed as a relative index of leaf level intrinsic water use efficiency wuei farquhar et al 1989 cernusak et al 2008 kanpanon et al 2015 there is also a strong positive relationship between the bulk leaf δ 13c and wuei among c3 photosynthesis plants ehleringer and dawson 1992 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 therefore maintaining high bulk leaf δ 13c for plants conducts to high levels of wuei the δ 2h and δ 18o in water samples were analyzed using the delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer combined with a high temperature conversion elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientiﬁc bremen germany to avoid any memory effect the 1st injection n 4 of the auto sampler as1310 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany was discarded for each measurement the δ 13c of bulk leaves were measured using a flash combustion elemental analyzer flash ea coupled with the delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientiﬁc bremen germany the precision of δ 2h δ 18o and δ 13c measurements were 0 4 0 14 and 0 03 respectively 2 6 models and statistical analyses the budyko s

contribution proportions of the potential source water in this study the potential water sources of different species were first defined as the water from the seven soil layers 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 110 and 110 160 cm afterwards the water uptake depths of rubber trees were assumed to be down to 0 160 cm based on the root investigation see section 3 3 accordingly the water uptake depths were restricted to 0 50 cm for amomum 0 70 cm for alpinia oxyphylla and 0 160 cm for coffee because we did not sample the soil water of 40 50 cm and 60 70 cm the isotopic values of these missing layers were obtained by linear fitness of the adjacent layers ground water was excluded from the potential water sources because of the deep water depth 10 m the parameters of mixsiar model were specified with fixed effect treatment siar process residual mcmc normal and no discrimination 0 a simple sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influences of soil depth assumption i e the soil sampling depth vs the root depth of different plants on water source prediction for comparison outputs of the model f 0 5 cm f 5 10 cm and f 110 160 cm were subjectively combined into shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 160 cm layers the relative difference in soil water content rdsw was calculated for the three rubber based agroforestry practices it was achieved by assuming that the intercrops caused greater swc fluctuations in the agroforestry practices i e rav rao and rca compared to the monoculture rm this hypothesis was reasonable because these treatments had similar geological properties and management practices the positive or negative values of rdsw refer to facilitate or competitive roles of different intercrops on rubber trees in this study rdsw of the 0 20

performed utilizing the spss 17 0 probability level p 0 05 one way analysis of variance anova including duncan d was used to analyze the differences in ai rld isotopes rdsw and source water contributions repeated measures two way anova was used to evaluate the effects of soil depth and season on swc geometric mean regression gmr was used for the fitting of regression equation because both of the two variables were random and subjected to measurement errors 3 results 3 1 drought stress and soil wetness at the experimental site the multi year 2008 2017 means of budyko s aridity index ai demonstrated that the plants in this region were subjected to a prolonged period of atmospheric drought stress 0 48 0 12 from november to april fig 1 the severe drought always occurred in february ai 0 22 0 23 whereas the wettest month was july ai 2 88 0 99 during 2008 2017 the rainfall amount and mean air temperature during the study period of 2017 2018 were 1620 mm and 22 2 3 1 c respectively in drought months the ai values of 2017 2018 0 52 0 29 were similar to the long term means p 0 05 indicating a typical drought year the soil water content swc was higher in the 0 20 cm depths compared to the 20 60 cm and 60 160 cm depths during the rainy months table 1 meanwhile swc of the 0 20 cm depths was similar to the deep soil layers between november 2017 and march 2018 the transition periods occurred in october 2017 and april 2018 and the highest swc fluctuated between the 0 20 cm depths and the deep soil layers during this period concerning the seasons swc of 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm depths decreased noticeably for all treatments during the dry season p 0 05 this trend of shallow swc was in line with the annual ai no significant differences of swc in the 60 160 cm depths happened between the rainy season and dry season the mean swc was higher in rao 21 81 1 70 and rca 22 19 2 48 than rm 20 50 2 49 while it was lower in rav 20 38 1 97 than rm p 0 05 3 2 isotopic characteristics of different water pools the isotopic composition of soil water changed with both season and depth especially in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers figs 2 and s2 the δ 2h and δ 18o of these two soil layers progressively became positive from the rainy season to dry season with similar patterns the isotopic values of precipitation were more positive δ 2h 33 4 17 6 δ 18o 5 18 2 13 during the dry season and gradually turned negative δ 2h 55 1 23 8 δ 18o 7 60 3 36 toward the rainy season p 0 001 the isotopic values of the 60 160 cm soil water were close to those of groundwater δ 2h 60 8 1 3 δ 18o 9 27 0 43 which experienced little changes during the whole study period of 2017 2018 compared to rm the three agroforestry practices of rav rao and rca significantly depleted the isotopic compositions of soil water in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm depths p 0 05 furthermore the isotopic values of soil water were more depleted in rca than the other treatments in the 60 160 cm soil layers however no significant differences in soil water δ 2h and δ 18o occurred among treatments for all the plants the isotopic values of xylem water varied within the ranges of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o figs 3 and s3 rubber trees generally had more positive xylem water δ 2h and δ 18o during the dry season table 2 in addition xylem δ 2h and δ 18o of the rubber trees differed significantly among treatments p 0 05 among these treatments the isotopic differences of rubber xylem δ 2h and δ 18o were lower during the rainy season this isotopic pattern i e more positive xylem δ 2h and δ 18o in the dry season was also applicable to the intercrops of amomum alpinia oxyphylla and coffee positive linear relationships existed between the xylem isotopic compositions of rubber trees and those of amomum in rav y 0 6x 1 3 r 2 0 07 p 0 503 alpinia oxyphylla in rao y 1 3x 2 5 r 2 0 59 p 0 05 and coffee in rca y 1 1x 1 6 r 2 0 51 p 0 05 indicating similar water sources between rubber trees and the intercrops 3 3 water uptake depth for plants in the agroforestry practices the depths of plant water uptake could be determined using the isotopic intersections between xylem water and soil water profiles figs 3 and s3 in this way the rubber trees mainly derived water from the 0 40 cm soil layers during the dry season and from the 0 20 cm soil layers during the rainy season the switch of water source to deep soil layers was most pronounced for the rubber trees in rm amomum mainly took up soil water from the 0 20 cm depths during the whole study period of 2017 2018 another herbaceous species of alpinia oxyphylla could derive soil water to a depth about 40 cm as a deep rooted plant coffee trees had the ability to absorb water from soil layers of more than 40 cm in fact rubber trees and the intercrops might acquire water from shallow and or deep soil strata e g may 2018 in all the treatments when the isotopic intersections were more than one between the xylem water and soil water profiles the mixsiar model predicted that the mean contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water to rubber trees was 40 5 14 6 68 6 in rm 45 3 15 8 81 8 in rav 41 3 16 5 58 7 in rao and 46 7 13 7 71 3 in rca meanwhile the percentage of water uptake from the 0 20 cm depths was 73 7 34 3 93 1 for amomum 69 3 51 1 95 3 for alpinia oxyphylla and 64 3 36 9 97 6 for coffee trees these partitioning results were acquired according to the actual root length of crops in the rubber practices the contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water would be undervalued by 7 9 4 0 23 2 for amomum and 12 4 1 5 31 0 for alpinia oxyphylla if the root depths of these intercrops were roughly assumed as 160 cm p 0 05 note that rubber trees still heavily depended on the 0 20 cm soil water under seasonal drought stress the mean contribution of the 0 20 cm soil water to rubber trees also slightly increased 1 2 2 1 during the rainy season except for rao 5 9 meanwhile all the intercrops heavily depended on the 0 20 cm soil water during both the dry and rainy seasons 3 4 fine root distribution and its relationship with plant water uptake the vertical root length density rld showed that rubber trees and all the intercrops were mainly shallow rooted fig 4 the mean rld of rubber trees 0 22 0 20 cm cm 3 did not significantly differ between treatments p 0 51 with 60 5 74 5 of their fine roots distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layers however the fine roots of amomum 0 11 0 08 cm cm 3 and alpinia oxyphylla 0 35 0 30 cm cm 3 were restricted to 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm depths respectively the fine roots of coffee 0 46 0 62 cm cm 3 penetrated the soil till a depth of 160 cm moreover the fine roots of coffee were more plentiful 3 68 cm cm 3 than rubber trees 1 31 cm cm 3 in the 0 20 cm soil layers a positive linear relationship y 7 7x 128 9 r 2 0 26 p 0 05 existed between the source water contribution and swc in the 0 160 cm soil layers fig 5 however the correlations were not significant when rubber trees p 0 19 and the intercrops p 0 17 were considered separately for rubber trees and the intercrops the values of the source water contribution exhibited positive correlations with the root diameter p 0 001 root length density p 0 001 and root surface area density p 0 001 3 5 leaf δ13c and rdsw in the rubber agroforestry practices the bulk leaf δ 13c of rubber trees exhibited similar seasonal trends in both the monoculture and agroforestry practices fig 6a nevertheless the mean δ 13c values of rubber trees were ranked in descending order as 30 71 1 17 in rca 30 74 0 59 in rm 31 51 1 28 in rav and 31 75 0 94 in rao i e rca rm rav rao meanwhile the values of rubber δ 13c significantly differed between rm and rav p 0 05 as well as between rm and rao p 0 001 the bulk leaf δ 13c of rubber trees was not significant different between rm and rca p 0 85 and between rav and rao p 0 41 overall rubber trees maintained higher δ 13c values during the dry season δ 13c 30 79 1 12 than the rainy season δ 13c 31 65 0 99 p 0 05 this phenomenon was more apparent in rav and rca the bulk leaf δ 13c of the intercrops was presented as a reference in this study fig s4 no significant difference occurred between the bulk leaf δ 13c of amomum 30 99 1 28 and alpinia oxyphylla 31 19 0 57 the bulk leaf δ 13c 34 56 0 41 was significantly lower for coffee than the two herbaceous species p 0 001 the relative difference in soil water content rdsw of the 0 160 cm soil layers was negative 0 01 0 09 in rav during the study periods fig 6b compared to rav overall positive values of rdsw were observed in rao 0 06 0 07 and rca 0 08 0 07 p 0 05 to better explain the water utilization characteristics of plants a schematic representation of source water contribution bulk leaf δ 13c and rwsd is summarized for the rubber trees and intercrops fig 7 during the dry season a noticeable decline in rdsw of 0 20 cm was observed in rav 0 06 0 04 and rao 0 03 0 03 p 0 05 indicating more shallow soil water loss in these two agroforestry practices in rav the values of rdsw were also negative in the 20 60 cm 0 06 0 09 p 0 37 and 60 160 cm 0 07 0 07 p 0 05 soil layers during the drought periods meanwhile the rdsw values of 0 20 cm depths were significantly higher in rao and rca than rav under drought stress p 0 05 during the rainy season the values of rdsw were positive in rca 0 13 0 07 rao 0 10 0 04 and rav 0 06 0 04 however there were no significant differences in rdsw of 0 20 20 60 and 60 160 cm depths between treatments during the rainy season 4 discussion 4 1 vertical patterns of water relations in different agroforestry practices the results of this study showed that the intercrops favorably affected soil water retention in the rubber based agroforestry practices table 1 this finding was also confirmed by the vertical signatures of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o figs 2 and s2 the ranges of soil water δ 2h and δ 18o in this study were similar to those reported by liu et al 2014 wu et al 2019 and yang et al 2020 in the same region theoretically soil water evaporation should result in more positive δ values because of the rayleigh distillation gat 1996 brooks et al 2010 dawson and simonin 2011 the δ 2h and δ 18o of shallow 0 20 cm and middle 20 60 cm soil layers were more positive in rm compared to the other three agroforestry practices it reflected that surface soil water in the agroforestry practices has less evaporation due to the cover shading of intercrops lin 2010 hardanto et al 2017 soil water evaporation is always regarded as an ineffective source of water loss because it does not directly contribute to crop yields in agricultural lands carr and lockwood 2011 yang et al 2018 therefore the effect of water retention is not only beneficial for soil water supplies but is also an advantage for the increasing of plant water use efficiency furthermore the other hydrologic processes such as canopy interception can also influence the status of soil water for example liu et al 2018 found that the throughfall amounts are reported to be closely related to the canopy structures in the rubber tea camellia sinensis and the rubber cocoa coffea arabica agroforestry practices as a result the canopy interception of multiple canopies may result in a high spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and rainfall erosivity in the rubber plantations liu et al 2018 the plants highly depended on water from the 0 20 cm soil layers despite the various functional traits in our agroforestry practices figs 3 and s3 the rubber trees took up 43 5 2 6 40 5 46 7 of their water from the 0 20 cm soil layers accordingly the three intercrops derived 69 1 3 2 64 3 73 7 of their water from 0 to 20 cm soil layers during the whole study periods plant species having contrasting water sources always coexist in various ecosystems jackson et al 1995 meinzer et al 1999 drake and franks 2003 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 this complementary water use is beneficial for the temporal and spatial partitioning of vertical water resources van noordwijk et al 2015 schwendenmann et al 2015 however a serious competition of shallow water sources had been detected in this study as also reported in other plant communities meinzer et al 1999 rossatto et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the plant water use characteristics in this region were related to the abundance of surface soil water supply table 1 therefore most plants with shallow rooted systems may have interspecific water competition and rely on surface soil water drake and franks 2003 goldsmith et al 2012 goldberg et al 2017 the rubber trees seemed to be able to tap the deeper 20 60 cm soil water during the drought periods yet this plasticity for deep water uptake was not as strong as those of previous studies liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 for instance liu et al 2014 found that the water uptake depth of rubber trees increases markedly 70 cm when soil moisture is gradually depleted in the late dry season wu et al 2016 also demonstrated that rubber trees can switch their main water source 75 to the 50 110 cm soil water during the dry season our results showed that 67 4 4 8 of the rubbers fine roots were concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil profiles fig 4 in this study the positive relationships between the source water contribution and root characteristics could offer some evidences for this view fig 5 a previous research also found the positive upward opening relationships between source water contribution and root length density in a semiarid revegetated ecosystem gao et al 2018 however the contribution of water sources decreases exponentially with the increase of root length density in their analysis gao et al 2018 one possible explanation is that the ﬁne root system of different species is morphologically chemically and functionally heterogeneous pregitzer et al 2002 kou et al 2018 to our limited knowledge it was the first report that directly investigated the fine root distribution of rubber trees in this area which provided valuable evidence on the water competition relations between rubber trees and their intercrops 4 2 seasonal dynamics of water relations in different agroforestry practices the ideal habitat for rubber trees should have plenty of monthly rainfall 100 mm and small temperature fluctuation 24 28 c iqbal et al 2006 liu et al 2016 however our study site is located in the tropical area of south east asia where the non native rubber trees experience a 6month long drought period fig 1 the total amount of monthly rainfall during the dry months of 2017 2018 november to april was less than 100 mm 8 85 mm as a result the swc in all the treatments sharply declined during the dry season p 0 05 table 1 the soil moisture during the dry season was more plentiful in rao p 0 12 and rca p 0 05 compared to rm thus the intercrops of alpinia oxyphylla and coffee likely had beneficial effects on the promotion of soil water availability which provided further cases for the positive role of intercrops in soil water retention in the rubber based agroforestry practices burgess et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 on the contrary the soil moisture was even worse in rav than in the rubber monoculture p 0 05 implying a negative impact of amomum on rubber trees i e the role of interspecific water competition soil water retention additional irrigation should be applied if amomum is used as a intercrop with rubber trees the water absorbing proportion from 0 to 20 cm soil layers to rubber trees slightly increased from 41 1 19 1 november april to 46 5 14 3 may october when the monthly rainfall is more abundant 102 334 mm during the rainy season figs 3 and s3 meanwhile amomum also improved the utilization of 0 20 cm soil water 68 5 22 1 to 80 1 10 8 during the season transform p 0 05 similarly alpinia oxyphylla increased the 0 20 cm water absorbing proportion between the dry season 67 7 4 0 and the rainy season 70 7 13 5 these findings are consistent with the results of several other studies dodd et al 1998 zegada lizarazu et al 2007 asbjornsen et al 2008 which suggested that the herbaceous species are more dependent on rainfall recharged soil water than do tall trees coffee trees were less dependent on the 0 20 cm soil water during the rainy season 59 9 19 3 than the dry season 67 7 15 8 several studies showed that plants can adjust their water resource after heavy rainfall events or irrigation campaigns west et al 2007 zegada lizarazu et al 2007 liu et al 2014 indeed this ability to quickly switch and absorb rainwater will put plants at an advantage if an interspecific water competition occurs during the drought periods sekiya and yano 2002 however the surface water e g rainwater or stream may not be a reliable long term water source for some species that are always subjected to seasonal drought ehleringer and dawson 1992 brooks et al 2010 the contrasting water uptake patterns of herbaceous and woody species suggested that these intercrops might have specific influences on rubber trees it will be possible to assess the impacts of drought stress on plant water use strategies if the source water partitioning and the measurement of intrinsic water use efficiency wuei are combined ehleringer and dawson 1992 meanwhile the stable carbon isotopes i e an indicator of plant wuei of coexisting c3 plants can be analyzed to characterize the water relations between plants living in the same environmental condition cernusak et al 2008 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 here the values of bulk leaf δ 13c 30 79 1 12 showed that rubber trees improved their wuei during the dry season than the rainy season 31 65 0 99 figs 6 and 7 a high wuei is likely a feedback of the rubber trees to the drought stress wu et al 2016 and it may enhance the normal growth of rubber trees during the drought periods which in turn will lead to a high latex yield during the subsequent rainy season δ 13c 31 81 29 59 this phenomenon principally occurs because the raising water use efficiency will lower the transpiration induced water loss of plants under drought stress emmerich 2007 yu et al 2008 monson et al 2010 therefore a high wuei likely ensures the normal physiological activity of rubber trees during the dry season snoeck et al 2013 kanpanon et al 2015 hondrade et al 2017 nonetheless rubber trees had lower bulk leaf δ 13c during the rainy season because of the relatively plentiful supply of shallow soil water table 2 this could be described as a wasteful water use behavior which is be beneficial for high latex yields of rubber trees during the non drought periods wu et al 2016 4 3 implications in xishuangbanna yunnan province southwestern china maintaining consistent water supply remains one of the biggest challenges in the rubber plantations the drought stress will always enhance the intense interspecific water competition among coexisting species when the rainfall recharged soil water is not available for shallow rooted plants dawson 1996 meinzer et al 1999 yang et al 2018 even so rubber trees are commonly referred as water pumps because of their high water uptake tan et al 2011 in this context there is an ideal expectation that rubber trees and the intercrops will always share the limited water through temporal and or spatial partitioning of resource utilization liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 2019 however our previous results revealed that the complementary water use did not occur between rubber trees and the intercrops of galangal alpinia officinarum tea camellia sinensis and cocoa theobroma cacao the results of this study also showed that all the intercrops i e amomum alpinia oxyphylla and coffee competed for shallow soil water resources with rubber trees during the whole study period of 2017 2018 fig 7 nevertheless the unfavorable interspecific water competition between rubber trees and intercrops can be partly compensated by the increasing effects of plant shades i e multiple layered canopies and rainfall inﬁltration zhu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 coffee seem an appropriate intercrop to rubber plantation because of its positive impacts on soil water availability on the contrary amomum would exacerbate the soil water shortages in the rubber plantation thus it is important to identify the main crop species and its optimal growing environment before establishing an agroforestry practice lin 2010 gao et al 2018 in the rubber based agroforestry practices the overstory trees remain the primary species in terms of economic returns while the intercrops represent just subsidiary species that are mainly used to provide additional benefits iqbal et al 2006 smajgl et al 2015 chen et al 2019 as a result the growth of rubber trees should not be hindered by the intercropping practices in xishuangbanna only few studies have explored the seasonal dynamics of water sources for rubber trees liu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 2019 yang et al 2020 the water relation between rubber trees and other intercrops should be more explored in this region 5 conclusions the interspecific water relations between rubber trees and three intercrops described in this study allow us to concluded that 1 rubber trees exhibited a weak plasticity in the depth of water uptake relying on 0 20 cm soil water during both the dry and rainy seasons meanwhile all of the intercrops exhibited interspecific competition for shallow soil water with the rubber trees 2 both of rubber trees and intercrops were shallow rooted in the 0 160 cm soil profiles specifically 60 5 74 5 of the rubbers fine roots concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil strata 3 all rubber trees maintained higher intrinsic wuei during the dry season than the rainy season 4 application of coffee trees had the best facilitation effect on the water acquisition of rubber trees while growing amomum significantly decreased soil water content in the rubber agroforestry practices authors contributions b y l s

10343,water management is becoming commonplace in discussions of high yield farming and modern agricultural best practices a field experiment undertaken in the northern region of egypt kafr el sheikh governorate with four cut off furrow irrigation treatments 100 full irrigation considered as a control 90 80 and 70 of strip length was used to compare the effects of reduced water supply on onion allium cepa l production via assessing three different cultivars e g giza red giza 20 and behairy red a strip plot design with three replicates was employed in this regard during two successive seasons 2014 2015 2015 2016 regardless of onion type water supply at 80 level resulted in higher marketable and total bulb yield t ha with improved quality traits and storability compared to other irrigation treatments there have been few significant interspecies differences the most notable significant differences were recorded in giza red and behairy red for all studied characteristics the highest results were reached with giza red under the use of 80 irrigation level in addition to the excellence in improving the overall quality and harvestable yield this treatment 80 watering has produced relatively good results with respect to the consumptive water use efficiency water productivity and showed significant benefits in terms of saving irrigation water maximum water saving was obtained under the use of 70 irrigation treatment but in the absence of a good and economically unacceptable yield the traditional technique 100 water supply consumed much water surpassing the most effective treatment 80 by 1195 77 cubic meter per hectare i e 11 96 cm in depth height in conclusion cut off irrigation technique is considered an efficient and effective intervention approach for onion yield increases while maintaining post harvesting quality and water savings however extending the study beyond onion is critical to increase the range of benefit with regard to other crops as well for adequate management of water under deficit irrigation conditions keywords cut off irrigation onion water management water relations storability yield 1 introduction onion allium cepa l is one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide it is grown for its precious bulb and flavoured leaves even though it is a temperate crop onion can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions from relatively hot and dry areas to fairly cool and humid zones purseglove 1985 kariuki and kimani 1994 khokhar 2014 partly for this reason its species can be found across the world in europe asia north america and africa as a crop of high nutritional and economic values onion ranks high among the egyptian society the early availability of the crop for foreign markets and the relatively high quality make it a commodity of international repute because of their storage characteristics and durability for shipping onions have always been traded more widely than most vegetables it is considered the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes murray 2012 over the past ten years world onion production has increased by more than 25 griffiths et al 2002 countries with more evenly distributed production witness more frequent changes in ranking of the top producers in 2017 the world production of dried onion was around 97 7 million tons compared to 93 2 in 2016 hanci 2018 led by china 25 and india 23 of the world total fao 2017 egypt occupies a unique position among the top ten producing countries fourth with an average annual production of 1450 978 tons during the last 21 years hanci 2018 and a higher average yield per area of 30 57 36 16 tons ha aliyu et al 2007 gebretsadik and dechassa 2018 according to fao data and more evenly with iran the total production of onions in egypt reached 2 4 million tons skipping russia and turkey which registered 2 1 million tons each fao 2017 today the world consumption of onions is increasing dramatically partially because of intense promotion that links flavour and health rodrigues et al 2003 tn et al 2005 corzo martínez and villamiel 2012 research on onion benefits received an added impulse beyond basic nutrition with the discovery of a large and diverse group of bioactive compounds that has substantial health benefits and some have been investigated extensively for their chemopreventive therapeutic potential especially in the reduction of risk of development of chronic diseases goldman et al 1996 galeone et al 2006 szalay 2017 being a high yielding crop onion is generally voracious consumer of soil nutrients and requires a nitrogen rich npk fertilizer to support healthy growth yaso and abdel razzak 2007 mogren et al 2008 el hadidi et al 2016 liberal application of the major npk elements can lead to good results in promoting growth and increasing average yield nevertheless balanced application at the appropriate physiological stage leads to greater results yinpo 1997 ariyama et al 2006 gebretsadik and dechassa 2018 onion is often considered to be a medium water user physiologically water stress seriously affects growth yield and quality of onion bulbs kandil et al 2011 bagali et al 2012 khokhar 2018 with a relatively shallow root zone onions take up most of their water requirements from the top 30 cm of the soil profile and therefore are more vulnerable to damage by water stress zayton 2007 pejic et al 2014 according to khokhar 2017 lack of irrigation results in a shorter duration of bulb growth a lower percentage of radiation interception and a lower efficiency of conversion of energy to dry matter which all act against potential yield water deficit at specific stages can adversely affect the quality leading to reduced size and multi centered bulbs ortolá and knox 2015 the degree of influence typically varies from stage to the next and definitely adequate growth is preceded by a successful introduction stage research has confirmed that onion is more sensitive to water stress during bulb formation and enlargement than during vegetative growth stage khokhar 2017 some findings refer to a solid evidence that the growth period from 20 to 30 days after transplanting dat early bulb initiation stage is the most critical stage fluctuation of irrigation level during this time is destructive affecting survival rate and bulb quality kadam et al 2006 according to the previous authors plant becomes more tolerant as reaching the bulb maturity stage 90 110 dat where it is able to survive fluctuations in irrigation and produce marketable size bulbs ghodke et al 2018 overall pelter et al 2004 reported that onion growth is reduced by soil water stress imposed at any growth stage but the greatest effect can be at the 3 leaf 5 leaf and 7 leaf stages with a potential yield decrease of 26 compared to normal conditions in egypt almost the entire crop area is irrigated except for some rain fed areas on the mediterranean coast hereher 2013 as a country with a deep rooted agriculture history agriculture is by far the main consumer of water resources in egypt the nile river is the main source of fresh water in the country with a share of more than 95 el nashar and elyamany 2018 lake nasser on nile river the largest reservoir in southern egypt provides 55 57 5 billion m3 annually egypt mwri et al 2015 agriculture and irrigation are virtually fully reliant on nile water irrigated agriculture in egypt accounts for 86 of water withdrawal or rather annual water resources swain 2011 and 89 of the nile flow osman et al 2016 nile water alone covers almost 80 of these requirements osman et al 2016 given the limited regional supply of water the situation in egypt is much aggravated as increasing food demand of the growing population exceeds natural recharge as well as the ongoing depletion of water resources threatens the sustainability of livelihoods in the country lichtfouse 2013 ashour et al 2009 stated that the limited amount of water in egypt imposes serious restrictions on the current and prospective economic development in this sense the rate of groundwater exploitation has risen markedly in recent decades to absorb touted expansionary ambitions omar and moussa 2016 groundwater supplies 8 of water requirements for agriculture although it is a very limited water resource groundwater has long been recognized as playing an important role in recent agriculture in egypt swain 2011 in parallel agricultural drainage water was not immune to this reality the reuse of drainage water for irrigation is well developed in egypt abdel azim and allam 2005 currently about 5 5 billion cubic meters per year bcm yr of drainage water are being reused after mixing with fresh water with an expectation to increase by more than 9 6 bcm by the year 2020 abdel shafy and mansour 2013 there are many drawbacks in pursuing this approach for example the extensive use of drainage water including wastewater can increase agriculture induced pollution eldridge 1963 as well as causing serious environmental and health threats shakir et al 2017 in fact with a current water shortage in egypt expected to continuously increase to more than 13 5 bcm yr the food and water security will be more challenging in the foreseeable future predictably egypt will need much greater share of nile water almost 50 more of nile water by 2050 to cover the potential shortage lichtfouse 2013 for centuries flood irrigation has been the base of agriculture in egypt and is considered the largest consumer of freshwater resources throughout the country irrespective of advantages larger water losses occur due to evaporation wind drift run off and water sinking deep below the root zone additionally in most production regions of row crops including field and vegetable crops such as cotton maize tomato potato onion etc furrow irrigation is a common practice it is widely used on millions of feddans especially in the old land of nile delta rescheduling irrigation systems with maximizing water productivity is a top priority in the contemporary egypt for increasing crop production and conserving scarce water resources a promising technique has recently received positive feedback among irrigators namely cut off irrigation different concepts of the significance of cut off irrigation were presented irrigation cut off strategies may be seen as the complete suppressing of irrigation during a given phenological phase which is insensitive to water deficit and reestablishing it only when a threshold value is reached ahumada orellana et al 2017 traditionally it involves shutting down the inflow of water onto a field before the surface wetted front reaches the lower end of the field the infiltration undertakes the task of saturating the entire field with the same amount of water oda oregon department of agriculture 2006 this approach allows plants to maintain high net primary productivity coupled with improving quality of post harvesting properties within crops with little or no return flows this method is vital for protecting water quality and reducing pollution by mineral fertilizers additional benefits are achieved by diverting saved water to irrigate other crops or for other beneficial uses wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2015 the main objective of the current study is to examine the efficiency of cut off irrigation technique in improving productivity and post harvesting properties of some onion cultivars including quality and storability the best cultivar with respect to surface irrigation design variables was identified some aspects of plant based water requirements were also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the experimental farm of sakha agricultural research station which is part of the research sector of the ministry of agriculture and land reclamation of egypt as the name indicates it is centrally located in and now surrounded by the city of sakha kafr el sheikh governorate 135 km north of cairo it is mainly found at an altitude of 6 m above sea level the site is situated at latitude of 31 07 n and longitude of 30 57 e kafr al sheikh is considered to have a desert climate during the year there is virtually no rainfall the rainy season extends from late october to april and reaches its highest

characteristics of the experimental site prior to transplanting of the plant material and addition of mineral fertilizers representative soil samples were collected from the research field four different samples were taken in this regard with a soil auger from four consecutive layers every 15 cm depth to a total depth of 60 cm and analyzed for physical and chemical properties tables 2 and 3 soil sampling depths were determined based on studied characteristics taking into account the plants rooting depth and soil horizons certain physical properties were determined in the field such as soil field capacity fc finding field capacity involved irrigating a test plot 1 1 m2 until the soil profile is saturated to a depth of about one meter then covering the top with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation the soil moisture was measured each 12 h until the changes reached a constant rate or were very tenuous at which point the soil moisture content was the estimate of field capacity soil moisture content was determined as detailed in a subsequent section of this study other properties including permanent wilting point pwp available water aw and soil bulk density bd were determined by laboratory methods according to james 1988 and klute 1986 soil texture i e relative proportions of sand silt and clay of the experimental area was determined following the method of klute 1986 the soil was classified as eutrophic with a clay texture the average content of sand silt and clay were 16 1 15 3 and 68 7 respectively water content at field capacity varied from 38 8 to 47 8 by volume and wilting point from 19 7 to 24 7 soil bulk densities ranged from 1 17 to 1 33 g cm3 table 2 chemical properties including total soluble salts ec soil ph soluble cations and anions were assessed for the experimental site according to the methods described by jackson 1973 soil sulfate so4 2 determination was calculated as a difference between soluble cations and anions table 3 2 3 treatment structure and crop management a field trial was conducted in this regard during two consecutive winter seasons of 2014 2015 2015 2016 with the use of three onion cultivars and four cut off furrow irrigation treatments furrow irrigation is a common traditional irrigation practice in most production regions of onions in egypt including the region that we are interested to take into account in this experiment onion seeds namely giza red giza 20 and behairy red were purchased from field crops research institute agricultural research center ministry of agriculture and land reclamation egypt the seeds were hand drilled in the nursery bed on 8th and 9th october in the two successive seasons respectively seedlings of nearly sixty days old e g when they usually were 25 cm in height were uprooted tied and transported to transplanting in the permanent field on 10 12 december in both seasons the seedlings were grown using cultural practices standard for high production such as fertilization planting density and sound pest management seedlings were planted into rows with shallow furrows along the ridge top and watered separately the recommended doses of phosphorus 107 1 kg ha as calcium superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and potassium 119 0 kg ha as potassium sulphate 48 k2o as well as well aged cattle manure were added once by broadcasting during soil preparation nitrogen fertilizer 285 6 kg ha n in the form of ammonium nitrate 33 5 n 852 0 kg ha was added after transplanting in two 426 0 kg doses at the first irrigation 25 dat and 30 days later the experiment

and behairy red a constant interval 25 35 days was regularly used to irrigate onion cultivars based on soil moisture content and our specific observations on the performance of onion leaves soil moisture content wet weight basis was determined gravimetrically on oven dry basis before and after each irrigation from planting to harvesting time with the use of a soil sampling auger duplicate samples were taken at several locations 5 200 g from constant depth 60 cm the effective root zone within the experimental site and mixed thoroughly composite subsamples of about 100 gm were placed in tightly closed aluminum cans four subsamples were taken and subjected to moisture evaluation they were weighted dried in an electrical oven at a constant temperature of 105 c for a period of 24 h then reweighted and the soil moisture content on the dry weight base were determined the gravimetric soil water content was measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried according to the following formula goyal 2012 pw sw sd sd 100 where pw percentage of water by weight on dry basis sw weight of the wet soil sample and sd weight of dry sample 2 4 sampling procedure and data

randomly taken for phytochemical analysis bulb tissues were oven aired at 70 c until constant weight was reached the samples were ground into fine powder using automatic gridding machine and stored refrigerated at about 4 c into air tight glass bottles with light excluded until use the powdered samples were wet digested as described by wolf 1982 and then assessed for their composition of total nitrogen phosphorous and potassium components nitrogen percentage was determined by the method provided by hach et al 1985 phosphorus and potassium contents ppm were estimated according to a o a c 1990 knudsen et al 1982 respectively 2 4 3 storage losses 2 4 3 1 storage conditions after curing under a shade for 10 days in order to heal wounds onion bulbs without foliage were sorted out and graded into various size categories e g below 40 mm between 40 and 70 mm and above 70 mm in diameter a mixed sample of all sizes 10 kg healthy and non sprouted bulbs was taken from each plot each bulb was weighed using electronic digital scale and its initial weight was recorded and labeled before it was introduced into the storage structure the bulbs were stored in a temperate region in a well ventilated storage room these bulbs were used each time to evaluate the respective parameters the temperature and relative humidity of the storage room ambient conditions were monitored on a daily basis throughout the storage period ambient storage atmosphere having 25 28 c maximum and 13 11 c minimum average temperatures with 62 42 mean relative humidity during both storage seasons the pathological and physiological activities of these bulbs were carefully monitored and the weight of spoiled onions in the form of rotting sprouted bulbs physiological weight loss and total weight loss in each lot were determined and recorded throughout the storage period from may to november 2 4 3 2 physiological loss in weight the physiological loss in weight was determined by periodical weighing of onion bulbs at 60 120 and 180 days after storage using a digital electronic balance the cumulative loss in weight of bulbs was calculated which was based on the initial bulb weight nouri and toofanian 2001 and expressed as percent physiological loss in weight for each treatment using the equation given below as was described by sharma et al 2020 pwl w 0 w 1 or w 2 or w 3 w 0 100 where pwl

storage days the bulb showing a sprout rotting were weighed then recorded and separated from the lot the sprouted rotted onions were discarded each time so as to avoid double measurement and potential infection the onion bulb was considered rotten when it became softened and sticky based on the physical observation of its texture using hand feel particularly around the neck area another area considered beyond the rot based smell was the change in colour the onion bulb was considered sprouted when the leaf primordia of stored onion bulbs began to develop green leaves from the neck bulbs that were sprouted and rotted at the same time were considered as sprouted the percentage of srl ssl was calculated based on the initial bulb weight under each treatment nouri and toofanian 2001 using

variance anova according to the standard procedure of snedecor and cochran 1980 and the means were compared using lsd test to check difference at 5 significant level all statistical analyses were performed with a software package costat statistical software version 6 311 costat statistical software 2005 a product of cohort software monterey california 3 results and discussion 3 1 onion bulbs yield irrigation influenced onion productivity in terms of average bulb weight cull bulbs total and marketable yields the highest increase in total and marketable yields was reached with 80 irrigation the lowest results were achieved at 70 irrigation more cull onions were produced as the water deficit increased table 4 the statistical analysis carried out in this regard to reveal any differences between the treatments in the test plants showed significant variation among the test varieties with fewer culls the giza red onion variety had the highest average bulb weight and total and marketable yield behairy red was equally good yet giza 20 gave the lowest marketable and total bulb yield with the highest values of culls bulbs the interaction between the two factors of the study irrigation and varieties highlighted giza red in association with irrigation at 80 of the basal level as the most efficient treatment onion cultivars had their inferior yields when grown under 70 irrigation level yields for all irrigation treatments were lower with giza 20 table 4 obviously controlled irrigation is necessary to sustain plant life and to adhere plant to its maximum productive potential one obstacle is inadequate knowledge about proper irrigation levels levidow et al 2014 in the current study several key findings were evident and corroborate some of the results of previous research that showed that surface or flood irrigation including furrow irrigation resulting in saturated soil conditions contributes largely to make a poor growing environment for onion roots and foliage development baeza et al 2019 stated that the potential for reduced fertility exists via excessive water availability too much water severely limits the supply of oxygen that roots depend on to function properly most seriously affecting major water mediated physiological and biochemical processes jones 2007 in the end the outcome will be reflected in less vegetative growth and lower potential yield deficit irrigation causes similar vulnerabilities according to our results onion plants that did receive 80 irrigation level along the two growing seasons achieved unique results compared to those experienced over 100 or deficit irrigation 70 because this irrigation level provides optimal conditions during critical stages of crop development such as vegetative growth bulb initiation and latter stages of bulb enlargement according to published research the yield response could be related to a vigorous growth stage and a well established biomass production de bruyn 1982 unsaturated soil induces an increase in vegetative growth and bulbs could produce more with less water nagaz et al 2012 soil aeration li et al 2015 chen et al 2018 nutrient uptake effective delivery of necessary elements wang and xing 2016 lovelli et al 2017 and reducing the incidence of water borne or water related diseases marouelli et al 2004 café filho et al 2019 is more efficient under unsaturated soils besides low watering is more beneficial resulting in longer nutrients residence time in soil at 30 60 cm depths which contributes to increase soil fertility in most situations chilundo 2017 reduced irrigation also leads to decreased erosion and pollutants leaching from soils due to surface run off of pesticides and fertilizers which are detrimental to plant health and in some cases can result in the gradual death of the plants adeyemi et al 2017 good quality water can positively affect the quantity and quality of plant growth and yield de oliveira et al 2013 this may give a rational explanation for the mechanisms underlying the plant growth promoting effects of sound irrigation including the case we discus 80 irrigation treatment this experiment also showed a variation between onion varieties in that regard it might be suggested that giza red has good adaptability to study area and thus performed well this ability was facilitated by the use of the proper irrigation level unfortunately the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation rates was not discussed in great detail in published literature it has been proven that onion production is greatly influenced by irrigation and the latter has to be adjusted to climate conditions pejic et al 2011 in the study area in order to obtain a higher yield from all existing resources in general the wise use of production factors requires a basic understanding of the relationship between water soil climate conditions and the crop itself a distinct bulb yield was noted under the use of 80 irrigation level of the whole population of varieties this calls for the speculation that cut off irrigation before reaching 6 3 m from the downstream end e g 80 level thoroughly fits the water requirements of onions for high bulbs production these findings consistent with other study comparing irrigation treatments and corresponding yield results ortolá and knox 2015 suggest that while withholding water is very essential to establish robust root growth promote balanced vegetative growth and an abundant yield perea et al 2008 the optimal irrigation level is conditional upon multiple variables of climate changes and spatial variations of soils 3 2 onion quality quality parameters of onion bulbs e g bulb diameter tss and dm were found significantly affected by irrigation treatments table 5 the highest values were attained at 80 irrigation level irrigation at 90 water showed significantly similar results the lowest values were recorded for bulbs harvested from plants irrigated with 70 water treatment performance of onion varieties in respect of quality parameters was generally coherent among the two year experiments especially with tss and dm content no consistent significant results were found between the different varieties in bulb diameter through the two successive seasons the maximum bulb diameter was observed with giza red and behairy red the tss and dm were the highest in giza 20 the composite application of irrigation levels and onion varieties showed some variation in its effect on tss and dm content but was more significant in increasing bulb diameter the overall results indicated that among the interaction treatments giza red giza 20 under the use of 80 irrigation level showed the best quality parameters the lowest values were obtained from plants cultivated under 70 irrigation level in quality context irrigation has been found as a key factor for attracting attention chung 1989 the literature has identified a strong relation between irrigation and quality of onion bulb based on our findings onion plants that are away from precision irrigation experience problems in relation to quality standards the onion is described as being a shallow rooted plant with maximum roots in about 0 18 m top soil and only fewer roots penetrate deep in the soil drinkwater and janes 1955 cit ghodke et al 2018 therefore it is highly sensitive to water stress in particular during bulb formation and enlargement stage zayton 2007 and this might be the reason for the reported increase in quality when water was used at the proper rate few studies on this issue are available suggesting that adequate water supply enables plants to establish a strong nutrient base that supports higher quality properties boga et al 2001 fitsum et al 2016 tsegaye et al 2016 3 3 macro elements content bulb contents of the macro elements were found to be significantly affected in response to the different treatments table 6 while giza 20 had the highest percentage of npk elements the best results obtained were under conventional irrigation 100 level along the two successive seasons of the study behairy red was the lowest performer in this context the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation treatments did not record significant effect on the studied parameters except for phosphorous in the 2014 2015 growing season the abundance of irrigation water may be a major reason for increasing the plant s ability to absorb nutrients from the soil and thus accumulate them in the resultant bulbs these results match the observations that have been reported by geries et al 2015 that traditional irrigation which provides an abundant water supply like practiced by local farmers significantly increased npk contents of onion bulbs the relative decrease in element contents by applying the high yield irrigation treatment e g 80 of basal level could be related to the enlargement of onion bulbs thereby reducing the unit amount of these elements dilution effect 3 4 storage losses treatment induced effects in terms of sprouting rotting physiological weight loss and total loss in weight of onion bulbs after designated days of storage displayed a strong relationship with irrigation treatments table 7 irrigation below 100 water level resulted in decreased weight loss sprouting and rotting in onion bulbs stored for 180 days the total weight loss was the lowest under irrigation level of 80 and 70 while the maximum weight loss was observed in bulb grown under 100 and 90 irrigation waters giza 20 had the highest percentage of healthy bulbs and disease free tissues with a higher moisture content the best treatment was a combination of 70 irrigation water with giza 20 variety equally good results were obtained under the use of 80 irrigation level obviously losses due to rotting sprouting and physiological weight loss were found higher in more irrigated treatments over irrigation during bulb formation provides a great potential for increasing the moisture content of the resulting bulbs and exposing them to water loss thereafter it may also be a key cause of sprouting and rotting during storage these results are consistent with the observations of many researchers that bulbs under the high irrigation rate in the field are most influenced during storage enciso et al 2009 biswas et al 2010 in fact wise irrigation greatly facilitates the maintenance of some quality features bhagyawant et al 2016 by enhancing moisture content and safeguarding against microbial attack which is very important to ensure optimum quality in storage islam et al 2019 however irrigation during plant life cycle is not only the main cause of the observed effects factors like weather disturbance and straight fertilization strongly impact onion storage abou el hassan et al 2018 intensive np application for example was found retardant for good storability by enhancing sprouting and rotting percentage tekalign et al 2012 3 5 seasonal applied water the amount of seasonal applied water includes total supplied water during irrigation and effective rainfall given the data obtained the seasonal amount of water was clearly affected by irrigation treatment applied table 8 the highest overall mean value during the two growing seasons 59 98 cm 5997 99 m3 ha was recorded with the use of traditional irrigation technique 100 the lowest mean value was found to pertain to 70 irrigation treatment 42 49 cm 4249 23 m3 ha generally the amount of water given during the 80 irrigation treatment lies in a moderate position 48 02 cm 4802 22 m3 ha between the 70 and 90 55 71 cm 5570 94 m3 ha treatments there was no discrepancy between varieties the total water supplied to a crop is mainly related to the irrigation scheme moursi et al 2014 geries et al 2015 practically the effective water saving irrigation treatment without detrimentally affecting onion production pertains to 80 irrigation level compared to the control this treatment resulted in saving 1195 77 m3 of irrigation water i e 11 96 cm in depth height which is equivalent to 19 94 of the amount of water used in the traditional technique or control 100 the amount of saved water was more in the 70 irrigation treatment 1748 76 m3 17 49 cm in height 29 16 on control basis this treatment can only be considered feasible if the benefit from saving water outweighs the decrease in onion bulb yield which needs further investigation 3 6 consumptive water use data presented in table 9 indicate that the mean values of cu were clearly affected by both irrigation treatments and onion cultivars the highest values 36 71 cm 3670 60 m3 ha were for full irrigation treatment 100 while they were less by an estimated amount of 34 77 cm 3476 56 m3 ha 30 10 cm 3009 70 m3 ha and 26 33 cm 2632 71 m3 ha under 90 80 and 70 irrigation treatments respectively there was a quite marked difference in the evenness of the varieties the data showed giza red as the most water consuming 33 90 cm 3389 55 m3 ha variety throughout the two successive seasons irrespective of the watering level imposed basically the variation in the data related to the cu underlies the amount of irrigation water applied through the different treatments and the plant performance of the three onion cultivars there is a reciprocal relationship between the vegetative growth of all the crop species and cu of water the abundance of water supports robust plants with good and dense vegetative cover the larger the vegetative surface the greater the capacity of plant evapotranspiration senay et al 2016 this may explain the high consumptive water use under full irrigation treatment compared to water stress treatment e g 70 water these results corroborate the findings of a great deal of the previous work in this field el ramady et al 2013 moursi et al 2014 according to the well reported data from grigorov 2017 water for onion cultivation is consumed most effectively based on the maintenance of a given threshold of pre irrigation soil moisture in a layer to 0 4 m the thresholds are 80 and 70 of the optimal moisture capacity in the stages from transplanting till the beginning of the active growth of the onions and during the active growth till to the beginning of ripening respectively the author added that the onions grown in the areas of such moisture capacity are characterized by the highest consumptive water use 5370 5580 m3 ha and the rational use of water resources is ensured by the formation of the highest yields this confirms the fact that cu is conditional to the amount of water applied 3 7 water consumptive use efficiency water consumptive use efficiency per cent is illustrated in table 9 the results showed that the overall average values for ecu were slightly affected by irrigation treatments contrary to onion cultivars regarding to cultivars effect maximum value 65 85 was found for giza red variety the lowest value belongs to giza 20 59 33 the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation treatment revealed a higher impact in terms of the data obtained overall giza red cultivar had the highest ecu value with the use of different irrigation treatments these findings are in the same line with those obtained by moursi et al 2014 and geries et al 2015 according to the well documented information reduced irrigation is an effective way to maximize water use efficiency bouazzama et al 2012 the values of ecu may also indicate a large proportion of irrigation water being lost through deep percolation because of over irrigation in most treatments indeed accumulation of water in the furrows encourages deeper percolation but for this to be useful to the crop the soil s available water capacity must be sufficiently high to retain the accumulated water within reach of the crop roots shaxson and barber 2003 3 8 water productivity and productivity of irrigation water data in table 10 show that the overall average values for wp and piw were clearly affected by irrigation treatments where the highest values were recorded under 80 irrigation level and the values were 11 92 and 7 47 kg m3 for wp and piw respectively by contrary the lowest average values were recorded under the full irrigation treatment and the values were 8 82 and 5 40 kg m3 for wp and piw respectively the overall average values for wp and piw were also affected by onion varieties the ranking in terms of the highest wp values was for behairy red 10 63 kg m3 followed by giza red 10 43 kg m3 and giza 20 9 92 kg m3 the highest piw value however was recorded with giza red 6 86 kg m3 followed by behairy red 6 48 kg m3 and giza 20 5 89 kg m3 in fact no much differences were noted between giza red and behairy red to give one advantage over the other regarding both studied parameters reason for difference between wp and piw values is related to the quantity of water used in both estimations applied water and water consumptive use in general the overall average values for wp and piw were increased in water restricted irrigation treatments this might be due to decreasing the values of applied water and water consumptive use under these conditions compared to full irrigated control which received the highest values of applied water and water consumptive use temesgen et al 2018 reported that maximum water productivity can be obtained under deficit irrigation despite opposition from some influential researchers mubarak and hamdan 2018 4 conclusions sound irrigation is an indicator of the efficiency of crop production system and has a meaningful impact in several ways it has been suggested that the cut off irrigation technique is useful in enhancing onion yield improving bulb quality and storability and increasing the efficiency of water use e g producing the same output with less water the results albeit conflicting were promising for the cultivars and soil tried we agree that these findings may provide a platform for further research on other field and vegetable crops such as cotton maize potato or tomato under different environmental conditions cut off irrigation can be as efficient as most other irrigation methods but such efficiency requires knowing how much water should be applied and scheduling applications according to soil water levels crop needs and accompanying environmental conditions a major finding in this study is the strong water yield relationship as evidenced by some measures of water use by the plant and their implications on yield and associated characters based on the fact that onions have limited water consumption and restricted easy access to water controlling plant water potentials via managing irrigation practices could add much to onions production as demonstrated by the results of this study particularly excellent results were obtained under 80 water supply with the use of giza red variety this current understanding of the nature of the relationship between the type of cultivated variety and water use provides major scope to save significant amounts of water and improve water use under deficit irrigation systems

10343,water management is becoming commonplace in discussions of high yield farming and modern agricultural best practices a field experiment undertaken in the northern region of egypt kafr el sheikh governorate with four cut off furrow irrigation treatments 100 full irrigation considered as a control 90 80 and 70 of strip length was used to compare the effects of reduced water supply on onion allium cepa l production via assessing three different cultivars e g giza red giza 20 and behairy red a strip plot design with three replicates was employed in this regard during two successive seasons 2014 2015 2015 2016 regardless of onion type water supply at 80 level resulted in higher marketable and total bulb yield t ha with improved quality traits and storability compared to other irrigation treatments there have been few significant interspecies differences the most notable significant differences were recorded in giza red and behairy red for all studied characteristics the highest results were reached with giza red under the use of 80 irrigation level in addition to the excellence in improving the overall quality and harvestable yield this treatment 80 watering has produced relatively good results with respect to the consumptive water use efficiency water productivity and showed significant benefits in terms of saving irrigation water maximum water saving was obtained under the use of 70 irrigation treatment but in the absence of a good and economically unacceptable yield the traditional technique 100 water supply consumed much water surpassing the most effective treatment 80 by 1195 77 cubic meter per hectare i e 11 96 cm in depth height in conclusion cut off irrigation technique is considered an efficient and effective intervention approach for onion yield increases while maintaining post harvesting quality and water savings however extending the study beyond onion is critical to increase the range of benefit with regard to other crops as well for adequate management of water under deficit irrigation conditions keywords cut off irrigation onion water management water relations storability yield 1 introduction onion allium cepa l is one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide it is grown for its precious bulb and flavoured leaves even though it is a temperate crop onion can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions from relatively hot and dry areas to fairly cool and humid zones purseglove 1985 kariuki and kimani 1994 khokhar 2014 partly for this reason its species can be found across the world in europe asia north america and africa as a crop of high nutritional and economic values onion ranks high among the egyptian society the early availability of the crop for foreign markets and the relatively high quality make it a commodity of international repute because of their storage characteristics and durability for shipping onions have always been traded more widely than most vegetables it is considered the second most important horticultural crop after tomatoes murray 2012 over the past ten years world onion production has increased by more than 25 griffiths et al 2002 countries with more evenly distributed production witness more frequent changes in ranking of the top producers in 2017 the world production of dried onion was around 97 7 million tons compared to 93 2 in 2016 hanci 2018 led by china 25 and india 23 of the world total fao 2017 egypt occupies a unique position among the top ten producing countries fourth with an average annual production of 1450 978 tons during the last 21 years hanci 2018 and a higher average yield per area of 30 57 36 16 tons ha aliyu et al 2007 gebretsadik and dechassa 2018 according to fao data and more evenly with iran the total production of onions in egypt reached 2 4 million tons skipping russia and turkey which registered 2 1 million tons each fao 2017 today the world consumption of onions is increasing dramatically partially because of intense promotion that links flavour and health rodrigues et al 2003 tn et al 2005 corzo martínez and villamiel 2012 research on onion benefits received an added impulse beyond basic nutrition with the discovery of a large and diverse group of bioactive compounds that has substantial health benefits and some have been investigated extensively for their chemopreventive therapeutic potential especially in the reduction of risk of development of chronic diseases goldman et al 1996 galeone et al 2006 szalay 2017 being a high yielding crop onion is generally voracious consumer of soil nutrients and requires a nitrogen rich npk fertilizer to support healthy growth yaso and abdel razzak 2007 mogren et al 2008 el hadidi et al 2016 liberal application of the major npk elements can lead to good results in promoting growth and increasing average yield nevertheless balanced application at the appropriate physiological stage leads to greater results yinpo 1997 ariyama et al 2006 gebretsadik and dechassa 2018 onion is often considered to be a medium water user physiologically water stress seriously affects growth yield and quality of onion bulbs kandil et al 2011 bagali et al 2012 khokhar 2018 with a relatively shallow root zone onions take up most of their water requirements from the top 30 cm of the soil profile and therefore are more vulnerable to damage by water stress zayton 2007 pejic et al 2014 according to khokhar 2017 lack of irrigation results in a shorter duration of bulb growth a lower percentage of radiation interception and a lower efficiency of conversion of energy to dry matter which all act against potential yield water deficit at specific stages can adversely affect the quality leading to reduced size and multi centered bulbs ortolá and knox 2015 the degree of influence typically varies from stage to the next and definitely adequate growth is preceded by a successful introduction stage research has confirmed that onion is more sensitive to water stress during bulb formation and enlargement than during vegetative growth stage khokhar 2017 some findings refer to a solid evidence that the growth period from 20 to 30 days after transplanting dat early bulb initiation stage is the most critical stage fluctuation of irrigation level during this time is destructive affecting survival rate and bulb quality kadam et al 2006 according to the previous authors plant becomes more tolerant as reaching the bulb maturity stage 90 110 dat where it is able to survive fluctuations in irrigation and produce marketable size bulbs ghodke et al 2018 overall pelter et al 2004 reported that onion growth is reduced by soil water stress imposed at any growth stage but the greatest effect can be at the 3 leaf 5 leaf and 7 leaf stages with a potential yield decrease of 26 compared to normal conditions in egypt almost the entire crop area is irrigated except for some rain fed areas on the mediterranean coast hereher 2013 as a country with a deep rooted agriculture history agriculture is by far the main consumer of water resources in egypt the nile river is the main source of fresh water in the country with a share of more than 95 el nashar and elyamany 2018 lake nasser on nile river the largest reservoir in southern egypt provides 55 57 5 billion m3 annually egypt mwri et al 2015 agriculture and irrigation are virtually fully reliant on nile water irrigated agriculture in egypt accounts for 86 of water withdrawal or rather annual water resources swain 2011 and 89 of the nile flow osman et al 2016 nile water alone covers almost 80 of these requirements osman et al 2016 given the limited regional supply of water the situation in egypt is much aggravated as increasing food demand of the growing population exceeds natural recharge as well as the ongoing depletion of water resources threatens the sustainability of livelihoods in the country lichtfouse 2013 ashour et al 2009 stated that the limited amount of water in egypt imposes serious restrictions on the current and prospective economic development in this sense the rate of groundwater exploitation has risen markedly in recent decades to absorb touted expansionary ambitions omar and moussa 2016 groundwater supplies 8 of water requirements for agriculture although it is a very limited water resource groundwater has long been recognized as playing an important role in recent agriculture in egypt swain 2011 in parallel agricultural drainage water was not immune to this reality the reuse of drainage water for irrigation is well developed

than 9 6 bcm by the year 2020 abdel shafy and mansour 2013 there are many drawbacks in pursuing this approach for example the extensive use of drainage water including wastewater can increase agriculture induced pollution eldridge 1963 as well as causing serious environmental and health threats shakir et al 2017 in fact with a current water shortage in egypt expected to continuously increase to more than 13 5 bcm yr the food and water security will be more challenging in the foreseeable future predictably egypt will need much greater share of nile water almost 50 more of nile water by 2050 to cover the potential shortage lichtfouse 2013 for centuries flood irrigation has been the base of agriculture in egypt and is considered the largest consumer of freshwater resources throughout the country irrespective of advantages larger water losses occur due to evaporation wind drift run off and water sinking deep below the root zone additionally in most production regions of row crops including field and vegetable crops such as cotton maize tomato potato onion etc furrow irrigation is a common practice it is widely used on millions of feddans especially in the old land of nile delta rescheduling irrigation systems with maximizing water productivity is a top priority in the contemporary egypt for increasing crop production and conserving scarce water resources a promising technique has recently received positive feedback among irrigators namely cut off irrigation different concepts of the significance of cut off irrigation were presented irrigation cut off strategies may be seen as the complete suppressing of irrigation during a given phenological phase which is insensitive to water deficit and reestablishing it only when a threshold value is reached ahumada orellana et al 2017 traditionally it involves shutting down the inflow of water onto a field before the surface wetted front reaches the lower end of the field the infiltration undertakes the task of saturating the entire field with the same amount of water oda oregon department of agriculture 2006 this approach allows plants to maintain high net primary productivity coupled with improving quality of post harvesting properties within crops with little or no return flows this method is vital for protecting water quality and reducing pollution by mineral fertilizers additional benefits are achieved by diverting saved water to irrigate other crops or for other beneficial uses wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2015 the main objective of the current study is to examine the efficiency of cut off irrigation technique in improving productivity and post harvesting properties of some onion cultivars including quality and storability the best cultivar with respect to surface irrigation design variables was identified some aspects of plant based water requirements were also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the experimental farm of sakha agricultural research station which is part of the research sector of the ministry of agriculture and land reclamation of egypt as the name indicates it is centrally located in and now surrounded by the city of sakha kafr el sheikh governorate 135 km north of cairo it is mainly found at an altitude of 6 m above sea level the site is situated at latitude of 31 07 n and longitude of 30 57 e kafr al sheikh is considered to have a desert climate during the year there is virtually no rainfall the rainy season extends from late october to april and reaches its highest level between january and march the average annual rainfall does not exceed 11 3 mm at the most according to the latest data published for the period between 2009 and 2020 anonymous 2020 the average annual minimum and maximum temperatures are 18 6 c and 29 8 c respectively the temperatures are higher on average in july at around 39 7 c the lowest average temperatures in the year occur in january

characteristics of the experimental site prior to transplanting of the plant material and addition of mineral fertilizers representative soil samples were collected from the research field four different samples were taken in this regard with a soil auger from four consecutive layers every 15 cm depth to a total depth of 60 cm and analyzed for physical and chemical properties tables 2 and 3 soil sampling depths were determined based on studied characteristics taking into account the plants rooting depth and soil horizons certain physical properties were determined in the field such as soil field capacity fc finding field capacity involved irrigating a test plot 1 1 m2 until the soil profile is saturated to a depth of about one meter then covering the top with a plastic sheet to prevent evaporation the soil moisture was measured each 12 h until the changes reached a constant rate or were very tenuous at which point the soil moisture content was the estimate of field capacity soil moisture content was determined as detailed in a subsequent section of this study other properties including permanent wilting point pwp available water aw and soil bulk density bd were determined by laboratory methods according to james 1988 and klute 1986 soil texture i e relative proportions of sand silt and clay of the experimental area was determined following the method of klute 1986 the soil was classified as eutrophic with a clay texture the average content of sand silt and clay were 16 1 15 3 and 68 7 respectively water content at field capacity varied from 38 8 to 47 8 by volume and wilting point from 19 7 to 24 7 soil bulk densities ranged from 1 17 to 1 33 g cm3 table 2 chemical properties including total soluble salts ec soil ph soluble cations and anions were assessed for the experimental site according to the methods described by jackson 1973 soil sulfate so4 2 determination was calculated as a difference between soluble cations and anions table 3 2 3 treatment structure and crop management a field trial was conducted in this regard during two consecutive winter seasons of 2014 2015 2015 2016 with the use of three onion cultivars and four cut off furrow irrigation treatments furrow irrigation is a common traditional irrigation practice in most production regions of onions in egypt including the region that we are interested to take into account in this experiment onion seeds namely giza red giza 20 and behairy red were purchased from field crops research institute agricultural research center ministry of agriculture and land reclamation egypt the seeds were hand drilled in the nursery bed on 8th and 9th october in the two successive seasons respectively seedlings of nearly sixty days old e g when they usually were 25 cm in height were uprooted tied and transported to transplanting in the permanent field on 10 12 december in both seasons the seedlings were grown using cultural practices standard for high production such as fertilization planting density and sound pest management seedlings were planted into rows with shallow furrows along the ridge top and watered separately the recommended doses of phosphorus 107 1 kg ha as calcium superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 and potassium 119 0 kg ha as potassium sulphate 48 k2o as well as well aged cattle manure were added once by broadcasting during soil preparation nitrogen fertilizer 285 6 kg ha n in the form of ammonium nitrate 33 5 n 852 0 kg ha was added after transplanting in two 426 0 kg doses at the first irrigation 25 dat and 30 days later the experiment was laid out in strip plot design with three replications r treatment over the two growing seasons in this context the horizontal strip plots h 31 50 m length 7 20 m width each 226 80 m2 in total were assigned to irrigation treatments i while vertical strip plots were assigned to onion cultivars 126 00 m length 2 40 m width each 302 40 m2 in total with a total number of 12 treatments the overall land area used was 226 80 h 4 i 3 r 2721 60 m2 the seven combined irrigation and variety treatments were outlined as follows horizontal strip plots included four irrigation treatments full irrigation

and behairy red a constant interval 25 35 days was regularly used to irrigate onion cultivars based on soil moisture content and our specific observations on the performance of onion leaves soil moisture content wet weight basis was determined gravimetrically on oven dry basis before and after each irrigation from planting to harvesting time with the use of a soil sampling auger duplicate samples were taken at several locations 5 200 g from constant depth 60 cm the effective root zone within the experimental site and mixed thoroughly composite subsamples of about 100 gm were placed in tightly closed aluminum cans four subsamples were taken and subjected to moisture evaluation they were weighted dried in an electrical oven at a constant temperature of 105 c for a period of 24 h then reweighted and the soil moisture content on the dry weight base were determined the gravimetric soil water content was measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried according to the following formula goyal 2012 pw sw sd sd 100 where pw percentage of water by weight on dry basis sw weight of the wet soil sample and sd weight of dry sample 2 4 sampling procedure and data

randomly taken for phytochemical analysis bulb tissues were oven aired at 70 c until constant weight was reached the samples were ground into fine powder using automatic gridding machine and stored refrigerated at about 4 c into air tight glass bottles with light excluded until use the powdered samples were wet digested as described by wolf 1982 and then assessed for their composition of total nitrogen phosphorous and potassium components nitrogen percentage was determined by the method provided by hach et al 1985 phosphorus and potassium contents ppm were estimated according to a o a c 1990 knudsen et al 1982 respectively 2 4 3 storage losses 2 4 3 1 storage conditions after curing under a shade for 10 days in order to heal wounds onion bulbs without foliage were sorted out and graded into various size categories e g below 40 mm between 40 and 70 mm and above 70 mm in diameter a mixed sample of all sizes 10 kg healthy and non sprouted bulbs was taken from each plot each bulb was weighed using electronic digital scale and its initial weight was recorded and labeled before it was introduced into the storage structure the bulbs were stored in a temperate region in a well ventilated storage room these bulbs were used each time to evaluate the respective parameters the temperature and relative humidity of the storage room ambient conditions were monitored on a daily basis throughout the storage period ambient storage atmosphere having 25 28 c maximum and 13 11 c minimum average temperatures with 62 42 mean relative humidity during both storage seasons the pathological and physiological activities of these bulbs were carefully monitored and the weight of spoiled onions in the form of rotting sprouted bulbs physiological weight loss and total weight loss

storage days the bulb showing a sprout rotting were weighed then recorded and separated from the lot the sprouted rotted onions were discarded each time so as to avoid double measurement and potential infection the onion bulb was considered rotten when it became softened and sticky based on the physical observation of its texture using hand feel particularly around the neck area another area considered beyond the rot based smell was the change in colour the onion bulb was considered sprouted when the leaf primordia of stored onion bulbs began to develop green leaves from the neck bulbs

water productivity and disagreement on the relevant equation there is a consensus on the numerator of piw being the marketable yield but the definition and components of the denominator differ among authors some consider just the irrigation water applied eid et al 2010 haile et al 2019 macêdo et al 2020 some others include both types of water gained irrigation and effective rainfall abdelkhalek et al 2015 awwad et al 2016 kassab et al 2019 2 5 statistical analysis data of all parameters including agronomic and irrigation parameters of onions were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance anova according to the standard procedure of snedecor and cochran 1980 and the means were compared using lsd test to check difference at 5 significant level all statistical analyses were performed with a software package costat statistical software version 6 311 costat statistical software 2005 a product of cohort software monterey california 3 results and discussion 3 1 onion bulbs yield irrigation influenced onion productivity in terms of average bulb weight cull bulbs total and marketable yields the highest increase in total and marketable yields was reached with 80 irrigation the lowest results were achieved at 70 irrigation more cull onions were produced as the water deficit increased table 4 the statistical analysis carried out in this regard to reveal any differences between the treatments in the test plants showed significant variation among the test varieties with fewer culls the giza red onion variety had the highest average bulb weight and total and marketable yield behairy red was equally good yet giza 20 gave the lowest marketable and total bulb yield with the highest values of culls bulbs the interaction between the two factors of the study irrigation and varieties highlighted giza red in association with irrigation at 80 of the basal level as the most efficient treatment onion cultivars had their inferior yields when grown under 70 irrigation level yields for all irrigation treatments were lower with giza 20 table 4 obviously controlled irrigation is necessary to sustain plant life and to adhere plant to its maximum productive potential one obstacle is inadequate knowledge about proper irrigation levels levidow et al 2014 in the current study several key findings were evident and corroborate some of the results of previous research that showed that surface or flood irrigation including furrow irrigation resulting in saturated soil conditions contributes largely to make a poor growing environment for onion roots and foliage development baeza et al 2019 stated that the potential for reduced fertility exists via excessive water availability too much water severely limits the supply of oxygen that roots depend on to function properly most seriously affecting major water mediated physiological and biochemical processes jones 2007 in the end the outcome will be reflected in less vegetative growth and lower potential yield deficit irrigation causes similar vulnerabilities according to our results onion plants that did receive 80 irrigation level along the two growing seasons achieved unique results compared to those experienced over 100 or deficit irrigation 70 because this irrigation level provides optimal conditions during critical stages of crop development such as vegetative growth bulb initiation and latter stages of bulb enlargement according to published research the yield response could be related to a vigorous growth stage and a well established biomass production de bruyn 1982 unsaturated soil induces an increase in vegetative growth and bulbs could produce more with less water nagaz et al 2012 soil aeration li et al 2015 chen et al 2018 nutrient uptake effective delivery of necessary elements wang and xing 2016 lovelli et al 2017 and reducing the incidence of water borne or water related diseases marouelli et al 2004 café filho et al 2019 is more efficient under unsaturated soils besides low watering is more beneficial resulting in longer nutrients residence time in soil at 30 60 cm depths which contributes to increase soil fertility in most situations chilundo 2017 reduced irrigation also leads to decreased erosion and pollutants leaching from soils due to surface run off of pesticides and fertilizers which are detrimental to plant health and in some cases can result in the gradual death of the plants adeyemi et al 2017 good quality water can positively affect the quantity and quality of plant growth and yield de oliveira et al 2013 this may give a rational explanation for the mechanisms underlying the plant growth promoting effects of sound irrigation including the case we discus 80 irrigation treatment this experiment also showed a variation between onion varieties in that regard it might be suggested that giza red has good adaptability to study area and thus performed well this ability was facilitated by the use of the proper irrigation level unfortunately the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation rates was not discussed in great detail in published literature it has been proven that onion production is greatly influenced by irrigation and the latter has to be adjusted to climate conditions pejic et al 2011 in the study area in order to obtain a higher yield from all existing resources in general the wise use of production factors requires a basic understanding of the relationship between water soil climate conditions and the crop itself a distinct bulb yield was noted under the use of 80 irrigation level of the whole population of varieties this calls for the speculation that cut off irrigation before reaching 6 3 m from the downstream end e g 80 level thoroughly fits the water requirements of onions for high bulbs production these findings consistent with other study comparing irrigation treatments and corresponding yield results ortolá and knox 2015 suggest that while withholding water is very essential to establish robust root growth promote balanced vegetative growth and an abundant yield perea et al 2008 the optimal irrigation level is conditional upon multiple variables of climate changes and spatial variations of soils 3 2 onion quality quality parameters of onion bulbs e g bulb diameter tss and dm were found significantly affected by irrigation treatments table 5 the highest values were attained at 80 irrigation level irrigation at 90 water showed significantly similar results the lowest values were recorded for bulbs harvested from plants irrigated with 70 water treatment performance of onion varieties in respect of quality parameters was generally coherent among the two year experiments especially with tss and dm content no consistent significant results were found between the different varieties in bulb diameter through the two successive seasons the maximum bulb diameter was observed with giza red and behairy red the tss and dm were the highest in giza 20 the composite application of irrigation levels and onion varieties showed some variation in its effect on tss and dm content but was more significant in increasing bulb diameter the overall results indicated that among the interaction treatments giza red giza 20 under the use of 80 irrigation level showed the best quality parameters the lowest values were obtained from plants cultivated under 70 irrigation level in quality context irrigation has been found as a key factor for attracting attention chung 1989 the literature has identified a strong relation between irrigation and quality of onion bulb based on our findings onion plants that are away from precision irrigation experience problems in relation to quality standards the onion is described as being a shallow rooted plant with maximum roots in about 0 18 m top soil and only fewer roots penetrate deep in the soil drinkwater and janes 1955 cit ghodke et al 2018 therefore it is highly sensitive to water stress in particular during bulb formation and enlargement stage zayton 2007 and this might be the reason for the reported increase in quality when water was used at the proper rate few studies on this issue are available suggesting that adequate water supply enables plants to establish a strong nutrient base that supports higher quality properties boga et al 2001 fitsum et al 2016 tsegaye et al 2016 3 3 macro elements content bulb contents of the macro elements were found to be significantly affected in response to the different treatments table 6 while giza 20 had the highest percentage of npk elements the best results obtained were under conventional irrigation 100 level along the two successive seasons of the study behairy red was the lowest performer in this context the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation treatments did not record significant effect on the studied parameters except for phosphorous in the 2014 2015 growing season the abundance of irrigation water may be a major reason for increasing the plant s ability to absorb nutrients from the soil and thus accumulate them in the resultant bulbs these results match the observations that have been reported by geries et al 2015 that traditional irrigation which provides an abundant water supply like practiced by local farmers significantly increased npk contents of onion bulbs the relative decrease in element contents by applying the high yield irrigation treatment e g 80 of basal level could be related to the enlargement of onion bulbs thereby reducing the unit amount of these elements dilution effect 3 4 storage losses treatment induced effects in terms of sprouting rotting physiological weight loss and total loss in weight of onion bulbs after designated days of storage displayed a strong relationship with irrigation treatments table 7 irrigation below 100 water level resulted in decreased weight loss sprouting and rotting in onion bulbs stored for 180 days the total weight loss was the lowest under irrigation level of 80 and 70 while the maximum weight loss was observed in bulb grown under 100 and 90 irrigation waters giza 20 had the highest percentage of healthy bulbs and disease free tissues with a higher moisture content the best treatment was a combination of 70 irrigation water with giza 20 variety equally good results were obtained under the use of 80 irrigation level obviously losses due to rotting sprouting and physiological weight loss were found higher in more irrigated treatments over irrigation during bulb formation provides a great potential for increasing the moisture content of the resulting bulbs and exposing them to water loss thereafter it may also be a key cause of sprouting and rotting during storage these results are consistent with the observations of many researchers that bulbs under the high irrigation rate in the field are most influenced during storage enciso et al 2009 biswas et al 2010 in fact wise irrigation greatly facilitates the maintenance of some quality features bhagyawant et al 2016 by enhancing moisture content and safeguarding against microbial attack which is very important to ensure optimum quality in storage islam et al 2019 however irrigation during plant life cycle is not only the main cause of the observed effects factors like weather disturbance and straight fertilization strongly impact onion storage abou el hassan et al 2018 intensive np application for example was found retardant for good storability by enhancing sprouting and rotting percentage tekalign et al 2012 3 5 seasonal applied water the amount of seasonal applied water includes total supplied water during irrigation and effective rainfall given the data obtained the seasonal amount of water was clearly affected by irrigation treatment applied table 8 the highest overall mean value during the two growing seasons 59 98 cm 5997 99 m3 ha was recorded with the use of traditional irrigation technique 100 the lowest mean value was found to pertain to 70 irrigation treatment 42 49 cm 4249 23 m3 ha generally the amount of water given during the 80 irrigation treatment lies in a moderate position 48 02 cm 4802 22 m3 ha between the 70 and 90 55 71 cm 5570 94 m3 ha treatments there was no discrepancy between varieties the total water supplied to a crop is mainly related to the irrigation scheme moursi et al 2014 geries et al 2015 practically the effective water saving irrigation treatment without detrimentally affecting onion production pertains to 80 irrigation level compared to the control this treatment resulted in saving 1195 77 m3 of irrigation water i e 11 96 cm in depth height which is equivalent to 19 94 of the amount of water used in the traditional technique or control 100 the amount of saved water was more in the 70 irrigation treatment 1748 76 m3 17 49 cm in height 29 16 on control basis this treatment can only be considered feasible if the benefit from saving water outweighs the decrease in onion bulb yield which needs further investigation 3 6 consumptive water use data presented in table 9 indicate that the mean values of cu were clearly affected by both irrigation treatments and onion cultivars the highest values 36 71 cm 3670 60 m3 ha were for full irrigation treatment 100 while they were less by an estimated amount of 34 77 cm 3476 56 m3 ha 30 10 cm 3009 70 m3 ha and 26 33 cm 2632 71 m3 ha under 90 80 and 70 irrigation treatments respectively there was a quite marked difference in the evenness of the varieties the data showed giza red as the most water consuming 33 90 cm 3389 55 m3 ha variety throughout the two successive seasons irrespective of the watering level imposed basically the variation in the data related to the cu underlies the amount of irrigation water applied through the different treatments and the plant performance of the three onion cultivars there is a reciprocal relationship between the vegetative growth of all the crop species and cu of water the abundance of water supports robust plants with good and dense vegetative cover the larger the vegetative surface the greater the capacity of plant evapotranspiration senay et al 2016 this may explain the high consumptive water use under full irrigation treatment compared to water stress treatment e g 70 water these results corroborate the findings of a great deal of the previous work in this field el ramady et al 2013 moursi et al 2014 according to the well reported data from grigorov 2017 water for onion cultivation is consumed most effectively based on the maintenance of a given threshold of pre irrigation soil moisture in a layer to 0 4 m the thresholds are 80 and 70 of the optimal moisture capacity in the stages from transplanting till the beginning of the active growth of the onions and during the active growth till to the beginning of ripening respectively the author added that the onions grown in the areas of such moisture capacity are characterized by the highest consumptive water use 5370 5580 m3 ha and the rational use of water resources is ensured by the formation of the highest yields this confirms the fact that cu is conditional to the amount of water applied 3 7 water consumptive use efficiency water consumptive use efficiency per cent is illustrated in table 9 the results showed that the overall average values for ecu were slightly affected by irrigation treatments contrary to onion cultivars regarding to cultivars effect maximum value 65 85 was found for giza red variety the lowest value belongs to giza 20 59 33 the interaction between onion cultivars and irrigation treatment revealed a higher impact in terms of the data obtained overall giza red cultivar had the highest ecu value with the use of different irrigation treatments these findings are in the same line with those obtained by moursi et al 2014 and geries et al 2015 according to the well documented information reduced irrigation is an effective way to maximize water use efficiency bouazzama et al 2012 the values of ecu may also indicate a large proportion of irrigation water being lost through deep percolation because of over irrigation in most treatments indeed accumulation of water in the furrows encourages deeper percolation but for this to be useful to the crop the soil s available water capacity must be sufficiently high to retain the accumulated water within reach of the crop roots shaxson and barber 2003 3 8 water productivity and productivity of irrigation water data in table 10 show that the overall average values for wp and piw were clearly affected by irrigation treatments where the highest values were recorded under 80 irrigation level and the values were 11 92 and 7 47 kg m3 for wp and piw respectively by contrary the lowest average values were recorded under the full irrigation treatment and the values were 8 82 and 5 40 kg m3 for wp and piw respectively the overall average values for wp and piw were also affected by onion varieties the ranking in terms of the highest wp values was for behairy red 10 63 kg m3 followed by giza red 10 43 kg m3 and giza 20 9 92 kg m3 the highest piw value however was recorded with giza red 6 86 kg m3 followed by behairy red 6 48 kg m3 and giza 20 5 89 kg m3 in fact no much differences were noted between giza red and behairy red to give one advantage over the other regarding both studied parameters reason for difference between wp and piw values is related to the quantity of water used in both estimations applied water and water consumptive use in general the overall average values for wp and piw were increased in water restricted irrigation treatments this might be due to decreasing the values of applied water and water consumptive use under these conditions compared to full irrigated control which received the highest values of applied water and water consumptive use temesgen et al 2018 reported that maximum water productivity can be obtained under deficit irrigation despite opposition from some influential researchers mubarak and hamdan 2018 4 conclusions sound irrigation is an indicator of the efficiency of crop production system and has a meaningful impact in several ways it has been suggested that the cut off irrigation technique is useful in enhancing onion yield improving bulb quality and storability and increasing the efficiency of water use e g producing the same output with less water the results albeit conflicting were promising for the cultivars and soil tried we agree that these findings may provide a platform for further research on other field and vegetable crops such as cotton maize potato or tomato under different environmental conditions cut off irrigation can be as efficient as most other irrigation methods but such efficiency requires knowing how much water should be applied and scheduling applications according to soil water levels crop needs and accompanying environmental conditions a major finding in this study is the strong water yield relationship as evidenced by some measures of water use by the plant and their implications on yield and associated characters based on the fact that onions have limited water consumption and restricted easy access to water controlling plant water potentials via managing irrigation practices could add much to onions production as demonstrated by the results of this study particularly excellent results were obtained under 80 water supply with the use of giza red variety this current understanding of the nature of the relationship between the type of cultivated variety and water use provides major scope to save significant amounts of water and improve water use under deficit irrigation systems

may help with the assessment of n fertilizer management to improve nitrogen use efficiency and to mitigate environmental pollution in this study the dssat ceres wheat model was calibrated and validated with two year field experiment which coupled with five n rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 and three irrigation levels 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation under drip irrigation the calibrated

increasing n application rates until it reached 180 kg ha 1 above 180 kg ha 1 negligible changes were measured in these values as the n rate increased the nitrogen physiological efficiency and nitrogen partial factor productivity were greatly improved at a n rate of 180 kg ha 1 compared with those at a n rate of 240 300 and 360 kg ha 1 consequently n rate of 180 kg ha 1 was the optimal nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat production these results may provide a scientific basis for nitrogen management of drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp graphical abstract ga1 keywords dssat ceres wheat model drip irrigation winter wheat nitrogen application rate long term weather data 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the main food crops in the north china plain ncp and accounts for approximately 60 80 of the wheat production of china du et al 2014 liang et al 2016 for conventional winter wheat production in the ncp over fertilization higher than 300 kg ha 1 ju et al 2009 pei et al 2015 tan et al 2017 has often been adopted by farmers to achieve high crop yields but this can also seriously reduce the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization ju et al 2009 furthermore inadequate n fertilizer management not only decreased the economic benefits received by farmers but also led to serious negative environmental impacts such as pollution of surface and ground water shan et al 2015 tan et al 2017 and increased greenhouse gas emissions liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 therefore optimal nitrogen management with high output low pollution and high use efficiency is critical to address these challenges and to ensure the sustainable development of winter wheat production in the ncp many methods have been found to be useful for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and for relieving environmental pollution including optimizing irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application sui et al 2015 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 use of advanced irrigation methods gao et al 2014 jha et al 2019 and use of a combination of organic and mineral fertilizers ding et al 2013 in recent years the application of drip irrigation has gradually increased for cereal crop production in arid and semi arid areas due to its benefits such as a reduction in irrigation water usage and improving the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization dar et al 2017 jha et al 2019 wang et al 2013 studies have shown that drip irrigation not only potentially guarantees a higher stability of crop yields but also may mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve irrigation water use efficiency mehmood et al 2019 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 determined that drip irrigation improved nitrogen use efficiency by ensuring the nitrogen supply to the topsoil layer and by increasing the total nitrogen accumulation of plants in the ncp some field experiments have been carried out to optimize the nitrogen fertilizer usage for drip irrigated wheat zhang et al 2017 pointed out that the n application of 190 kg ha 1 could keep yield steady for at least two years bai et al 2020 reported that the fertilization dose of 235 kg n ha 1 and 118 kg p2o5 ha 1 resulted in a yield increase of 4 0 and a partial factor productivity pfp increase of 48 5 for drip fertigated winter wheat compared to the average grain yield and pfp under the local surface irrigation regime our latest study showed that the n rate of 240 kg ha 1 could help to achieve maximum grain yield and high water use efficiency wue in two year field experiment si et al 2020 however these studies were performed for short periods of time and did not allow identifying optimal nitrogen application rate under various meteorological scenarios crop systems modeling has been proven to be a useful tool to investigate the impacts of climate variability and management strategies on crop productivity resource use efficiencies and environmental impacts of farming systems andarzian et al 2011 2015 matthews et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 of these models the dssat ceres wheat model has been widely evaluated and applied studies have shown that the dssat ceres wheat model performed satisfactorily in simulating the occurrence of phenological events biomass grain yield and actual evapotranspiration eta ahmed et al 2016 dar et al 2017 ji et al 2014 patel et al 2010 attia et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 used the dssat ceres wheat model for accurate prediction of winter wheat production and wue responses to surface irrigation management in the texas high plains and in the ncp respectively rinaldi 2004 conducted a seasonal analysis with the ceres wheat model and confirmed the optimal water availability at sowing and nitrogen management of durum wheat in italy timsina et al 2008 evaluated different sowing dates and irrigation scheduling for increasing yield and water productivity of wheat in india using the dssat ceres wheat model zhang et al 2019 simulated the long term effects of different plant densities and nitrogen rates on wheat productivity and nitrogen use under limiting surface irrigation conditions and concluded that nitrogen application of 180 kg ha 1 with 300 plants m 2 improved the long term nitrogen use stabilized grain yield and produced the highest net return however most simulations have been conducted using traditional surface irrigation and there are few reports that validate and evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model for drip irrigated winter wheat consequently further study is required to assess the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model under drip irrigation so that it can be used for the development of optimal nitrogen fertilizer management regimes for drip irrigated winter wheat the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model for simulating the phenology biomass yield eta and wue of drip irrigated winter wheat 2 to determine an optimal nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the study area based on different meteorological scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 field database field experiments were conducted across two growing

was sown on november 1 2015 and october 19 2016 and was then harvested on june 3 2016 and june 1 2017 respectively experiments consisted of five nitrogen fertilizer application rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n120 n180 n240 and n300 and three irrigation quota levels i e irrigation quota of 40 30 and 20 mm referred as i1 i2 and i3 there were 15 treatments with 3 replicates for a total of 45 plots plot size was 5 m 16 m a surface drip irrigation system was installed with a lateral spacing of 60 cm the irrigation system was turned on when the average soil water content 0 100 cm

converted to yield ha 1 2 2 description calibration and evaluation of the dssat ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model v4 6 a component of the dssat software application program was calibrated and validated in this study it was embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call for common modules of weather soil soil plant atmosphere spam and management to simulate crop growth yield and carbon and water balances jones et al 2003 the main function of the weather module is to read or generate daily weather data the soil module integrates information from four sub modules soil water soil temperature soil carbon and nitrogen and soil dynamics computing and updating data daily for each soil layer jones et al 2003 the spam module brings together soil plant and atmosphere inputs and computes root water uptake potential evapotranspiration et as well as actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration et could be calculated either with the priestley taylor method ritchie 1972 or with the penman fao method the default priestley and taylor method requiring only daily solar radiation and temperature was used in our study the actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration is calculated by et details of these aspects can be found in jones et al 2003 the management module determines when field operations planting harvesting applying inorganic fertilizer irrigating and applying crop residue and organic material are performed by calling sub modules the dssat ceres wheat model operates on daily time steps and computes the state variable for

and mean absolute percentage error mape were used to evaluate the model prediction capacity as has been demonstrated by numerous previous studies attia et al 2016 farid et al 2015 patel et al 2017 the

dssat ceres wheat model was used to determine the optimal n application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the study area using long term weather datasets these weather datasets contained daily minimum and maximum temperatures daily rainfall and solar radiation from 1970 to 2010 and were obtained from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the meteorological station 35 32 n

the soil the awc is the difference between drained upper limit field capacity and drained lower limit wilting point the automatic irrigation threshold was set as 20 awc and the irrigation amount was set as 30 mm referred to jha et al 2019 this means that an irrigation amount of 30 mm was triggered when 80 of soil available water was depleted the growth stage gstd was calculated internally in the model from its own stage system which in turn is dependent on plant response to photoperiod vernalization and temperature timsina et al 2008 zadoks et al 1974 the end of irrigation application time was set as the completion of the late milk stage gstd 80 six simulated nitrogen rates were defined 0 120 180 240 300 and 360 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n120 n180 n240 n300 and n360 the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at sowing and in early march returning green stage accounting for 40 and 60 of total nitrogen fertilizer respectively ju et al 2009 phosphate and potassium fertilizer were applied at a rate of 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilizer the date of the initial conditions for simulation was the same as the planting date the initial swc for the 0 100 cm soil layers was set at 80 of the field capacity the initial ammonium n and nitrate n of the profile were set based on the field experiment data the planting date and simulation start date was set as 15th october which was consistent with the local planting date the model crop cultivar plant population row spacing and planting depth for different nitrogen treatments for 40 years was the same as that used in the model calibration and

coefficients were calibrated using observations in the minimum stress treatments n180i1 n240i1 and n300i1 in the 2016 2017 season the calibrated genetic coefficients are 50 49 76 04 710 9 29 35 30 51 1 538 and 97 79 for piv pid p5 g1 g2 g3 and phint respectively table 2 the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were same as observed dates the average are between simulated and observed shoot biomass grain yield eta and wue were 4 47 7 34 10 12 and 3 10 respectively these results confirmed that the ceres wheat model was successfully calibrated in the study area with a reliable result the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model was further evaluated using the field data from the rest of the field experiment no considered in the calibration process briefly discussed in the following section 3 1 1 phenology the simulated anthesis date and maturity date were consistent with observed values with an are of less than 3 in all treatments table 3 accordingly the nrmse and mape of the anthesis and maturity dates were below 2 table 4 it should be noticed that the simulated anthesis dates were same for all treatments but the observed anthesis dates in water and nitrogen deficit treatments were 2 4 days earlier than those in the minimum stress treatments table 3 3 1 2 grain yield and biomass the averaged are of grain yield and shoot biomass was 6 35 and 8 16 respectively in the 2015 2016 season and 2 71 and 11 84 respectively in the 2016 2017 season table 3 for the grain yield the nrmse and mape values were less than 10 table 4 for shoot biomass the nrmse and mape values were 10 97 and 9 53 while the r2 and d value were 0 84 and 0 92 respectively for the two seasons this shows the model could satisfactorily simulate the grain yield and shoot biomass the model could simulate yield and shoot biomass for the minimum stress treatments n180i1 n240i1 and n300i1 excellently with are ranging from 1 02 to 5 03 for two seasons table 3 the are of the grain yield and shoot biomass for the nitrogen stress treatments n0i1 and n120i1 was less than 11 while the are of grain yield and shoot biomass for the water stress treatments n120i3 n180i3 n240i3 and n300i3 was higher this revealed that the model still performed well under nitrogen stress conditions but had slightly low performance under water stress conditions the time course shoot biomass production during two growing seasons was simulated for different conditions adequate water and nitrogen n240i1 nitrogen stress n120i1 and water stress n240i3 fig 2 the model performed well for simulating shoot biomass under adequate water and nitrogen conditions as well as under low nitrogen conditions fig 2 a b however there was a large deviation between the simulated shoot biomass and the measured value during the late stages under water deficit conditions fig 2 c 3 1 3 eta and wue the averaged are of eta and wue were 7 22 and 7 24 respectively in 2015 2016 and 10 69 and 13 07 respectively in 2016 2017 table 3 the model has a good simulation effect on eta with nrmse mape r2 and d were 9 96 8 73 0 72 and 0 76 respectively in two seasons table 4 for wue the nrmse mape r2 and d were 11 29 9 83 0 65 and 0 82 respectively 3 2 scenario simulation using long term weather data 3 2 1 irrigation management the irrigation numbers and irrigation amount over 40 scenarios based on the ceres wheat model are showed in table 5 the number of irrigation per season depends on meteorological factors such as temperature radiation and rainfall during the growth period of winter wheat the irrigation numbers ranged from 3 times to 9 times during 40 seasons and the average irrigation frequency was 6 65 times the average irrigation amount during 40 seasons was 199 5 mm 3 2 2 grain yield and shoot biomass the average simulated grain yield during the 40 seasons ranged from 5946 to 9391 kg ha 1 for the various nitrogen application treatments table 6 the grain yield increased as the nitrogen rate increased but did not responded particularly to increased nitrogen levels when the nitrogen rate exceeded 180 kg ha 1 fig 3 a grain yield in the n180 treatment was increased by 49 69 and 9 49 respectively compared with the n0 and n120 treatments but was reduced by only 3 14 compared with the n240 treatment table 6 in a similar manner to the trend in grain yield the simulated shoot biomass was significantly affected by the nitrogen rate table 6 fig 3 b the average shoot biomass in the n120 n180 n240 n300 and n360 treatments increased by 39 66 53 65 60 05 63 31 and 65 10 respectively compared with the n0 treatment 3 2 3 water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and iwue increased as the nitrogen rate increased but the rate of increase gradually slowed down fig 4 a b the average of wue and iwue in the n180 treatment for the 40 seasons were 2 29 and 4 50 kg m 3 respectively which were 3 35 and 3 11 lower respectively compared with the n240 treatment table 6 however both npe and npfp decreased as the nitrogen rate increased fig 4 c d the average of npe and npfp in the n180 treatment for the 40 seasons was 6 14 and 29 15 higher respectively compared with the n240 treatment table 6 3 2 4 economic analysis the net margin response to nitrogen rate is shown in fig 5 the 40 year average net margin improved as the nitrogen rate increased ranging from 1212 to 2079 usd ha 1 among the six scenarios fig 5 table 6 the 240 kg n ha 1 application rate was dominant with the highest mean return 2102 usd ha 1 at the same time we should also note that the decrease in net margin from the n240 treatment to the n180 treatment was only 2 38 this indicates that although the net margin for the n rate at the 240 kg ha 1 application rate was the highest the n rate of 180 kg ha 1 could also be a good choice because it achieved a 97 62 maximum net margin using a substantially lower nitrogen application 4 discussion 4 1 validation and evaluation of dssat ceres wheat in our study the simulated dates of anthesis and maturity were consistent with observed values with an are of less than 3 in all treatments and nrmse and mape values less than 2 in both seasons table 3 table 4 however the model was not able to reflect the differences in phenological period among different treatments table 3 feng et al 2015 reported rmse of 1 83 and 3 56 days for time to anthesis and maturity timsina and humphreys 2006 reported that the ceres wheat predicted the anthesis and maturity dates quite well with nrmse 4 5 and d 0 94 0 99 while dar et al 2017 and yao et al 2015 pointed out that the simulated anthesis and maturity dates could not reflect the effect of water deficit on phenology this probably because the model considers phenological development as a function of temperature and does not focus much on the effects of irrigation and nitrogen application jones et al 2003 overall the model satisfactorily simulated the grain yield and shoot biomass nrmse and mape were less than 12 r2 and d ranged from 0 84 to 0 96 table 4 attia et al 2016 confirmed the ability of the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model to accurately simulate grain and biomass yields of winter wheat with nrmse 15 r2 0 85 and d 0 95 patel et al 2017 reported excellent performance of the simulated yield under well watered treatments with nrmse 3 and r2 0 9 but poor accuracy under water stress treatment with nrmse 11 1 and r2 0 63 yao et al 2015 reported average are of 27 60 between simulated and observed yield in water stress treatments in our study the model had a high simulation precision under different nitrogen application with adequate water supply while the simulation in water stress conditions were slightly poor table 3 fig 2 this may explain why the existing water stress module in the model did not accurately calculate the effect of water stress on yield and biomass therefore it is necessary to improve the performance of the model under water stress conditions the crm of 0 07 for wue during two seasons indicated that the model was slightly overestimating wue which may be due to the underestimated eta crm of 0 09 for eta however the acceptable performance of eta and wue prediction was indicated by high r2 and d r2 was 0 72 and 0 65 d was 0 76 and 0 82 as well as low nrmse and mape nrmse and mape were less than 12 table 4 several studies have reported good prediction of soil water eta and wue using the dssat model basso et al 2016 dar et al 2017 wang et al 2012 studies also reported that the dssat ceres wheat model underestimated et attia et al 2016 kang et al 2009 therefore some components of soil water balance should be improved to obtain more reasonable eta and wue in conclusion the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model performed well under different nitrogen application rates with adequate water supply and consequently it represents a promising tool to assist with the determination of the optimal nitrogen rate for winter wheat under drip irrigation 4 2 optimization of the nitrogen application rate of drip irrigated winter wheat using the dssat ceres wheat model at present n application rates ranging from 180 to 240 kg ha 1 are recommended to maximize the wheat yield for surface irrigation in the ncp wang et al 2014 2015 2017 zhang et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 reported that an n rate of 240 and 210 kg ha 1 with two different irrigation treatments produced the highest grain yield under field conditions zhang et al 2019 suggested that n application of 180 kg ha 1 improved grain yield and produced the highest net return by evaluating long term winter wheat production practices using the dssat ceres wheat model in this study the optimal nitrogen application rate was selected based on higher grain yields water nitrogen use efficiency and net margins although n rates of 0 120 kg ha 1 gave higher npe and npfp the grain yield net margins wue and iwue were much lower than under higher nitrogen application treatments grain yields and net margins with a nitrogen rate of 180 kg ha 1 increased significantly compared with lower nitrogen rate although they were slightly lower compared with higher nitrogen rates fig 3 a fig 5 interestingly compared to the n rate of 240 kg ha 1 the rate of 180 kg n ha 1 slightly decreased the wue and iwue but greatly improved the npe and npfp fig 4 a b c d in conclusion a nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 can be recommended as optimal for drip irrigated wheat the n rate of 180 kg ha 1 were consistent with the result from zhang et al 2017 in which 190 kg n ha 1 was considered as a suitable n application rate for a good and steady yield under drip fertigation in the near area this study is specifically for the soil in study region under drip irrigation given the target of high output and high efficiency nitrogen requirement could vary by soil type initial nitrogen content yield goal and profit goal further studies are required to determine the appropriate nitrogen application rates of drip irrigated winter wheat with various varieties various soil types various initial nitrogen content as well as given the targeted profit 5 conclusion the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model performed well when simulating the anthesis date maturity date shoot biomass grain yield and eta of drip irrigated winter wheat under different nitrogen application rates with adequate water supply however the simulation performance for grain yield and shoot biomass was slightly lower under water stress conditions the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model was also used to determine the most suitable nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat using 40 years of historical weather data simulated results indicated that a nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 could obtain high grain yields net margins wue and nitrogen use efficiency these results are helpful for developing scientific nitrogen management regime with high output low pollution and high

10344,improper application of nitrogen fertilizer for winter wheat production in the north china plain ncp limits n use efficiency and increases the risk of non point pollution crop simulation models may help with the assessment of n fertilizer management to improve nitrogen use efficiency and to mitigate environmental pollution in this study the dssat ceres wheat model was calibrated and validated with two year field experiment which coupled with five n rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 and three irrigation levels 40 30 and 20 mm per irrigation under drip irrigation the calibrated

rates 0 120 180 240 300 and 360 kg ha 1 under 40 meteorological scenarios and the results showed that grain yields water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency and net margins increased with increasing n application rates until it reached 180 kg ha 1 above 180 kg ha 1 negligible changes were measured in these values as the n rate increased the nitrogen physiological efficiency and nitrogen partial factor productivity were greatly improved at a n rate of 180 kg ha 1 compared with those at a n rate of 240 300 and 360 kg ha 1 consequently n rate of 180 kg ha 1 was the optimal nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat production these results may provide a scientific basis for nitrogen management of drip irrigated winter wheat in the ncp graphical abstract ga1 keywords dssat ceres wheat model drip irrigation winter wheat nitrogen application rate long term weather data 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the main food crops in the north china plain ncp and accounts for approximately 60 80 of the wheat production of china du et al 2014 liang et al 2016 for conventional winter wheat production in the ncp over fertilization higher than 300 kg ha 1 ju et al 2009 pei et al 2015 tan et al 2017 has often been adopted by farmers to achieve high crop yields but this can also seriously reduce the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization ju et al 2009 furthermore inadequate n fertilizer management not only decreased the economic benefits received by farmers but also led to serious negative environmental impacts such as pollution of surface and ground water shan et al 2015 tan et al 2017 and increased greenhouse gas emissions liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 therefore optimal nitrogen management with high output low pollution and high use efficiency is critical to address these challenges and to ensure the sustainable development of winter wheat production in the ncp many methods have been found to be useful for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and for relieving environmental pollution including optimizing irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer application sui et al 2015 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 use of advanced irrigation methods gao et al 2014 jha et al 2019 and use of a combination of organic and mineral fertilizers ding et al 2013 in recent years the application of drip irrigation has gradually increased for cereal crop production in arid and semi arid areas due to its benefits such as a reduction in irrigation water usage and improving the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization dar et al 2017 jha et al 2019 wang et al 2013 studies have shown that drip irrigation not only potentially guarantees a higher stability of crop yields but also may mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve irrigation water use efficiency mehmood et al 2019 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 determined that drip irrigation improved nitrogen use efficiency by ensuring the nitrogen supply to the topsoil layer and by increasing the total nitrogen accumulation of plants in the ncp some field experiments have been carried out to optimize the nitrogen fertilizer usage for drip irrigated wheat zhang et al 2017 pointed out that the n application of 190 kg ha 1 could keep yield steady for at least two years bai et al 2020 reported that the fertilization dose of 235 kg n ha 1 and 118 kg p2o5 ha 1 resulted in a yield increase of 4 0 and a partial factor productivity pfp increase of 48 5 for drip fertigated winter wheat compared to the average grain yield and pfp under the local surface irrigation regime our latest study showed that the n rate of 240 kg ha 1 could help to achieve maximum grain yield and high water use efficiency wue in two year field experiment si et al 2020 however these studies were performed for short periods of time and did not allow identifying optimal nitrogen application rate under various meteorological scenarios crop systems modeling has been proven to be a useful tool to investigate the impacts of climate variability and management strategies on crop productivity resource use efficiencies and environmental impacts of farming systems andarzian et al 2011 2015 matthews et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 of these models the dssat ceres wheat model has been widely evaluated and applied studies have shown that the dssat ceres wheat model performed satisfactorily in simulating the occurrence of phenological events biomass grain yield and actual evapotranspiration eta ahmed et al 2016 dar et al 2017 ji et al 2014 patel et al 2010 attia et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 used the dssat ceres wheat model for accurate prediction of winter wheat production and wue responses to surface irrigation management in the texas high plains and in the ncp respectively rinaldi 2004 conducted a seasonal analysis with the ceres wheat model and confirmed the optimal water availability at sowing and nitrogen management of durum wheat in italy timsina et al 2008 evaluated different sowing dates and irrigation scheduling for increasing yield and water productivity of wheat in india using the dssat ceres wheat model zhang et al 2019 simulated the long term effects of different plant densities and nitrogen rates on wheat productivity and nitrogen use under limiting surface irrigation conditions and concluded that nitrogen application of 180 kg ha 1 with 300 plants m 2 improved the long term nitrogen use stabilized grain yield and produced the highest net return however most simulations have been conducted using traditional surface irrigation and there are few reports that validate and evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model for drip irrigated winter wheat consequently further study is required to assess the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model under drip irrigation so that it can be used for the development of optimal nitrogen fertilizer management regimes for drip irrigated winter wheat the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres wheat model for simulating the phenology biomass yield eta and wue of drip irrigated winter wheat 2 to determine an optimal nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the study area based on different meteorological scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 field database field experiments were conducted across two growing

two seasons are presented in fig 1 the soil in the experimental area is silt loam and its physical and chemical properties are given in table 1 the winter wheat cultivar triticum aestivum aikang 58 was sown on november 1 2015 and october 19 2016 and was then harvested on june 3 2016 and june 1 2017 respectively experiments consisted of five nitrogen fertilizer application rates 0 120 180 240 and 300 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n120 n180 n240 and n300 and three irrigation quota levels i e irrigation quota of 40 30 and 20 mm referred as i1 i2 and i3 there were 15 treatments with 3 replicates for a total of 45 plots plot size was 5 m 16 m a surface drip irrigation system was installed with a lateral spacing of 60 cm the irrigation system was turned on when the average soil water content 0 100 cm in i1 decreased to less than 60 of the field capacity irrigation in all treatments was scheduled at the same time using the corresponding irrigation amounts n p and k fertilization were applied using urea 46 7 n calcium superphosphate 16 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o p and k fertilizer were applied at 120 kg ha 1 as a basal fertilizer n fertilization was applied two times as a base fertilizer 40 and a topdressing 60 the topdressing fertilizer was applied at the winter wheat returning green stage the soil water content swc was determined every 7 10 days to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm interval eta was estimated using the soil water balance equation hillel 1998 shoot biomass was measured from a row of 20 cm in length plant samples the sampled plants were placed into an oven at 105 c

converted to yield ha 1 2 2 description calibration and evaluation of the dssat ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model v4 6 a component of the dssat software application program was calibrated and validated in this study it was embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call for common modules of weather soil soil plant atmosphere spam and management to simulate crop growth yield and carbon and water balances jones et al 2003 the main function of the weather module is to read or generate daily weather data the soil module integrates information from four sub modules soil water soil temperature soil carbon and nitrogen and soil dynamics computing and updating data daily for each soil layer jones et al 2003 the spam module brings together soil plant and atmosphere inputs and computes root water uptake potential evapotranspiration et as well as actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration et could be calculated either with the priestley taylor method ritchie 1972 or with the penman fao method the default priestley and taylor method requiring only daily solar radiation and temperature was used in our study the actual soil evaporation and plant transpiration is calculated by et details of these aspects can be found in jones et al 2003 the management module determines when field operations planting harvesting applying inorganic fertilizer irrigating and applying crop residue and organic material are performed by calling sub modules the dssat ceres wheat model operates on daily time steps and computes the state variable for each day of a year or growing seasons fraisse et al 2001 jones et al 2003 the data required for running the model usually include four types weather data soil data crop genetic coefficients and management information the model was used for research on the development of irrigation systems he et al 2013 the effects of water fertilizer coupling singh et al 2008 and the effects of climate change on agricultural production bannayan et al 2014 palosuo et al 2011 in this study the dssat glue package jones et al 2011 which is based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method he et al 2010 was used to calibrate the genetic parameters of winter wheat variety aikang 58 the genetic parameters were calibrated using observations of phenological dates anthesis date and maturity date shoot biomass at maturity and grain yield from three minimum stress treatments n180i1 n240i1 and n300i1 in the 2016 2017 season the adjusted genetic parameters used for model validation are presented in table 2 once calibrated the model was further evaluated for the phenology yield shoot biomass eta and wue of the wheat crop using the data set from other 27 treatments in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 performance indicators such as absolute relative error are coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse index of agreement d coefficient of residual mass crm and mean absolute percentage error mape were used to evaluate the model prediction capacity as has been demonstrated by numerous previous studies attia et al 2016 farid et al 2015 patel et al 2017 the equations used for are and mape were 1 are s i o i o i 100 2 mape 100 n i 1 n s i o i o i where si and oi are simulated and observed values respectively the value of are revealed the relative deviation between observed and measured data the value of mape showed the prediction accuracy of forecasting method as a percentage lower values of are or mape represent higher accuracy and precision of the simulation model the equation used for r2 was 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where the s and o are the simulated and observed mean values respectively an r2 of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between observed and simulated data the equation used for nrmse was 4 nrmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 o the simulation is considered as excellent with an nmrse value of nmrse

of d range from 0 to 1 and are based on a measure of dispersion a d of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between observed and simulated data a d of less than 0 50 suggests greater diversity and inconsistency between the model predictions a d value that is closer to 0 0 indicates that there is no agreement between observed and simulated values the equation used for crm was 6 crm 1 i 1 n s i i 1 n o i crm indicates whether the model tends to over or underestimate observed data a negative value indicates a tendency for the model to overestimate compared with the observed data while a

dssat ceres wheat model was used to determine the optimal n application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat in the study area using long term weather datasets these weather datasets contained daily minimum and maximum temperatures daily rainfall and solar radiation from 1970 to 2010 and were obtained from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the meteorological station 35 32 n

the soil the awc is the difference between drained upper limit field capacity and drained lower limit wilting point the automatic irrigation threshold was set as 20 awc and the irrigation amount was set as 30 mm referred to jha et al 2019 this means that an irrigation amount of 30 mm was triggered when 80 of soil available water was depleted the growth stage gstd was calculated internally in the model from its own stage system which in turn is dependent on plant response to photoperiod vernalization and temperature timsina et al 2008 zadoks et al 1974 the end of irrigation application time was set as the completion of the late milk stage gstd 80 six simulated nitrogen rates were defined 0 120 180 240 300 and 360 kg ha 1 referred as n0 n120 n180 n240 n300 and n360 the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at sowing and in early march returning green stage accounting for 40 and 60 of total nitrogen fertilizer respectively ju et al 2009 phosphate and potassium fertilizer were applied at a rate of 120 kg ha 1 as basal fertilizer the date of the initial conditions for simulation was the same as the planting date the initial swc for the 0 100 cm soil layers was set at 80 of the field capacity the initial ammonium n and nitrate n of the profile were set based on the field experiment data the planting date and simulation start date was set as 15th october which was consistent with the local planting date the model crop cultivar plant population row spacing and planting depth for different nitrogen treatments for 40 years was the same as that used in the model calibration and

coefficients were calibrated using observations in the minimum stress treatments n180i1 n240i1 and n300i1 in the 2016 2017 season the calibrated genetic coefficients are 50 49 76 04 710 9 29 35 30 51 1 538 and 97 79 for piv pid p5 g1 g2 g3 and phint respectively table 2 the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were same as observed dates the average are between simulated and observed shoot biomass grain yield eta and wue were 4 47 7 34 10 12 and 3 10 respectively these results confirmed that the ceres wheat model was successfully calibrated in the study area with a reliable result the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model was further evaluated using the field data from the rest of the field experiment no considered in the calibration process briefly discussed in the following section 3 1 1 phenology the simulated anthesis date and maturity date were consistent with observed values with an are of less than 3 in all treatments table 3 accordingly the nrmse and mape of the anthesis and maturity dates were below 2 table 4 it should be noticed that the simulated anthesis dates were same for all treatments but the observed anthesis dates in water and nitrogen deficit treatments were 2 4 days earlier than those in the minimum stress treatments table 3 3 1 2 grain yield and biomass the averaged are of grain yield and shoot biomass was 6 35 and 8 16 respectively in the 2015 2016 season and 2 71 and 11 84 respectively in the 2016 2017 season table 3 for the grain yield the nrmse and mape values were less than 10 table 4 for shoot biomass the nrmse and mape values were 10 97 and 9 53 while the r2 and d value were 0 84 and 0 92 respectively for the two seasons this shows the model could satisfactorily simulate the grain yield and shoot biomass the model could simulate yield and shoot biomass for the minimum stress treatments n180i1 n240i1 and n300i1 excellently with are ranging from 1 02 to 5 03 for two seasons table 3 the are of the grain yield and shoot biomass for the nitrogen stress treatments n0i1 and n120i1 was less than 11 while the are of grain yield and shoot biomass for the water stress treatments n120i3 n180i3 n240i3 and n300i3 was higher this revealed that the model still performed well under nitrogen stress conditions but had slightly low performance under water stress conditions the time course shoot biomass production during two growing seasons was simulated for different conditions adequate water and nitrogen n240i1 nitrogen stress n120i1 and water stress n240i3 fig 2 the model performed well for simulating shoot biomass under adequate water and nitrogen conditions as well as under low nitrogen conditions fig 2 a b however there was a large deviation between the simulated shoot biomass and the measured value during the late stages under water deficit conditions fig 2 c 3 1 3 eta and wue the averaged are of eta and wue were 7 22 and 7 24 respectively in 2015 2016 and 10 69 and 13 07 respectively in 2016 2017 table 3 the model has a good simulation effect on eta with nrmse mape r2 and d were 9 96 8 73 0 72 and 0 76 respectively in two seasons table 4 for wue the nrmse mape r2 and d were 11 29 9 83 0 65 and 0 82 respectively 3 2 scenario simulation using long term weather data 3 2 1 irrigation management the irrigation numbers and irrigation amount over 40 scenarios based on the ceres wheat model are showed in table 5 the number of irrigation per season depends on meteorological factors such as temperature radiation and rainfall during the growth period of winter wheat the irrigation numbers ranged from 3 times to 9 times during 40 seasons and the average irrigation frequency was 6 65 times the average irrigation amount during 40 seasons was 199 5 mm 3 2 2 grain yield and shoot biomass the average simulated grain yield during the 40 seasons ranged from 5946 to 9391 kg ha 1 for the various nitrogen application treatments table 6 the grain yield increased as the nitrogen rate increased but did not responded particularly to increased nitrogen levels when the nitrogen rate exceeded 180 kg ha 1 fig 3 a grain yield in the n180 treatment was increased by 49 69 and 9 49 respectively compared with the n0 and n120 treatments but was reduced by only 3 14 compared with the n240 treatment table 6 in a similar manner to the trend in grain yield the simulated shoot biomass was significantly affected by the nitrogen rate table 6 fig 3 b the average shoot biomass in the n120 n180 n240 n300 and n360 treatments increased by 39 66 53 65 60 05 63 31 and 65 10 respectively compared with the n0 treatment 3 2 3 water and nitrogen use efficiency wue and iwue increased as the nitrogen rate increased but the rate of increase gradually slowed down fig 4 a b the average of wue and iwue in the n180 treatment for the 40 seasons were 2 29 and 4 50 kg m 3 respectively which were 3 35 and 3 11 lower respectively compared with the n240 treatment table 6 however both npe and npfp decreased as the nitrogen rate increased fig 4 c d the average of npe and npfp in the n180 treatment for the 40 seasons was 6 14 and 29 15 higher respectively compared with the n240 treatment table 6 3 2 4 economic analysis the net margin response to nitrogen rate is shown in fig 5 the 40 year average net margin improved as the nitrogen rate increased ranging from 1212 to 2079 usd ha 1 among the six scenarios fig 5 table 6 the 240 kg n ha 1 application rate was dominant with the highest mean return 2102 usd ha 1 at the same time we should also note that the decrease in net margin from the n240 treatment to the n180 treatment was only 2 38 this indicates that although the net margin for the n rate at the 240 kg ha 1 application rate was the highest the n rate of 180 kg ha 1 could also be a good choice because it achieved a 97 62 maximum net margin using a substantially lower nitrogen application 4 discussion 4 1 validation and evaluation of dssat ceres wheat in our study the simulated dates of anthesis and maturity were consistent with observed values with an are of less than 3 in all treatments and nrmse and mape values less than 2 in both seasons table 3 table 4 however the model was not able to reflect the differences in phenological period among different treatments table 3 feng et al 2015 reported rmse of 1 83 and 3 56 days for time to anthesis and maturity timsina and humphreys 2006 reported that the ceres wheat predicted the anthesis and maturity dates quite well with nrmse 4 5 and d 0 94 0 99 while dar et al 2017 and yao et al 2015 pointed out that the simulated anthesis and maturity dates could not reflect the effect of water deficit on phenology this probably because the model considers phenological development as a function of temperature and does not focus much on the effects of irrigation and nitrogen application jones et al 2003 overall the model satisfactorily simulated the grain yield and shoot biomass nrmse and mape were less than 12 r2 and d ranged from 0 84 to 0 96 table 4 attia et al 2016 confirmed the ability of the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model to accurately simulate grain and biomass yields of winter wheat with nrmse 15 r2 0 85 and d 0 95 patel et al 2017 reported excellent performance of the simulated yield under well watered treatments with nrmse 3 and r2 0 9 but poor accuracy under water stress treatment with nrmse 11 1 and r2 0 63 yao et al 2015 reported average are of 27 60 between simulated and observed yield in water stress treatments in our study the model had a high simulation precision under different nitrogen application with adequate water supply while the simulation in water stress conditions were slightly poor table 3 fig 2 this may explain why the existing water stress module in the model did not accurately calculate the effect of water stress on yield and biomass therefore it is necessary to improve the performance of the model under water stress conditions the crm of 0 07 for wue during two seasons indicated that the model was slightly overestimating wue which may be due to the underestimated eta crm of 0 09 for eta however the acceptable performance of eta and wue prediction was indicated by high r2 and d r2 was 0 72 and 0 65 d was 0 76 and 0 82 as well as low nrmse and mape nrmse and mape were less than 12 table 4 several studies have reported good prediction of soil water eta and wue using the dssat model basso et al 2016 dar et al 2017 wang et al 2012 studies also reported that the dssat ceres wheat model underestimated et attia et al 2016 kang et al 2009 therefore some components of soil water balance should be improved to obtain more reasonable eta and wue in conclusion the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model performed well under different nitrogen application rates with adequate water supply and consequently it represents a promising tool to assist with the determination of the optimal nitrogen rate for winter wheat under drip irrigation 4 2 optimization of the nitrogen application rate of drip irrigated winter wheat using the dssat ceres wheat model at present n application rates ranging from 180 to 240 kg ha 1 are recommended to maximize the wheat yield for surface irrigation in the ncp wang et al 2014 2015 2017 zhang et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 reported that an n rate of 240 and 210 kg ha 1 with two different irrigation treatments produced the highest grain yield under field conditions zhang et al 2019 suggested that n application of 180 kg ha 1 improved grain yield and produced the highest net return by evaluating long term winter wheat production practices using the dssat ceres wheat model in this study the optimal nitrogen application rate was selected based on higher grain yields water nitrogen use efficiency and net margins although n rates of 0 120 kg ha 1 gave higher npe and npfp the grain yield net margins wue and iwue were much lower than under higher nitrogen application treatments grain yields and net margins with a nitrogen rate of 180 kg ha 1 increased significantly compared with lower nitrogen rate although they were slightly lower compared with higher nitrogen rates fig 3 a fig 5 interestingly compared to the n rate of 240 kg ha 1 the rate of 180 kg n ha 1 slightly decreased the wue and iwue but greatly improved the npe and npfp fig 4 a b c d in conclusion a nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 can be recommended as optimal for drip irrigated wheat the n rate of 180 kg ha 1 were consistent with the result from zhang et al 2017 in which 190 kg n ha 1 was considered as a suitable n application rate for a good and steady yield under drip fertigation in the near area this study is specifically for the soil in study region under drip irrigation given the target of high output and high efficiency nitrogen requirement could vary by soil type initial nitrogen content yield goal and profit goal further studies are required to determine the appropriate nitrogen application rates of drip irrigated winter wheat with various varieties various soil types various initial nitrogen content as well as given the targeted profit 5 conclusion the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model performed well when simulating the anthesis date maturity date shoot biomass grain yield and eta of drip irrigated winter wheat under different nitrogen application rates with adequate water supply however the simulation performance for grain yield and shoot biomass was slightly lower under water stress conditions the calibrated dssat ceres wheat model was also used to determine the most suitable nitrogen application rate for drip irrigated winter wheat using 40 years of historical weather data simulated results indicated that a nitrogen application rate of 180 kg ha 1 could obtain high grain yields net margins wue and nitrogen use efficiency these results are helpful for developing scientific nitrogen management regime with high output low pollution and high
