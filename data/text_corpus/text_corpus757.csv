3785,evaporation over freshwater bodies is one of the main sources of water loss however evaporation estimation models using net radiation rn over water bodies have not yet provided proper efficiency the fact which has led to several attempts to improve such models using satellite images therefore the purpose of this study is to introduce a model for estimation of rn through using satellite images and to utilize such model in evaporation calculation models in order to produce an evaporation map for freshwater bodies in this regard two reservoirs of taleghan and amirkabir dams in iran were selected as the areas under study thirty three landsat satellite images from the years 2010 to 2018 along with the corresponding meteorological data were used in the implementations a new simplified equation was introduced for calculating rn and the subsequent estimation of potential evaporation over freshwater bodies using remote sensing images evaporation was generally estimated using fao56 pm priestley taylor kimberly penman and hargreaves samani models and the results were then compared with pan evaporation data the obtained results were also compared with the results of two energy balance models including surface energy balance system sebal and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric the results of this study indicated that kimberly penman model with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 76 root mean square error rmse of 1 29 mm and nash sutcliffe nse of 0 65 and fao56 pm model with r2 0 75 rmse 1 76 mm and nse 0 36 outperformed when compared to other similar methods moreover the proposed model proved higher performance in estimating evaporation over freshwater bodies compared with sebal and metric models keywords energy balance algorithms freshwater body net radiation potential evaporation remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et from the surface of plants is one of the crucial factors in maintaining water and energy balance likewise evaporation plays a significant role in loss of the existing freshwater in water bodies zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 such evaporation depends on the present energy mass and energy transfer mechanism as well as the depth and area of the water body abtew 2001 evaporation from water surfaces due to its nature is usually estimated through indirect methods such as pan evaporation water balance energy balance sima et al 2013 mass transfer and combined techniques rahimzadegan and janani 2019 numerous models have already been presented in evaporation estimation and some of the most important studies about them are introduced in table 1 furthermore several simplified evapotranspiration estimation models have been developed based on temperature and net radiation rn parameter over recent decades rn is one of the principal parameters in evaporation estimation and a key component in energy balance of the earth s surface rn is defined as a balance between incoming and outgoing longwave radiation along with the incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation it is also the primary source of energy for physical and chemical processes which occur between the earth and the atmosphere e g heat and water budget photosynthesis and evapotranspiration lima et al 2012 moreover rn is one of the inputs in hydrological and climate change models hence it seems obvious that an accurate estimation of rn is assumed to be of great importance for researchers in various fields such as meteorology hydrology global changes and agriculture myeni et al 2020 ramanathan 1987 samani et al 2007 suttles and ohring 1986 wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 it can be validly obtained through net radiometers or shortwave and longwave radiometers and is generally recorded in meteorological and radiation stations a number of instruments can measure rn in the stations with high degree of accuracy however its measurement over an extensive area is time consuming and costly due to the need for numerous ground installations therefore it is still a prime concern for researchers to provide a model for estimating rn especially over the surface of water bodies there are several studies on et estimation using temperature and rn some of which are introduced in table 1 in recent decades due to advances in satellite technology and electronic and informatics devices several remote sensing methods have been introduced for regional estimation of et and evaporation from the surface of water reservoirs akbari et al 2007 alexandridis et al 2009 fadel et al 2020 majumdar et al 2007 teixeira et al 2009 zhao and gao 2019 using satellite images spatial distribution of required factors for et estimation and their variations are obtained in two or more consecutive images allen et al 2002 et can be estimated using satellite images without considering soil humidity condition crop or farm management bastiaanssen et al 2005 some of the widely used remote sensing algorithms for estimating evapotranspiration are introduced in table 1 as all the investigated studies reveal a variety of models have been introduced to estimate potential evaporation which have been already used by many researchers to estimate evaporation over water bodies in different areas of the world moreover many remote sensing models have also been developed based on these models nevertheless a possible shortcoming of these models can be said to be considering rn as a constant value over water bodies which yields a calculation of a constant value as evaporation from the whole water body however due to the high variability of radiation from the surface of water body and its effect on evaporation value evaporation is not a constant value and has different amounts at different points moreover few studies have been carried out to focus on calculating the map of rn and evaporation over the surfaces of freshwater bodies using satellite images the spatial distribution of rn over water bodies changes depending on various factors and values such as wind speed and direction air humidity and air temperature therefore introducing a specific model to estimate the distribution of the daily rn over water bodies is of great importance for this reason the main objective of this study is to introduce a new specific model to calculate the daily rn using satellite images over freshwater bodies which has not been specifically addressed in the previous studies the obtained daily rn in this study will then be used to estimate the spatial distribution of evaporation on the surface of freshwater bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selected study areas are two freshwater reservoirs of amirkabir and taleghan in iran fig 1 the selected reservoirs are located in the arid climatic region based on the de martonne zonation merrikhpour and rahimzadegan 2019 rahimi et al 2013 amirkabir dam is located in sefidrood basin and taleghan dam is located in the salt lake basin in iran these two dams supply drinking and agricultural water for tehran capital of iran and karaj cities as the most amount of water loss is through evaporation in these water reservoirs calculating the evaporation of these two dams can be of higher importance in management of water resources in this region amirkabir dam with a reservoir volume of 205 million cubic meters is constructed on karaj river and taleghan dam with a volume of 420 million cubic meters is constructed on taleghan river the longitude and latitude of amirkabir dam are 51 05 59 and 35 58 21 respectively taleghan dam is located in longitude and latitude of 50 40 18 and 36 10 30 respectively the average annual evaporation values in karaj and taleghan s meteorological stations are 1540 and 1583 mm respectively according to the long term measurements recorded in karaj meteorological station the average annual temperature is 14 4 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures are 42 and 20 c respectively moreover the average relative humidity in karaj station is 53 long term statistics in taleghan station also show that the annual temperature average is 11 4 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 and 21 c respectively tehran regional water authority 2020 2 2 dataset for the purpose of this study thirty three landsat satellite images were used in clear sky conditions table 2 the selected images were adopted from earth explorer website http www earthexplorer usgs gov the required meteorological station data corresponding to the selected images were collected from synoptic stations of iran meteorological organization the meteorological data included solar radiation sunshine hours rn relative humidity maximum minimum and average temperatures wind speed and dew point temperature which were presented on a daily basis furthermore the measured evaporation amounts by pan fig 1 used for the evaluation of reference evapotranspiration were obtained from synoptic stations in this organization the employed pan was class a and the accuracy of evaporation measurement was 0 1 mm pan evaporation was measured once a day at 6 00 utc using volumetric method 2 3 methodology the general flowchart of the implemented method of this research is provided in fig 2 at the first step the rn was calculated using the proposed method of this study afterwards the evaporation of the selected freshwater bodies was calculated using the acquired rn in the form of the selected combination methods and the radiation based method moreover evaporation maps of the selected water bodies were estimated by the selected temperature based method and also energy balance methods finally the acquired evaporation values from different models were evaluated using corrected pan measurements for estimation of dam evaporation 2 3 1 pre processing of the satellite images in the first step the digital values of the selected landsat satellite images were converted to radiance and reflectance values in order to calculate the required radiance and albedo in the implementations this was performed using the existing gain and offset in the header file of the images 2 3 2 daily net radiation calculations the rn as shown in fig 2 is calculated using the difference between net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation allen et al 1998 1 r n r ns r nl where rns is net shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 and rnl is net longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 the calculation process of each of the parameters is presented in the following text net shortwave radiation is the difference between incoming and reflected shortwave solar radiation rns and is a function of surface albedo allen et al 1998 2 r ns 1 α r s where rs is global solar radiation which can be calculated using devices such as radiometer in the stations or through models such as angstrom prescott model considering the sunshine hours wu et al 2017 α is the surface albedo which is dimensionless in the provided method in fao56 pm table 1 for the purpose of calculating net shortwave radiation used in the potential evaporation the constant value of 0 23 was considered for albedo which was not appropriate for water body surfaces moreover since albedo is not spatially constant for the whole water surfaces considering a constant value for albedo in calculating potential evaporation will cause errors albedo can be calculated using satellite images for all surfaces liang 2001 in this study reflectance values of landsat 8 oli and landsat 5 tm images were used to calculate albedo the albedo value at the top of the atmosphere α toa is calculated using the summation of the multiplication of reflectance in each band by weighting coefficient of the related bands allen et al 2002 this multiplication for the landsat 5 tm satellite ranges from bands1 to 6 and for the landsat 8 oli satellite ranges from bands 2 to 7 3 α toa ω λ ρ λ where ρ λ is the reflectance value in each band in wavelength of λ and ω λ denotes the weighting coefficient of each band which is calculated according to the following equation 4 ω λ esu n λ esu n λ where esunλ is exo atmospheric radiance is averaged for each band the top of the atmosphere albedo needs radiometric correction to be converted to the surface albedo bastiaanssen 2000 5 α α toa α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ sw 2 where α path radiance is the average back scattered incoming solar radiation toward the satellite before reaching the earth the α path radiance value is between 0 025 and 0 04 which could be considered 0 03 according to bastiaanssen 2000 τsw is atmospheric transmissivity which is calculated using the following equation allen et al 1998 6 τ sw 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the average height of the studied area above the mean sea level which must be a good representation of the intended area to estimate the global solar radiation rs different models have been developed the most widely implemented method for estimating global solar radiation is angstrom prescott model angstrom 1924 revfeim 1997 in which 7 r s a s b s n n r a ra denotes extraterrestrial solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 which is extracted from the extraterrestrial radiation table n is the actual sunshine hours and n is the maximum possible sunshine hours as is the regression constant that shows the ratio of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth during cloudy days n 0 as bs indicates the ratio of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear sky days the typical values of these coefficients are between 0 and 1 when ground data for calibration is not available allen et al 1998 recommended as 0 25 and bs 0 5 extraterrestrial solar radiation ra is calculated using the following equation for each day of the year and for different latitudes allen et al 1998 8 r a 24 60 π g sc d r ω s sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ cos ω s where gsc is the solar constant 0 082 mj m 2 min 1 φ is the latitude in terms of radian and ωs is the sunset hour angle radian dr and δ values are the inverse of earth sun relative distance and solar declination radian respectively and can be calculated using the following equations 9 d r 1 0 033 cos 2 π 365 j 10 δ 0 409 sin 2 π 365 j 1 39 where j indicates julian day j 1 n n 365 or 366 the ωs parameter is calculated using φ and δ using the equation below 11 ω s arccos tan φ tan δ the value of maximum sunshine hours is calculated using the following equation 12 n 24 π ω s the other parameter in calculating rn equation 1 is longwave rn the provided fao56 pm relationship for calculating rnl is as following equation allen et al 1998 13 r nl σ t max 4 t min 4 2 0 34 0 14 e a 1 35 r s r so 0 35 where σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 4 903 10 9 mj

provided by bastiaanssen 1995 is used to calculate net longwave radiation at the satellite overpass time to calculate net longwave radiation an equation concerning incoming and outgoing longwave radiation is used as 14 r nl r l r l 1 ε 0 r l r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 which is calculated using stefan boltzmann equation along with atmospheric transmissivity and surface temperature as cold pixel r l denotes the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 which is calculated using surface temperature and emissivity the surface temperature is obtained through satellite image data in the thermal band the term 1 ε 0 r l indicates the reflected ratio of the incoming longwave radiation from the surface of the earth in this study equation 14 was used to calculate the daily rn at the surface of freshwater body considering simplifications related to water specifications outgoing longwave radiation r l is the thermal radiation flux which is emitted from the surface of the earth r l w m 2 can be calculated using stefan boltzmann equation for the overpass time of the satellite as 15 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where ts is surface temperature in kelvin and ε 0 is the surface emissivity surface emissivity for water surface is calculated using vegetation indices tasumi 2004 16 ε 0 0 985 for ndvi 0 where ndvi is normalized difference vegetation index and lai is leaf area index surface temperature is calculated using planck radiation law as 17 t s k 2 ln ε nb k 1 l λ 1 where k1 and k2 are coefficients calculated for landsat 8 image and lλ is spectral radiance in the thermal band εnb is the emissivity in thermal band considering the water heat flux is a small and near zero value at the surface of water bodies allen et al 2002 near surface temperature gradient in water bodies dtwater has a close to zero value 18 h water 0 19 d t water h water r a h w a t e r ρ c p 0 where hwater is water sensible heat flux ρ denotes air density cp is air specific heat and rah water is aerodynamic resistance against heat transfer over the water body hence surface temperature of the water bodies ts is approximately the same as near surface air temperature ta allen et al 2002 20 d t water t s t a 0 21 t s t a to calculate daily outgoing longwave radiation from water bodies equation 15 can be rewritten as follows 22 r l ε 0 σ t a 4 as it was mentioned surface emissivity for freshwater surfaces has a constant value and is dimensionless ta is average air temperature in terms of kelvin in this study daily maximum and minimum temperatures are used to calculate the daily longwave radiation based on fao56 pm allen et al 1998 and equation 22 for daily time scale is rewritten as a new equation as follows 23 r l ε 0 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 tmax daily is maximum daily temperature k and tmin daily is the minimum daily temperature k incoming longwave radiation is downwelling thermal radiation flux from the atmosphere which is calculated using stefan boltzmann equation as 24 r l ε a σ t a 4 where εa is atmosphere emissivity bastiaanssen 1995 offered the following equation for calculating atmosphere emissivity 25 ε a 0 85 ln τ sw 0 09 where τ sw is atmospheric transmissivity and is calculated using equation 6 in this study the combination of maximum and minimum daily temperatures just like calculating the outgoing longwave radiation is used to calculate daily incoming longwave radiation therefore the equation 24 can be rewritten as a new equation as follows 26 r l ε a σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 using equations 23 and 26 the net longwave radiation could be written as a specific new equation over the water surface as below 27 r nl ε 0 ε a 1 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 thus a new specific equation to calculate the daily rn for water bodies is represented as the following equation 28 r n 1 α r s ε 0 ε a 1 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 according to the provided equation above the daily rn of water can be calculated using maximum and minimum daily temperatures received from the stations and the calculated global solar radiation gained through sunshine hours the advantage of the provided equation for calculating rn lies in the fact that it needs less input parameters and can calculate the spatial distribution of rn at the surface of freshwater body in this study after calculating daily rn over freshwater body according to the aforementioned method the performance of this method in calculating evaporation is evaluated by employing several other methods fig 2 2 3 3 potential evaporation calculation methods different methods have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration from the reference crop and water surfaces using satellite data and have been evaluated for different areas and climatic conditions potential evaporation is the maximum amount of water that might escape from water or soil in case of no limitation penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 based on this definition water has the maximum evaporation capacity since the purpose of this study is to estimate evaporation over freshwater body surface the term potential evaporation is used to refer to evaporation from water surface provided models for potential evaporation estimation range from simple to complicated equations based on physical processes such as combination methods penman 1948 which demands lots of meteorological data therefore as there is not a right distribution of meteorological stations for data collection in many areas more simplified temperature based and radiation based models are provided each of these two methods require less input data for calculating potential evaporation among the temperature based methods the methods provided by thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1963 and hargreaves and samani 1985 can be mentioned methods provided by makkink 1957 turc 1961 and priestley and taylor 1972 are among the radiation based methods in this study the temperature based model of hargreaves and samani 1985 and radiation based model of priestley and taylor 1972 and combination models of kp wright 1982 and fao56 pm allen et al 1998 have been evaluated penman 1948 was the first person who introduced the combination equation for calculating evaporation from the open water surface and combined the theoretical energy balance method with mass transfer method burman and pochop 1994 in 1982 the kp method was developed using the penman principal equation and applying wind coefficients and high accuracy lysimetric measurements wright 1982 in this study the modified version of kp table 1 was used to calculate evaporation monteith 1965 modified the combination method of penman 1948 to consider the surface resistance to evaporation table 1 which is known as pm equation this equation has been used by different researchers for calculating evaporation from water surfaces craig 2006 gallego elvira et al 2012 using the combination equation of pm a standardized equation namely fao56 pm is introduced to calculate evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 gallego elvira et al 2012 jensen et al 2005 heat flux is positive when the water is warming and negative when the water is cooling since the energy gained during a day by water is lost at night daily water heat flux can be neglected abreham 2009 hence in this research based on abreham 2009 the daily water heat flux of freshwater body is considered as zero the pm method requires accurate and reliable meteorological data due to the possibility of error in data collection and recording or lack of some of the required data in the meteorological station methods simpler than pm were introduced for instance the provided method by hargreaves and samani 1985 requires less meteorological data to estimate potential evaporation table 1 the method introduced by priestley and taylor 1972 is also a simplified method based on radiation which defines potential evaporation table 1 it should be noted that it is possible to utilize fao56 pm equation and other retrieved equations from pm model over the dam reservoir using a dam factor craig 2006 craig et al 2006 in this regard fao56 pm showed reasonable results in estimating water body evaporation craig 2006 gallego elvira et al 2012 hence in this study the reference et was calculated using the proposed equations afterwards the calculated reference et values were converted to potential et et0 by multiplying a dam factor then due to maximum evaporation capability of the water body the acquired et0 was regarded as the actual water loss through evaporation 2 3 4 surface energy balance models energy balance methods estimate evapotranspiration from the surface of the crop and water bodies as the residual of energy balance equation as 29 λ e t r n g h where λis latent heat flux w m 2 and h is sensible heat flux w m 2 different et models have been devised based on energy balance in this study two methods including sebal and metric methods which were widely used by different researchers were evaluated rn calculations in both metric and sebal models were the same except in atmospheric transmissivity in metric model air pressure and the water content of the atmosphere were used to calculate atmospheric transmissivity surface temperature albedo and ndvi were used to estimate soil heat flux calculation in both methods in the same way but the abovementioned method was not appropriate for water heat flux and in this study in accordance with recommendation of allen et al 2002 the 0 5rn value was considered for water heat flux sensible heat flux is the other component of energy balance which requires calculation of near surface temperature difference dt in both sebal and metric methods the linear relationship of dt ats b was used to determine dt where a and b are calibration coefficients the calibration coefficients are found by determining the anchor pixels hot pixel and cold pixel in both methods hot pixel is a pixel with a high value of surface temperature and latent heat flux of zero λet 0 cold pixel is the pixel with the maximum evaporation and low value of heat flux in sebal model cold pixel is usually considered at the surface of water and its heat flux is zero hcold 0 in metric model cold pixel is generally considered at a well irrigated alfalfa field and evaporation in cold pixel is considered 5 more than reference crop evapotranspiration hcold rn g 1 05λetcold in the present study based on previous studies allen et al 2002 rahimpour and rahimzadegan 2021 zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 latent heat flux λet was converted to the hourly evaporation einst in mm hr 1 using the following equation 30 e inst 3600 λ e t λ where 3600 is the conversion coefficient from seconds to hours and λ is the latent heat of vaporization afterwards evaporation fraction ef was calculated using reference et etr acquired from weather data as the following equation 31 ef e inst e t r finally the daily actual evaporation edaily in mm day 1 was estimated using cumulative 24 hour reference et for the imaging day e t r 24 h a s c e and acquired ef e t r 24 h a s c e was computed using standardized equation introduced by american society of civil engineers asce as the following equation walter et al 2000 32 e daily e f e t r 24 h a s c e 2 3 5 methods of evaluating results in this study pan measurements were used to evaluate the estimated evaporation values pan evaporation data should be multiplied by a pan coefficient to remove the effects of the pan condition in evaporation measurements in this study the pan coefficient was considered based on the fao irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1998 since the pan coefficient varies in different months and changes according to the pan type and the environmental condition the pan coefficient was applied for each month in this research root mean square error rmse is used to calculate the error between the predicted and measured values 33 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i where n is the number of observations x i is the measured values and xi is the predicted values in addition determination coefficient r2 is used to calculate correlation between the predicted and evaluated values as 34 r 2 i 1 n x i x i i 1 n x i i 1 n x i n 2 i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 n i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 n the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc was used to estimate the predictive performance of the hydrological algorithms nash and sutcliffe 1970 as 35 nsc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i is the average of the measured values and the nsc varies between to 1 the value of 1 for nsc represents the complete match of the predicted values to the measured values the zero value of the nsc means the same performance x i compared to predicted values and the negative values denote the better performance of x i compared to predicted values the models with nsc values in the range of 0 50 and 0 65 are recommended by other researchers ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 rn analysis fig 3 a shows daily rn amounts diagram obtained from equation 28 against rn measured using net radiometer mounted next to the coast of the selected reservoirs firstly spatial distribution of rn in the entire reservoir was calculated using equation 30 then the rn calculated at the closest pixel of the reservoir surface to radiometer measurement point was derived in order to enable comparisons among rn measurements as it can be seen equation 28 has a proper efficiency in estimating rn from water body surface fig 3b shows a comparison between measured daily rn amounts with the relationship provided in fao56 pm as it is obvious the performance of fao56 pm r2 0 77 and rmse 2 36 mj m 2 day 1 was weaker than the proposed equation of this study equation 28 moreover the calculated nsc values confirmed the better performance of the proposed method of this study over fao56 pm method the superiority of the introduced method of this study can be related to considering the effect of emissivity in water longwave rn calculations a parameter which does not exist in fao56 pm another reason for this better performance of our method over fao56 pm is considering the changing value of albedo over water body using satellite images which was considered as a constant value of 0 23 in the fao56 pm method sunshine hours and extraterrestrial radiation play key roles in shortwave radiation calculations extraterrestrial radiation depends on the day of the year so that in the summer when it is hot and the heat is at a high level there is more extraterrestrial radiation furthermore the clearer the sky the longer the sunshine duration and the more solar radiation reaching the earth the longer the sunshine hours and the more the extraterrestrial radiation the more shortwave radiation too table 3 shows the albedo ts rn and sunshine hours in taleghan dam during the studied days according to this table most of the images are related to late spring and summer and the coefficient of determination of sunshine hours and estimated rn values in this station is r2 0 78 as expected this table proved the dependence of the estimated rn of this study on sunshine hours 3 2 daily evaporation in the initial step freshwater rn was calculated using equation 28 provided in this study afterwards the distribution of potential evaporation was calculated using the selected four methods including fao56 pm kimberly penman hargreaves samani and priestley taylor over freshwater reservoir of karaj and taleghan after calculating evaporation for the entire reservoir surfaces the calculated evaporation of the nearest pixel of each reservoir by each of the four methods was compared with pan data table 4 evaporation maps of the two selected reservoirs were produced using sebal and metric models for a better analysis of the performance of the four methods table 4 since hargreaves samani s method is a temperature based one and rn parameter is not considered in its equation a constant evaporation value was calculated as the representative of the whole reservoir and the spatial distribution of evaporation was not calculated in this method hence the spatial distribution of evaporation was only calculated using fao56 pm kp and priestley taylor methods as it is obvious from table 4 kp method and fao56 pm method have revealed better performances compared with hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods this is due to the fact that kp and fao56 pm methods are among combination methods containing all effective parameters on evaporation estimation however hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods are simplified methods which do not consider all the influencing parameters on evaporation which may cause some uncertainties table 5 represents rmse and r2 among evaporation values which are calculated through potential evaporation calculation methods together with energy balance methods and are compared against measured evaporation by pan evaporation as it can be clearly witnessed the kp method was leading with r2 0 76 and rmse 1 29 mm and fao56 pm method with r2 0 75 and rmse 1 76 mm provided better results in comparison with other methods on the other hand priestley taylor method with r2 0 2437 and rmse 2 67 mm showed a less satisfactory performance compared to other models although sebal and metric models have been employed in different studies on the farms with different crops and resulted in acceptable performances in water bodies these models provided less effective performances than combination methods table 5 which can be due to uncertainty in determination of water heat flux at the satellite overpass time altogether the results indicated that kp and fao56 pm models owned the highest efficiency level in evaporation estimation of water body surfaces in the selected study areas with arid climates in iran table 5 shows rmse and r2 among evaporation values calculated from five methods including metric fao56 pm kp hargreaves samani and priestley taylor set against evaporation estimated by sebal model as one of the most applied evapotranspiration remote sensing methods as it can be seen metric fao56 pm and kp models produced results similar to sebal model and they also had higher correlation coefficients compared with sebal model moreover the metric method with r2 0 82 and rmse 0 49 mm had closer results to sebal model than other models the reason for which is that the metric is developed based on sebal model except for minor differences therefore the calculation process for rn in both methods was the same except for atmospheric transmissivity calculation furthermore each of them concluded in a distinct equation for soil heat flux calculation however the 0 5 rn was considered as the water heat flux according to a recommendation made by allen et al 2002 because the focused studied field was water the main difference between sebal and metric models is in selection of cold pixel and evaporation fractions more precisely in metric cold pixel is selected with characteristics similar to alfalfa reference crop on an agricultural farm and the reference crop evaporation is used to convert the instantaneous evaporation at the satellite overpass time to daily evaporation hence in this study a well irrigated agriculture farm nearest to the reservoir was selected to determine cold pixel in metric model fig 4 shows the performance diagram of the six selected methods in evaporation estimation over the reservoirs using pan evaporation measurements as it is obvious kp sebal and metric methods overestimate evaporation compared to other methods priestley taylor method underestimates evaporation compared with other methods in addition fao56 pm and kp methods show close numerical values sebal and metric models which are energy balance based models also display resembling results according to the results of evaluation of fao56 pm and kp methods in table 6 it could be concluded that these two methods can perform more efficiently in estimation of evaporation from water body surface the provided relationships by different researchers so far have succeeded to calculate evaporation at one point and at the meteorological station however in this study spatial distribution over the dam reservoir was calculated using remote sensing images and an equation was proposed to calculate rn of water surface 3 3 spatial variation of daily evaporation in order to show evaporation distribution map fig 5 shows daily evaporation over amirkabir reservoir using fao56 pm kimberly penman and priestley taylor methods on 5 august 2015 as an example calculated evaporation from the reservoir using kimberly penman method fig 5a indicated that the evaporation amount from the reservoir was less at the northern part of the dam reservoir due to less radiation moreover radiation and evaporation was more at the southern part of amirkabir dam reservoir fig 5a as fig 5b shows the fao56 pm method calculated higher evaporation values from the priestley taylor method evaporation from the reservoir with fao56 pm method also showed that most of the northern parts of the reservoir had less evaporation than the southern parts fig 5c indicates that evaporation estimated by priestley taylor method from the southern part of dam was also more than the estimated values from its northern parts another reason for generating different calculation of daily evaporation over water surface by different models can be the wind speed and direction evaporation of water surface depends on solar rn air humidity air temperature and wind speed the surrounding air of the water surface become gradually saturated with the increase of water vapor in the evaporating surface if the humidity in the air doesn t move it would cause a halt in the process of evaporation however since wind speed is usually more than zero the saturated air is replaced by drier air hence in addition to the impact of rn on the amount of evaporation increasing the wind speed and direction can alter the evaporation level of the surface of the reservoir fig 6 shows a sample of daily evaporation map acquired for taleghan dam on 30 june 2017 this figure also shows variable evaporation distribution over the surface of the dam according to fig 6 exactly like amirkabir reservoir kp method showed evaporation amounts higher than the two other methods moreover fao56 pm method showed higher evaporation values than priestley taylor method fig 6b the calculated evaporation values from the three methods for both reservoirs revealed similar values because the spatial coordinates of dams were not far different from each other and their climates were similar too for instance the range of calculated evaporation values through kp method for amirkabir and taleghan dams were approximately the same 3 4 evaporation from the whole reservoir table 7 shows daily evaporation volume lost from the reservoir using fao56 pm kp and priestley taylor methods in the two calculations 1 considering a fixed value for albedo and evaporation as a representative of the entire dam and 2 considering variable amounts for albedo and calculating evaporation for each pixel of the reservoir as it is clear there s a considerable difference between the two calculations just as most researches have considered the constant value of 0 065 as water surface albedo finch and hall 2001 in calculation 1 in this measurement the constant albedo value of 0 065 was considered as the albedo of reservoir surface as table 7 also shows on the days during which the constant albedo was much different from the computational albedo for every pixel the computational evaporation volume was remarkably different moreover due to the larger area of taleghan compared to amirkabir reservoir the computational evaporation volume difference was more visible in the two calculations of the study therefore considering a constant value as albedo from the reservoir causes errors in evaporation estimations and water resource management of the reservoir this study provided a simplified method to determine rn over freshwater surface using remote sensing data and in the next step rn was employed to determine evaporation by four common evaporation estimation methods the results of this study showed higher improvements compared to similar studies this study also evaluated the proposed evaporation estimation method against the two well known energy balance methods which proved the efficiency of our method in determination of water surface evaporation in the most of previous studies on water body surface albedo of water was considered as a constant value finch and hall 2001 this research however proved that considering a constant value can cause an error in determination of water evaporation moreover in former studies conducted using combination and radiation based methods such as abtew 2001 wang et al 2019 a fixed value of evaporation was considered as representative from whole water surface in this research a simplified method using the remote sensing data as an input parameter was developed to calculate the spatial distribution of rn and subsequently evaporation of freshwater body was estimated although in some studies such as wang et al 2019 the installed instrument over the reservoir was used to estimate energy balance components such instruments are expensive and non existent in most areas of the world it seems that the presented method in this research could be valuable to estimate rn and evaporation for areas that suffering from a lack of measurement instruments our proposed method also requires less input data to estimate the rn over water surface of reservoir compared to moukomla and blanken 2017 besides our proposed method estimated rn on a daily basis while moukomla and blanken 2017 calculated it at the satellite overpass time which cannot be used in a daily evaporation model requiring the daily rn the results of the statistical analyses comparing predicted and measured rn data in our study was also very satisfactory the results of this study was in line with wang et al 2019 in which the combination based models had better performance compared to the radiation based methods over water body moreover fao56 model is a standard model with proper performance in the estimation of evapotranspiration of various crops using crop factor rácz et al 2013 the findings of this study proved that fao56 has adequate efficiency in estimation of water body evaporation the introduced technique of this study definitely suffers from its own limitations the utilized meteorological variables as the input of the models was considered constant over whole pixels of the reservoir which may cause uncertainty in the final pixel value however due to low variations in the climate data over the water body the impact of this factor can be considered negligible furthermore some meteorological parameters such as undetected clouds and aerosols could also have affected the satellite images and consequently might have influenced the rn calculations 4 conclusion the purpose of this study was to provide a model to prepare a spatial distribution map of evaporation over freshwater bodies using the daily rn calculated from satellite images to this aim a new simplified relationship was provided in this study to calculate rn over freshwater surface subsequently using the provided equation for rn the evaporation spatial distribution over the iranian taleghan and amirkabir reservoirs was calculated this proposed equation for freshwater surface rn was employed to calculate potential evaporation using four different equations namely fao56 pm priestley taylor kimberly penman and hargreaves samani moreover for a more efficient comparison and evaluation of the proposed model the results were compared with sebal and metric models evaporation estimation results were evaluated using six methods with pan data and it was found that the combination methods of kimberly penman r2 0 76 rmse 1 29 mm and nse 0 65 and fao56 pm r2 0 75 rmse 1 76 mm and nse 0 36 could present better performances than other methods it was also found that fao56 pm and kimberly penman methods as well as sebal and metric models had closely similar results in this respect the advantage of the proposed method of this study compared to the sebal and metric methods is the specific determination of rn over the freshwater surface on a daily basis with a new special simplified equation that requires less input from weather station data in general the obtained results indicated the efficiency of our proposed model in this study for calculating rn values using satellite images and for applying such values in evaporation calculation models for the purpose of development of an evaporation map over the freshwater bodies as a suggestion for future research the presented method of this research can be applied for saline water bodies as long as the salinity factor is considered as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3785,evaporation over freshwater bodies is one of the main sources of water loss however evaporation estimation models using net radiation rn over water bodies have not yet provided proper efficiency the fact which has led to several attempts to improve such models using satellite images therefore the purpose of this study is to introduce a model for estimation of rn through using satellite images and to utilize such model in evaporation calculation models in order to produce an evaporation map for freshwater bodies in this regard two reservoirs of taleghan and amirkabir dams in iran were selected as the areas under study thirty three landsat satellite images from the years 2010 to 2018 along with the corresponding meteorological data were used in the implementations a new simplified equation was introduced for calculating rn and the subsequent estimation of potential evaporation over freshwater bodies using remote sensing images evaporation was generally estimated using fao56 pm priestley taylor kimberly penman and hargreaves samani models and the results were then compared with pan evaporation data the obtained results were also compared with the results of two energy balance models including surface energy balance system sebal and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric the results of this study indicated that kimberly penman model with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 76 root mean square error rmse of 1 29 mm and nash sutcliffe nse of 0 65 and fao56 pm model with r2 0 75 rmse 1 76 mm and nse 0 36 outperformed when compared to other similar methods moreover the proposed model proved higher performance in estimating evaporation over freshwater bodies compared with sebal and metric models keywords energy balance algorithms freshwater body net radiation potential evaporation remote sensing 1 introduction evapotranspiration et from the surface of plants is one of the crucial factors in maintaining water and energy balance likewise evaporation plays a significant role in loss of the existing freshwater in water bodies zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 such evaporation depends on the present energy mass and energy transfer mechanism as well as the depth and area of the water body abtew 2001 evaporation from water surfaces due to its nature is usually estimated through indirect methods such as pan evaporation water balance energy balance sima et al 2013 mass transfer and combined techniques rahimzadegan and janani 2019 numerous models have already been presented in evaporation estimation and some of the most important studies about them are introduced in table 1 furthermore several simplified evapotranspiration estimation models have been developed based on temperature and net radiation rn parameter over recent decades rn is one of the principal parameters in evaporation estimation and a key component in energy balance of the earth s surface rn is defined as a balance between incoming and outgoing longwave radiation along with the incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation it is also the primary source of energy for physical and chemical processes which occur between the earth and the atmosphere e g heat and water budget photosynthesis and evapotranspiration lima et al 2012 moreover rn is one of the inputs in hydrological and climate change models hence it seems obvious that an accurate estimation of rn is assumed to be of great importance for researchers in various fields such as meteorology hydrology global changes and agriculture myeni et al 2020 ramanathan 1987 samani et al 2007 suttles and ohring 1986 wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 it can be validly obtained through net radiometers or shortwave and longwave radiometers and is generally recorded in meteorological and radiation stations a number of instruments can measure rn in the stations with high degree of accuracy however its measurement over an extensive area is time consuming and costly due to the need for numerous ground installations therefore it is still a prime concern for researchers to provide a model for estimating rn especially over the surface of water bodies there are several studies on et estimation using temperature and rn some of which are introduced in table 1 in recent decades due to advances in satellite technology and electronic and informatics devices several remote sensing methods have been introduced for regional estimation of et and evaporation from the surface of water reservoirs akbari et al 2007 alexandridis et al 2009 fadel et al 2020 majumdar et al 2007 teixeira et al 2009 zhao and gao 2019 using satellite images spatial distribution of required factors for et estimation and their variations are obtained in two or more consecutive images allen et al 2002 et can be estimated using satellite images without considering soil humidity condition crop or farm management bastiaanssen et al 2005 some of the widely used remote sensing algorithms for estimating evapotranspiration are introduced in table 1 as all the investigated studies reveal a variety of models have been introduced to estimate potential evaporation which have been already used by many researchers to estimate evaporation over water bodies in different areas of the world moreover many remote sensing models have also been developed based on these models nevertheless a possible shortcoming of these models can be said to be considering rn as a constant value over water bodies which yields a calculation of a constant value as evaporation from the whole water body however due to the high variability of radiation from the surface of water body and its effect on evaporation value evaporation is not a constant value and has different amounts at different points moreover few studies have been carried out to focus on calculating the map of rn and evaporation over the surfaces of freshwater bodies using satellite images the spatial distribution of rn over water bodies changes depending on various factors and values such as wind speed and direction air humidity and air temperature therefore introducing a specific model to estimate the distribution of the daily rn over water bodies is of great importance for this reason the main objective of this study is to introduce a new specific model to calculate the daily rn using satellite images over freshwater bodies which has not been specifically addressed in the previous studies the obtained daily rn in this study will then be used to estimate the spatial distribution of evaporation on the surface of freshwater bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selected study areas are two freshwater reservoirs of amirkabir and taleghan in iran fig 1 the selected reservoirs are located in the arid climatic region based on the de martonne zonation merrikhpour and rahimzadegan 2019 rahimi et al 2013 amirkabir dam is located in sefidrood basin and taleghan dam is located in the salt lake basin in iran these two dams supply drinking and agricultural water for tehran capital of iran and karaj cities as the most amount of water loss is through evaporation in these water reservoirs calculating the evaporation of these two dams can be of higher importance in management of water resources in this region amirkabir dam with a reservoir volume of 205 million cubic meters is constructed on karaj river and taleghan dam with a volume of 420 million cubic meters is constructed on taleghan river the longitude and latitude of amirkabir dam are 51 05 59 and 35 58 21 respectively taleghan dam is located in longitude and latitude of 50 40 18 and 36 10 30 respectively the average annual evaporation values in karaj and taleghan s meteorological

temperatures are 42 and 20 c respectively moreover the average relative humidity in karaj station is 53 long term statistics in taleghan station also show that the annual temperature average is 11 4 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 and 21 c respectively tehran regional water authority 2020 2 2 dataset for the purpose of this study thirty three landsat satellite images were used in clear sky conditions table 2 the selected images were adopted from earth explorer website http www earthexplorer usgs gov the required meteorological station data corresponding to the selected images were collected from synoptic stations of iran meteorological organization the meteorological data included solar radiation sunshine hours rn relative humidity maximum minimum and average temperatures wind speed and dew point temperature which were presented on a daily basis furthermore the measured evaporation amounts by pan fig 1 used for the evaluation of reference evapotranspiration were obtained from synoptic stations in this organization the employed pan was class a and the accuracy of evaporation measurement was 0 1 mm pan evaporation was measured once a day at 6 00 utc using volumetric method 2 3 methodology the general flowchart of the implemented method of this research is provided in fig 2 at the first step the rn was calculated using the proposed method of this study afterwards the evaporation of the selected freshwater bodies was calculated using the acquired rn in the form of the selected combination methods and the radiation based method moreover evaporation maps of the selected water bodies were estimated by the selected temperature based method and also energy balance methods finally the acquired evaporation values from different models were evaluated using corrected pan measurements for estimation of dam evaporation 2 3 1 pre processing of the satellite images in the first step the digital values of the selected landsat satellite images were converted to radiance and reflectance values in order to calculate the required radiance and albedo in the implementations this was performed using the existing gain and offset in the header file of the images 2 3 2 daily net radiation calculations the rn as shown in fig 2 is calculated using the difference between net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation allen et al 1998 1 r n r ns r

can be calculated using devices such as radiometer in the stations or through models such as angstrom prescott model considering the sunshine hours wu et al 2017 α is the surface albedo which is dimensionless in the provided method in fao56 pm table 1 for the purpose of calculating net shortwave radiation used in the potential evaporation the constant value of 0 23 was considered for albedo which was not appropriate for water body surfaces moreover since albedo is not spatially constant for the whole water surfaces considering a constant value for albedo in calculating potential evaporation will cause errors albedo can be calculated using satellite images for all surfaces liang 2001 in this study reflectance values of landsat 8 oli and landsat 5 tm images were used to calculate albedo the albedo value at the top of the atmosphere α toa is calculated using the summation of the multiplication of reflectance in each band by weighting coefficient of the related bands allen et al 2002 this multiplication for the landsat 5 tm satellite ranges from bands1 to 6 and for the landsat 8 oli satellite ranges from bands 2 to 7 3 α toa ω λ ρ λ where ρ λ is the reflectance value in each band in wavelength of λ and ω λ denotes the weighting coefficient of each band which is calculated according to the following equation 4 ω λ esu n λ esu n λ where esunλ is exo atmospheric radiance is averaged for each band the top of the atmosphere albedo needs radiometric correction to be converted to the surface albedo bastiaanssen 2000 5 α α toa α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ sw 2 where α path radiance is the average back scattered incoming solar radiation toward the satellite before reaching the earth the α path radiance value is between 0 025 and 0 04 which could be considered 0 03 according to bastiaanssen 2000 τsw is atmospheric transmissivity which is calculated using the following equation allen et al 1998 6 τ sw 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the average height of the studied area above the mean sea level which must be a good representation of the intended area to estimate the global solar radiation rs different models have been developed the most widely implemented method for estimating global solar radiation is angstrom prescott model angstrom 1924 revfeim 1997 in which 7 r s a s b s n n r a ra denotes extraterrestrial solar radiation mj m 2 day 1

coefficients are between 0 and 1 when ground data for calibration is not available allen et al 1998 recommended as 0 25 and bs 0 5 extraterrestrial solar radiation ra is calculated using the following equation for each day of the year and for different latitudes allen et al 1998 8 r a 24 60 π g sc d r ω s sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ cos ω s where gsc is the solar constant 0 082 mj m 2 min 1 φ is the

provided by bastiaanssen 1995 is used to calculate net longwave radiation at the satellite overpass time to calculate net longwave radiation an equation concerning incoming and outgoing longwave radiation is used as 14 r nl r l r l 1 ε 0 r l r l is the incoming longwave radiation w m 2 which is calculated using stefan boltzmann equation along with atmospheric transmissivity and surface temperature as cold pixel r l denotes the outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 which is calculated using surface temperature and emissivity the surface temperature is obtained through satellite image data in the thermal band the term 1 ε 0 r l indicates the reflected ratio of the incoming longwave radiation from the surface of the earth in this study equation 14 was used to calculate the daily rn at the surface of freshwater body considering simplifications related to water specifications outgoing longwave radiation r l is the thermal radiation flux which is emitted from the surface of the earth r l w m 2 can be calculated using stefan boltzmann equation for the overpass time of the satellite as 15 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where ts is surface temperature in kelvin and ε 0 is the surface emissivity surface emissivity for water surface is calculated using vegetation indices tasumi 2004 16 ε 0 0 985 for ndvi 0 where ndvi is normalized difference vegetation index and lai is leaf area

thermal band εnb is the emissivity in thermal band considering the water heat flux is a small and near zero value at the surface of water bodies allen et al 2002 near surface temperature gradient in water bodies dtwater has a close to zero value 18 h water 0 19 d t water h water r a h w a t e r ρ c p 0 where hwater is water sensible heat flux ρ denotes air density cp is air specific heat and rah water is aerodynamic resistance against heat transfer over the water body hence surface temperature of the water bodies ts is approximately the same as near surface air temperature ta allen et al 2002 20 d t water t s t a 0 21 t s t a to calculate daily outgoing longwave radiation from water bodies equation 15 can be rewritten as follows 22 r l ε 0 σ t a 4 as it was mentioned surface emissivity for freshwater surfaces has a constant value and is dimensionless ta is average air temperature in terms of kelvin in this study daily maximum and minimum temperatures are used to calculate the daily longwave radiation based on fao56 pm allen et al 1998 and equation 22 for daily time scale is rewritten as a new equation as follows 23 r l ε 0 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 tmax daily is maximum daily temperature k and tmin daily is the minimum daily temperature k incoming longwave radiation is downwelling thermal radiation flux from the atmosphere which is calculated using stefan boltzmann equation as 24 r l ε a σ t a 4 where εa is atmosphere emissivity bastiaanssen 1995 offered the following equation for calculating atmosphere emissivity 25 ε a 0 85 ln τ sw 0 09 where τ sw is atmospheric transmissivity and is calculated using equation 6 in this study the combination of maximum and minimum daily temperatures just like calculating the outgoing longwave radiation is used to calculate daily incoming longwave radiation therefore the equation 24 can be rewritten as a new equation as follows 26 r l ε a σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 using equations 23 and 26 the net longwave radiation could be written as a specific new equation over the water surface as below 27 r nl ε 0 ε a 1 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 thus a new specific equation to calculate the daily rn for water bodies is represented as the following equation 28 r n 1 α r s ε 0 ε a 1 σ t max d a i l y 4 t min d a i l y 4 2 according to the provided equation above the daily rn of water can be calculated using maximum and minimum daily temperatures received from the stations and the calculated global solar radiation gained through sunshine hours the advantage of the provided equation for calculating rn lies in the fact that it needs less input parameters and can calculate the spatial distribution of rn at the surface of freshwater body in this study after calculating daily rn over freshwater body according to the aforementioned method the performance of this method in calculating evaporation is evaluated by employing several other methods fig 2 2 3 3 potential evaporation calculation methods different methods have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration from the reference crop and water surfaces using satellite data and have been evaluated for different areas and climatic conditions potential evaporation is the maximum amount of water that might escape from water or soil in case of no limitation penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 based on this definition water has the maximum evaporation capacity since the purpose of this study is to estimate evaporation over freshwater body surface the term potential evaporation is used to refer to evaporation from water surface provided models for potential evaporation estimation range from simple to complicated equations based on physical processes such as combination methods penman 1948 which demands lots of meteorological data therefore as there is not a right distribution of meteorological stations for data collection in many areas more simplified temperature based and radiation based models are provided each of these two methods require less input data for calculating potential evaporation among the temperature based methods the methods provided by thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1963 and hargreaves and samani 1985 can be mentioned methods provided by makkink 1957 turc 1961 and priestley and taylor 1972 are among the radiation based methods in this study the temperature based model of hargreaves and samani 1985 and radiation based model of priestley and taylor 1972 and combination models of kp wright 1982 and fao56 pm allen et al 1998 have been evaluated penman 1948 was the first person who introduced the combination equation for calculating evaporation from the open water surface and combined the theoretical energy balance method with mass transfer method burman and pochop 1994 in 1982 the kp method was developed using the penman principal equation and applying wind coefficients and high accuracy lysimetric measurements wright 1982 in this study the modified version of kp table 1 was used to calculate evaporation monteith 1965 modified the combination method of penman 1948 to consider the surface resistance to evaporation table 1 which is known as pm equation this equation has been used by different researchers for calculating evaporation from water surfaces craig 2006 gallego elvira et al 2012 using the combination equation of pm a standardized equation namely fao56 pm is introduced to calculate evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 gallego elvira et al 2012 jensen et al 2005 heat flux is positive when the water is warming and negative when the water is cooling since the energy gained during a day by water is lost at night daily water heat flux can be neglected abreham 2009 hence in this research based on abreham 2009 the daily water heat flux of freshwater body is considered as zero the pm method requires accurate and reliable meteorological data due to the possibility of error in data collection and recording or lack of some of the required data in the meteorological station methods simpler than pm were introduced for instance the provided method by hargreaves and samani 1985 requires less meteorological data to estimate potential evaporation table 1 the method introduced by priestley and taylor 1972 is also a simplified method based on radiation which defines potential evaporation table 1 it should be noted that it is possible to utilize fao56 pm equation and other retrieved equations from pm model over the dam reservoir using a dam factor craig 2006 craig et al 2006 in this regard fao56 pm showed reasonable results in estimating water body evaporation craig 2006 gallego elvira et al 2012 hence in this study the reference et was calculated using the proposed equations afterwards the calculated reference et values were converted to potential et et0 by multiplying a dam factor then due to maximum evaporation capability of the water body the acquired et0 was regarded as the actual water loss through evaporation 2 3 4 surface energy balance models energy balance methods estimate evapotranspiration from the surface of the crop and water bodies as the residual of energy balance equation as 29 λ e t r n g h where λis latent heat flux w m 2 and h is sensible heat flux w m 2 different et models have been devised based on energy balance in this study two methods including sebal and metric methods which were widely used by different researchers were evaluated rn calculations in both metric and sebal models were the same except in atmospheric transmissivity in metric model air pressure and the water content of the atmosphere were used to calculate atmospheric transmissivity surface temperature albedo and ndvi were used to estimate soil heat flux calculation in both methods in the same way but the abovementioned method was not appropriate for water heat flux and in this study in accordance with recommendation of allen et al 2002 the 0 5rn value was considered for water heat flux sensible heat flux is the other component of energy balance which requires calculation of near surface temperature difference dt in both sebal and metric methods the linear relationship of dt ats b was used to determine dt where a and b are calibration coefficients the calibration coefficients are found by determining the anchor pixels hot pixel and cold pixel in both methods hot pixel is a pixel with a high value of surface temperature and latent heat flux of zero λet 0 cold pixel is the pixel with the maximum evaporation and low value of heat flux in sebal model cold pixel is usually considered at the surface of water and its heat flux is zero hcold 0 in metric model cold pixel is generally considered at a well irrigated alfalfa field and evaporation in cold pixel is considered 5 more than reference crop evapotranspiration hcold rn g 1 05λetcold in the present study based on previous studies allen et al 2002 rahimpour and rahimzadegan 2021 zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 latent heat flux λet was converted to the hourly evaporation einst in mm hr 1 using the following equation 30 e inst 3600 λ e t λ where 3600 is the conversion coefficient from seconds to hours and λ is the latent heat of vaporization afterwards evaporation fraction ef was calculated using reference et etr acquired from weather data as the following equation 31 ef e inst e t r finally the daily actual evaporation edaily in mm day 1 was estimated using cumulative 24 hour reference et for the imaging day e t r 24 h a s c e and acquired ef e t r 24 h a s c e was computed using standardized equation introduced by american society of civil engineers asce as the following equation walter et al 2000 32 e daily e f e t r 24 h a s c e 2 3 5 methods of evaluating results in this study pan measurements were used to evaluate the estimated evaporation values pan evaporation data should be multiplied by a pan coefficient to remove the effects of the pan condition in evaporation measurements in this study the pan coefficient was considered based on the fao irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1998 since the pan coefficient varies in different months and changes according to the pan type and the environmental condition the pan coefficient was applied for each month in this research root mean square error rmse is used to calculate the error between the predicted and measured values 33 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i where n is the number of observations x i is the measured values and xi is the predicted values in addition determination coefficient r2 is used to calculate correlation between the predicted and evaluated values as 34 r 2 i 1 n x i x i i 1 n x i i 1 n x i n 2 i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 n i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 n the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc was used to estimate the predictive performance of the hydrological algorithms nash and sutcliffe 1970 as 35 nsc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i is the average of the measured values and the nsc varies between to 1 the value of 1 for nsc represents the complete match of the predicted values to the measured values the zero value of the nsc means the same performance x i compared to predicted values and the negative values denote the better performance of x i compared to predicted values the models with nsc values in the range of 0 50 and 0 65 are recommended by other researchers ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 rn analysis fig 3 a shows daily rn amounts diagram obtained from equation 28 against rn measured using net radiometer mounted next to the coast of the selected reservoirs firstly spatial distribution of rn in the entire reservoir was calculated using equation 30 then the rn calculated at the closest pixel of the reservoir surface to radiometer measurement point was derived in order to enable comparisons among rn measurements as it can be seen equation 28 has a proper efficiency in estimating rn from water body surface fig 3b shows a comparison between measured daily rn amounts with the relationship provided in fao56 pm as it is obvious the performance of fao56 pm r2 0 77 and rmse 2 36 mj m 2 day 1 was weaker than the proposed equation of this study equation 28 moreover the calculated nsc values confirmed the better performance of the proposed method of this study over fao56 pm method the superiority of the introduced method of this study can be related to considering the effect of emissivity in water longwave rn calculations a parameter which does not exist in fao56 pm another reason for this better performance of our method over fao56 pm is considering the changing value of albedo over water body using satellite images which was considered as a constant value of 0 23 in the fao56 pm method sunshine hours and extraterrestrial radiation play key roles in shortwave radiation calculations extraterrestrial radiation depends on the day of the year so that in the summer when it is hot and the heat is at a high level there is more extraterrestrial radiation furthermore the clearer the sky the longer the sunshine duration and the more solar radiation reaching the earth the longer the sunshine hours and the more the extraterrestrial radiation the more shortwave radiation too table 3 shows the albedo ts rn and sunshine hours in taleghan dam during the studied days according to this table most of the images are related to late spring and summer and the coefficient of determination of sunshine hours and estimated rn values in this station is r2 0 78 as expected this table proved the dependence of the estimated rn of this study on sunshine hours 3 2 daily evaporation in the initial step freshwater rn was calculated using equation 28 provided in this study afterwards the distribution of potential evaporation was calculated using the selected four methods including fao56 pm kimberly penman hargreaves samani and priestley taylor over freshwater reservoir of karaj and taleghan after calculating evaporation for the entire reservoir surfaces the calculated evaporation of the nearest pixel of each reservoir by each of the four methods was compared with pan data table 4 evaporation maps of the two selected reservoirs were produced using sebal and metric models for a better analysis of the performance of the four methods table 4 since hargreaves samani s method is a temperature based one and rn parameter is not considered in its equation a constant evaporation value was calculated as the representative of the whole reservoir and the spatial distribution of evaporation was not calculated in this method hence the spatial distribution of evaporation was only calculated using fao56 pm kp and priestley taylor methods as it is obvious from table 4 kp method and fao56 pm method have revealed better performances compared with hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods this is due to the fact that kp and fao56 pm methods are among combination methods containing all effective parameters on evaporation estimation however hargreaves samani and priestley taylor methods are simplified methods which do not consider all the influencing parameters on evaporation which may cause some uncertainties table 5 represents rmse and r2 among evaporation values which are calculated through potential evaporation calculation methods together with energy balance methods and are compared against measured evaporation by pan evaporation as it can be clearly witnessed the kp method was leading with r2 0 76 and rmse 1 29 mm and fao56 pm method with r2 0 75 and rmse 1 76 mm provided better results in comparison with other methods on the other hand priestley taylor method with r2 0 2437 and rmse 2 67 mm showed a less satisfactory performance compared to other models although sebal and metric models have been employed in different studies on the farms with different crops and resulted in acceptable performances in water bodies these models provided less effective performances than combination methods table 5 which can be due to uncertainty in determination of water heat flux at the satellite overpass time altogether the results indicated that kp and fao56 pm models owned the highest efficiency level in evaporation estimation of water body surfaces in the selected study areas with arid climates in iran table 5 shows rmse and r2 among evaporation values calculated from five methods including metric fao56 pm kp hargreaves samani and priestley taylor set against evaporation estimated by sebal model as one of the most applied evapotranspiration remote sensing methods as it can be seen metric fao56 pm and kp models produced results similar to sebal model and they also had higher correlation coefficients compared with sebal model moreover the metric method with r2 0 82 and rmse 0 49 mm had closer results to sebal model than other models the reason for which is that the metric is developed based on sebal model except for minor differences therefore the calculation process for rn in both methods was the same except for atmospheric transmissivity calculation furthermore each of them concluded in a distinct equation for soil heat flux calculation however the 0 5 rn was considered as the water heat flux according to a recommendation made by allen et al 2002 because the focused studied field was water the main difference between sebal and metric models is in selection of cold pixel and evaporation fractions more precisely in metric cold pixel is selected with characteristics similar to alfalfa reference crop on an agricultural farm and the reference crop evaporation is used to convert the instantaneous evaporation at the satellite overpass time to daily evaporation hence in this study a well irrigated agriculture farm nearest to the reservoir was selected to determine cold pixel in metric model fig 4 shows the performance diagram of the six selected methods in evaporation estimation over the reservoirs using pan evaporation measurements as it is obvious kp sebal and metric methods overestimate evaporation compared to other methods priestley taylor method underestimates evaporation compared with other methods in addition fao56 pm and kp methods show close numerical values sebal and metric models which are energy balance based models also display resembling results according to the results of evaluation of fao56 pm and kp methods in table 6 it could be concluded that these two methods can perform more efficiently in estimation of evaporation from water body surface the provided relationships by different researchers so far have succeeded to calculate evaporation at one point and at the meteorological station however in this study spatial distribution over the dam reservoir was calculated using remote sensing images and an equation was proposed to calculate rn of water surface 3 3 spatial variation of daily evaporation in order to show evaporation distribution map fig 5 shows daily evaporation over amirkabir reservoir using fao56 pm kimberly penman and priestley taylor methods on 5 august 2015 as an example calculated evaporation from the reservoir using kimberly penman method fig 5a indicated that the evaporation amount from the reservoir was less at the northern part of the dam reservoir due to less radiation moreover radiation and evaporation was more at the southern part of amirkabir dam reservoir fig 5a as fig 5b shows the fao56 pm method calculated higher evaporation values from the priestley taylor method evaporation from the reservoir with fao56 pm method also showed that most of the northern parts of the reservoir had less evaporation than the southern parts fig 5c indicates that evaporation estimated by priestley taylor method from the southern part of dam was also more than the estimated values from its northern parts another reason for generating different calculation of daily evaporation over water surface by different models can be the wind speed and direction evaporation of water surface depends on solar rn air humidity air temperature and wind speed the surrounding air of the water surface become gradually saturated with the increase of water vapor in the evaporating surface if the humidity in the air doesn t move it would cause a halt in the process of evaporation however since wind speed is usually more than zero the saturated air is replaced by drier air hence in addition to the impact of rn on the amount of evaporation increasing the wind speed and direction can alter the evaporation level of the surface of the reservoir fig 6 shows a sample of daily evaporation map acquired for taleghan dam on 30 june 2017 this figure also shows variable evaporation distribution over the surface of the dam according to fig 6 exactly like amirkabir reservoir kp method showed evaporation amounts higher than the two other methods moreover fao56 pm method showed higher evaporation values than priestley taylor method fig 6b the calculated evaporation values from the three methods for both reservoirs revealed similar values because the spatial coordinates of dams were not far different from each other and their climates were similar too for instance the range of calculated evaporation values through kp method for amirkabir and taleghan dams were approximately the same 3 4 evaporation from the whole reservoir table 7 shows daily evaporation volume lost from the reservoir using fao56 pm kp and priestley taylor methods in the two calculations 1 considering a fixed value for albedo and evaporation as a representative of the entire dam and 2 considering variable amounts for albedo and calculating evaporation for each pixel of the reservoir as it is clear there s a considerable difference between the two calculations just as most researches have considered the constant value of 0 065 as water surface albedo finch and hall 2001 in calculation 1 in this measurement the constant albedo value of 0 065 was considered as the albedo of reservoir surface as table 7 also shows on the days during which the constant albedo was much different from the computational albedo for every pixel the computational evaporation volume was remarkably different moreover due to the larger area of taleghan compared to amirkabir reservoir the computational evaporation volume difference was more visible in the two calculations of the study therefore considering a constant value as albedo from the reservoir causes errors in evaporation estimations and water resource management of the reservoir this study provided a simplified method to determine rn over freshwater surface using remote sensing data and in the next step rn was employed to determine evaporation by four common evaporation estimation methods the results of this study showed higher improvements compared to similar studies this study also evaluated the proposed evaporation estimation method against the two well known energy balance methods which proved the efficiency of our method in determination of water surface evaporation in the most of previous studies on water body surface albedo of water was considered as a constant value finch and hall 2001 this research however proved that considering a constant value can cause an error in determination of water evaporation moreover in former studies conducted using combination and radiation based methods such as abtew 2001 wang et al 2019 a fixed value of evaporation was considered as representative from whole water surface in this research a simplified method using the remote sensing data as an input parameter was developed to calculate the spatial distribution of rn and subsequently evaporation of freshwater body was estimated although in some studies such as wang et al 2019 the installed instrument over the reservoir was used to estimate energy balance components such instruments are expensive and non existent in most areas of the world it seems that the presented method in this research could be valuable to estimate rn and evaporation for areas that suffering from a lack of measurement instruments our proposed method also requires less input data to estimate the rn over water surface of reservoir compared to moukomla and blanken 2017 besides our proposed method estimated rn on a daily basis while moukomla and blanken 2017 calculated it at the satellite overpass time which cannot be used in a daily evaporation model requiring the daily rn the results of the statistical analyses comparing predicted and measured rn data in our study was also very satisfactory the results of this study was in line with wang et al 2019 in which the combination based models had better performance compared to the radiation based methods over water body moreover fao56 model is a standard model with proper performance in the estimation of evapotranspiration of various crops using crop factor rácz et al 2013 the findings of this study proved that fao56 has adequate efficiency in estimation of water body evaporation the introduced technique of this study definitely suffers from its own limitations the utilized meteorological variables as the input of the models was considered constant over whole pixels of the reservoir which may cause uncertainty in the final pixel value however due to low variations in the climate data over the water body the impact of this factor can be considered negligible furthermore some meteorological parameters such as undetected clouds and aerosols could also have affected the satellite images and consequently might have influenced the rn calculations 4 conclusion the purpose of this study was to provide a model to prepare a spatial distribution map of evaporation over freshwater bodies using the daily rn calculated from satellite images to this aim a new simplified relationship was provided in this study to calculate rn over freshwater surface subsequently using the provided equation for rn the evaporation spatial distribution over the iranian taleghan and amirkabir reservoirs was calculated this proposed equation for freshwater surface rn was employed to calculate potential evaporation using four different equations namely fao56 pm priestley taylor kimberly penman and hargreaves samani moreover for a more efficient comparison and evaluation of the proposed model the results were compared with sebal and metric models evaporation estimation results were evaluated using six methods with pan data and it was found that the combination methods of kimberly penman r2 0 76 rmse 1 29 mm and nse 0 65 and fao56 pm r2 0 75 rmse 1 76 mm and nse 0 36 could present better performances than other methods it was also found that fao56 pm and kimberly penman methods as well as sebal and metric models had closely similar results in this respect the advantage of the proposed method of this study compared to the sebal and metric methods is the specific determination of rn over the freshwater surface on a daily basis with a new special simplified equation that requires less input from weather station data in general the obtained results indicated the efficiency of our proposed model in this study for calculating rn values using satellite images and for applying such values in evaporation calculation models for the purpose of development of an evaporation map over the freshwater bodies as a suggestion for future research the presented method of this research can be applied for saline water bodies as long as the salinity factor is considered as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3786,the israeli central mountain rim was chosen to represent the transformation of rain chemical composition to runoff composition in a carbonate landscape under a mediterranean climate it was found

geochemical modeling for studying runoff formation is less usual moreover in seasonal arid and semiarid regions with winter rains and hot dry summers runoff chemistry modeling and delineation is a major challenge while many runoff chemical composition studies are focused on anthropogenic contamination examining natural runoff chemistry formation helps define the development of the anthropogenic processes once understood changes in ph and major ion concentrations can distinguish the natural processes from inorganic anthropogenic pollution nativ et al 1997 just about 3 on average of the annual rainfall in the judea and samaria mountains is transformed into runoff anker et al 2019 which constitutes practically the entire groundwater recharge component weinberger et al 2012 and understanding its chemical development is the main goal of the presented study 2 geographical setting the shiloh drainage basin in the central part of the samaria mountain rim was chosen as a mountainous mediterranean watershed representative the study area consists of a developed karstic terrain with an altitude range from less than 100 m above sea level asl at the western contact with the coastal plain and up to 900 m asl along the eastern mountain rims the study area represents the upper cretaceous carbonates outcrops mostly dolomites of the mountain aquifer fig 1 annual average rainfall is around 500 mm and all the rains fall usually between october and april the main soil type in the region is terra rossa but over chalk and marl lithologies there are commonly developed rendzina soils zaidenberg and dan 1979 the shiloh basin fig 1 where the runoff sampling occurred covers an area of about 400 km2 which is about 20 of the contributing area to regional drainage datum the yarkon river which once flooded poses severe consequences to adjacent populated regions anker et al 2019 3 methods runoff sampling occurred in three points within ariel city and 11 other points spread along the shiloh stream in all the events water height at sampling points was about 10 cm and the flow rate ranges from 1 to 2 m sec description of the sampling sites including coordinates lithology type and name of geological unit forming the outcrops are shown in table 1 ph and temperature were measured in the field by using the vernier portable laboratory for major ion analysis two 0 5 l pet bottles one for anion analysis and the other for cation analysis were washed three times and filled to the top with runoff and stored refrigerated until the analysis immediately when reaching the eastern r d soil and water laboratory at ariel university within the same day the samples were filtered with 0 2 µm filters and the samples for cation analysis were acidified with 1 5 hcl and 1 5 hno3 cation concentration was measured by the varian liberty 1 icp oes sm 3120 and anions by the dionex 1100 ion chromatography system the chemical analyses was validated by parallel measurements in the

derived from the default phreeqc dat database and llnl dat database that contains thermodynamic data for a wide range of trace elements with careful data checking for runoff evaporation modeling the pitzer dat database was used this database takes into consideration the specific ion interaction model of pitzer at high ionic strengths 4 results and discussion chemical composition of rain and runoff samples is presented in table 2 the average mg concentration in rainwater is around 1 5 mg l which is similar to other regions in the judea and samaria mountains burg 1998 herut 1992 and is mostly of marine origin herut 1992 during the rainy season october march when runoff periodically forms the air temperature is usually low and relative humidity is high which causes seasonal evaporation to be decreased during the rain event the evaporation is smaller than 10 usually less than 5 of the runoff volume meteorological service of israel 2020 consequently the expected mg concentration in runoff at a theoretical inert surface should not exceed 2 mg l although the measured mg concentrations in the runoff for the judea and samaria mountain dolomitic terrains are in the range of 3 18 mg l burg 1998 during runoff formation cation exchange cannot noticeably increase the mg concentration because of the high mass ratio of water to accessible clay particles both when these particles are scattered on the carbonate outcrop slopes or concentrated as layers in the stream beds besides this low cation concentrations in rainwater and quasi equilibrium between the perennial rainfall and soil at the same site also define the limited influence of the cation exchange the main increase in mg concentration during runoff formation is probably caused by water rock interaction which in the research area is from dissolution dolomite constitutes the common mineralogy to the various rock formations anker 2007 following the phreeqc modeling at the present atmospheric co2 concentration of 0 041 https www co2 earth and representative runoff temperature of 15 c table 2 burg 1998 equilibrium with dolomite should provide mg concentrations in the runoff of about 6 1 9 9 mg l and ph of about 8 1 8 3 with databases phreeqc dat and core10 dat in most runoff samples measured in the field ph values indeed are close to the above equilibrium values and mg concentrations are also of the same order 6 7 mg l at average table 2 the situation with calcium concentrations in the runoff is different following phreeqc modeling at above mentioned atmospheric co2 concentration 0 041 and runoff temperature 15 c equilibrium with dolomite and calcite should have provided ca concentrations in runoff of about 10 16 3 mg l and 24 8 25 4 mg l respectively with phreeqc dat and core10 dat databases nonetheless ca concentrations measured in the runoff ranged from 14 8 to 97 1 mg l 44 9 at average and 43 9 at the median about twice as high compared with the modeled concentrations for dolomite and calcite dissolution at all possible ratios of dolomite and calcite masses in equilibrium with rainwater the phreeqc modeling was not consistent with the high rca rmg equivalent ratios that were measured in runoff samples 2 94 8 51 table 2 which strongly exceed the dolomite stoichiometric ratio 1 0 implying an additional calcium source a good correlation between equivalent calcium and sulfate concentrations in all the samples fig 2 implies that this source may be related to calcium sulfates gypsum glauberite etc formed as a result of residual runoff evaporation between rain events that are enriched by dry fallout dissolution of these sulfates can account for oversaturation with respect to calcite found in about a third of the runoff samples glauberite na2ca so4 2 dissolution can also explain the high na to cl equivalent ratio in runoff 1 29 at average table 2 as compared to this ratio in rain about 0 6 at average table 2 bulk dolomite sampled at the mountainous mediterranean climate of judea and samaria usually contains very low sulfate concentrations in the range of 0 02 0 05 of weight jebreen et al 2018 hence the main input of sulfate and calcium to the runoff should be from external sources during dust storms gypsum particles constitute about 10 of the total dust mass ganor et al 2009 at the reported annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 following only saharan storms frumkin and stein 2004 ganor and foner 2001 the gypsum deposition ranges from 5 g m2 yr to 10 g m2 yr 6 10 g m2 yr reported by kishcha et al 2020 for comparison annual sulfate and calcium inputs from rains in ariel constitute about 1 5 g m2 yr and 1 6 g m2 yr correspondingly which is much less than with dry deposition the deposited small gypsum particles with the high reactive surface are dissolved when runoff forms although once runoff is totally evaporated more soluble sulfate minerals precipitate and they are the first to be dissolved at the following runoff event anker et al 2009 for assessing the geochemical processes feasibility a series of numerical simulations for various combinations of runoff evaporation and water rock interactions were done the simulation results for runoff evaporation on dolomite calcite dolomite calcite or marl surface by the prevailing geological formation lithology at each site in equilibrium with the atmospheric co2 are presented in fig 3 and table 3 the results suggest that at the eutonic point after which evaporite composition does not change the precipitated minerals are calcite halite and glauberite and sometimes anhydrite and sylvite fig 3 gypsum and anhydrite always precipitate at the early stages of evaporation and afterward gypsum is completely dissolved leaving anhydrite and glauberite to be the only solid sulfates the numerical simulations show that changing the temperature in the range of 15 40 c usually does not change the precipitated salt composition table 3 lists masses of minerals precipitated at the study sites when the sampled runoff the israeli central mountain rim was chosen to represent the transformation of rain chemical composition to runoff composition in a carbonate landscape under a mediterranean climate it was found that at the mostly dolomitic slopes of the samaria mountains the main processes shaping runoff chemistry are dissolution of dry fallout dust and salts that were precipitated during evaporation of water from previous small scale runoff events calcium and sulfate concentrations in the runoff are defined mainly by the dissolution of dust minerals the main input of sodium and chloride into runoff composition comes from both rain and dissolution of halite that remained from the evaporation of the previous

studying runoff chemistry formation numerical simulations of runoff sample evaporation have shown that the main minerals precipitating during dry periods are calcite anhydrite gypsum glauberite and halite the high na to cl equivalent ratios about 1 3 at average may reflect the two phase dissolution of sulfates and halite in the initial stage that whereas and of glauberite in the following stage rainwater transformation to runoff inverse modeling was found to be consistent with the forward modeling results confirming these runoff chemical processes numerical simulations of runoff evaporation for terraces with almost nil runoff and soil typical cation exchange capacity of 30 meq 100 g zaidenberg and dan 1979 indicate that the precipitating minerals were calcite gypsum and halite owing to the relatively high gypsum anhydrite and especially of halite and glauberite solubility after they precipitate through runoff evaporation table 3 they may entirely be dissolved during the following rain events after these simulations a mass balance was done with phreeqc inverse modeling capacity to evaluate the chemical processes and mass transfers involved in the transformation of the ariel rainwater chemical composition to that of runoff samples at three sites across the city drainage basin the transformation models obtained by the inverse modeling table 4 are characterized by negligible nil evaporation during the rain event dissolution of both dolomite from the outcrops and minerals precipitated during previous runoff evaporation calcite anhydrite glauberite and halite and also the dissolution of the atmospheric co2 maintaining carbonate dissolution the ca input to runoff from dolomite dissolution is 3 12 times smaller than the total ca input from dry fallout dissolution and from previously temporarily precipitated minerals calcite anhydrite and glauberite the comparison of the inverse modeling results of rainwater transformation to runoff at ariel site dissolution of minerals with results of the forward modeling precipitation of these minerals shows the consistency of the results of the forward and inverse modeling in both numerical simulations the mass transfers have been received with the same order of magnitude fig 4 while the calculated average masses of precipitating soluble salts anhydrite halite and glauberite were systematically higher than the modeled average masses of dissolved salts fig 4 no soluble salt accumulation was found on the surface salt accumulation was found on the surface in a more arid region about 35 km south east of the study area and the absence of such salts in ariel can be explained by salt precipitation in a deeper 3 m and more soil accumulation horizon b owing to longer transport by runoff percolation anker et al 2009 the inverse modeling of salt dissolution during rain transformation into runoff did not take this layer into account considering the processes taking place only at the surface of outcrops the modeling results for calcite are the opposite the dissolution during runoff formation from rainwater exceeds the precipitation during runoff evaporation this may be explained by the significant addition of finely dispersed soluble calcite with dust dust storm samples from different locations in israel contain 30 40 calcite on average ganor 1975 ganor et al 2009 at annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 frumkin and stein 2004 ganor and foner 2001 the variance in calcite precipitation and dissolution fig 4 can be related to the range of annual calcite deposition from dust 15 40 g m2 and its partial dissolution for ariel s average rainfall of about 500 mm 500 l m2 the modeling suggests a calcite dissolution range of 68 7 96 8 mg kgw and an annual dissolved calcite mass of 34 48 g m2 the modeled dissolved calcite mass to its mas in dry fallout demonstrated reasonable fit table 5 as well as during runoff evaporation and mineral precipitation in anhydrite these in comparison the ranges are close but do not coincide since any considerable calcite and gypsum accumulations on dolomite outcrops of the samaria mountains have not been observed finely dispersed calcite and gypsum anhydrite settling with dry fallout and precipitated during evaporation of runoff have to be dissolved by the following rains the halite fraction in dry fallout over israel is minor with an average mass concentration of up to 0 2 ganor et al 1991 and annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 which constitutes 0 1 0 2 g m2 yr frumkin and stein 2004 this contribution can be neglected as the chloride in a mass form rain in ariel is about 7 9 g m2 yr 5 conclusions it has been found that at the mostly dolomitic slopes of the samaria mountains the main processes forming runoff chemistry are dissolution of dry fallout and of salts that were precipitated during evaporation of small scale runoff events dust storms supplying small gypsum and calcite particles with high reactive surfaces were found to strongly influence runoff chemical composition calcium and sulfate concentrations in the runoff are defined mainly by the dissolution of these dry fallout minerals calcium contribution from the surface dolomite dissolution 8 23 from the total ca input was found to be 3 to 12 times smaller than its total contribution from the dissolution of dry fallout and the temporary surface evaporitic minerals the portion of dry fallout halite in the runoff composition appeared to be negligible the main input of sodium and chloride to runoff composition comes from both rain and dissolution of halite that remained from the evaporation of the previous runoff whereas the main input of magnesium is connected to dissolution of dolomite outcrops a combination of forward and inverse phreeqc modeling was found to be effective for studying runoff chemistry formation numerical simulations of evaporation of the sampled runoff have shown that the main minerals precipitating during dry periods at all the studied geological settings are calcite anhydrite gypsum glauberite and halite sulfates and halite are completely dissolved by the following rains glauberite dissolution provides high equivalent na to cl ratios about 1 3 at average in the studied runoff the results of inverse modeling of rainwater composition transformation to runoff were

perennial rainfall and soil at the same site also define the limited influence of the cation exchange the main increase in mg concentration during runoff formation is probably caused by water rock interaction which in the research area is from dissolution dolomite constitutes the common mineralogy to the various rock formations anker 2007 following the phreeqc modeling at the present atmospheric co2 concentration of 0 041 https www co2 earth and representative runoff temperature of 15 c table 2 burg 1998 equilibrium with dolomite should provide mg concentrations in the runoff of about 6 1 9 9 mg l and ph of about 8 1 8 3 with databases phreeqc dat and core10 dat in most runoff samples measured in the field ph values indeed are close to the above equilibrium values and mg concentrations are also of the same order 6 7 mg l at average table 2 the situation with calcium concentrations in the runoff is different following phreeqc modeling at above mentioned atmospheric co2 concentration 0 041 and runoff temperature 15 c equilibrium with dolomite and calcite should have provided ca concentrations in runoff of about 10 16 3 mg l and 24 8 25 4 mg l respectively with phreeqc dat and core10 dat databases nonetheless ca concentrations measured in the runoff ranged from 14 8 to 97 1 mg l 44 9 at average and 43 9 at the median about twice as high compared with the modeled concentrations for dolomite and calcite dissolution at all possible ratios of dolomite and calcite masses in equilibrium with rainwater the phreeqc modeling was not consistent with the high rca rmg equivalent ratios that were measured in runoff samples 2 94 8 51 table 2 which strongly exceed the dolomite stoichiometric ratio 1 0 implying an additional calcium source a good correlation between equivalent calcium and sulfate concentrations in all the samples fig 2 implies that this source may be related to calcium sulfates gypsum glauberite etc formed as a result of residual runoff evaporation between rain events that are enriched by dry fallout dissolution of these sulfates can account for oversaturation with respect to calcite found in about a third of the runoff samples glauberite na2ca so4 2 dissolution can also explain the high na to cl equivalent ratio in runoff 1 29 at average table 2 as compared to this ratio in rain about 0 6 at average table 2 bulk dolomite sampled at the mountainous mediterranean climate of judea and samaria usually contains very low sulfate concentrations in the range of 0 02 0 05 of weight jebreen et al 2018 hence the main input of sulfate and calcium to the runoff should be from external sources during dust storms gypsum particles constitute about 10 of the total dust mass ganor et al 2009 at the reported annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 following only saharan storms frumkin and stein 2004 ganor and foner 2001 the gypsum deposition ranges from 5 g m2 yr to 10 g m2 yr 6 10 g m2 yr reported by kishcha et al 2020 for comparison annual sulfate and calcium inputs from rains in ariel constitute about 1 5 g m2 yr and 1 6 g m2 yr correspondingly which is much less than with dry deposition the deposited small gypsum particles with the high reactive surface are dissolved when runoff forms although once runoff is totally evaporated more soluble sulfate minerals precipitate and they are the first to be dissolved at the following runoff event anker et al 2009 for assessing the geochemical processes feasibility a series of numerical simulations for various combinations of runoff evaporation and water rock interactions were done the simulation results for runoff evaporation on dolomite calcite dolomite calcite or marl surface by the prevailing geological formation lithology at each site in equilibrium with the atmospheric co2 are presented in fig 3 and table 3 the results suggest that at the eutonic point after which evaporite composition does not change the precipitated minerals are calcite halite and glauberite and sometimes anhydrite and sylvite fig 3 gypsum and anhydrite always precipitate at the early stages of evaporation and afterward gypsum is completely dissolved leaving anhydrite and glauberite to be the only solid sulfates the numerical simulations show that changing the temperature in the range of 15 40 c usually does not change the precipitated salt composition table 3 lists masses of minerals precipitated at the study sites when the sampled runoff the israeli central mountain rim was chosen to represent the transformation of rain chemical composition to runoff composition in a carbonate landscape under a mediterranean climate it was found that at the mostly dolomitic slopes of the samaria mountains the main processes shaping runoff chemistry are dissolution of dry fallout dust and salts that were precipitated during evaporation of water from previous small scale runoff events calcium and sulfate concentrations in the runoff are defined mainly by the dissolution of dust minerals the main input of sodium and chloride into runoff composition comes from both rain and dissolution of halite that remained from the evaporation of the previous runoff whereas the main input of magnesium is connected to dissolution of dolomite outcrops a combination of forward and inverse modeling by using phreeqc software was found to be effective for studying runoff chemistry formation numerical simulations of runoff sample evaporation have shown that the main minerals precipitating during dry periods are calcite anhydrite gypsum glauberite and halite the high na to cl equivalent ratios about 1 3 at average may reflect the two phase dissolution of sulfates and halite in the initial stage that whereas and of glauberite in the following stage rainwater transformation to runoff inverse modeling was found to be consistent with the forward modeling results confirming these runoff chemical processes numerical simulations of runoff evaporation for terraces with almost nil runoff and soil typical cation exchange capacity of 30 meq 100 g zaidenberg and dan 1979 indicate that the precipitating minerals were calcite gypsum and halite owing to the relatively high gypsum anhydrite and especially of halite and glauberite solubility after they precipitate through runoff evaporation table 3 they may entirely be dissolved during the following rain events after these simulations a mass balance was done with phreeqc inverse modeling capacity to evaluate the chemical processes and mass transfers involved in the transformation of the ariel rainwater chemical composition to that of runoff samples at three sites across the city drainage basin the transformation models obtained by the inverse modeling table 4 are characterized by negligible nil evaporation during the rain event dissolution of both dolomite from the outcrops and minerals precipitated during previous runoff evaporation calcite anhydrite glauberite and halite and also the dissolution of the atmospheric co2 maintaining carbonate dissolution the ca input to runoff from dolomite dissolution is 3 12 times smaller than the total ca input from dry fallout dissolution and from previously temporarily precipitated minerals calcite anhydrite and glauberite the comparison of the inverse modeling results of rainwater transformation to runoff at ariel site dissolution of minerals with results of the forward modeling precipitation of these minerals shows the consistency of the results of the forward and inverse modeling in both numerical simulations the mass transfers have been received with the same order of magnitude fig 4 while the calculated average masses of precipitating soluble salts anhydrite halite and glauberite were systematically higher than the modeled average masses of dissolved salts fig 4 no soluble salt accumulation was found on the surface salt accumulation was found on the surface in a more arid region about 35 km south east of the study area and the absence of such salts in ariel can be explained by salt precipitation in a deeper 3 m and more soil accumulation horizon b owing to longer transport by runoff percolation anker et al 2009 the inverse modeling of salt dissolution during rain transformation into runoff did not take this layer into account considering the processes taking place only at the surface of outcrops the modeling results for calcite are the opposite the dissolution during runoff formation from rainwater exceeds the precipitation during runoff evaporation this may be explained by the significant addition of finely dispersed soluble calcite with dust dust storm samples from different locations in israel contain 30 40 calcite on average ganor 1975 ganor et al 2009 at annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 frumkin and stein 2004 ganor and foner 2001 the variance in calcite precipitation and dissolution fig 4 can be related to the range of annual calcite deposition from dust 15 40 g m2 and its partial dissolution for ariel s average rainfall of about 500 mm 500 l m2 the modeling suggests a calcite dissolution range of 68 7 96 8 mg kgw and an annual dissolved calcite mass of 34 48 g m2 the modeled dissolved calcite mass to its mas in dry fallout demonstrated reasonable fit table 5 as well as during runoff evaporation and mineral precipitation in anhydrite these in comparison the ranges are close but do not coincide since any considerable calcite and gypsum accumulations on dolomite outcrops of the samaria mountains have not been observed finely dispersed calcite and gypsum anhydrite settling with dry fallout and precipitated during evaporation of runoff have to be dissolved by the following rains the halite fraction in dry fallout over israel is minor with an average mass concentration of up to 0 2 ganor et al 1991 and annual dust deposition in samaria of 50 100 g m2 which constitutes 0 1 0 2 g m2 yr frumkin and stein 2004 this contribution can be neglected as the chloride in a mass form rain in ariel is about 7 9 g m2 yr 5 conclusions it has been found that at the mostly dolomitic slopes of the samaria mountains the main processes forming runoff chemistry are dissolution of dry fallout and of salts that were precipitated during evaporation of small scale runoff events dust storms supplying small gypsum and calcite particles with high reactive surfaces were found to strongly influence runoff chemical composition calcium and sulfate concentrations in the runoff are defined mainly by the dissolution of these dry fallout minerals calcium contribution from the surface dolomite dissolution 8 23 from the total ca input was found to be 3 to 12 times smaller than its total contribution from the dissolution of dry fallout and the temporary surface evaporitic minerals the portion of dry fallout halite in the runoff composition appeared to be negligible the main input of sodium and chloride to runoff composition comes from both rain and dissolution of halite that remained from the evaporation of the previous runoff whereas the main input of magnesium is connected to dissolution of dolomite outcrops a combination of forward and inverse phreeqc modeling was found to be effective for studying runoff chemistry formation numerical simulations of evaporation of the sampled runoff have shown that the main minerals precipitating during dry periods at all the studied geological settings are calcite anhydrite gypsum glauberite and halite sulfates and halite are completely dissolved by the following rains glauberite dissolution provides high equivalent na to cl ratios about 1 3 at average in the studied runoff the results of inverse modeling of rainwater composition transformation to runoff were found to be consistent with the forward modeling results confirming the disclosed processes of runoff chemistry formation credit authorship contribution statement michael zilberbrand methodology

3787,rapid onset droughts termed as flash droughts cause short term but serious threats to terrestrial ecosystems and influence carbon dynamics due to insufficient warning to date how the regional terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to flash droughts in india remains unknown since india is highly dependent on its cropland and vegetation identifying the influence of flash droughts on terrestrial ecosystem is important here we use modis remote sensing satellite sensor based gross primary productivity gpp and remote sensing based soil moisture data to compute the response of ecosystems to flash droughts in india from the investigation it was observed that gpp responds to more than 95 of the flash droughts across india with the highest response frequency occurring over ganga basin and southern india while the lowest response across northeastern india the discrepancies in the response frequencies are mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country moreover the mean response time is about 10 to 19 days averaged over india with the lowest and highest response time over indus ganga basins and northeastern indian river basins including the brahmaputra minor rivers draining into myanmar basin mrmb and barak basins respectively severe reduction in water use efficiency wue was observed for the ganga river basin and some parts of southern india which highlighted the non resilient nature of ecosystem towards rapid soil moisture variations the study facilitates the identification of flash drought hotspots in the country including the indus basin southern river basins cauveri efrpcp and efrscb basins some parts of the ganga basin and the ability of an ecosystem to withstand such drastic conditions these findings

pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 it can cause massive environmental economic and social consequences across the world soľáková et al 2014 wilhite et al 2007 generally conventional drought is defined as a slowly growing climate phenomenon das et al 2021a b taking few months or more to attain its spatial extent and maximum intensity poonia et al 2021b 2021c yuan et al 2017 otkin et al 2013 however recent findings have revealed a new kind of rapidly growing drought termed as flash drought flash drought is a recently identified extreme event characterized by its sudden onset and rapid intensification otkin et al 2018 the sudden onset allows limited time for planning and preparation causing destructive impacts on the terrestrial ecosystem and agriculture due to insufficient early warnings liu et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 gerken et al 2018 due to rapid intensification and high evapotranspiration et flash drought causes quick soil moisture depletion which results in vegetation

minimized carbon uptake 100 tg c in china despite the ecological impacts and increasing occurrence of flash droughts our understanding of flash drought and its impact on the terrestrial ecosystem remains incomplete therefore it is crucial to understand that how different ecosystems respond under flash drought conditions in order to predict the future atmospheric co2 concentrations and terrestrial carbon sink as well as to provide recommendations for drought mitigation and prevention policies drought can adversely impact the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem which in turn influences food security particularly for a developing country like india jha et al 2019 thomey et al 2011 drought also affects the carbon cycle by changing the physiological behavior comprising

drought conditions in china they found that lower water use efficiency during droughts was observed in northwestern china whereas wue was increased over south china and northeast china further zhang et al 2020 suggest to assess the response of terrestrial ecosystem to flash droughts moreover it is also important to incorporate the response time and response frequency of flash drought due to their variability over different regions therefore it is the need of the hour to understand that how ecosystem indicators gpp wue underlying water use efficiency uwue respond to flash drought regarding the investigation of wue during flash droughts few global studies have been carried out across the world zhang and yuan 2020 guo et al 2019 xie et al 2016 however how the regional terrestrial carbon

gadgil 2006 moreover india is considered amongst the most vulnerable and drought prone countries around the world mishra and singh 2010 therefore it is important to examine the flash drought and its impact on the ecosystem over india moreover understanding the seasonal variability of flash drought occurrence is also crucial especially in the rainfed based agricultural regions of india asoka et al 2017 in this work we present a novel approach integrating remote sensing observations gpp wue uwue and climate data to quantify the ecosystem response to flash droughts in a finer and systematic view over india this study to the author s knowledge will be the first attempt to assess the ecosystem response to the flash drought for the whole country using multiple ecosystem metrics the objectives of this study can be summarized as follows i to perform triple collocation tc technique to assess the accuracy of soil moisture datasets ii investigate the seasonal distribution of flash droughts and the associated hydrometeorological characteristics during different stages of flash droughts iii investigate the seasonal response of ecosystem indicators gpp wue uwue to flash droughts over india the present analysis is performed using moderate resolution 0 250 0 250 precipitation temperature soil moisture datasets over 24 river basins of india moreover satellite dataset i e terrestrial gpp product mod17a2 from the modis is used for spatiotemporal assessment of wuee and uwuee from 2000 to 2014 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area india is the 7th largest country across the world covering an area of approximately 3 28 million sq km according to india wris 2014 classification india is divided into 24 major river basins based on different climatic variability the present analysis is conducted over 24 major river basins of the country to quantify the occurrence of flash droughts fig s1 fig s1 illustrates the location and associated details of river basins in india precipitation and temperature conditions substantially varies on spatio temporal scale therefore all 24 major river basins are important for the flash drought investigation for example the western part of the country receives very less precipitation 500 mm year whereas the western ghats and the northeastern part of india receive high precipitation greater than2000 mm year 2 2 meteorological data for the present study daily gridded precipitation dataset was obtained from imd during 1981 2014 at a grid resolution of 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude the imd precipitation dataset is available from 1901 to 2015 and the readers are suggested to refer pai et al 2014 for more details imd datasets are realistic in nature and utilized in several studies kumar et al 2021 poonia et al 2021a das et al 2020 the mean annual precipitation mm year was determined from daily precipitation values at the same resolution 0 250 0 250 temperature data from 1981 to 2014 was also acquired from imd at a grid resolution of 1 latitude 1 longitude the relative humidity data was downloaded from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar re analysis

at a spatial resolution of 500 m the global annual gpp dataset is derived from modis mod17a3 product from 2000 to 2014 these datasets were obtained from the nasa eos program these products have been utilized in several research studies zhang and yuan 2020 huang et al 2017 reichstein et al 2007 the gpp dataset is finally aggregated to 0 250 0 250 resolution table s1 presents the types and sources of data used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 triple collocation availability of in situ based soil moisture data is scarce and application of satellite or model based products requires large scale validation considering the high uncertainty associated with soil moisture products and unavailability of in situ information various available products were evaluated against unknown truth based on triple collocation on all the possible triplets the triplets were derived by arbitrarily selecting three products from a collection of 5 soil moisture datasets imdaa sm gldas 2noah sm merra 2 sm era interim sm and esa cci sm all the available products were firstly pre processed by resampling to 0 25 grids and converting them into 8 day products this was done to remove the influence of missing days and then various triplets were derived to obtain correlation and rmse values triple collocation was first developed to obtain error variance of wind dataset stoffelen 1998 which was later applied to soil moisture chen et al 2016 gruber et al 2016 and precipitation dubey et al 2021 the equations used to derive the correlation and rmse values from triple collocation can be obtained from mccoll et al 2014 3 2 flash drought identification initially daily gridded datasets soil moisture precipitation temperature were converted to 8 days called octads daily precipitation was added for the eight days while daily temperature and soil moisture were averaged for the eight days hence a total of 46 octads were achieved for each year where 16 octads represent the monsoon season i e 19th to 34th octads in a year while the remaining octads represent the non monsoon season from 1st to 18th and 35th to 46th octads in the present analysis soil moisture octads were used to identify flash droughts and their characteristics frequency and duration flash drought occurs due to a quick reduction in soil moisture caused by either increased temperature or rainfall scarcity or both ford and labosier 2017 flash drought was defined when the 8 day mean soil moisture percentile reduces to 20th or less percentile from above 40th percentile with a mean rate of decline no 5 percentile per 8 day period for example june 21 july 15 in fig 1 which is termed as the onset stage the reduction from 40th percentile to 20th percentile indicates the development of flash drought once the soil moisture starts to either decrease slowly or increase then the recovery stage of flash drought was considered once the soil moisture percentile rises to 20 or more percentile again then the drought ends e g july 31 in fig 1 moreover the minimum duration of 24 days was considered for flash droughts in order to avoid short dry spells that have a small impact on the ecosystem the 20th percentile was considered as the drought threshold to avoid persistent long term traditional droughts yuan et al 2019 hence flash droughts that transformed into traditional droughts were eliminated from the investigation readers are suggested to refer fig 1 for more details 3 3 ecosystem response to flash drought it is important to note that droughts have great impact on ecosystem productivity by changing ecosystem respiration and plant photosynthesis stocker et al 2018 gpp is the total photosynthetic co2 fixation at the ecosystem level and impacts all of the carbon cycle variables beer et al 2010 photosynthetic co2 assimilation is affected by leaf area index rubisco activity and stomatal conductance grossiord et al 2020 the negative anomalies of ecological metric i e gpp indicates the commencement of ecological response the standardized anomalies are computed as 1 gpp sa gpp μ gpp σ gpp where gpp sa are standardized anomalies of gpp σ gpp and μ gpp are standard deviation and mean of gpp time series for example all jan 1 8 during 2000 2014 would have a μ gpp and σ gpp and jan 9 16 would have another μ gpp and σ gpp and so on in this study response time index and response frequency are used to examine the interaction between ecological response and flash drought niu et al 2018 for each grid response frequency was obtained by dividing the flash drought events with negative gpp sa by the total flash droughts a lower response frequency indicates lower risk to the ecosystem and vice versa the response time index is described as the count of the positive standardized anomaly gpp sa till the occurrence of first negative value during flash droughts wue is computed as the ratio of gpp to evapotranspiration song et al 2017 in the present analysis daily potential evapotranspiration mm day is computed using fao penman monteith equation eq 2 and described as 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa oc g is ground heat flux mj m2 day rn is the net radiation at the surface mj m2 day γ is psychrometric constant kpa oc u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m sec vpd is vapour pressure deficit which is computed as the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressures the carbon cycle and water are linked via stomata and the vegetation will adopt some mitigation measures to deal with drought conditions for example increasing its water use efficiency xu et al 2019 in addition to drought wue is also sensitive to the vapour pressure deficit vpd therefore underlying water use efficiency uwue proposed by zhou et al 2014 would be a better alternative as it incorporates the effects of vpd underlying water use efficiencies are computed as ratio of the gpp vpd to the et to reflect the non linear interaction between et vpd and gpp the variations of underlying water use efficiency are supposed to be strongly associated with drought conditions the uwue is more appropriate than wue for describing the biochemical functions of plants zhou et al 2015 the average annual wue g c m 2 mm 1 yr 1 and uwue g c pa0 5 m 2 mm 1 yr 1 were computed from daily wue and uwue values the standardized anomalies of wue as well as uwue are computed using eq 1 4 results 4 1 triple collocation fig s2 a b represents the correlation coefficient values and fig s3 a b represent the rmse values obtained for various products by the application of triple collocation each row in these figure represent a triplet which was used to assess the performance of these products against the unknown truth gruber et al 2016 mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 these figures suggest that gldas 2 noah sm and era interim sm outperformed the other products whereas the performance of these two products were similar zonal statistics of different river basins suggested that gldas 2 noah sm was slightly better than era interim sm and therefore the data obtained from the gldas 2 noah sm was further used for the analysis of flash drought 4 2 meteorological and ecological conditions over india fig 2 presents the annual mean climatological and ecological characteristics over india based on 2000 2014 datasets the annual mean precipitation showed significant spatial variations over india ranges from 100 mm yr to 4000 mm yr fig 2a the western part of the country receives the lowest precipitation 500 mm year whereas the western ghats and the northeastern parts of india receive the highest precipitation greater than2000 mm year the mean annual soil moisture also showed considerable variation across the country fig 2b with very dry soil characteristics over western india in addition to the accumulated precipitation soil moisture is also related to the changes in evapotranspiration similarly the mean annual modis gpp also shows significant spatial variation over india fig 2c with maximum gpp spread across the western ghats and northeastern regions greater than1400 g c m2 whereas the minimum gpp distributed across the arid regions of western india 400 g c m2 one fourth of the forest area of the country lies in northeastern india whereas western india consists of grasslands with comparatively low vegetation productivity like precipitation and gpp mean annual wue and uwue also varies significantly over india fig 2 d e because of different soil climate and vegetation types wue is higher for northeastern parts of the country followed by eastern northern and southern regions respectively whereas lower wue is observed over western parts of the country due to low vegetation productivity the spatial variation in wue is strongly associated with the variations in the mean annual precipitation and gpp 4 3 flash drought and associated hydrometeorological characteristics across india the computation of flash drought duration and frequency are the same as those of traditional droughts mo 2011 however computed at a higher temporal scale the mean duration was computed by dividing the total flash drought duration by the total number of flash droughts and the frequency was defined as the total number of flash drought events per decade initially we investigate the seasonal distribution of flash droughts based on the frequency and mean duration that occurred during the 1981 2014 period in india fig 3 in case of monsoon season the mean frequency averaged over india is 2 6 events for 34 years 1981 2014 including some hotspots over indus basin fig 3a approximately 82 area of indus river basin km2 is likely to suffer from flash droughts during monsoon season table s2 moreover luni river basin with 70 of its area km2 is vulnerable to flash drought which is mainly attributed to the minimum annual rainfall over luni river basin subash and sikka 2014 moreover the mean duration of flash drought events is 37 days across all of india with the longest mean durations detected over western and northern parts of the country fig 3c particularly the luni river basin experience frequent flash drought events with longer durations as the luni river basin receives the minimum annual mean precipitation subash and sikka 2014 regions in the country like northeastern river basins showed low likelihood of drought events in monsoon season this suggests that vegetation cover of such river basins can tolerate extreme changes in soil moisture conditions in monsoon however in the non monsoon season the majority of river basins of the country experience frequent and longer flash droughts during 1981 2014 fig 3b d long dry spells with negative precipitation anomalies in the non monsoon rapidly reduce soil moisture which triggers flash droughts the mean frequency averaged over india is 5 3 events for 34 years whereas the mean duration is 54 days across all of india during the non monsoon season however in case of non monsoon season river basins such as ganga brahmani baitarani bb pennar cauveri efrkpb efrpcb efrscb mrbb mrmb basin were also unsafe from the flash droughts and more than 60 of their areas were identified as drought affected areas area wise the ganga basin was observed to be the most badly affected river basin nearly 73 i e 614 551 km2 to flash droughts table s2 interestingly arid or semi arid parts of western india particularly luni river basin which were mostly suffer from drought risks experienced the lowest frequency and duration of flash droughts during non monsoon season this suggests that these regions are more susceptible to seasonal or long term droughts rather than flash droughts in the non monsoon further we determined the seasonal distribution of mean duration of onset and recovery stages of flash drought events that occurred during 1981 2014 across india fig 4 during the monsoon season onset duration shows no substantial difference for different climate regions however in some regions the duration varied significantly at different grids i e from zero to above 35 fig 4a however the recovery duration is slightly longer in some parts of the country fig 4c interestingly it was observed that at least two third area of the ganga basin is witnessing zero onset duration however the recovery duration is longer more than 30 days due to lowered soil moisture level the mean duration of the onset as well as recovery stages are 20 days and 28 days respectively during the non monsoon season northeastern river basins brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb river basins southern river basins pennar cauveri efrpcb efrscb river basins and some parts of the ganga basin were witnessing longer onset as well as recovery duration during 1981 2014 fig 4b d this is primarily due to the precipitation deficit over a longer period the mean duration of the onset as well as recovery stages are 25 days and 29 days respectively fig 5 describes the soil moisture percentiles and associated meteorological conditions during different stages of flash drought in the non monsoon season only the pixels with at least three drought events detected are shown during the 1981 2014 period before the onset of drought the soil moisture percentile is close to 45 percentiles across all of the selected grid points fig 5a however during the onset of flash drought the soil moisture percentile falls from above 40 percentiles to 32 percentiles fig 5b as soon as the flash drought enters into the recovery stage there is a quick transition from high soil moisture condition to much drier condition approximately 15 percentile fig 5c further the soil moisture recovers quickly to 41 percentiles after the termination of flash drought fig 5d regarding the onset stage the standardized negative anomaly of precipitation and positive anomalies of temperature and vpd suggest that flash drought events are characterized by elevated evaporative demand and precipitation deficit fig 5 e p the quick drying of soil moisture is usually related to anomalously high temperature large rainfall deficits and high vpd wang et al 2016 which continue till the recovery stage of drought the decrease in vpd and increased rainfall relieves the soil moisture once the drought terminates readers are suggested to refer fig s4 for soil moisture percentiles and associated meteorological conditions during different stages of flash drought in the monsoon season 4 4 response of gpp to flash droughts across india fig 6 shows the response frequency and response time of gross primary productivity gpp to flash drought events during monsoon and non monsoon seasons across india in case of response frequency no substantial discrepancy was observed across different climate regions of the country during monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons fig 6a b the mean response frequency is around 97 averaged over india during both seasons in case of monsoon season response time also shows no substantial difference approximately 8 days or less for different climate regions however some regions of the brahmaputra godavari and krishna river basins exhibit longer response time more than 20 days fig 6c which is due to the presence of forests in these basins in case of non monsoon season a longer response time is observed especially in the indo gangetic plain northeastern india barak mrmb mrbb river basins and some parts of brahmaputra basin and some parts of southern river basins including pennar efrscb and efrpcb basins fig 6d a longer response time in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates lower risk to the ecosystem gpp moreover the mean response time is about 10 days and 19 days averaged over india for monsoon and non monsoon respectively 4 5 response of wue and uwue to flash droughts across india the positive standardized anomalies of underlying wue are higher as compared to wue over the onset as well as recovery stages of flash drought for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons fig 7 this is majorly attributed to the influence of elevated vapour pressure deficit as higher vpd could rise evapotranspiration which in turn increases water loss during the onset stage the negative anomalies of wue and uwue indicate the non resilient vegetation to flash droughts fig 7 a d however this is further decreased during recovery stages fig 7 e h this reduction suggests that the vegetation adaptation to flash drought declines with the increasing duration of drought in terms of wue and uwue the ganga basin was observed to be the most badly affected river basin to flash droughts especially in the monsoon season this might be due to deforestation in the ganga basin which reduces 1 2 mm rainfall per day during the monsoon season paul et al 2016 as we know that the recycled component is very high in the ganga basin therefore a small change in vegetation cover may cause a significant change in precipitation which further result in drought conditions higher positive anomalies of wue and uwue were observed in non monsoon season as compared to monsoon season which suggests that gpp responds quicker to flash drought events in monsoon season as compared to non monsoon season 5 discussion despite growing concerns and challenges to flash droughts their occurrence and impact on the terrestrial ecosystem are least addressed at the pan india scale it was observed that the quick transition of soil moisture is caused by large rainfall deficits and high vapour pressure deficit vpd the sudden onset of flash drought gives limited time for planning and preparation and poses a great challenge for early warning gerken et al 2018 otkin et al 2015 as we know that plants rely mainly on soil moisture to extract water which further regulates the transpiration losses stomatal control and stem water dynamics daly et al 2004 the decline in soil moisture would reduce stomatal conductance in order to prevent extra water loss moreover the deficit in atmospheric humidity further decreases stomatal conductance meanwhile the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant s leaf is also decreased during droughts the combined soil moisture and atmospheric conditions have synergistic impacts on transpiration and photosynthesis processes and hence changing the coupling among water and carbon fluxes in addition to soil moisture droughts the response of ecosystem respiration is also sensitive to higher temperatures johnston et al 2021 the ecosystem response of gpp occurs over 95 of identified flash droughts which indicates that gpp is highly sensitive to flash droughts across the country for ganga and southern river basins of india gpp response occurs during 97 of drought events which was significantly higher than 75 for northeastern river basins of the country this was mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country jha et al 2019 suggest that river basins of southern india were observed to be susceptible and non resilient to droughts the non resilient vegetation characteristics of these basins basically show their incompetence to attain the required soil moisture conditions for vegetation redevelopment once the dry period ends however northeastern river basins and indo gangetic plain shows less ecological response to flash droughts as they were considered as one of the most ecological rich regions of the country sankarganesh et al 2017 where vegetation can tolerate extreme deviations in soil moisture conditions a lower response frequency in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates a lower risk to the ecosystem gpp the mean response time is about 10 days and 19 days averaged across india for monsoon and non monsoon respectively in case of monsoon season the ecological response of gpp occurs only within 8 days for more than 50 of flash drought events in ganga and indus river basin which was too prior to those for northeastern river basins including brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb basins of india the quicker response time indicates that the vegetation cover of these river basins cannot tolerate extreme changes in soil moisture for a longer duration in terms of vegetation drought indus and ganga river basins were observed to be non resilient river basins jha et al 2019 the response of gpp increases rapidly during 17 to 32 days of drought event for northeastern river basins of india which suggests that vegetation adaptation would decrease with increasing drought duration the seasonal dependency was also observed in the time response we found that vegetation cover of the ganga basin experienced quicker time response to flash droughts in monsoon season however it increases in case of non monsoon season during this non monsoon season a longer response time was observed especially in the indo gangetic plain northeastern river basins brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb basins and some parts of southern river basins pennar cauveri efrpcb efrscb of the country the longer response time in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates lower risk to the ecosystem gpp therefore it is important to examine flash drought characteristics for example drought duration and severity as they play a crucial role in influencing the ecosystem zhao et al 2020 wu et al 2016 for example the longer and severe flash droughts could cause high carbon loss in terrestrial ecology it is interesting to note that vegetation takes more time to get back to its normal situation even after flash drought recovers higher wue and uwue during drought events indicate the ecosystem s resilience to flash drought our results showed that the brahmaputra and godavari river basins have the maximum wue and uwue in both seasons which can mainly be attributed to the presence of forests in these basins as the forest land cover has higher wue as compared to others sharma and goyal 2018a northeastern river basins have the largest forest cover among all river basins over india in contrast the mahi and sabarmati basins have the least wue among all river basins which is primarily due to the absence of forest areas sharma and goyal 2018b it is interesting to note that the mahi basin receives the lowest annual mean rainfall whereas the brahmaputra basin receives the highest annual mean rainfall fig 2a which indicates the dependence of water use efficiency over precipitation moreover the ganga basin also experienced the least water use efficiency this suggests that the impact of decreased soil moisture is much more dangerous than decreased precipitation as ganga river basin receives nearly 1000 mm of annual precipitation khan et al 2016 due to lowered soil moisture about 2 3rd area of the ganga basin comes under least water use efficiency however the wue and uwue are further decreased in the recovery stage with the increasing drought duration this reduction suggests that the vegetation adaptation to flash drought declines with the increasing drought duration kapoor et al 2020 the standardized anomalies of underlying wue are higher as compared to wue over the onset as well as recovery stages of flash drought this is majorly attributed to the influence of elevated vapour pressure deficit as higher vpd could rise evapotranspiration which in turn increases water loss massmann et al 2019 regarding the recovery stage no substantial difference in wue and underlying wue was observed across the study areas especially in the ganga and mahanadi river basins of india signifying a more vulnerable grassland ecosystem in ganga and mahanadi river basin than forests in northeastern india 6 conclusion the present analysis is carried out to demonstrates the quick response of terrestrial ecosystems to flash drought events using gross primary productivity gpp acquired from modis our results showed that gpp was highly sensitive to the flash drought occurrence especially over ganga river basin and southern india containing semiarid climate rather than northeastern india i e humid part of the country the results of the present analysis are fascinating as it highlights that ecosystems in majority of the river basins are non resilient to flash droughts as observed through the non resilient nature of most of the basins to vegetation drought over india jha et al 2019 the incompetence of ecosystems to tolerate the flash drought events may cause severe challenges in terms of food security food production and carbon sequestration as we know that india is a developing country where agricultural sector provides livelihood to a large section of the population therefore high risk of flash drought is alarming situation for the nation moreover our results provide information about the hotspots for drought management and ecosystem policymaking however the present study used satellite based soil moisture datasets which may be insufficient in incorporating real time conditions therefore it is suggested to perform hydrological modeling to simulate soil moisture datasets in order to obtain better results in future studies

3787,rapid onset droughts termed as flash droughts cause short term but serious threats to terrestrial ecosystems and influence carbon dynamics due to insufficient warning to date how the regional terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to flash droughts in india remains unknown since india is highly dependent on its cropland and vegetation identifying the influence of flash droughts on terrestrial ecosystem is important here we use modis remote sensing satellite sensor based gross primary productivity gpp and remote sensing based soil moisture data to compute the response of ecosystems to flash droughts in india from the investigation it was observed that gpp responds to more than 95 of the flash droughts across india with the highest response frequency occurring over ganga basin and southern india while the lowest response across northeastern india the discrepancies in the response frequencies are mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country moreover the mean response time is about 10 to 19 days averaged over india with the lowest and highest response time over indus ganga basins and northeastern indian river basins including the brahmaputra minor rivers draining into myanmar basin mrmb and barak basins respectively severe reduction in water use efficiency wue was observed for the ganga river basin and some parts of southern india which highlighted the non resilient nature of ecosystem towards rapid soil moisture variations the study facilitates the identification of flash drought hotspots in the country including the indus basin southern river basins cauveri efrpcp and efrscb basins some parts of the ganga basin and the ability of an ecosystem to withstand such drastic conditions these findings

pulwarty and sivakumar 2014 it can cause massive environmental economic and social consequences across the world soľáková et al 2014 wilhite et al 2007 generally conventional drought is defined as a slowly growing climate phenomenon das et al 2021a b taking few months or more to attain its spatial extent and maximum intensity poonia et al 2021b 2021c yuan et al 2017 otkin et al 2013 however recent findings have revealed a new kind of rapidly growing drought termed as flash drought flash drought is a recently identified extreme event characterized by its sudden onset and rapid intensification otkin et al 2018 the sudden onset allows limited time for planning and preparation causing destructive impacts on the terrestrial ecosystem and agriculture due to insufficient early warnings liu et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 gerken et al 2018 due to rapid intensification and high evapotranspiration et flash drought causes quick soil moisture depletion which results in vegetation stress otkin et al 2018 flash droughts are strongly related to high evapotranspiration low soil moisture content and intense heat pendergrass et al 2020 wang et al 2016 recently flash droughts have occurred frequently for example northern usa in 2017 gerken et al 2018 southern africa in 2015 yuan et al 2018 southern china in 2013 yuan et al 2015 central usa in 2012 hoerling et al 2014 recently a study by yuan et al 2019 found significant increasing trends flash drought frequency over china in the warming and changing climate moreover mishra et al 2021 carried out flash drought identification over india for the projected climate and found an increasing trend in the frequency of flash drought events the increasing frequency may impose a higher risk on the ecosystem crop production water security human mortality vegetation health and environmental sustainability vazifehkhah et al 2019 such events could hasten atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and reduce carbon uptake green et al 2019 ciais et al 2005 during the year 2013 southern china experienced its most terrible drought and heatwave of the last century yuan et al 2016 the rapid intensification of drought significantly minimized carbon uptake 100 tg c in china despite the ecological impacts and increasing occurrence of flash droughts our understanding of flash drought and its impact on the terrestrial ecosystem remains incomplete therefore it is crucial to understand that how different ecosystems respond under flash drought conditions in order to predict the future atmospheric co2 concentrations and terrestrial carbon sink as well as to provide recommendations for drought mitigation and prevention policies drought can adversely impact the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem which in turn influences food security particularly for a developing country like india jha et al 2019 thomey et al 2011 drought also affects the carbon cycle by changing the physiological behavior comprising vegetation respiration and photosynthesis satellite images provide a local understanding of terrestrial vegetation conditions running et al 2004 and hence are widely used to examine the ecological influences of drought zhao and running 2010 high resolution vegetation datasets obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis are extensively used to control the changes in vegetation characteristics sharma and goyal 2018a wolf et al 2016 these products offer global gross primary productivity gpp running et al 2004 these products have been used in several regional as well as global studies anav et al 2015 zhao and running 2010 the leaf area index and vegetation productivity show distinct responses to drought from vegetation structural and physiological viewpoints flack prain et al 2019 huang et al 2016 gross primary productivity gpp and net primary productivity npp are effective indicators for carbon fluxes and ecosystem functioning from physiological and ecological processes cao and woodward 1998 the significant relationship between climate variables and gpp has been used to recognize the impact of climate on ecosystem otkin et al 2016 examine that how vegetation conditions and soil moisture evolve during the extreme flash drought event of 2012 across u s and witnessed a significant response of vegetation conditions to the drought in the summer

evapotranspiration cheng et al 2017 xiao et al 2013 which controls vegetation productivity in dry environment mu et al 2011 wue is also affected by drought boese et al 2019 the hydrometeorological parameters also play a crucial part spatio temporal variation in wue via influencing the carbon assimilation transpiration and evaporation sharma and goyal 2018a the response of water use efficiency differs among different ecosystems guo et al 2019 gang et al 2016 and droughts with different severity and duration ma et al 2019 gang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 assessed the response of wue to the drought conditions in china they found that lower water use efficiency during droughts was observed in northwestern china whereas wue was increased over south china and northeast china further zhang et al 2020 suggest to assess the response of terrestrial ecosystem to flash droughts moreover it is also important to incorporate the response time and response frequency of flash drought due to their variability over different regions therefore it is the need of the hour to understand that how ecosystem indicators gpp wue underlying water use efficiency uwue respond to flash drought regarding the investigation of wue during flash droughts few global studies have been carried out across the world zhang and yuan 2020 guo et al 2019 xie et al 2016 however how the regional terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to flash droughts in india remains unknown as we know that india is a developing country where agricultural sector provides livelihood to a large section of the population gadgil and gadgil 2006 moreover india is considered amongst the most vulnerable and drought prone countries around the world mishra and singh 2010 therefore it is important to examine the flash drought and its impact on the ecosystem over india moreover understanding the seasonal variability of flash drought occurrence is also crucial especially in the rainfed based agricultural regions of india asoka et al 2017 in this work we present a novel approach integrating remote sensing observations gpp wue uwue and climate data to quantify the ecosystem response to flash droughts in a finer and systematic view over india this study to the author s knowledge will be the first attempt to assess the ecosystem response to the flash drought for the whole country using multiple ecosystem metrics the objectives of this study can be summarized as follows i to perform triple collocation tc technique to assess the accuracy of soil moisture datasets ii investigate the seasonal distribution of flash droughts and the associated hydrometeorological characteristics during different stages of flash droughts iii investigate the seasonal response of ecosystem indicators gpp wue uwue to flash droughts over india the present analysis is performed using moderate resolution 0 250 0 250 precipitation temperature soil moisture datasets over 24 river basins of india moreover satellite dataset i e terrestrial gpp product mod17a2 from the modis is used for spatiotemporal assessment of wuee and uwuee from 2000 to 2014 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area india is the 7th largest country across the world covering an area of approximately 3 28 million sq km according to india wris 2014 classification india is divided into 24 major river basins based on different climatic variability the present analysis is conducted over 24 major river basins of the country to quantify the occurrence of flash droughts fig s1 fig s1 illustrates the location and associated details of river basins in india precipitation and temperature conditions substantially varies on spatio temporal scale therefore all 24 major river basins are important for the flash drought investigation for example the western part of the country receives very less precipitation 500 mm year whereas the western ghats and the northeastern part of india receive high precipitation greater than2000 mm year 2 2 meteorological data for the present study daily gridded precipitation dataset was obtained from imd during 1981 2014 at a grid resolution of 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude the imd precipitation dataset is available from 1901 to 2015 and the readers are suggested to refer pai et al 2014 for more details imd datasets are realistic in nature and utilized in several studies kumar et al 2021 poonia et al 2021a das et al 2020 the mean annual precipitation mm year was determined from daily precipitation values at the same resolution 0 250 0 250 temperature data from 1981 to 2014 was also acquired from imd at a grid resolution of 1 latitude 1 longitude the relative humidity data was downloaded from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar re analysis

at a spatial resolution of 500 m the global annual gpp dataset is derived from modis mod17a3 product from 2000 to 2014 these datasets were obtained from the nasa eos program these products have been utilized in several research studies zhang and yuan 2020 huang et al 2017 reichstein et al 2007 the gpp dataset is finally aggregated to 0 250 0 250 resolution table s1 presents the types and sources of data used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 triple collocation availability of in situ based soil moisture data is scarce and application of satellite or model based products requires large scale validation considering the high uncertainty associated with soil moisture products and unavailability of in situ information various available products were evaluated against unknown truth based on triple collocation on all the possible triplets the triplets were derived by arbitrarily selecting three products from a collection of 5 soil moisture datasets imdaa sm gldas 2noah sm merra 2 sm era interim sm and esa cci sm all the available products were firstly pre processed by resampling to 0 25 grids and converting them into 8 day products this was done to remove the influence of missing days and then various triplets were derived to obtain correlation and rmse values triple collocation was first developed to obtain error variance of wind dataset stoffelen 1998 which was later applied to soil moisture chen et al 2016 gruber et al 2016 and precipitation dubey et al 2021 the equations used to derive the correlation and rmse values from triple collocation can be obtained from mccoll et al 2014 3 2 flash drought identification initially daily gridded datasets soil moisture precipitation temperature were converted to 8 days called octads daily precipitation was added for the eight days while daily temperature and soil moisture were averaged for the eight days hence a total of 46 octads were achieved for each year where 16 octads represent the monsoon season i e 19th to 34th octads in a year while the remaining octads represent the non monsoon season from 1st to 18th and 35th to 46th octads in the present analysis soil moisture octads were used to identify flash droughts and their characteristics frequency and duration flash drought occurs due to a quick reduction in soil moisture caused by either increased temperature or rainfall scarcity or both ford and labosier 2017 flash drought was defined when the 8 day mean soil moisture percentile reduces to 20th or less percentile from above 40th percentile with a mean rate of decline no 5 percentile per 8 day period for example june 21 july 15 in fig 1 which is termed as the onset stage the reduction from 40th percentile to 20th percentile indicates the development of flash drought once the soil moisture starts to either decrease slowly or increase then the recovery stage of flash drought was considered once the soil moisture percentile rises to 20 or more percentile again then the drought ends e g july 31 in fig 1 moreover the minimum duration of 24 days was considered for flash droughts in order to avoid short dry spells that have a small impact on the ecosystem the 20th percentile was considered as the drought threshold to avoid persistent long term traditional droughts yuan et al 2019 hence flash droughts that transformed into traditional droughts were eliminated from the investigation readers are suggested to refer fig 1 for more details 3 3 ecosystem response to flash drought it is important to note that droughts have great impact on ecosystem productivity by changing ecosystem respiration and plant photosynthesis stocker et al 2018 gpp is the total photosynthetic co2 fixation at the ecosystem level and impacts all of the carbon cycle variables beer et al 2010 photosynthetic co2 assimilation is affected by leaf area index rubisco activity and stomatal conductance grossiord et al 2020 the negative anomalies of ecological metric i e gpp indicates the commencement of ecological response the standardized anomalies are computed as 1 gpp sa gpp μ gpp σ gpp where gpp sa are standardized anomalies of gpp σ gpp and μ gpp are standard deviation and mean of gpp time series for example all jan 1 8 during 2000 2014 would have a μ gpp and σ gpp and jan 9 16 would have another μ gpp and σ gpp and so on in this study response time index and response frequency are used to examine the interaction between ecological response and flash drought niu et al 2018 for each grid response frequency was obtained by dividing the flash drought events with negative gpp sa by the total flash droughts a lower response frequency indicates lower risk to the ecosystem and vice versa the response time index is described as the count of the positive standardized anomaly gpp sa till the occurrence of first negative value during flash droughts wue is computed as the ratio of gpp to evapotranspiration song et al 2017 in the present analysis daily potential evapotranspiration mm day is computed using fao penman monteith equation eq 2 and described as 2 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa oc g is ground heat flux mj m2 day rn is the net radiation at the surface mj m2 day γ is psychrometric constant kpa oc u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m sec vpd is vapour pressure deficit which is computed as the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressures the carbon cycle and water are linked via stomata and the vegetation will adopt some mitigation measures to deal with drought conditions for example increasing its water use efficiency xu et al 2019 in addition to drought wue is also sensitive to the vapour pressure deficit vpd therefore underlying water use efficiency uwue proposed by zhou et al 2014 would be a better alternative as it incorporates the effects of vpd underlying water use efficiencies are computed as ratio of the gpp vpd to the et to reflect the non linear interaction between et vpd and gpp the variations of underlying water use efficiency are supposed to be strongly associated with drought conditions the uwue is more appropriate than wue for describing the biochemical functions of plants zhou et al 2015 the average annual wue g c m 2 mm 1 yr 1 and uwue g c pa0 5 m 2 mm 1 yr 1 were computed from daily wue and uwue values the standardized anomalies of wue as well as uwue are computed using eq 1 4 results 4 1 triple collocation fig s2 a b represents the correlation coefficient values and fig s3 a b represent the rmse values obtained for various products by the application of triple collocation each row in these figure represent a triplet which was used to assess the performance of these products against the unknown truth gruber et al 2016 mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 these figures suggest that gldas 2 noah sm and era interim sm outperformed the other products whereas the performance of these two products were similar zonal statistics of different river basins suggested that gldas 2 noah sm was slightly better than era interim sm and therefore the data obtained from the gldas 2 noah sm was further used for the analysis of flash drought 4 2 meteorological and ecological conditions over india fig 2 presents the annual mean climatological and ecological characteristics over india based on 2000 2014 datasets the annual mean precipitation showed significant spatial variations over india ranges from 100 mm yr to 4000 mm yr fig 2a the western part of the country receives the lowest precipitation 500 mm year whereas the western ghats and the northeastern parts of india receive the highest precipitation greater than2000 mm year the mean annual soil moisture also showed considerable variation across the country fig 2b with very dry soil characteristics over western india in addition to the accumulated precipitation soil moisture is also related to the changes in evapotranspiration similarly the mean annual modis gpp also shows significant spatial variation over india fig 2c with maximum gpp spread across the western ghats and northeastern regions greater than1400 g c m2 whereas the minimum gpp distributed across the arid regions of western india 400 g c m2 one fourth of the forest area of the country lies in northeastern india whereas western india consists of grasslands with comparatively low vegetation productivity like precipitation and gpp mean annual wue and uwue also varies significantly over india fig 2 d e because of different soil climate and vegetation types wue is higher for northeastern parts of the country followed by eastern northern and southern regions respectively whereas lower wue is observed over western parts of the country due to low vegetation productivity the spatial variation in wue is strongly associated with the variations in the mean annual precipitation and gpp 4 3 flash drought and associated hydrometeorological characteristics across india the computation of flash drought duration and frequency are the same as those of traditional droughts mo 2011 however computed at a higher temporal scale the mean duration was computed by dividing the total flash drought duration by the total number of flash droughts and the frequency was defined as the total number of flash drought events per decade initially we investigate the seasonal distribution of flash droughts based on the frequency and mean duration that occurred during the 1981 2014 period in india fig 3 in case of monsoon season the mean frequency averaged over india is 2 6 events for 34 years 1981 2014 including some hotspots over indus basin fig 3a approximately 82 area of indus river basin km2 is likely to suffer from flash droughts during monsoon season table s2 moreover luni river basin with 70 of its area km2 is vulnerable to flash drought which is mainly attributed to the minimum annual rainfall over luni river basin subash and sikka 2014 moreover the mean duration of flash drought events is 37 days across all of india with the longest mean durations detected over western and northern parts of the country fig 3c particularly the luni river basin experience frequent flash drought events with longer durations as the luni river basin receives the minimum annual mean precipitation subash and sikka 2014 regions in the country like northeastern river basins showed low likelihood of drought events in monsoon season this suggests that vegetation cover of such river basins can tolerate extreme changes in soil moisture conditions in monsoon however in the non monsoon season the majority of river basins of the country experience frequent and longer flash droughts during 1981 2014 fig 3b d long dry spells with negative precipitation anomalies in the non monsoon rapidly reduce soil moisture which triggers flash droughts the mean frequency averaged over india is 5 3 events for 34 years whereas the mean duration is 54 days across all of india during the non monsoon season however in case of non monsoon season river basins such as ganga brahmani baitarani bb pennar cauveri efrkpb efrpcb efrscb mrbb mrmb basin were also unsafe from the flash droughts and more than 60 of their areas were identified as drought affected areas area wise the ganga basin was observed to be the most badly affected river basin nearly 73 i e 614 551 km2 to flash droughts table s2 interestingly arid or semi arid parts of western india particularly luni river basin which were mostly suffer from drought risks experienced the lowest frequency and duration of flash droughts during non monsoon season this suggests that these regions are more susceptible to seasonal or long term droughts rather than flash droughts in the non monsoon further we determined the seasonal distribution of mean duration of onset and recovery stages of flash drought events that occurred during 1981 2014 across india fig 4 during the monsoon season onset duration shows no substantial difference for different climate regions however in some regions the duration varied significantly at different grids i e from zero to above 35 fig 4a however the recovery duration is slightly longer in some parts of the country fig 4c interestingly it was observed that at least two third area of the ganga basin is witnessing zero onset duration however the recovery duration is longer more than 30 days due to lowered soil moisture level the mean duration of the onset as well as recovery stages are 20 days and 28 days respectively during the non monsoon season northeastern river basins brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb river basins southern river basins pennar cauveri efrpcb efrscb river basins and some parts of the ganga basin were witnessing longer onset as well as recovery duration during 1981 2014 fig 4b d this is primarily due to the precipitation deficit over a longer period the mean duration of the onset as well as recovery stages are 25 days and 29 days respectively fig 5 describes the soil moisture percentiles and associated meteorological conditions during different stages of flash drought in the non monsoon season only the pixels with at least three drought events detected are shown during the 1981 2014 period before the onset of drought the soil moisture percentile is close to 45 percentiles across all of the selected grid points fig 5a however during the onset of flash drought the soil moisture percentile falls from above 40 percentiles to 32 percentiles fig 5b as soon as the flash drought enters into the recovery stage there is a quick transition from high soil moisture condition to much drier condition approximately 15 percentile fig 5c further the soil moisture recovers quickly to 41 percentiles after the termination of flash drought fig 5d regarding the onset stage the standardized negative anomaly of precipitation and positive anomalies of temperature and vpd suggest that flash drought events are characterized by elevated evaporative demand and precipitation deficit fig 5 e p the quick drying of soil moisture is usually related to anomalously high temperature large rainfall deficits and high vpd wang et al 2016 which continue till the recovery stage of drought the decrease in vpd and increased rainfall relieves the soil moisture once the drought terminates readers are suggested to refer fig s4 for soil moisture percentiles and associated meteorological conditions during different stages of flash drought in the monsoon season 4 4 response of gpp to flash droughts across india fig 6 shows the response frequency and response time of gross primary productivity gpp to flash drought events during monsoon and non monsoon seasons across india in case of response frequency no substantial discrepancy was observed across different climate regions of the country during monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons fig 6a b the mean response frequency is around 97 averaged over india during both seasons in case of monsoon season response time also shows no substantial difference approximately 8 days or less for different climate regions however some regions of the brahmaputra godavari and krishna river basins exhibit longer response time more than 20 days fig 6c which is due to the presence of forests in these basins in case of non monsoon season a longer response time is observed especially in the indo gangetic plain northeastern india barak mrmb mrbb river basins and some parts of brahmaputra basin and some parts of southern river basins including pennar efrscb and efrpcb basins fig 6d a longer response time in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates lower risk to the ecosystem gpp moreover the mean response time is about 10 days and 19 days averaged over india for monsoon and non monsoon respectively 4 5 response of wue and uwue to flash droughts across india the positive standardized anomalies of underlying wue are higher as compared to wue over the onset as well as recovery stages of flash drought for both monsoon and non monsoon seasons fig 7 this is majorly attributed to the influence of elevated vapour pressure deficit as higher vpd could rise evapotranspiration which in turn increases water loss during the onset stage the negative anomalies of wue and uwue indicate the non resilient vegetation to flash droughts fig 7 a d however this is further decreased during recovery stages fig 7 e h this reduction suggests that the vegetation adaptation to flash drought declines with the increasing duration of drought in terms of wue and uwue the ganga basin was observed to be the most badly affected river basin to flash droughts especially in the monsoon season this might be due to deforestation in the ganga basin which reduces 1 2 mm rainfall per day during the monsoon season paul et al 2016 as we know that the recycled component is very high in the ganga basin therefore a small change in vegetation cover may cause a significant change in precipitation which further result in drought conditions higher positive anomalies of wue and uwue were observed in non monsoon season as compared to monsoon season which suggests that gpp responds quicker to flash drought events in monsoon season as compared to non monsoon season 5 discussion despite growing concerns and challenges to flash droughts their occurrence and impact on the terrestrial ecosystem are least addressed at the pan india scale it was observed that the quick transition of soil moisture is caused by large rainfall deficits and high vapour pressure deficit vpd the sudden onset of flash drought gives limited time for planning and preparation and poses a great challenge for early warning gerken et al 2018 otkin et al 2015 as we know that plants rely mainly on soil moisture to extract water which further regulates the transpiration losses stomatal control and stem water dynamics daly et al 2004 the decline in soil moisture would reduce stomatal conductance in order to prevent extra water loss moreover the deficit in atmospheric humidity further decreases stomatal conductance meanwhile the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant s leaf is also decreased during droughts the combined soil moisture and atmospheric conditions have synergistic impacts on transpiration and photosynthesis processes and hence changing the coupling among water and carbon fluxes in addition to soil moisture droughts the response of ecosystem respiration is also sensitive to higher temperatures johnston et al 2021 the ecosystem response of gpp occurs over 95 of identified flash droughts which indicates that gpp is highly sensitive to flash droughts across the country for ganga and southern river basins of india gpp response occurs during 97 of drought events which was significantly higher than 75 for northeastern river basins of the country this was mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country jha et al 2019 suggest that river basins of southern india were observed to be susceptible and non resilient to droughts the non resilient vegetation characteristics of these basins basically show their incompetence to attain the required soil moisture conditions for vegetation redevelopment once the dry period ends however northeastern river basins and indo gangetic plain shows less ecological response to flash droughts as they were considered as one of the most ecological rich regions of the country sankarganesh et al 2017 where vegetation can tolerate extreme deviations in soil moisture conditions a lower response frequency in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates a lower risk to the ecosystem gpp the mean response time is about 10 days and 19 days averaged across india for monsoon and non monsoon respectively in case of monsoon season the ecological response of gpp occurs only within 8 days for more than 50 of flash drought events in ganga and indus river basin which was too prior to those for northeastern river basins including brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb basins of india the quicker response time indicates that the vegetation cover of these river basins cannot tolerate extreme changes in soil moisture for a longer duration in terms of vegetation drought indus and ganga river basins were observed to be non resilient river basins jha et al 2019 the response of gpp increases rapidly during 17 to 32 days of drought event for northeastern river basins of india which suggests that vegetation adaptation would decrease with increasing drought duration the seasonal dependency was also observed in the time response we found that vegetation cover of the ganga basin experienced quicker time response to flash droughts in monsoon season however it increases in case of non monsoon season during this non monsoon season a longer response time was observed especially in the indo gangetic plain northeastern river basins brahmaputra barak mrmb and mrbb basins and some parts of southern river basins pennar cauveri efrpcb efrscb of the country the longer response time in northeastern india and indo gangetic plain indicates lower risk to the ecosystem gpp therefore it is important to examine flash drought characteristics for example drought duration and severity as they play a crucial role in influencing the ecosystem zhao et al 2020 wu et al 2016 for example the longer and severe flash droughts could cause high carbon loss in terrestrial ecology it is interesting to note that vegetation takes more time to get back to its normal situation even after flash drought recovers higher wue and uwue during drought events indicate the ecosystem s resilience to flash drought our results showed that the brahmaputra and godavari river basins have the maximum wue and uwue in both seasons which can mainly be attributed to the presence of forests in these basins as the forest land cover has higher wue as compared to others sharma and goyal 2018a northeastern river basins have the largest forest cover among all river basins over india in contrast the mahi and sabarmati basins have the least wue among all river basins which is primarily due to the absence of forest areas sharma and goyal 2018b it is interesting to note that the mahi basin receives the lowest annual mean rainfall whereas the brahmaputra basin receives the highest annual mean rainfall fig 2a which indicates the dependence of water use efficiency over precipitation moreover the ganga basin also experienced the least water use efficiency this suggests that the impact of decreased soil moisture is much more dangerous than decreased precipitation as ganga river basin receives nearly 1000 mm of annual precipitation khan et al 2016 due to lowered soil moisture about 2 3rd area of the ganga basin comes under least water use efficiency however the wue and uwue are further decreased in the recovery stage with the increasing drought duration this reduction suggests that the vegetation adaptation to flash drought declines with the increasing drought duration kapoor et al 2020 the standardized anomalies of underlying wue are higher as compared to wue over the onset as well as recovery stages of flash drought this is majorly attributed to the influence of elevated vapour pressure deficit as higher vpd could rise evapotranspiration which in turn increases water loss massmann et al 2019 regarding the recovery stage no substantial difference in wue and underlying wue was observed across the study areas especially in the ganga and mahanadi river basins of india signifying a more vulnerable grassland ecosystem in ganga and mahanadi river basin than forests in northeastern india 6 conclusion the present analysis is carried out to demonstrates the quick response of terrestrial ecosystems to flash drought events using gross primary productivity gpp acquired from modis our results showed that gpp was highly sensitive to the flash drought occurrence especially over ganga river basin and southern india containing semiarid climate rather than northeastern india i e humid part of the country the results of the present analysis are fascinating as it highlights that ecosystems in majority of the river basins are non resilient to flash droughts as observed through the non resilient nature of most of the basins to vegetation drought over india jha et al 2019 the incompetence of ecosystems to tolerate the flash drought events may cause severe challenges in terms of food security food production and carbon sequestration as we know that india is a developing country where agricultural sector provides livelihood to a large section of the population therefore high risk of flash drought is alarming situation for the nation moreover our results provide information about the hotspots for drought management and ecosystem policymaking however the present study used satellite based soil moisture datasets which may be insufficient in incorporating real time conditions therefore it is suggested to perform hydrological modeling to simulate soil moisture datasets in order to obtain better results in future studies

3788,reduced snow storage has been associated with lower river low flows in mountainous catchments exacerbating summer hydrological droughts however the impacts of changing snow storage on summer low flows in low elevation snow affected catchments has not yet been investigated to address this knowledge gap the dominant hydroclimate predictors of summer low flows were first identified through correlation analysis in 12 tributary catchments of the st lawrence river in the canadian province of quebec the correlation results show that summer low flow is most sensitive to summer rainfall while maximum snow water equivalent swe is the dominant winter preconditioning factor of low flows particularly at the end of summer the multivariate sensitivity of summer low flow to hydroclimate predictors was then quantified by multilevel regression analysis considering also the effect of catchment biophysical attributes accumulated rainfall since snow cover disappearance was found to be the prime control on summer low flow as expected for the humid climate of quebec maximum swe had a secondary but significant positive influence on low flow sometimes on the same order as the negative effect of evapotranspiration losses as a whole our results show that in these low elevation catchments thicker winter snowpacks that last longer and melt slower in the spring are conducive to higher low flows in the following summer more rugged and forested catchments with coarser soils were found to have higher summer low flows than flatter agricultural catchments with compacted clayed soils this emphasizes the role of soils and geology on infiltration aquifer recharge and related river baseflow in summer further climate warming and snowpack depletion could reduce future summer low flow exacerbating hydrological droughts and impacting ecosystems integrity and ecological services keywords snow water equivalent snow melt river low flow interannual variability climate change 1 introduction in northern countries such as canada the hydrological regime is characterized by long winters dominated by solid precipitation and snow accumulation sustained snowmelt leads to a spring freshet typically the most significant hydrological event of the year and which often results in flooding especially when combined with rainfall episodes buttle et al 2016 pomeroy et al 2016 while a large of part of snowmelt water runs off to streams another part infiltrates into soils and helps to recharge aquifers which maintain river baseflow during summer larocque and broda 2016 maurer et al 2007 moore et al 2007 stewart et al 2004 these seasonal summer base flows dominate the summer low flows that are essential for maintaining ecosystems water diversion projects and for ensuring an adequate supply for human needs especially in cold regions burn et al 2008 smakhtin 2001 thus it is important to understand the impact of antecedent hydroclimatic conditions and processes that affect the hydrological regime of rivers in summer the different hydroclimatic projections in cold regions of the world allow predicting the emerging trends in the impacts of climate change on extreme hydrological events such as floods and low flows diffenbaugh et al 2013 studies in various parts of the world have shown that snow dominated basins are amongst the most sensitive to global warming aygün et al 2020a barnett et al 2005 as the shift from snowfall to rain is one of the most important impacts of projected climate change on the hydrological cycle zhang et al 2014 snowpack depletion is expected to occur in several regions and cause a gradual transition from a nivo pluvial hydrological regime to a pluvio nival regime in many cold regions berghuijs et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 whereas increasing precipitation under warming scenarios could lead to enhanced snow accumulation in regions with winter temperatures well below the freezing level regions with a milder winter climate will experience significant alterations of their hydrological regimes within the next decades aygün et al 2020a aygün et al 2020b given the expected reductions in snowpack volumes under climate change scenarios a precise knowledge of the impact of winter snow storage on summer low flows is important for water resource managers in regions where cold weather temperatures are near the freezing point in general a low flow is caused by the gradual drawdown of aquifers whose slow discharge feeds the streams during summer precipitation deficits in summer or higher than normal evapotranspiration losses particularly in summer smakhtin 2001 in new england usa hodgkins et al 2005 showed that about half of the interannual variability in summer low flow is explained by negative anomalies in summer july august precipitation in china tian et al 2011 showed that the increase in low flow between 1956 and 2004 was related to an increase in annual precipitation averages in the poyang lake basin in quebec canada assani et al 2011 showed that an increase in summer and spring precipitation resulted in an increase in summer low flow over the 1950 2000 period in the southeastern st lawrence basin increasing evapotranspiration losses under warmer air temperatures can also lead to reduced summer low flows but overall the impact of air temperatures variability on summer low flow rates appears to be lower than that of summer precipitation hodgkins et al 2005 yang et al 2002 several studies have shown that snow cover duration and snowpack volume in cold regions watersheds is changing in response to climate change directly influencing the magnitude timing and frequency of spring floods e g aygün et al 2020a curry and zwiers 2018 zhang et al 2014 these studies have analysed the relationship between the characteristics of spring high flows in cold regions and their relationship with snow cover and climate indices zhang et al 2014 showed in their study of alpine watersheds in asia 1960 2007 that winter and summer accumulated temperature and the amount of snowfall were significantly correlated with the spring snowmelt peak discharge whereas other climatic factors had no direct effect on the spring freshet also extensive work in the western united states berghuijs et al 2014 stewart et al 2004 has clearly shown that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with a higher mean annual discharge and that warmer air temperatures in spring result in a higher fraction of the annual discharge occurring earlier in the hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september in the northern hemisphere many studies throughout the world have reported that spring floods in snow affected basins will be earlier and of lesser magnitude in a warmer climate aygün et al 2020b bavay et al 2009 blöschl et al 2017 boyer et al 2010 buttle et al 2016 guay et al 2015 veijalainen et al 2010 however while the impacts of snowpack volume on spring discharge have been widely documented in cold regions the relationship between summer hydrology and antecedent winter snow storage has been comparatively little studied glacier melting during summer is known to modulate the summer low flow regime in glacierized catchments e g schaefli et al 2005 comeau et al 2009 there is however much fewer evidence that the storage and melting of seasonal snow contributes to summer low flow variability in non glacierized catchments only a few studies to date have investigated the link between snowpack characteristics and the interannual variability of low flows finding in general that winter snow accumulation can affect low flows in the following summer in the swiss alps snow water equivalent swe was found to be the dominant winter predictor of 7 day low flow jenicek et al 2016 similar findings have been reported from sierra nevada catchments in the western united states where godsey et al 2014 found that a decrease in maximum swe leads to a decrease in low flow in the following summer similar results were found in the maritime western u s mountains cooper et al 2018 and in the mountains of western north america dierauer et al 2018 where dry winters lead to significantly lower low flows in summer all these studies have been conducted in mountainous catchments in western north america or in the swiss alps where snowmelt water is expected to transfer downstream rapidly due to the steep topography the sensitivity of low flows to snow storage is also expected to be more pronounced in semiarid climates where summer rainfall is limited such as in the western us mountains these regions also have winter temperature near the zero degree isotherm which makes them particularly sensitive to temperature variations safeeq et al 2016 the impact of snow storage on the summer low flow regime of low elevation more humid catchments have on the other hand not been studied the interannual variability of summer low flows has been studied in canada in relation to atmospheric and oceanic circulation indices assani et al 2011 assani et al 2010 bonsal and shabbar 2008 but the hydroclimatic variables responsible for the interannual variability in the magnitude and timing of summer low flows have not yet been identified while the more abundant rainfall in summer is expected to be the prime control on low flow regimes increasing hydrological drought in summer due to rising evapotranspirative demand and longer dryspells under a warming trend berthot et al 2021 guay et al 2015 tam et al 2019 call for a better understanding of the role of snowpacks in sustaining summer low flows in these regions in addition the relative role of climatic factors and catchment attributes topography land cover and use geology and soils on low flow regimes in these regions has not been addressed the present study intends to partially fill this gap by estimating the relative impacts of interannual variations in snow storage summer rainfall and evapotranspiration on the variability of summer low flows in low elevation catchments in southern quebec canada we further investigate the respective influence of hydroclimatic conditions and catchment biophysical attributes on summer low flow magnitude 2 data and methods 2 1 study sites twelve tributary catchments of the st lawrence river in southern quebec were selected for the study fig 1 catchment areas range from 366 to 4 504 km2 with elevations 850 m table 1 the choice of catchments was based on the length of the flow measurement record a hydrological regime as close as possible to natural conditions i e near natural flows with no major human influences such as dams or water diversions and the presence of snow monitoring stations within or close to the basin these snow monitoring stations were used in a former study to calibrate and validate the gr4j cémaneige hydrological model in the 12 catchments nemri and kinnard 2020 the selected basins are spatially distributed between the north and south shores of the st lawrence river within four homogeneous hydrological regions used by the quebec center of water expertise cehq the governmental organization in charge of hydrological monitoring and forecasting in quebec fig 1 catchments in the northwestern st lawrence region matawin batiscan and bras du nord straddle the canadian shield with a more rugged and forested landscape and the mostly agricultural st lawrence lowlands and is characterized by a continental climate the northeastern st lawrence region godbout is on the canadian shield and has a maritime climate catchments in the southwestern st lawrence region nicolet acadie straddle the appalachian region with a forested landscape and the st lawrence lowlands and have a maritime climate catchments in the southeastern st lawrence region york beaurivage bécancour famine etchemin ouelle are in the appalachian region and characterized by a mixture of maritime and continental climate assani et al 2010 mazouz et al 2013 among the studied catchments only acadie and nicolet are dominantly agricultural 72 1 and 60 respectively while the other catchments are dominantly forested i e more than 70 of their area is covered by forest table 1 2 2 hydrometeorological data this study uses continuous meteorological data extracted from daily 10 km resolution climate grids developed by the atmospheric environment information service simat in collaboration with the quebec center of water expertise cehq bergeron 2015 catchment averages of mean daily air temperature and total precipitation were calculated from the grids nemri and kinnard 2020 daily streamflow records at the outlet of the 12 catchments were obtained from the cehq www cehq qc ca more than 30 years of records were chosen for analysis to match the standard record length used for defining climate normals table 1 this period is limited by the gridded climate product extending from 1961 to 2015 potential evapotranspiration epot was calculated according to oudin et al 2005 from daily air temperature and elevation we used mean catchment wide swe for the 12 study catchments previously simulated by nemri and kinnard 2020 with the cémaneige snow model valéry et al 2014 rain snow partition snowpack accumulation and snowmelt were calculated by nemri and kinnard 2020 at five equal area elevation bands and then averaged to the whole catchment nemri and kinnard 2020 then simulated actual evapotranspiration eact and river discharge with the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 with epot snowmelt and rainfall as inputs they used a split sample test to separate the observation record into two equal periods of calibration validation which varied from 8 to 27 years depending on the available record in each catchment table 1 they then calibrated the six parameters of the coupled gr4j cémaneige model on available discharge and swe observations using the multi objective amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 swe observations were taken from bi weekly surveys made by the ministry of environment and fight against climate change melcc in each of the studied catchment and represent the average of 10 manual measurements made with a snow corer at fixed points along a 100 m transect melcc 2008 model results yielded a good performance on independent observations with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients ranging from 0 67 to 0 90 median 0 80 for discharge and 0 20 0 78 median 0 70 for swe using the modeled swe instead of swe observations circumvents the problem of the sparse temporal bi weekly and spatial one or few survey sites per catchment coverage of the observations further model description and details on forcing data calibration and validation are given in nemri and kinnard 2020 2 3 antecedent hydroclimate conditions and statistical analysis of summer low flow the minimum daily flow measured over seven consecutive days between may and september was used as summer low flow variable 7 day running streamflow averages were used to minimize the effect of potential outliers this 7 day low flow indicator q7 is widely used as it is not susceptible to temporary upstream flow changes that can affect one day low flow calculations riggs 1985 hereafter this 7 day low flow q7 is simply referred as low flow minimum daily flows in the studied catchments occurred mostly between july and september but also occasionally in october 8 of the time across all catchments the analysis was limited to september because snowfall sometimes occurred in october in the more northern basins e g york and godbout fig 1 which could confuse the analysis due to the intermittent storage of precipitation as snow during this month seven variables related to winter spring and summer antecedent meteorological and water storage conditions in the basins were selected as potential predictors of the minimum summer low flow q7min table 2 the advantage of this choice of predictors is that only daily data of snow water equivalent swe snow cover fraction in the basin precipitation air temperature and streamflow are required for their calculation winter conditions were represented by the maximum peak accumulated swe in the basin swemax and its date of occurrence swemaxt spring conditions are represented by the snow disappearance date sdd calculated as the first day following the peak swe date with near snow free conditions i e with a snow cover 10 in the basin following jenicek et al 2016 the snow cover fraction was simulated by the cémaneige model nemri and kinnard 2020 these variables are used since is hypothesized that a thicker and later snowpack as well as a longer snow cover duration could favour aquifer recharge and help sustaining higher low flows later in summer in addition the average melt rate meltrate was calculated for the period between the date of maximum swe swemaxt and the snow disapearance date sdd following equation 1 barnhart et al 2016 1 meltrate t s d d t s w e max t δ s w e t d where δ s w e t represents negative changes in swe ablation and d the number of days with negative δ s w e t between the maximum swe date and the snow disappearance date three summer predictors were considered in the st lawrence valley the low flow regime is typically interrupted by the onset of sustained rain events in the fall which varies between years depending on synoptic patterns in particular the southern migration of the polar front in the fall which favours cyclogenesis and frontal precipitation events over southern quebec it is hypothesized that a later onset of autumn rainfall would cause a longer drawdown of aquifers and hence lower flow flows other factors being equal as such the date of minimum summer flow q7mint was used as predictor of its magnitude q7min to represent this phenomenon the accumulated actual evapotranspiration eact and rainfall prain between the date of snow disappearance sdd and the date of minimum flow q7mint were also calculated in each basin taken together these two variables determine the amount of available water in a given year and catchment after snowmelt we first used spearman s rank correlation to explore bivariate relationships between each potential predictor and summer low flow the nonparametric spearman correlation was used because several variables are not normally distributed the analysis was first conducted for all catchments combined global analysis and then separately for each catchment for this purpose the predictor and response variables were previously standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation per catchment to allow pooling catchments on a common unit scale for the global analysis to investigate memory effects of snowpack on low flow correlations were calculated between the maximum swe and the minimum flow within a 10 day running window from june to september in each catchment multilevel or mixed regression was then used to describe the combined effect of antecedent hydrometeorological variables on the interannual variability of summer low flows while also considering the effect of catchment attributes several catchment biophysical descriptors were considered i e land cover and use drainage density mean catchment slope and dominant geology and soil type table 1 multilevel regression is a widely used statistical model used when observations are organized grouped at more than one level and which allows to jointly model the within and between group variability gelman and hill 2006 the model relates the response variable q7min to seasonal hydroclimatic predictors first level fixed effects with basin id as grouping variable random effect and catchment attributes as group level variables second level fixed effects the multilevel model is represented by the following equations gelman and hill 2006 p 266 2 y t n α j t β x t σ t 2 f o r t 1 n 3 α j n γ 0 γ 1 u j σ α 2 f o r j 1 j where x t represents seasonal hydroclimatic predictors first level fixed effects n represents the number of annual observations in each catchment j for a total of j 12 catchments β is the vector of regression slopes for hydroclimatic predictors α j t is the intercept for catchment j γ 0 is the global or mean intercept value γ 1 is the vector of regression slopes for catchment attributes second level fixed effects and σ t 2 and σ α are the standard deviations model errors at the first and second levels respectively n symbolizes the normal distribution z score standardisation was applied on all hydroclimate variables prior to model fitting in order to use a common scale in the analysis a group mean standardisation was used which conserves inter basin differences in mean conditions which are then explicitly modelled by random effects in the multilevel model data were further transformed to a normal distribution using boxcox transformation sakia 1992 when necessary predictor multicollinearity was tested by calculating the variance inflation factor vif discarding predictor variables with a vif larger than 10 o brien 2007 separate multilevel regression models were fitted for each individual summer month from june to september as well as for the whole summer period hence for individual months q7min is the minimum 7 day discharge over the month while for the whole period q7min is the minimum 7 day discharge over the whole summer period june september in all cases rainfall prain and evapotranspiration eact are summed between the snow disappearance date and the minimum low flow date three different models of increasing complexity were considered 1 only considering hydroclimate predictors without basin grouping effect 2 hydroclimate predictors and a basin grouping effect 3 hydroclimate predictors with basin grouping and catchment attributes as catchment level predictors catchment biophysical characteristics tend to be closely interrelated in southern quebec for examples catchments on the canadian shield are more rugged forested and have coarser soils those on the st lawrence lowlands are flatter more agricultural and with finer soils this collinearity was addressed by applying a principal component analysis to the main catchment attributes presented in table 1 followed by a varimax rotation for better interpretability e g wilks 2011 basin area was not included as it is not physically related to the other catchment attributes nor was it significantly correlated with low flow the best model was selected based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1987 the aic is a model selection score which rewards goodness of fit as assessed by the likelihood function and penalizes for model complexity i e the number of model parameters the model with lowest aic score is usually favored competing models can be contrasted by computing the difference δaic between their aic and that of the best model as a rule of thumb models having a δaic 2 have substantial support evidence those with 4 δaic 7 have considerably less support and models having δaic greater than 10 have essentially no support burnham and anderson 2004 the multilevel regression models were further compared with a likelihood ratio test zuur et al 2009 p 120 all data processing and statistical analyses were carried out with the matlab and r softwares 3 results 3 1 correlation between hydroclimate variables the global correlation heat map shows the strength of the association between all the hydroclimatic variables when pooling all catchment together fig 2 all variables related to snow conditions are significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated together the snow disappearance date sdd is positively and significantly correlated with maximum swe swemax rho 0 49 and its date of occurrence swemaxt rho 0 47 in addition the melt rate is strongly correlated with swemax rho 0 63 and its date of occurrence swemaxt rho 0 79 hence thicker snowpacks tend to occur later and also to last longer in the spring this also explains the higher average melting rate occurring when snow persists under warmer spring conditions as found elsewhere musselman et al 2017 correlation between winter conditions and summer variables were generally low and often nonsignificant as expected however significant and inverse correlations are observed between the snow disappearance date sdd and accumulated evapotranspiration eact and rainfall prain which occurs because sdd controls the period over which the sum of rainfall and evapotranspiration is calculated fig 2 allows a first evaluation of the global relationship between summer low flow q7min and antecedent hydroclimate conditions as expected summer preconditioning of low flows is more important than winter and spring preconditioning the amount of rainfall accumulated between the snow disappearance date and the summer low flow date is the best overall predictor of q7min rho 0 27 so that wetter summers globally lead to higher summer low flows a weak but significant positive correlation rho 0 18 p 0 05 is found between maximum swe and summer low flow for the 12 pooled basins so that a thicker snowpack is associated with higher low flows additionally both the snow disappearance date rho 0 09 p 0 05 and melt rate rho 0 11 p 0 05 are weakly but positively correlated to summer low flow thus the snow disappearance date and melting rate do not explain much of the global variability in summer low flow the positive correlation between the melt rate and low flow is contrary to the hypothesized increased recharge under slower melt rates and could reflect the collinearity between swemax and meltrate seen in fig 2a higher evapotranspiration losses eact are associated with reduced low flows but the correlation is weaker rho 0 11 than for rainfall and maximum swe no significant correlations appear between winter snow variables and the timing of summer low flow q7mint in contrast q7mint is strongly and positively correlated with prain rho 0 82 and eact rho 0 83 however these correlations arise because later low flows increase the period over which prain and eact are calculated also no global correlation emerged between q7min and its date of occurrence q7mint separate correlations between summer low flow and the potential hydroclimatic predictors were calculated for humid and dry years years were ranked by total summer rainfall in each catchment and then split into two groups corresponding to the 50 most humid and 50 driest years the correlation between low flow and accumulated rainfall increases during wet years rho 0 66 and decreases during dry years rho 0 16 compared to the pooled sample fig 2b the correlation between low flow and evapotranspiration become positive during wet years and more negative during dry years compared to the pooled sample this suggests and interactive effect between rainfall and evapotranspiration on low flows since evapotranspiration is tightly coupled to rainfall amounts rho 0 76 fig 2a as expected for the energy limited regime of humid climates the positive correlation between low flow and evapotranspiration during wet years reflects the collinearity between rainfall and evapotranspiration during dry years the influence of rainfall on low flows is much reduced and evapotranspiration losses have a greater influence on catchment wetness leading to lower flows interestingly the correlation of low flow with swe and the melt rate are stable between humid and dry years suggesting that the snowpack represents a more stable source of moisture to sustain summer low flows low flow is even more strongly correlated to maximum swe than with rainfall during dry years also while the correlation between low flow and its timing was globally not significant a significant positive correlation arises during wet years and a negative one during dry years the positive correlation during wet years is probably due to the partial collinearity between rainfall and low flow timing as described earlier during dry years however the influence of rainfall on low flow is much reduced and the negative correlation between low flow and its timing may reflect the earlier onset of autumn rainfall events which interrupt the gradual drawdown of aquifers and results in higher summer low flows 3 2 impact of maximum swe on low flow during summer to explore in more details the memory effect of snowpack conditions on summer low flows the maximum swe was correlated with the minimum 7 day low flow every 10 days for the 12 selected catchments separately fig 3 similar to the approach used by jenicek et al 2016 for catchments in switzerland the 10 day period was chosen to be large enough to capture flow recessions while keeping a high temporal resolution for the analysis these 10 days correlation coefficients show the temporal sensitivity of low flow conditions to preceding winter accumulated snowpack the influence of maximum swe on summer low flow tends to increase over time and is greatest between late august and mid september with however heterogeneity between catchments fig 3 two catchments stand out from this general trend the northernmost godbout id1 and york id2 for which swe is rather weakly but negatively correlated with late summer low flow the maximum swe is also negatively correlated with low flow early in summer in five catchments etchemin bécancour ouelle famine nicolet such that a larger swe is associated with lower low flows in early mid june the snow disappearance date typically occurs in april may varying by 1 2 weeks each year in a given catchment and increasing towards higher latitudes in contrast the occurrence date of the summer low flow occurs on average from mid august to mid september with a more subdued increase northward but with large interannual variability 1 month when compared across all 12 catchments the correlation between the preconditioning variables and low flow in september when the correlation with maximum swe is highest fig 3 shows that low flow is positively correlated with maximum swe in 10 of the 12 catchments with correlations varying between 0 21 and 0 41 fig 4 however only five catchments pass the significance threshold p 0 05 the smaller number of observations in individual catchments explains the higher threshold correlation for statistical significance compared to the pooled catchments analysis in fig 2 despite the significance of the correlations their values are generally not strong suggesting that maximum swe plays a secondary role on low flow variability compared to summer conditions which was hypothesized for the more humid climate of southern quebec the correlation between maximum swe and september low flow also displays significant inter basin heterogeneity which does not seem to be related with the hydroclimatic region other winter predictors swemaxt sdd and meltrate are most often positively correlated with low flow but are rarely significant except in acadie batiscan and bras du nord fig 4 highlights a strong and significant correlation between low flow and accumulated rainfall in late summer september in all the studied catchments the correlation coefficients vary between 0 28 in famine and 0 67 in matawin conversely the accumulated evapotranspiration has significant negative effects on late summer low flow only in three basins godbout bras du nord and batiscan while a positive effect is found in three other basins ouelle etchemin and beaurivage while higher evapotranspiration should lead to reduced low flow the collinearity between rainfall and evapotranspiration fig 2 complicates the interpretation of simple bivariate relations to further examine the combined influence of rainfall and evapotranspiration on low flow q7min was correlated with the effective rainfall prain eact i e the available water for runoff the correlation between low flow and effective rainfall either increases or decreases slightly compared to the correlation with rainfall alone suggesting that low flow magnitude is more related to rainfall than evapotranspiration in summer as also highlighted in section 3 1 and fig 2 the global and catchment wise bivariate correlation analyses highlight the first order controls on low flow interannual variability however to better discriminate the influence of the respective hydroclimate predictors their multivariate influence on low flow must be assessed which is explored in the next section 3 3 low flow response to multivariate antecedent hydroclimate conditions and catchment characteristics the previous sections showed that summer low flow can be related to a combination of preconditioning factors with heterogeneity between basins thus a multilevel regression model was developed to investigate the combined effects of hydroclimate predictors taking into account the potential influence of catchment attributes on summer low flow collinearity tests using the variance inflation factor vif showed that the snow disappearance date had a vif larger than 10 o brien 2007 and was thus removed from the predictor set as shown in fig 2 the snow disappearance date is strongly correlated with the maximum swe and the melt rate as a thicker snowpack tends to last longer into the spring and increases the mean melt rate the first two principal component pc axes of catchment attributes explained 73 pc1 46 pc2 27 of their variability and were included as potential catchment level predictors of low flow the two rotated pc axes have low correlation r 0 16 which avoids collinearity issues in the regression model the two principal axes describe biophysical assemblages that are typical of southern quebec pc1 mainly separates catchments based on their dominant geology and soil types fig 5 catchments on the canadian shield grenville geological province with precambrian gneissic rocks have more sandy soils concentrated in incised glacial valleys while catchments extending into the appalachian province composed of tilted and folded paleozoic sedimentary rocks and rolling hill topography have more loamy soils pc2 mainly separates catchments according to their land cover and topography catchments that extend more into the st lawrence lowlands flat proterozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks covered by glaciomarine deposits have more clayed soils a higher agricultural cover a lower forest cover flatter topography and a higher drainage density the varying intercept model model 2 which accounts for random variations in q7min between catchments significantly improves the prediction performance compared to using fixed hydroclimatic effects only model 1 table 3 adding catchment attributes in model 3 further improved the predictive performance relative to model 2 suggesting that part of the inter catchment random variations can be explained by differences in catchment attributes table 3 the difference in aic with model 2 is greater than 10 which suggests that model 3 is a more optimal model which is confirmed by the likelihood ratio test zuur et al 2009 χ2 14 21 p 0 001 model 3 was thus retained as the best model to explain low flow interannual variations adding interactions between predictors fixed effects did not improve the model further results for the multilevel model 3 equations 2 3 are presented in table 4 fixed effects i e first level hydroclimate variables and second level catchment descriptors explain 60 62 of the interannual variability in q7min marginal r2 0 60 to 0 62 while random inter catchment differences effects account for 17 22 of the variance in q7min conditional r2 0 77 to 0 84 the accumulated rainfall following snow cover disappearance prain has a strong and sustained influence on q7min throughout summer standardized regression coefficient α 0 44 to 0 59 evapotranspiration losses eact have a negative influence on q7min decreasing towards the end of summer α 0 18 to 0 39 thus the expected negative effect of evapotranspiration on low flows stands out clearly in the multivariate analysis compared to bivariate correlations figs 2 and 3 since the simultaneous effect of the other predictors is taken into account in the multilevel models the flow timing q7mint has a significant negative influence on summer wide low flow but not on a monthly basis this is consistent with the notion that later flows have lower magnitude due to the gradual drawdown of aquifers feeding baseflow maximum swe swemax has a positive influence on low flow throughout summer α 0 15 to 0 25 p 0 05 table 4 in accordance with the bivariate correlation analysis fig 3 the influence is highest in june and august the relation between maximum swe and low flow for the whole summer is lower and similar to that in september which is because the lowest summer flow occurs on average in late summer the timing of maximum swe swemaxt is also positively related to low flow in june september α 0 14 to 0 19 p 0 05 so years with delayed melting and a later peak swe tend to result in higher low flows in summer the melt rate has a negative influence on low flow in june α 0 14 and august α 0 17 only this is interpreted to reflect the fact that slower melting of the snowpack favours infiltration which in turn would support subsurface drainage contributions to baseflow in early summer and aquifer recharge which would favor a delayed contribution to baseflow in august it is worth noting that while evapotranspiration has a lesser influence than rainfall on low flow the influence of maximum swe on low flow is of similar magnitude than that of evapotranspiration in late summer august september however for the summer wide period snow storage ranks third as low flow preconditioning factor behind rainfall and evapotranspiration inter catchment heterogeneity in the hydroclimate preconditioning of low flows was already noted in the previous section and figs 3 and 4 the multilevel model analysis yields interesting insights on the magnitude and causes of this heterogeneity partial residual plots of the significant winter spring predictors are shown for the month of august in fig 6 and for the summer period in fig 7 the varying intercept coefficients visible on these figures indicate significant differences in mean low flow conditions amongst catchments that are not explained by hydroclimatic factors the catchment attributes index variables pc1 and pc2 explain a large part of this inter catchment variability throughout summer α 0 37 to 0 49 table 4 and fig 8 the negative influence of pc1 on low flow illustrates that catchments which extend onto the canadian shield with sandy loam soils have generally higher flows than catchments extending into the appalachians with loamy soils fig 5 the negative influence of pc2 on low flow on the other hand illustrates that catchments extending onto the st lawrence lowlands with a higher lower agricultural forest cover lower slopes and higher drainage densities tend to have lower low flows 4 discussion our results highlighted the impact of antecedent seasonal hydrological conditions on summer low flow in twelve southern quebec rivers with a natural regime and significant variability in winter and summer precipitation the global and catchment wise bivariate correlation analyses cf section 3 1 and 3 2 showed that accumulated rainfall from snow disappearance to the date of low flow occurrence is the main control on low flow interannual variability followed by accumulated evapotranspiration losses this finding is not surprising given the humid continental climate of quebec larger snow storage in winter was also found to enhance low flows in the following summer with maximum swe emerging as a relatively more important driver of low flow variability during dry years fig 2 among the snow related variables maximum swe showed the clearest positive association with summer low flow but with significant heterogeneity among catchments the positive association between swe and summer low flow is interpreted to reflect the increased groundwater recharge during snowmelt which then sustains river baseflow during dry summer periods as found in other snow dominated areas e g beaulieu et al 2012 this is also in accordance with previous results found in mountainous basins in the swiss alps jenicek et al 2016 in austria laghari et al 2012 and western usa godsey et al 2014 where swe showed the best predictive ability for the 7 day low flow among all winter related predictors the situation in quebec is however quite different from semiarid climates like the sierra nevada where scarce summer precipitation enhances the response of low flow to antecedent snow storage godsey et al 2014 however the enhanced role of snow storage during dry years in the more humid quebec region shows that dry summers in an otherwise humid climate can also benefit from larger snow storage in the preceding winter our results show that across most of the studied catchments the effect of maximum swe on summer low flow is more important towards the end of summer august september this delayed response to snowmelt is interpreted to result from the predominant recharge of aquifers during spring snowmelt followed by the progressive outflow of aquifers to streams in summer as documented in several cold regions including quebec aygün et al 2020b boumaiza et al 2020 jasechko et al 2014 this is different than the situation in alpine and pre alpine catchments where the sensitivity of summer low flow to swe was found to decrease over the course of summer jenicek et al 2016 this suggests the transfer modes of snowpack anomalies are different i e via the slow discharge of aquifers in low elevation catchments and via faster subsurface runoff in alpine basins however for two basins york godbout a thicker snowpack in winter was related to lower low flows volume in summer fig 3 fig 4 however once the effect of rainfall and evapotranspiration was taken into account in the multivariate model the relation became positive albeit weakly figs 6 and 7 this is possibly because these catchments have a maritime climate with year round precipitation abundance which could explain the low dependence of streamflow on aquifer recharge by snowmelt the multilevel regression approach used in this study allowed examining the combined effect of hydroclimate predictors while accounting for inter catchment variability in low flow our results show that both summer climate rainfall and evapotranspiration and winter conditions snow storage and melt dynamics influenced summer low flows interannual variations accumulated summer precipitation is the dominant control on summer low flow variability with evapotranspiration losses and snow storage playing significant but secondary roles similar results regarding a large influence of rainfall regimes on low flows have been documented for historical river summer low flows in new england hodgkins et al 2005 for lower elevation basins in switzerland jenicek et al 2016 and southeast st lawrence watersheds in quebec assani et al 2011 while interannual variations in rainfall is unsurprisingly the first control on summer low flows given the regular summer rainfall in the area antecedent winter conditions still represent an important source of interannual variability sometimes of similar magnitude than evapotranspiration losses e g in august and september differences occur between bivariate correlation results global and by catchment and the multivariate analysis while some predictors maximum swe and accumulated rainfall have consistent relationships with summer low flow partly because these two variables are not interrelated other variables have different effects when the influence of the other predictors is taken into account within the multivariate models accumulated evapotranspiration has a negative relationships with summer low flows once other predictors are taken into account in the regression models this is consistent with the expected driving mechanism of decreasing catchment wetness and lower summer flows under higher evapotranspiration losses the low flow timing also has a negative effect on the summer lowest flow once the effect of other predictors is accounted for this is consistent with the notion that a later onset of the frontal rainfall regime in the fall allows for a longer period of aquifer depletion and correspondingly decreased low flow one limitation of the mixed modelling approach used is the varying length of the available flow records table 1 the entire flow records available during the 1961 2015 period limited by the climate forcings were preferred over a shorter but common period so as to maximise the number of observations and better detect significant hydroclimatic controls on low flow across the sample of catchments hence some catchments may have had a stronger weight in the model however all catchments had at least 33 years of data except bécancour id9 n 16 years which allowed for a robust and near balanced detection of climate flow relationships among catchments another limitation is the potential impact of unaccounted spatial heterogeneity within individual catchments on low flows the first order spatial heterogeneity was accounted for by using simulated swe within five elevation bands and rainfall snowfall and potential evapotranspiration calculated from 10 km gridded climate products nemri and kinnard 2020 however the uneven distribution of precipitation and snowmelt combined with the spatial heterogeneity in soils and geology could influence catchment storage and thus the temporal distribution of runoff this complexity may not be fully captured in our catchment scale analysis yet at the seasonal scale i e relating summer low flows to seasonal hydroclimatic conditions this effect should be small for low elevation catchments where biophysical gradients are typically much smaller than in mountainous settings moreover we did not find any significant correlation between catchment area and low flows q7min r 0 34 p 0 28 since spatial heterogeneity should scale with catchment area we take this as evidence that spatial heterogeneity plays a smaller role than hydroclimatic interannual variability on summer low flows our results showed significant inter catchment variability in low flow which was partly explained by catchment attributes the more agricultural catchments on the st lawrence lowlands with their flatter topography and higher drainage density were found to have lower low flows these catchments have clayed soils derived from glaciomarine deposits that are compacted due to intensive farming practices which restrict infiltration and promote surface runoff extensive tile drainage in quebec also promotes fast drainage of fields following snowmelt further limiting infiltration and aquifer recharge aygün et al 2021 forested catchments on the other hand have more porous soils due their surface organic layers and macropore networks these catchments thus favor infiltration and aquifer recharge which support groundwater discharge to rivers in summer as a result the baseflows in forest dominated catchments are prolonged so that low flows occur later in summer and with higher volumes neary et al 2009 these results agree with those documented in forested catchments of british columbia beaulieu et al 2012 that showed the important contribution of recharged subsurface reservoir by spring snowmelt to support a more stable summer base flow however many studies in north america caissie et al 2002 pike and scherer 2003 some of them conducted in quebec muma et al 2001 quilbé et al 2008 have demonstrated that basin deforestation due to forest harvesting leads to an increase in low flows in general deforested basins can conserve their porous soils on the short term but evapotranspiration losses are greatly reduced following forest harvest this increases baseflow compared with agricultural basins that have fine grained and compacted soils temporal changes in land cover could have affected low flow regimes but were not accounted for in this study jobin et al 2010 reported a small overall decrease 1 3 in forest cover in southern québec between 1993 and 2001 the largest change was a conversion from perennial to annual crops which could have caused a decrease in low flows due to increased soil compaction under intensive farming practices geology and soil types also emerged as significant predictors of low flow variability among catchments the more hydraulically conductive sandy loams and fractured gneissic rocks of the canadian shield were associated with higher summer low flows whereas the loamier soils on the sedimentary rocks of the appalachian province and the clayed soil on the st lawrence lowlands had relatively lower flows fig 5 and fig 8 regions of the globe with an energy limited evapotranspiration regime could suffer from increased evapotranspirative losses due to a warming climate which could deplete groundwater recharge and exacerbate summer low flows e g condon et al 2020 bloomfield et al 2019 larocque et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 in southern quebec higher precipitation and increasing summer evapotranspiration losses have been projected for 2050 leading to lower summer flows aygün et al 2020b guay et al 2015 our results show that historical summer low flows are most sensitive to summer rainfall and evapotranspiration losses which is in line with these hydrological projections our results also show that antecedent snow storage represents a secondary but non negligible source of summer low flow variability especially during drier years rising temperatures are expected to decrease snowpacks and snow cover sturm et al 2017 in mountains this effect will depend on elevation through the progressive rise of the zero isotherm jenicek et al 2018 but in non mountainous landscapes such as in the st lawrence valley climate warming will cause a progressive widespread shift from snowfall to rainfall leading to decreasing swe boyer et al 2010 aygün et al 2020b nemri and kinnard 2020 based on our findings the reduced snow storage anticipated in response to climate change could also reduce the efficiency of groundwater recharge which would exacerbate low flow conditions in late summer and negatively impact ecosystems integrity and ecological services 5 conclusions this study explored the hydroclimatic preconditioning of summer low flows in low elevation snow affected catchments in southern quebec canada the amount of rainfall following the disappearance of the snow cover was the prime control on summer low flows as expected for the humid continental climate of the region evapotranspiration losses following snow cover disappearance had a comparatively smaller influence on low flows despite the predominant summer control on low flows the amount of snow accumulated during the previous winter was also found to impact summer low flows the imprint of winter snowpacks on low flow was greatest in late summer when rainfall is scarcer and streamflow is fed by aquifer discharge this transfer mode of snowpack anomalies through the recharge of aquifers during spring snowmelt and the subsequent slow discharge to streams over the course of summer is different than in mountain basins where low flow has been shown to be better correlated with snowpacks in early summer due to the steeper topography and faster transfer by subsurface runoff catchment attributes were found to explain low flow differences between catchments more rugged catchments with a higher forest cover coarser soils and fractured crystalline bedrocks favoured higher low flows whereas flatter catchments with higher agricultural cover finer soils and sedimentary rocks favoured lower minimum flows these results underline the importance of snowpacks and catchment characteristics for aquifer recharge and subsequent low flow regimes in low elevation snow affected catchments increased evapotranspiration losses under warmer future climates but also decreased snow storage could exacerbate hydrological droughts in summer and negatively impact ecosystems integrity and ecological

3788,reduced snow storage has been associated with lower river low flows in mountainous catchments exacerbating summer hydrological droughts however the impacts of changing snow storage on summer low flows in low elevation snow affected catchments has not yet been investigated to address this knowledge gap the dominant hydroclimate predictors of summer low flows were first identified through correlation analysis in 12 tributary catchments of the st lawrence river in the canadian province of quebec the correlation results show that summer low flow is most sensitive to summer rainfall while maximum snow water equivalent swe is the dominant winter preconditioning factor of low flows particularly at the end of summer the multivariate sensitivity of summer low flow to hydroclimate predictors was then quantified by multilevel regression analysis considering also the effect of catchment biophysical attributes accumulated rainfall since snow cover disappearance was found to be the prime control on summer low flow as expected for the humid climate of quebec maximum swe had a secondary but significant positive influence on low flow sometimes on the same order as the negative effect of evapotranspiration losses as a whole our results show that in these low elevation catchments thicker winter snowpacks that last longer and melt slower in the spring are conducive to higher low flows in the following summer more rugged and forested catchments with coarser soils were found to have higher summer low flows than flatter agricultural catchments with compacted clayed soils this emphasizes the role of soils and geology on infiltration aquifer recharge and related river baseflow in summer further climate warming and snowpack depletion could reduce future summer low flow exacerbating hydrological droughts and impacting ecosystems integrity and ecological services keywords snow water equivalent snow melt river low flow interannual variability climate change 1 introduction in northern countries such as canada the hydrological regime is characterized by long winters dominated by solid precipitation and snow accumulation sustained snowmelt leads to a spring freshet typically the most significant hydrological event of the year and which often results in flooding especially when combined with rainfall episodes buttle et al 2016 pomeroy et al 2016 while a large of part of snowmelt water runs off to streams another part infiltrates into soils and helps to recharge aquifers which maintain river baseflow during summer larocque and broda 2016 maurer et al 2007 moore et al 2007 stewart et al 2004 these seasonal summer base flows dominate the summer low flows that are essential for maintaining ecosystems water diversion projects and for ensuring an adequate supply for human needs especially in cold regions burn et al 2008 smakhtin 2001 thus it is important to understand the impact of antecedent hydroclimatic conditions and processes that affect the hydrological regime of rivers in summer the different hydroclimatic projections in cold regions of the world allow predicting the emerging trends in the impacts of climate change on extreme hydrological events such as floods and low flows diffenbaugh et al 2013 studies in various parts of the world have shown that snow dominated basins are amongst the most sensitive to global warming aygün et al 2020a barnett et al 2005 as the shift from snowfall to rain is one of the most important impacts of projected climate change on the hydrological cycle zhang et al 2014 snowpack depletion is expected to occur in several regions and cause a gradual transition from a nivo pluvial hydrological regime to a pluvio nival regime in many cold regions berghuijs et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 whereas increasing precipitation under warming scenarios could lead to enhanced snow accumulation in regions with winter temperatures well below the freezing level regions with a milder winter climate will experience significant alterations of their hydrological regimes within the next decades aygün et al 2020a aygün et al 2020b given the expected reductions in snowpack volumes under climate change scenarios a precise knowledge of the impact of winter snow storage on summer low flows is important for water resource managers in regions where cold weather temperatures are near the freezing point in general a low flow is caused by the gradual drawdown of aquifers whose slow discharge feeds the streams during summer precipitation deficits in summer or higher than normal evapotranspiration losses particularly in summer smakhtin 2001 in new england usa hodgkins et al 2005 showed that about half of the interannual variability in summer low flow is explained by negative anomalies in summer july august precipitation in china tian et al 2011 showed that the increase in low flow between 1956 and 2004 was related to an increase in annual precipitation averages in the poyang lake basin in quebec canada assani et al 2011 showed that an increase in summer and spring precipitation resulted in an increase in summer low flow over the 1950 2000 period in the southeastern st lawrence basin increasing evapotranspiration losses under warmer air temperatures can also lead to reduced summer low flows but overall the impact of air temperatures variability on summer low flow rates appears to be lower than that of summer precipitation hodgkins et al 2005 yang et al 2002 several studies have shown that snow cover duration and snowpack volume in cold regions watersheds is changing in response to climate change directly influencing the magnitude timing and frequency of spring floods e g aygün et al 2020a curry and zwiers 2018 zhang et al 2014 these studies have analysed the relationship between the characteristics of spring high flows in cold regions and their relationship with snow cover and climate indices zhang et al 2014 showed in their study of alpine watersheds in asia 1960 2007 that winter and summer accumulated temperature and the amount of snowfall were significantly correlated with the spring snowmelt peak discharge whereas other climatic factors had no direct effect on the spring freshet also extensive work in the western united states berghuijs et al 2014 stewart et al 2004 has clearly shown that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with a higher mean annual discharge and that warmer air temperatures in spring result in a higher fraction of the annual discharge occurring earlier in the hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september in the northern hemisphere many studies throughout the world have reported that spring floods in snow affected basins will be earlier and of lesser magnitude in a warmer climate aygün et al 2020b bavay et al 2009 blöschl et al 2017 boyer et al 2010 buttle et al 2016 guay et al 2015 veijalainen et al 2010 however while the impacts of snowpack volume on spring discharge have been widely documented in cold regions the relationship between summer hydrology and antecedent winter snow storage has been comparatively little studied glacier melting during summer is known to modulate the summer low flow regime in glacierized catchments e g schaefli et al 2005 comeau et al 2009 there is however much fewer evidence that the storage and melting of seasonal snow contributes to summer low flow variability in non glacierized catchments only a few studies to date have investigated the link between snowpack characteristics and the interannual variability of low flows finding in general that winter snow accumulation can affect low flows in the following summer in the swiss alps snow water equivalent swe was found to be the dominant winter predictor of 7 day low flow jenicek et al 2016 similar findings have been reported from sierra nevada catchments in the western united states where godsey et al 2014 found that a decrease in maximum swe leads to a decrease in low flow in the following summer similar results were found in the maritime western u s mountains cooper et al 2018 and in the mountains of western north america dierauer et al 2018 where dry winters lead to significantly lower low flows in summer all these studies have been conducted in mountainous catchments in western north america or in the swiss alps where snowmelt water is expected to transfer downstream rapidly due to the steep topography the sensitivity of low flows to snow storage is also expected to be more pronounced in semiarid climates where summer rainfall is limited such as in the western us mountains these regions also have winter temperature near the zero degree isotherm which makes them particularly sensitive to temperature variations safeeq et al 2016 the impact of snow storage on the summer low flow regime of low elevation more humid catchments have on the other hand not been studied the interannual variability of summer low flows has been studied in canada in relation to atmospheric and oceanic circulation indices assani et al 2011 assani et al 2010 bonsal and shabbar 2008 but the hydroclimatic variables responsible for the interannual variability in the magnitude and timing of summer low flows have not yet been identified while the more abundant rainfall in summer is expected to be the prime control on low flow regimes increasing hydrological drought in summer due to rising evapotranspirative demand and longer dryspells under a warming trend berthot et al 2021 guay et al 2015 tam et al 2019 call for a better understanding of the role of snowpacks in sustaining summer low flows in these regions in addition the relative role of climatic factors and catchment attributes topography land cover and use geology and soils on low flow regimes in these regions has not been addressed the present study intends to partially fill this gap by estimating the relative impacts of interannual variations in snow storage summer rainfall and evapotranspiration on the variability of summer low flows in low elevation catchments in southern quebec canada we further investigate the respective influence of hydroclimatic conditions and catchment biophysical attributes on summer low flow magnitude 2 data and methods 2 1 study sites twelve tributary catchments of the st lawrence river in southern quebec were selected for the study fig 1 catchment areas range from 366 to 4 504 km2 with elevations 850 m table 1 the choice of catchments was based on the length of the flow measurement record a hydrological regime as close as possible to natural conditions i e near natural flows with no major human influences such as dams or water diversions and the presence of snow monitoring stations within or close to the basin these snow

were calculated from the grids nemri and kinnard 2020 daily streamflow records at the outlet of the 12 catchments were obtained from the cehq www cehq qc ca more than 30 years of records were chosen for analysis to match the standard record length used for defining climate normals table 1 this period is limited by the gridded climate product extending from 1961 to 2015 potential evapotranspiration epot was calculated according to oudin et al 2005 from daily air temperature and elevation we used mean catchment wide swe for the 12 study catchments previously simulated by nemri and kinnard 2020 with the cémaneige snow model valéry et al 2014 rain snow partition snowpack accumulation and snowmelt were calculated by nemri and kinnard 2020 at five equal area elevation bands and then averaged to the whole catchment nemri and kinnard 2020 then simulated actual evapotranspiration eact and river discharge with the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 with epot snowmelt and rainfall as inputs they used a split sample test to separate the observation record into two equal periods of calibration validation which varied from 8 to 27 years depending on the available record in each catchment table 1 they then calibrated the six parameters of the coupled gr4j cémaneige model on available discharge and swe observations using the multi objective amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 swe observations were taken from bi weekly surveys made by the ministry of environment and fight against climate change melcc in each of the studied catchment and represent the average of 10 manual measurements made with a snow corer at fixed points along a 100 m transect melcc 2008 model results yielded a good performance on independent observations with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients ranging from 0 67 to 0 90 median 0 80 for discharge and 0 20 0 78 median 0 70 for swe using the modeled swe instead of swe observations circumvents the problem of the sparse temporal bi weekly and spatial one or few survey sites per catchment coverage of the observations further model description and details on forcing data calibration and validation are given in nemri and kinnard 2020 2 3 antecedent hydroclimate conditions and statistical analysis of summer low flow the minimum daily flow measured over seven consecutive days between may and september was used as summer low flow variable 7 day running streamflow averages were used to minimize the effect of potential outliers this 7 day low flow indicator q7 is widely used as it is not susceptible to temporary upstream flow changes that can affect one day low flow calculations riggs 1985 hereafter this 7 day low flow q7 is simply referred as low flow minimum daily flows in the studied catchments occurred mostly between july and september but also occasionally in october 8 of the time across all catchments the analysis was limited to september because snowfall sometimes occurred in october in the more northern basins e g york and godbout fig 1 which could confuse the analysis due to the intermittent storage of precipitation as snow during this month seven variables related to winter spring and summer antecedent meteorological and water storage conditions in the basins were selected as potential predictors of the minimum summer low flow q7min table 2 the advantage of this choice of predictors is that only daily data of snow water equivalent swe snow cover fraction in the basin precipitation air temperature and streamflow are required for their calculation winter conditions were represented by the maximum peak accumulated swe in the basin swemax and its date of occurrence swemaxt spring conditions are represented by the snow disappearance date sdd calculated as the first day following the peak swe date with near snow free conditions i e with a snow cover 10 in the basin following jenicek et al 2016 the snow cover fraction was simulated by the cémaneige model nemri and kinnard 2020 these variables are used since is hypothesized that a thicker and later snowpack as well as a longer snow cover duration could favour aquifer recharge and help sustaining higher low flows later in summer in addition the average melt rate meltrate was calculated for the period between the date of maximum swe swemaxt and the snow disapearance date sdd following equation 1 barnhart et al 2016 1 meltrate t s d d t s w e max t δ s w e t d where δ s w e t represents negative changes in swe ablation and d the number of days with negative δ s w e t between the maximum swe date and the snow disappearance date three summer predictors were considered in the st lawrence valley the low flow regime is typically interrupted by the onset of sustained rain events in the fall which varies between years depending on synoptic patterns in particular the southern migration of the polar front in the fall which favours cyclogenesis and frontal precipitation events over southern quebec it is hypothesized that a later onset of autumn rainfall would cause a longer drawdown of aquifers and hence lower flow flows other factors being equal as such the date of minimum summer flow q7mint was used as predictor of its magnitude q7min to represent this phenomenon the accumulated actual evapotranspiration eact and rainfall prain between the date of snow disappearance sdd and the date of minimum flow q7mint were also calculated in each basin taken together these two variables determine the amount of available water in a given year and catchment after snowmelt we first used spearman s rank correlation to explore bivariate relationships between each potential predictor and summer low flow the nonparametric spearman correlation was used because several variables are not normally distributed the analysis was first conducted for all catchments combined global analysis and then separately for each catchment for this purpose the predictor and response variables were previously standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation per catchment to allow pooling catchments on a common unit scale for the global analysis to investigate memory effects of snowpack on low flow correlations were calculated between the maximum swe and the minimum flow within a 10 day running window from june to september in each catchment multilevel or mixed regression was then used to describe the combined effect of antecedent hydrometeorological variables on the interannual variability of summer low flows while also considering the effect of catchment attributes several catchment biophysical descriptors were considered i e land cover and use drainage density mean catchment slope and dominant geology and soil type table 1 multilevel regression is a widely used statistical model used when observations are organized grouped at more than one level and which allows to jointly model the within and between group variability gelman and hill 2006 the model relates the response variable q7min to seasonal hydroclimatic predictors first level fixed effects with basin id as grouping variable random effect and catchment attributes as group level variables second level fixed effects the multilevel model is represented by the following equations gelman and hill 2006 p 266 2 y t n α j t β x t σ t 2 f o r t 1 n 3 α j n γ 0 γ 1 u j σ α 2 f o r j 1 j where x t represents seasonal hydroclimatic predictors first level fixed effects n represents the number of annual observations in each catchment j for a total of j 12 catchments β is the vector of regression slopes for hydroclimatic predictors α j t is the intercept for catchment j γ 0 is the global or mean intercept value γ 1 is the vector of regression slopes for catchment attributes second level fixed effects and σ t 2 and σ α are the standard deviations model errors at the first and second levels respectively n symbolizes the normal distribution z score standardisation was applied on all hydroclimate variables prior to model fitting in order to use a common scale in the analysis a group mean standardisation was used which conserves inter basin differences in mean conditions which are then explicitly modelled by random effects in the multilevel model data were further transformed to a normal distribution using boxcox transformation sakia 1992 when necessary predictor multicollinearity was tested by calculating the variance inflation factor vif discarding predictor variables with a vif larger than 10 o brien 2007 separate multilevel regression models were fitted for each individual summer month from june to september as well as for the whole summer period hence for individual months q7min is the minimum 7 day discharge over the month while for the whole period q7min is the minimum 7 day discharge over the whole summer period june september in all cases rainfall prain and evapotranspiration eact are summed between the snow disappearance date and the minimum low flow date three different models of increasing complexity were considered 1 only considering hydroclimate predictors without basin grouping effect 2 hydroclimate predictors and a basin grouping effect 3 hydroclimate predictors with basin grouping and catchment attributes as catchment level predictors catchment biophysical characteristics tend to be closely interrelated in southern quebec for examples catchments on the canadian shield are more rugged forested and have coarser soils those on the st lawrence lowlands are flatter more agricultural and with finer soils this collinearity was addressed by applying a principal component analysis to the main catchment attributes presented in table 1 followed by a varimax rotation for better interpretability e g wilks 2011 basin area was not included as it is not physically related to the other catchment attributes nor was it significantly correlated with low flow the best model was selected based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1987 the aic is a model selection score which rewards goodness of fit as assessed by the likelihood function and penalizes for model complexity i e the number of model parameters the model with lowest aic score is usually favored competing models can be contrasted by computing the difference δaic between their aic and that of the best model as a rule of thumb models having a δaic 2 have substantial support evidence those with 4 δaic 7 have considerably less support and models having δaic greater than 10 have essentially no support burnham and anderson 2004 the multilevel regression models were further compared with a likelihood ratio test zuur et al 2009 p 120 all data processing and statistical analyses were carried out with the matlab and r softwares 3 results 3 1 correlation between hydroclimate variables the global correlation heat map shows the strength of the association between all the hydroclimatic variables when pooling all catchment together fig 2 all variables related to snow conditions are significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated together the snow disappearance date sdd is positively and significantly correlated with maximum swe swemax rho 0 49 and its date of occurrence swemaxt rho 0 47 in addition the melt rate is strongly correlated with swemax rho 0 63 and its date of occurrence swemaxt rho 0 79 hence thicker snowpacks tend to occur later and also to last longer in the spring this also explains the higher average melting rate occurring when snow persists under warmer spring conditions as found elsewhere musselman et al 2017 correlation between winter conditions and summer variables were generally low and often nonsignificant as expected however significant and inverse correlations are observed between the snow disappearance date sdd and accumulated evapotranspiration eact and rainfall prain which occurs because sdd controls the period over which the sum of rainfall and evapotranspiration is calculated fig 2 allows a first evaluation of the global relationship between summer low flow q7min and antecedent hydroclimate conditions as expected summer preconditioning of low flows is more important than winter and spring preconditioning the amount of rainfall accumulated between the snow disappearance date and the summer low flow date is the best overall predictor of q7min rho 0 27 so that wetter summers globally lead to higher summer low flows a weak but significant positive correlation rho 0 18 p 0 05 is found between maximum swe and summer low flow for the 12 pooled basins so that a thicker snowpack is associated with higher low flows additionally both the snow disappearance date rho 0 09 p 0 05 and melt rate rho 0 11 p 0 05 are weakly but positively correlated to summer low flow thus the snow disappearance date and melting rate do not explain much of the global variability in summer low flow the positive correlation between the melt rate and low flow is contrary to the hypothesized increased recharge under slower melt rates and could reflect the collinearity between swemax and meltrate seen in fig 2a higher evapotranspiration losses eact are associated with reduced low flows but the correlation is weaker rho 0 11 than for rainfall and maximum swe no significant correlations appear between winter snow variables and the timing of summer low flow q7mint in contrast q7mint is strongly and positively correlated with prain rho 0 82 and eact rho 0 83 however these correlations arise because later low flows increase the period over which prain and eact are calculated also no global correlation emerged between q7min and its date of occurrence q7mint separate correlations between summer low flow and the potential hydroclimatic predictors were calculated for humid and dry years years were ranked by total summer rainfall in each catchment and then split into two groups corresponding to the 50 most humid and 50 driest years the correlation between low flow and accumulated rainfall increases during wet years rho 0 66 and decreases during dry years rho 0 16 compared to the pooled sample fig 2b the correlation between low flow and evapotranspiration become positive during wet years and more negative during dry years compared to the pooled sample this suggests and interactive effect between rainfall and evapotranspiration on low flows since evapotranspiration is tightly coupled to rainfall amounts rho 0 76 fig 2a as expected for the energy limited regime of humid climates the positive correlation between low flow and evapotranspiration during wet years reflects the collinearity between rainfall and evapotranspiration during dry years the influence of rainfall on low flows is much reduced and evapotranspiration losses have a greater influence on catchment wetness leading to lower flows interestingly the correlation of low flow with swe and the melt rate are stable between humid and dry years suggesting that the snowpack represents a more stable source of moisture to sustain summer low flows low flow is even more strongly correlated to maximum swe than with rainfall during dry years also while the correlation between low flow and its timing was globally not significant a significant positive correlation arises during wet years and a negative one during dry years the positive correlation during wet years is probably due to the partial collinearity between rainfall and low flow timing as described earlier during dry years however the influence of rainfall on low flow is much reduced and the negative correlation between low flow and its timing may reflect the earlier onset of autumn rainfall events which interrupt the gradual drawdown of aquifers and results in higher summer low flows 3 2 impact of maximum swe on low flow during summer to explore in more details the memory effect of snowpack conditions on summer low flows the maximum swe was correlated with the minimum 7 day low flow every 10 days for the 12 selected catchments separately fig 3 similar to the approach used by jenicek et al 2016 for catchments in switzerland the 10 day period was chosen to be large enough to capture flow recessions while keeping a high temporal resolution for the analysis these 10 days correlation coefficients show the temporal sensitivity of low flow conditions to preceding winter accumulated snowpack the influence of maximum swe on summer low flow tends to increase over time and is greatest between late august and mid september with however heterogeneity between catchments fig 3 two catchments stand out from this general trend the northernmost godbout id1 and york id2 for which swe is rather weakly but negatively correlated with late summer low flow the maximum swe is also negatively correlated with low flow early in summer in five catchments etchemin bécancour ouelle famine nicolet such that a larger swe is associated with lower low flows in early mid june the snow disappearance date typically occurs in april may varying by 1 2 weeks each year in a given catchment and increasing towards higher latitudes in contrast the occurrence date of the summer low flow occurs on average from mid august to mid september with a more subdued increase northward but with large interannual variability 1 month when compared across all 12 catchments the correlation between the preconditioning variables and low flow in september when the correlation with maximum swe is highest fig 3 shows that low flow is positively correlated with maximum swe in 10 of the 12 catchments with correlations varying between 0 21 and 0 41 fig 4 however only five catchments pass the significance threshold p 0 05 the smaller number of observations in individual catchments explains the higher threshold correlation for statistical significance compared to the pooled catchments analysis in fig 2 despite the significance of the correlations their values are generally not strong suggesting that maximum swe plays a secondary role on low flow variability compared to summer conditions which was hypothesized for the more humid climate of southern quebec the correlation between maximum swe and september low flow also displays significant inter basin heterogeneity which does not seem to be related with the hydroclimatic region other winter predictors swemaxt sdd and meltrate are most often positively correlated with low flow but are rarely significant except in acadie batiscan and bras du nord fig 4 highlights a strong and significant correlation between low flow and accumulated rainfall in late summer september in all the studied catchments the correlation coefficients vary between 0 28 in famine and 0 67 in matawin conversely the accumulated evapotranspiration has significant negative effects on late summer low flow only in three basins godbout bras du nord and batiscan while a positive effect is found in three other basins ouelle etchemin and beaurivage while higher evapotranspiration should lead to reduced low flow the collinearity between rainfall and evapotranspiration fig 2 complicates the interpretation of simple bivariate relations to further examine the combined influence of rainfall and evapotranspiration on low flow q7min was correlated with the effective rainfall prain eact i e the available water for runoff the correlation between low flow and effective rainfall either increases or decreases slightly compared to the correlation with rainfall alone suggesting that low flow magnitude is more related to rainfall than evapotranspiration in summer as also highlighted in section 3 1 and fig 2 the global and catchment wise bivariate correlation analyses highlight the first order controls on low flow interannual variability however to better discriminate the influence of the respective hydroclimate predictors their multivariate influence on low flow must be assessed which is explored in the next section 3 3 low flow response to multivariate antecedent hydroclimate conditions and catchment characteristics the previous sections showed that summer low flow can be related to a combination of preconditioning factors with heterogeneity between basins thus a multilevel regression model was developed to investigate the combined effects of hydroclimate predictors taking into account the potential influence of catchment attributes on summer low flow collinearity tests using the variance inflation factor vif showed that the snow disappearance date had a vif larger than 10 o brien 2007 and was thus removed from the predictor set as shown in fig 2 the snow disappearance date is strongly correlated with the maximum swe and the melt rate as a thicker snowpack tends to last longer into the spring and increases the mean melt rate the first two principal component pc axes of catchment attributes explained 73 pc1 46 pc2 27 of their variability and were included as potential catchment level predictors of low flow the two rotated pc axes have low correlation r 0 16 which avoids collinearity issues in the regression model the two principal axes describe biophysical assemblages that are typical of southern quebec pc1 mainly separates catchments based on their dominant geology and soil types fig 5 catchments on the canadian shield grenville geological province with precambrian gneissic rocks have more sandy soils concentrated in incised glacial valleys while catchments extending into the appalachian province composed of tilted and folded paleozoic sedimentary rocks and rolling hill topography have more loamy soils pc2 mainly separates catchments according to their land cover and topography catchments that extend more into the st lawrence lowlands flat proterozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks covered by glaciomarine deposits have more clayed soils a higher agricultural cover a lower forest cover flatter topography and a higher drainage density the varying intercept model model 2 which accounts for random variations in q7min between catchments significantly improves the prediction performance compared to using fixed hydroclimatic effects only model 1 table 3 adding catchment attributes in model 3 further improved the predictive performance relative to model 2 suggesting that part of the inter catchment random variations can be explained by differences in catchment attributes table 3 the difference in aic with model 2 is greater than 10 which suggests that model 3 is a more optimal model which is confirmed by the likelihood ratio test zuur et al 2009 χ2 14 21 p 0 001 model 3 was thus retained as the best model to explain low flow interannual variations adding interactions between predictors fixed effects did not improve the model further results for the multilevel model 3 equations 2 3 are presented in table 4 fixed effects i e first level hydroclimate variables and second level catchment descriptors explain 60 62 of the interannual variability in q7min marginal r2 0 60 to 0 62 while random inter catchment differences effects account for 17 22 of the variance in q7min conditional r2 0 77 to 0 84 the accumulated rainfall following snow cover disappearance prain has a strong and sustained influence on q7min throughout summer standardized regression coefficient α 0 44 to 0 59 evapotranspiration losses eact have a negative influence on q7min decreasing towards the end of summer α 0 18 to 0 39 thus the expected negative effect of evapotranspiration on low flows stands out clearly in the multivariate analysis compared to bivariate correlations figs 2 and 3 since the simultaneous effect of the other predictors is taken into account in the multilevel models the flow timing q7mint has a significant negative influence on summer wide low flow but not on a monthly basis this is consistent with the notion that later flows have lower magnitude due to the gradual drawdown of aquifers feeding baseflow maximum swe swemax has a positive influence on low flow throughout summer α 0 15 to 0 25 p 0 05 table 4 in accordance with the bivariate correlation analysis fig 3 the influence is highest in june and august the relation between maximum swe and low flow for the whole summer is lower and similar to that in september which is because the lowest summer flow occurs on average in late summer the timing of maximum swe swemaxt is also positively related to low flow in june september α 0 14 to 0 19 p 0 05 so years with delayed melting and a later peak swe tend to result in higher low flows in summer the melt rate has a negative influence on low flow in june α 0 14 and august α 0 17 only this is interpreted to reflect the fact that slower melting of the snowpack favours infiltration which in turn would support subsurface drainage contributions to baseflow in early summer and aquifer recharge which would favor a delayed contribution to baseflow in august it is worth noting that while evapotranspiration has a lesser influence than rainfall on low flow the influence of maximum swe on low flow is of similar magnitude than that of evapotranspiration in late summer august september however for the summer wide period snow storage ranks third as low flow preconditioning factor behind rainfall and evapotranspiration inter catchment heterogeneity in the hydroclimate preconditioning of low flows was already noted in the previous section and figs 3 and 4 the multilevel model analysis yields interesting insights on the magnitude and causes of this heterogeneity partial residual plots of the significant winter spring predictors are shown for the month of august in fig 6 and for the summer period in fig 7 the varying intercept coefficients visible on these figures indicate significant differences in mean low flow conditions amongst catchments that are not explained by hydroclimatic factors the catchment attributes index variables pc1 and pc2 explain a large part of this inter catchment variability throughout summer α 0 37 to 0 49 table 4 and fig 8 the negative influence of pc1 on low flow illustrates that catchments which extend onto the canadian shield with sandy loam soils have generally higher flows than catchments extending into the appalachians with loamy soils fig 5 the negative influence of pc2 on low flow on the other hand illustrates that catchments extending onto the st lawrence lowlands with a higher lower agricultural forest cover lower slopes and higher drainage densities tend to have lower low flows 4 discussion our results highlighted the impact of antecedent seasonal hydrological conditions on summer low flow in twelve southern quebec rivers with a natural regime and significant variability in winter and summer precipitation the global and catchment wise bivariate correlation analyses cf section 3 1 and 3 2 showed that accumulated rainfall from snow disappearance to the date of low flow occurrence is the main control on low flow interannual variability followed by accumulated evapotranspiration losses this finding is not surprising given the humid continental climate of quebec larger snow storage in winter was also found to enhance low flows in the following summer with maximum swe emerging as a relatively more important driver of low flow variability during dry years fig 2 among the snow related variables maximum swe showed the clearest positive association with summer low flow but with significant heterogeneity among catchments the positive association between swe and summer low flow is interpreted to reflect the increased groundwater recharge during snowmelt which then sustains river baseflow during dry summer periods as found in other snow dominated areas e g beaulieu et al 2012 this is also in accordance with previous results found in mountainous basins in the swiss alps jenicek et al 2016 in austria laghari et al 2012 and western usa godsey et al 2014 where swe showed the best predictive ability for the 7 day low flow among all winter related predictors the situation in quebec is however quite different from semiarid climates like the sierra nevada where scarce summer precipitation enhances the response of low flow to antecedent snow storage godsey et al 2014 however the enhanced role of snow storage during dry years in the more humid quebec region shows that dry summers in an otherwise humid climate can also benefit from larger snow storage in the preceding winter our results show that across most of the studied catchments the effect of maximum swe on summer low flow is more important towards the end of summer august september this delayed response to snowmelt is interpreted to result from the predominant recharge of aquifers during spring snowmelt followed by the progressive outflow of aquifers to streams in summer as documented in several cold regions including quebec aygün et al 2020b boumaiza et al 2020 jasechko et al 2014 this is different than the situation in alpine and pre alpine catchments where the sensitivity of summer low flow to swe was found to decrease over the course of summer jenicek et al 2016 this suggests the transfer modes of snowpack anomalies are different i e via the slow discharge of aquifers in low elevation catchments and via faster subsurface runoff in alpine basins however for two basins york godbout a thicker snowpack in winter was related to lower low flows volume in summer fig 3 fig 4 however once the effect of rainfall and evapotranspiration was taken into account in the multivariate model the relation became positive albeit weakly figs 6 and 7 this is possibly because these catchments have a maritime climate with year round precipitation abundance which could explain the low dependence of streamflow on aquifer recharge by snowmelt the multilevel regression approach used in this study allowed examining the combined effect of hydroclimate predictors while accounting for inter catchment variability in low flow our results show that both summer climate rainfall and evapotranspiration and winter conditions snow storage and melt dynamics influenced summer low flows interannual variations accumulated summer precipitation is the dominant control on summer low flow variability with evapotranspiration losses and snow storage playing significant but secondary roles similar results regarding a large influence of rainfall regimes on low flows have been documented for historical river summer low flows in new england hodgkins et al 2005 for lower elevation basins in switzerland jenicek et al 2016 and southeast st lawrence watersheds in quebec assani et al 2011 while interannual variations in rainfall is unsurprisingly the first control on summer low flows given the regular summer rainfall in the area antecedent winter conditions still represent an important source of interannual variability sometimes of similar magnitude than evapotranspiration losses e g in august and september differences occur between bivariate correlation results global and by catchment and the multivariate analysis while some predictors maximum swe and accumulated rainfall have consistent relationships with summer low flow partly because these two variables are not interrelated other variables have different effects when the influence of the other predictors is taken into account within the multivariate models accumulated evapotranspiration has a negative relationships with summer low flows once other predictors are taken into account in the regression models this is consistent with the expected driving mechanism of decreasing catchment wetness and lower summer flows under higher evapotranspiration losses the low flow timing also has a negative effect on the summer lowest flow once the effect of other predictors is accounted for this is consistent with the notion that a later onset of the frontal rainfall regime in the fall allows for a longer period of aquifer depletion and correspondingly decreased low flow one limitation of the mixed modelling approach used is the varying length of the available flow records table 1 the entire flow records available during the 1961 2015 period limited by the climate forcings were preferred over a shorter but common period so as to maximise the number of observations and better detect significant hydroclimatic controls on low flow across the sample of catchments hence some catchments may have had a stronger weight in the model however all catchments had at least 33 years of data except bécancour id9 n 16 years which allowed for a robust and near balanced detection of climate flow relationships among catchments another limitation is the potential impact of unaccounted spatial heterogeneity within individual catchments on low flows the first order spatial heterogeneity was accounted for by using simulated swe within five elevation bands and rainfall snowfall and potential evapotranspiration calculated from 10 km gridded climate products nemri and kinnard 2020 however the uneven distribution of precipitation and snowmelt combined with the spatial heterogeneity in soils and geology could influence catchment storage and thus the temporal distribution of runoff this complexity may not be fully captured in our catchment scale analysis yet at the seasonal scale i e relating summer low flows to seasonal hydroclimatic conditions this effect should be small for low elevation catchments where biophysical gradients are typically much smaller than in mountainous settings moreover we did not find any significant correlation between catchment area and low flows q7min r 0 34 p 0 28 since spatial heterogeneity should scale with catchment area we take this as evidence that spatial heterogeneity plays a smaller role than hydroclimatic interannual variability on summer low flows our results showed significant inter catchment variability in low flow which was partly explained by catchment attributes the more agricultural catchments on the st lawrence lowlands with their flatter topography and higher drainage density were found to have lower low flows these catchments have clayed soils derived from glaciomarine deposits that are compacted due to intensive farming practices which restrict infiltration and promote surface runoff extensive tile drainage in quebec also promotes fast drainage of fields following snowmelt further limiting infiltration and aquifer recharge aygün et al 2021 forested catchments on the other hand have more porous soils due their surface organic layers and macropore networks these catchments thus favor infiltration and aquifer recharge which support groundwater discharge to rivers in summer as a result the baseflows in forest dominated catchments are prolonged so that low flows occur later in summer and with higher volumes neary et al 2009 these results agree with those documented in forested catchments of british columbia beaulieu et al 2012 that showed the important contribution of recharged subsurface reservoir by spring snowmelt to support a more stable summer base flow however many studies in north america caissie et al 2002 pike and scherer 2003 some of them conducted in quebec muma et al 2001 quilbé et al 2008 have demonstrated that basin deforestation due to forest harvesting leads to an increase in low flows in general deforested basins can conserve their porous soils on the short term but evapotranspiration losses are greatly reduced following forest harvest this increases baseflow compared with agricultural basins that have fine grained and compacted soils temporal changes in land cover could have affected low flow regimes but were not accounted for in this study jobin et al 2010 reported a small overall decrease 1 3 in forest cover in southern québec between 1993 and 2001 the largest change was a conversion from perennial to annual crops which could have caused a decrease in low flows due to increased soil compaction under intensive farming practices geology and soil types also emerged as significant predictors of low flow variability among catchments the more hydraulically conductive sandy loams and fractured gneissic rocks of the canadian shield were associated with higher summer low flows whereas the loamier soils on the sedimentary rocks of the appalachian province and the clayed soil on the st lawrence lowlands had relatively lower flows fig 5 and fig 8 regions of the globe with an energy limited evapotranspiration regime could suffer from increased evapotranspirative losses due to a warming climate which could deplete groundwater recharge and exacerbate summer low flows e g condon et al 2020 bloomfield et al 2019 larocque et al 2019 taylor et al 2013 in southern quebec higher precipitation and increasing summer evapotranspiration losses have been projected for 2050 leading to lower summer flows aygün et al 2020b guay et al 2015 our results show that historical summer low flows are most sensitive to summer rainfall and evapotranspiration losses which is in line with these hydrological projections our results also show that antecedent snow storage represents a secondary but non negligible source of summer low flow variability especially during drier years rising temperatures are expected to decrease snowpacks and snow cover sturm et al 2017 in mountains this effect will depend on elevation through the progressive rise of the zero isotherm jenicek et al 2018 but in non mountainous landscapes such as in the st lawrence valley climate warming will cause a progressive widespread shift from snowfall to rainfall leading to decreasing swe boyer et al 2010 aygün et al 2020b nemri and kinnard 2020 based on our findings the reduced snow storage anticipated in response to climate change could also reduce the efficiency of groundwater recharge which would exacerbate low flow conditions in late summer and negatively impact ecosystems integrity and ecological services 5 conclusions this study explored the hydroclimatic preconditioning of summer low flows in low elevation snow affected catchments in southern quebec canada the amount of rainfall following the disappearance of the snow cover was the prime control on summer low flows as expected for the humid continental climate of the region evapotranspiration losses following snow cover disappearance had a comparatively smaller influence on low flows despite the predominant summer control on low flows the amount of snow accumulated during the previous winter was also found to impact summer low flows the imprint of winter snowpacks on low flow was greatest in late summer when rainfall is scarcer and streamflow is fed by aquifer discharge this transfer mode of snowpack anomalies through the recharge of aquifers during spring snowmelt and the subsequent slow discharge to streams over the course of summer is different than in mountain basins where low flow has been shown to be better correlated with snowpacks in early summer due to the steeper topography and faster transfer by subsurface runoff catchment attributes were found to explain low flow differences between catchments more rugged catchments with a higher forest cover coarser soils and fractured crystalline bedrocks favoured higher low flows whereas flatter catchments with higher agricultural cover finer soils and sedimentary rocks favoured lower minimum flows these results underline the importance of snowpacks and catchment characteristics for aquifer recharge and subsequent low flow regimes in low elevation snow affected catchments increased evapotranspiration losses under warmer future climates but also decreased snow storage could exacerbate hydrological droughts in summer and negatively impact ecosystems integrity and ecological

3789,under global warming droughts have become more severe and more frequent in this context it is widely accepted that both water supply e g precipitation pre and demand e g potential evapotranspiration pet should be considered in drought assessments due to increasing evapotranspiration china s yellow river basin is located mainly in arid and semi arid regions that suffer severe droughts analyzing the temporal and spatial patterns of droughts in this area and exploring the relative effects of supply and demand on drought occurrence and variations are thus necessary to adapt to increased droughts here we compared three kinds of drought indices including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi and used spei to identify droughts in the yellow river basin during the six decades from 1956 to 2016 we identified droughts and described drought dynamics based on drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent we then evaluated the relative contributions of pre and pet to droughts of varying severity and long term trend as well as the relationships between ocean signals and droughts our results show that most of the basin has undergone progressively drier conditions since the 1950 s this increased drought occurrence has manifested as longer more frequent droughts affecting a larger spatial extent pre was the dominant driver 64 of drought occurrence in an area of 86 of the basin whereas pet was the main driver 55 in the remaining 14 of the basin however changes in pet contributed more than pre to drought variation i e long term spei trends in about 60 of the area and effects of pet increased during severer droughts due to the intensive interaction between soil moisture and atmospheric water demand in highly arid conditions physically droughts were closely related to several ocean signals such as the multivariate enso index mei the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo and the arctic oscillation index ao at different time scales understandings of drought dynamics their physical mechanisms and the effects of pre and pet on droughts of varying severity are essential for water resource management especially in arid regions keywords meteorological drought drought event standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index ocean signals 1 introduction drought is a common natural hazard and there is no universally accepted criterion for drought occurrence due to its complex senses in different research communities or applications a simple but concise definition for drought is periods when the supply of water fails to meet water demands ault 2020 redmond 2002 wilhite and glantz 1985 and drought is different from water scarcity which can be influenced by local water management van loon and van lanen 2013 so droughts are inevitable and harmful to ecological and socioeconomic systems ahmadalipour et al 2020 van loon et al 2016b during the last two decades an average of 71 6 million people per year was affected by global drought related disasters and direct economic losses have been valued at 65 3 billion per year ifrc 2019 such devastating impacts require that droughts especially meteorological droughts the origin of other droughts be intensively studied american meteorological society 1997 van loon et al 2016a moreover because the regional supply and demand for moisture have changed greatly because of climate change and socioeconomic development alfieri et al 2018 dai 2013 understanding drought dynamics and the effects of changing supply and demand on drought occurrence is crucial to risk management the identification of droughts based on specific indicators lays the groundwork for drought assessments american meteorological society 1997 mishra and singh 2010 and indicators from a supply demand perspective are significant in the context of global warming dai 2011 stahle 2020 trenberth et al 2013 several indices have been developed to identify droughts by tracking the departure of drought related variables from their historical norms dai 2011 gibbs and maher 1967 mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 van rooy 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 among them the palmer drought severity index pdsi rainfall deciles standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are commonly used proxies of meteorological drought pdsi and spei have been widely used because they account for the combined effects of water supply precipitation pre and demand potential evapotranspiration pet rather than precipitation alone changing water demands promotes drought by increasing the vapor pressure deficit and evapotranspiration under atmospheric warming dai 2011 recent studies have also noticed and analyzed the effects of warming on droughts including the attendant soil moisture deficit tree mortality and streamflow reduction brodribb et al 2018 naumann et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 samaniego et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example martin et al 2020 found that warming increases drought severity by decreasing runoff efficiency a fivefold increase in the frequency of tree mortality events in the southwestern united states is predicted for 4 c of warming adams et al 2009 zhou et al 2019b have also highlighted the increasing negative compound effects of high vapor pressure deficit and low soil moisture on vegetation productivity and terrestrial carbon uptake given these influences of warming on drought occurrence especially those severe droughts causing tree mortality two major questions stand out 1 to what extent does pet affect drought identification compared to pre and 2 does this effect differ among droughts of varying severity some studies have used pre as the main variable determining drought onset duration termination and intensity based on the assumptions that the variability of pre is higher than that of other variables affecting the water balance and that these variables are relatively constant vicente serrano et al 2010 however by theoretical and observational analyses hu and willson 2000 showed that pdsi responds equally well to similar magnitude changes in temperature and precipitation david et al 2007 found that the effects of warming were offset by increased precipitation in parts of the united states whereas more spatially extensive severe to extreme droughts occurred in areas not receiving increased precipitation it is therefore necessary to clarify the relative effects of pre and pet on drought occurrence and severity the yellow river is the second and sixth longest river system in china and the world respectively like many other river basins in arid or semi arid areas the yellow river basin yrb faces a tough challenge of drought the climate here has become drier and warmer and this change is expected to aggravate drought risks in this region ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019 drying since the early 1970 s culminated in a severe drought at the end of the 20th century during which a river segment longer than 700 km became drying up chen and mu 2000 liu and zhang 2002 thus research on drought and its driving factors in this region is important for watershed management many studies have analyzed the spatial patterns temporal trends seasonal variation and periodicity of drought in the yrb by employing spi pdsi spei and new integrated drought indices that incorporate multiple observational and remote sensing based meteorological hydrological or ecological variables chang et al 2015 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ma et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019a zhu et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 among them droughts are commonly described according to their duration intensity frequency and spatial extent still a comprehensive analysis of drought evolution from the perspective of each of these aspects is needed sun and ma 2015 showed that temperature exerted a greater influence on drought trends than precipitation on the loess plateau located in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb but relative effects of precipitation and other factors on the different severity of droughts require further examination here we analyzed drought dynamics estimated the relative contributions of pre and pet to droughts of varying severity and long term trend in the yrb and explored underlying physical mechanisms of droughts specifically we first compared several kinds of drought indices before identifying droughts based on spei over six decades from 1956 to 2016 then described drought severity in terms of drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent section 4 1 we analyzed drought dynamics based on these four aspects to explore changing drought characteristics section 4 2 next and perhaps most importantly we estimated the relative contributions of pet and pre to droughts to compare their influence on droughts of varying severity and long term trend section 4 3 lastly we analyzed the relationships between ocean signals and droughts to examine the underlying causes of drought occurrence this study will contribute to a better understanding of drought in the yrb and provides a fresh perspective on the impact of pet on meteorological droughts 2 study area and data the yrb located in north central china extends from 32 10 n 95 53 e to 41 50 n 119 05 e covering a total area of 7 52 105 km2 fig 1 the climate here differs from an arid zone in the northwest to a humid zone in the southeast due to the various topographies and vast extent for example annual precipitation varies from about 100 to 1000 mm and increases from the northwest to the southeast while annual pan evaporation ranges from about 700 to 1800 mm chang et al 2015 influenced by atmospheric circulation and monsoon climate seasonal differentiation is distinct in the yrb with rainy hot summer and dry cold winter zhu et al 2019 to explore drought dynamics in different regions the whole yrb was divided into eight sub basins based on the secondary basin boundary in china http www geodata cn i the source region ii southwest and iii northeast of the upper reaches iv interior drainage areas v north vi south and vii southeast of the middle reaches and viii the lower reaches fig 1 the source region upper middle reaches and lower reaches are situated at the eastern qinghai tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain respectively with altitudes from high to low and the yr flows through them in turn from west to east we used data from 141 meteorological stations in and around the basin to obtain gridded monthly pre and pet datasets for spei calculation daily records of precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity and sunshine duration at each station were collected from the meteorological data set provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn we then calculated daily pet by the penman monteith method using most of the above mentioned meteorological variables as parameters details available in allen et al 1998 then the daily pre and pet records were each summed to obtain monthly data based on the monthly station data and a digital elevation model of the basin obtained from the international scientific data service platform http datamirror csdb cn the anusplin interpolation tool hutchinson and xu 2013 was used to produce 0 1 gridded monthly pre and pet datasets over the entire yrb spanning the period from 1956 to 2016 we also collected actual evapotranspiration et data to calculate other drought indices used to compare with spei given the lack of direct et observations in yrb two sets of modeled et productions were obtained the first dataset et crm is a monthly 0 1 terrestrial et production across china 1982 2017 it is derived from the complementary relationship method and developed by ma et al 2019b the second dataset et gleam is the daily 0 25 et product from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 5a 1980 2020 by martens et al 2017 the period from 1982 to 2016 remained for both datasets and the et gleam product was downscaled to 0 1 to unify the spatial resolutions of other datasets to investigate the physical causes of long term drought variations atmospheric teleconnections with drought were considered kim et al 2019 we collected several ocean signals including the multivariate enso index mei the pacific decadal oscillation index pdo the arctic oscillation index ao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo the nino3 4 the north atlantic oscillation nao and the southern oscillation index soi they are provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration physical sciences laboratory and can be downloaded from https psl noaa gov enso mei and https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries 3 methods 3 1 calculation of spei and other drought indices spei which represents deviations from normal conditions based on the standardized difference between pre and pet is commonly used to identify drought it is calculated as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 the monthly difference between pre and pet eq 1 and their cumulative difference at a particular time scale eq 2 are calculated for each month to obtain a data series 1 d i j pre i j pet i j 2 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i j if j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where pre i j pet i j and d i j are precipitation potential evapotranspiration and their difference mm respectively in a year i and month j x i j k is the cumulative difference in the year i and month j at the k month time scale mm k is the time scale used for different time lags of droughts because water deficits develop over different time scales and thus promote different drought phenomena it is important to associate drought indices with specific time scales for monitoring and water management purposes vicente serrano et al 2010 therefore we calculated the spei series at 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales and conducted all analyses separately for each series then the probability distribution function of the data series f x is estimated and spei can be obtained as the standardized probability values of the data series based on f x eqs 3 4 3 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 4 w 2 ln p p 1 f x if p 0 5 2 ln 1 p p 1 f x if p 0 5 where x is an element in the data series x and f x represents a probability distribution function candidate probability distribution f x is chosen based on its goodness of fit here three common types of distributions log logistic ll generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii p3 distributions were collected for spei calculation from previous studies their goodness of fit in the yrb was evaluated based on kolmogorov smirnov k s anderson darling a d and shapiro wilk s w tests stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 a n d d 3 are constants with respective values of 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 vicente serrano et al 2010 spei values near zero indicate normal conditions i e neither excessively wet nor dry more negative spei values indicate drier conditions while positive spei values indicate wet conditions a specific definition of the drought severity based on spei can be seen in the following section 3 2 other climate indices including standardized precipitation index spi and standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi were also estimated and we compared them with spei to make a more solid drought assessment spi and sedi represent deviations from normal conditions based on the standardized pre and the standardized difference between et and pet respectively we calculated them at 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales following the above procedure for spei in particular gamma and ll distributions were used for spi and sedi respectively according to suggestions from previous studies beguería et al 2014 kim et al 2019 stagge et al 2015 in addition two sets of sedi i e sedi gleam and sedi crm were calculated using et gleam and et crm respectively to reduce the inevitable uncertainties around et products 3 2 drought definition and description here we define drought as any month when spei is below a threshold e g 0 5 and drought events as consecutive months of droughts ma et al 2019a wang et al 2018 if the interval between two droughts is no more than one month we consider them the same event fig 2 we use drought duration intensity frequency and the spatial extent to describe identified drought events duration is defined as the interval months between the onset and end of a drought event intensity is the average spei value during a drought event units of month 1 as with spei more negative values indicate more severe droughts frequency is the proportion of drought months in an entire year and spatial extent is the proportion of drought affected areas within a certain region duration intensity and frequency were analyzed in each grid cell whereas spatial extent was estimated for the entire yrb and its sub basins the mann kendall test was used to analyze changes in the trends of these characteristics mann 1945 and sen s slope method was used to estimate their rates of change gocic and trajkovic 2013 sen 1968 to analyze the similarities and differences between drought characteristics of varying severity we divided drought events into several groups according to their duration intensity and frequency respectively he et al 2020 huopo and jianqi 2015 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 two criteria determined the intervals between groups i they should be consistent with classifications in previous studies for comparison and ii each drought event should be classified into one and only one group and each group should contain at least one drought event detailed information on the groups can be seen in table 1 the group number indicates the severity of the droughts i e droughts in groups 1 and 5 are the least and most severe respectively we also estimated drought severity across the entire yrb each year by summing the monthly spei values of each drought event in a given year to obtain a series of yearly drought values these values were then normalized as 5 nd i d m a x d i d m a x d m i n where nd i and d i are the normalized and yearly drought values of the ith year respectively and d m a x and d m i n are the respective maximum and minimum values of the series of yearly drought values normalized values range from 0 to 1 with larger values indicating more severe droughts 3 3 relative contributions of pet and pre to drought here we quantify the relative contributions of pet and pre to both drought events and drought variations at first following the approach proposed by pederson et al 2013 we used multiple regression to estimate the relative contributions of pet and pre to drought events martin et al 2020 we regressed the time series of spei against the monthly pet and pre z scores multiplied the pet and pre z score time series by the regression coefficients and summed the respective series to approximate the relative forcing by pet and pre this calculation was performed for each grid cell of the study area to obtain the spatial distribution of the variable dominantly affecting drought occurrence to eliminate any disturbances by wet periods we considered only z score time series for periods with original spei values lower than 0 5 moreover because residuals of the multiple regression are assumed to follow a standard normal distribution with an expected value of zero there is no extra error between sum of spei and sum of products of pet or pre with their respective coefficients so rationality of this approach is determined only by performance of the multiple regression and r2 and p value are used to evaluate its goodness of fit fig s1 left to compare the relative contributions of pre and pet to the drought groups based on duration intensity and frequency table 1 we performed a similar regression for each group multiple contribution values are needed for each group to evaluate whether differences between groups are statistically significant and a random sampling method is used in this study to achieve that specifically we randomly extracted a certain number of grid cells from each group to conduct regression and repeated this procedure 1000 times per group then we used one way analysis of variance to determine if the differences in contributions between groups are statistically significant in addition the number of grid cells extracted from each group per round depended on the number of droughts in each group especially it should smaller than the amount of data in the smallest group and was typically around 5 000 in this study secondly we estimate the relative contributions of changes in pet and pre to drought variations using a differential equation this approach as proposed by ding and peng 2020 separates the long term trend of spei into two parts 6 dspei dt s p e i p e t dpet dt s p e i p r e dpre dt where dspei dt dpet dt and dpre dt are the long term trends of spei pet and pre respectively and s p e i p e t and s p e i p r e are the sensitivity coefficients of spei to pet and pre respectively therefore the percentage of each part is supposed to be the relative contribution of change in pet or pre to spei variations long term trends of spei pet and pre were estimated using sen s slope method while sensitivity coefficients of spei to pet and pre were calculated according to the following equation 7 δ s p e i a δ p e t b δ p r e where δ s p e i δ p e t and δ p r e are the interannual variations of time series of spei pet and pre respectively and a and b i e s p e i p e t and s p e i p r e are regression coefficients obtained from multiple regression again r2 and p value are used to evaluate the goodness of fit in regression fig s1 right as for the rationality of this approach we compared the sum of the two parts in eq 6 with the actual spei trend fig s2 3 4 relationships between ocean signals and drought we used the pearson method to calculate correlation coefficients between ocean signals mei pdo ao amo the nino3 4 nao and soi and droughts and explore their relationships based on these correlation coefficients given the interannual or decadal oscillations of ocean signals multi decadal time scales from 10 to 600 months were analyzed in this study the moving average method was used to calculate values of ocean signals and droughts at different time scales two indicators using to represent droughts were the spei series at 12 month time scales spei 12 and the annual area fraction of i2 4 droughts drought intensity falls into groups 2 4 see table 1 identified by mean spei 12 in the yrb following the method in kim et al 2019 we also applied the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis to extract the top three principal components pcs of the spei 12 time series and further analyzed respective relationships between ocean signals and the three pcs at different time scales using pearson method all these analyses mentioned above were conducted in matlab r2020a 4 results 4 1 spei and drought our results show a drying trend in the yrb during the six decades of the study period especially in the southwest and east central areas fig 3 average annual spei values over the entire region decreased significantly p 0 09 0 11 0 05 and 0 02 at the 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales respectively at rates of 0 008 to 0 003 yr 1 spatially about 76 of the studied areas showed decreasing spei trends and the rates of decrease were significant p 0 05 in 42 of those areas these areas were mainly to the south of the junction between the source region and the upper reaches of the yrb and in the east central parts of the middle reaches of the areas showing increasing spei trends 24 only 10 showed significant increase rates these areas were primarily in the north and northwest of the upper reaches and dominating the lower reaches based on these spei results we identified and described drought events according to their duration intensity frequency and spatial extent almost 55 of the drought events were shorter than three months and 60 were of mild intensity 1 month 1 in about 13 of the years analyzed one or more drought events accounted for at least eight months of drought fig 4 a considering drought intensity frequency and spatial extent the most severe droughts occurred in 1965 1966 1972 1987 1997 2002 and 2013 fig 4b relatively severe droughts occurred almost every ten years and were characterized by different durations and intensities for example the 1997 2002 drought was the longest whereas the 1965 1966 drought was shorter but more intense differences are also evident between different time scales for instance droughts identified from the 1 and 3 month spei trends were more severe than those identified from the 12 month trend in 1979 2010 and 2013 fig 4b more drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month trends were of shorter duration than those identified from the 6 and 12 month trends the proportions of low and high frequency drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month trends were lower than those identified from the 6 and 12 month trends whereas the proportion of intermediate frequency events was greater in the 1 and 3 month trends fig 4a we also compared spei with other drought indices including spi sedi gleam and sedi crm with spei in two ways a correlations between monthly spei and spi sedi gleam sedi crm time series at each grid cell fig s3 and b similarities in their annual variations fig s4 results showed that spei is significantly related to spi sedi gleam and sedi crm at 1 3 6 and 12 month in almost all regions with average pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 91 0 72 and 0 70 respectively spatially spei had a closer relation with spi in southeast yrb than that in the northwest while it had closer relations with sedi gleam and sedi crm in the northwest the goodness of fit for the probability distributions of all drought indices had been tested most of the rejection frequencies for the tested distributions were lower than 5 more details can be seen in table s1 and s2 as for spei the goodness of fit of three probability distributions log logistic generalized extreme value and pearson type iii has been tested and pearson type iii distribution had lower rejection rates than the other two in the yrb so it was used in this study to calculate spei 4 2 changes in drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent respective temporal changes of drought events in duration intensity and frequency for each gridded yrb were tested in this part as shown in fig 5 drought events in more than half of the yrb became longer 61 of the basin less intense 65 and more frequent 71 during 1956 2016 overall the increased frequency of drought events was more obvious than changes in duration and intensity because the larger areas showed significant trends although drought events were more intense in parts of the basin with decreasing spei trends these areas were relatively small they were located mainly southwest of the yellow river source region the spatial extent area fraction of drought affected areas in the entire basin increased at a rate of 0 10 0 22 per year fig 6 dominated by increases in areas affected by droughts of medium duration 4 6 months mild intensity 1 month 1 and moderate to high frequency 30 fig 7 a specifically significant increases in drought affected areas occurred in the yellow river source region fig 7b southwest of the upper reaches fig 7c and in most of the middle reaches fig 7f and fig 7g no significant changes in spatial extent occurred in the northeast of the upper reaches fig 7d in the interior drainage areas fig 7e and in the southeast of the middle reaches fig 7h in the lower reaches however significant increases and decreases in the spatial extents of different drought groups offset each other fig 7i 4 3 contributions of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to droughts precipitation pre exerted a more important control on drought events than potential evapotranspiration pet fig 8 left although the role of pet increased with increasing drought severity fig 9 moreover changes in pet contributed more to the long term spei trend than pet fig 8 right when 50 was used as the threshold between pre 50 and pet dominated 50 the occurrence of drought events was driven dominantly by pre in about 86 area of the yrb average contribution of 64 whereas pet was the dominant driver average contribution of 55 in the remaining 14 of the basin fig 8 left drought variations i e long term spei trends were mainly affected by changes in pet in about 60 area of the yrb average contribution of 72 while pre was the main driver in the other area about 40 of the basin with an average contribution of 69 fig 8 right we then used the ratio of pre to pet contributions as an indicator of the dominant driver of drought among drought events of varying severity table 1 as shown in fig 9 the ratios were decreasing they differed significantly within most of the groups which means pet contributed relatively more to severe droughts than it to the less intense ones significantly fig 9 moreover results mentioned above differed between droughts identified from the spei trends at different time scales for example pre had larger contributions to long time scale droughts fig 8g h and fig 9d than it to short time scale ones fig 8a b and fig 9a and thus the contributions of pet were opposite pre became less important and pet more important with increasing drought severity in all duration intensity and frequency groups derived from the 3 and 6 month spei time series fig 9b c however these relationships were not as straightforward for droughts identified from the 1 and 12 month time series the role of pre was strengthened relative to the 3 and 6 month data in the most severe drought groups of duration in 1 month data fig 9a and intensity in 12 month data fig 9d 4 4 teleconnections between ocean signals and drought as fig 10 shown the time series of mean spei 12 in the yrb was significantly related to the 12 month moving average of monthly multivariate enso index mei pearson s r 0 29 p 0 001 and severer droughts here which meant drought intensity fell into group 2 4 identified by spei 12 were also closely associated with the positive phases of enso which indicate el niño occurrence as for relationships of ocean signals with spei 12 and its three main principal components pcs at different time scales from 10 to 600 months we found that spei 12 and its pcs were significantly related to different ocean signals at different time scales fig s5 in general spei 12 and pcs had closer relationships with nao amo ao at more time scales than that with mei pdo nino3 4 and soi specifically spei 12 and pc3 were positively associated with nao while negatively associated with amo ao mei and pdo contrary to spei 12 and pc3 pc1 and pc2 had opposite relationships with these signals on the other hand spei 12 and pc1 had closer connections with nao and amo at shorter time scales than that with ao pdo and mei and closer connections of pc2 and pc3 with these ocean signals appeared simultaneously as spei 12 and pc1 except for nao 5 discussion 5 1 droughts of longer duration higher frequency and greater spatial extent the yellow river basin has become drier under the changing climate and droughts have become more severe and frequent ma et al 2020 here we concretized drought severity using multiple aspects of drought and found that although drought intensity did not significantly change in most areas drought events became longer more frequent and more spatially extensive during the study period figs 5 and 6 our results are consistent with zhu et al 2019 they showed a general drying tendency in this region with meteorological and hydrological droughts becoming longer and more spatially extensive however our analysis did not capture some shorter term fluctuations because we focused on the general trend during 1956 2016 for example wang et al 2018 divided the period 1961 2015 into three stages and found that both drought intensity and frequency increased from stage 1 1961 1996 to stage 2 1997 2002 and then decreased during stage 3 2003 2015 considering that the most severe drought occurred during stage 2 fig 4b it is reasonable that drought events were the most intense during that time our results showed that the increasing duration frequency and spatial extent of drought events apply only to drying areas of the yrb including the source region southwest of the upper reaches most of the middle reaches and not to wetter areas such as northeast of the upper reaches and the lower reaches fig 3 however drying extents are partly inconsistent among previous studies for example the dry gets drier and wet gets wetter ddww paradigm is popular and widely used to summarize the expected trends of the global hydrological cycle chia et al 2009 feng and zhang 2015 but we found the relationship between aridity index the ratio between pre and pet and long term spei trends in the yrb is against the ddww paradigm yang et al 2019 and presents an opposite pattern that dry gets wetter and wet gets drier fig s6 zhu et al 2016 reported that all yrb sub basins are drying but found less drastic drying trends in the source region southwest of the upper reaches and the lower reaches these differences may result from the various indicators used to identify drought some studies included only precipitation whereas others accounted for meteorological hydrological ecological and socioeconomic variables chang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a indeed meteorological hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts have unique spatial patterns and temporal trends and the ddww paradigm is more useful when only precipitation driven drought indices are applied yang et al 2019 5 2 increasing contributions of potential evapotranspiration to severe droughts under global warming and changing atmospheric water demands the importance of pet to drought should not be ignored dai 2013 stahle 2020 in this study we quantified the relative contributions of pre and pet to meteorological drought given the variability of pre it is not surprising that pre was the dominant driver of drought events in most of the studied areas fig 8 left however drought variation i e long term spei trend was mainly affected by the change in pet in about 60 area of the yrb fig 8 right and by classifying drought events according to their duration intensity and frequency we showed that the relative contribution of pet to severe droughts was always larger than that to mild ones fig 9 in addition to global warming this phenomenon may be associated with interrelated physical processes zhou et al 2019b during dry periods soil moisture is lower because of inadequate recharge from pre decreased soil moisture reduces evapotranspiration and causes a higher atmospheric water demand pet by reducing evaporative cooling and near surface humidity increased pet in turn promotes evapotranspiration on land and accelerates the drying of soils miralles et al 2014b yin et al 2014 this positive feedback between decreasing soil moisture and increasing pet exacerbates drought conditions and amplifies the importance of pet during more severe droughts global warming has also been shown to play a significant role in the occurrence of extreme drought events such as the mega droughts and consequently increased tree mortality and wildfires in southwestern north america since the early 2000 s and this kind of drought is called global change type drought adams et al 2009 breshears et al 2005 brodribb et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 furthermore the negative effects of extreme heat and dryness events on continental productivity are larger when compounded and the likelihood of such compound events is expected only to increase in future decades alizadeh et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b although we focused only on meteorological droughts our study highlights the increasing importance of pet in extreme drought conditions it confirms the interaction between and the compound effects of pre and pet 5 3 physical mechanism of drought from a view of ocean signals the atmospheric responses to ocean signals play a significant role in the variations of regional precipitation temperature and therefore drought kim et al 2019 miralles et al 2014a so teleconnections between ocean signals and drought might explain drought occurrence and the long term trend of spei from a physical perspective at a large scale wang et al 2020a our analysis highlighted the important role of el niño southern oscillation enso events on drought occurrence which is agreed with previous studies when the sea surface temperature sst in the eastern tropical pacific rises el niño occurs and weakens the east asian summer monsoon so there is no adequate water vapor being conveyed to the yrb and drought forms la niña which occurs when the sst is declining is opposite to el niño and always leads to floods besides ocean signals also contribute very much to the long term spei variations for example wang et al 2020a found strong effects of ocean signals including enso ao and pdo on drought evolution in the yrb by the cross wavelet transform approach kim et al 2019 illustrated seasonal teleconnection between long term enso and the general trend of sedi drought index calculated by et deficits over the contiguous united states they further revealed the top three principal components pcs of the sedi time series were significantly related to amo mean air temperature of the study area and pdo respectively in this study we found spei and its pcs were significantly associated with different ocean signals at different time scales fig s5 and they had closer relationships with nao amo ao at more time scales than with mei and pdo which is partly consistent with wang et al 2020a however the relationships of spei and its pcs with these ocean signals are complex in terms of direction positive or negative of relationship and time scale in which closer relationship appears in summary long term ocean signals impact the spei time series but the interaction between ocean signals and different periodicities of signals make their relationships more complex seung et al 2017 so more physical exploration and explanation for drought are needed in future research 5 4 implications and uncertainties in the yellow river basin drought represents the biggest threat to water resource availability which is critical to ecological and social development therefore understanding drought dynamics and the relative contributions of pre and pet to drought occurrence and variations is important to regional water resource management and regulation the increasing durations frequencies and spatial extents of droughts imply that longer droughts will affect larger areas so effective mitigation measures will require spatially extensive long term efforts such as well organized water planning and regulation based on reservoirs dams or planting crops with lower water consumption considering global warming and the grave consequences of extreme droughts on socio ecological systems such measures should be taken as early as possible to alleviate water stress and prevent intensive interactions between soil water and pet during severe droughts droughts are complex phenomena and we chose to use spei alone as the drought indicator in this study for two reasons 1 spei accounts for the effects of both pre and pet variability on drought occurrence which is more reasonable under the warming climate and 2 spei estimates water deficits surpluses across multiple time scales and can thus be used to analyze droughts with different time lags which have varied implications ault 2020 it is nonetheless inevitable that our analysis included some uncertainties although accounting for the atmospheric water demand is one of the great strengths of spei the choice of the indicator used to represent that demand remains under debate beguería et al 2014 showed that using pet rather than actual evapotranspiration is advantageous to calculate spei they recommended the penman monteith equation for pet estimation because it includes more comprehensive physical mechanisms fisher et al 2011 although we have followed their suggestion spei trends should be calculated using different methods of pet estimation to compare their differences in spatial patterns and temporal trends when used for drought identification indeed some studies have shown that the penman monteith equation might overestimate changes in pet under global warming because of its incorrect assumption that all surfaces have a fixed resistance for example pet and the extent of dry land based on the aridity index defined as pet pre are reduced when a co2 responsive surface resistance is used to improve the original penman monteith equation greve et al 2019 roderick et al 2015 furthermore droughts can occur at monthly seasonal yearly or decadal scales drought characteristics may vary at different temporal scales this study showed results at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales although their general trends and spatial patterns are roughly consistent our results show discrepancies among the identified drought events and the relative contributions of pre and pet for example drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month spei have greater proportions of shorter duration and intermediate frequency than those identified from the 6 and 12 month spei fig 4a these discrepancies are at least partly consistent with the properties of short term lag and long term lag droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 have pointed out that drought series identified from shorter time scales are of short duration and high frequency while the droughts identified from longer time scales show a lower frequency with longer duration as for the contribution discrepancies of pre and pet to droughts identified from different time scales figs 8 and 9 more exploration is needed such as discussion on the difference between accumulated variations of pre and pet the difference between spei and other drought indices results from the spatial discrepancy between pet and et for example the relationship between spei and spi is closer in southeast yrb than that in the northwest and this is consistent with fig 8 left that pet was the dominant driver of droughts in the northwest instead of pre although the general variation of spei is similar to that of spi values of the two indices differ in periods during which both pre and pet were higher than normal conditions for example there was more 13 1 rainfall than normal conditions and record breaking warming in 2016 yan et al 2020 and spi is larger than spei this year due to its neglect of the increasing pet contrary to spi relationships between spei and sedi are closer in the northwest than in the southeast given the strong relationship between et and pre in arid to sub humid regions and the strong relationship between et and pet in humid regions it s not strange that spei is highly related to sedi in the drier northwest than wetter southeast beguería et al 2014 also considered sedi an unreliable index due to its high frequency of et pet 0 in the humid region which is harmful to probability distribution fitting moreover correlation coefficients between spei and sedi are lowest in the southwest resulting from the complex hydrological cycle in qinghai tibet plateau where pre is not the major source of et moreover our analysis focused only on meteorological droughts as discussed above drought characteristics and the effects of driving factors may vary among drought types and indicators along with the processes of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological to socioeconomic droughts huang et al 2017 van loon et al 2012 furthermore moisture and heat conditions differ between arid and humid regions more research should thus focus on more critical regions and on multiple types of droughts to examine the robustness of existing results and obtain more universal findings at last it is noteworthy that drought in the yrb may also be influenced by anthropogenic factors besides climatological and meteorological drivers due to intense human activities here such as afforestation and the use of dams and reservoirs for controlling water aghakouchak et al 2021 afforestation affects drought by intensifying the water cycle thus increasing pre and et but decreasing soil moisture and runoff li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 dams and reservoirs alter the local climate and improve water resource utilization performance which results in a decline in runoff and an exacerbation of hydrological drought downstream wang et al 2019 further research hence is needed for understanding the role of the human in drought formation and propagation due to its complicated effects on hydro meteorological processes 6 conclusions with climate change the effects of climatic warming on drought occurrence and variations are increasingly significant we compared several drought indices before using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to analyze drought dynamics duration intensity frequency and spatial extent in the yellow river basin china over six decades from 1956 to 2016 then estimated the relative effects of precipitation pre and potential evapotranspiration pet on drought occurrence and variations using multiple regression approaches and explored underlying physical causes of droughts formation from a view of ocean signals our results show that most areas in the yellow river basin have been drying since the 1950 s and increasing drought trends have manifested as longer more frequent drought events affecting larger areas pre was the main driver of drought events and contributed about 64 to drought occurrence in about 86 of the area in contrast the change in pet was the dominant driver 72 for drought variations in about 60 of the area moreover the effect of pet was larger in more severe drought events than it in the less severe ones as for the physical mechanism of droughts ocean signals such as the multivariate enso index mei the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo and the arctic oscillation index ao had complicated impacts on drought occurrence and variation in general our study highlights the increasing influence of pet during extreme drought conditions and demonstrates the interaction between and

3789,under global warming droughts have become more severe and more frequent in this context it is widely accepted that both water supply e g precipitation pre and demand e g potential evapotranspiration pet should be considered in drought assessments due to increasing evapotranspiration china s yellow river basin is located mainly in arid and semi arid regions that suffer severe droughts analyzing the temporal and spatial patterns of droughts in this area and exploring the relative effects of supply and demand on drought occurrence and variations are thus necessary to adapt to increased droughts here we compared three kinds of drought indices including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi and used spei to identify droughts in the yellow river basin during the six decades from 1956 to 2016 we identified droughts and described drought dynamics based on drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent we then evaluated the relative contributions of pre and pet to droughts of varying severity and long term trend as well as the relationships between ocean signals and droughts our results show that most of the basin has undergone progressively drier conditions since the 1950 s this increased drought occurrence has manifested as longer more frequent droughts affecting a larger spatial extent pre was the dominant driver 64 of drought occurrence in an area of 86 of the basin whereas pet was the main driver 55 in the remaining 14 of the basin however changes in pet contributed more than pre to drought variation i e long term spei trends in about 60 of the area and effects of pet increased during severer droughts due to the intensive interaction between soil moisture and atmospheric water demand in highly arid conditions physically droughts were closely related to several ocean signals such as the multivariate enso index mei the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo and the arctic oscillation index ao at different time scales understandings of drought dynamics their physical mechanisms and the effects of pre and pet on droughts of varying severity are essential for water resource management especially in arid regions keywords meteorological drought drought event standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index ocean signals 1 introduction drought is a common natural hazard and there is no universally accepted criterion for drought occurrence due to its complex senses in different research communities or applications a simple but concise definition for drought is periods when the supply of water fails to meet water demands ault 2020 redmond 2002 wilhite and glantz 1985 and drought is different from water scarcity which can be influenced by local water management van loon and van lanen 2013 so droughts are inevitable and harmful to ecological and socioeconomic systems ahmadalipour et al 2020 van loon et al 2016b during the last two decades an average of 71 6 million people per year was affected by global drought related disasters and direct economic losses have been valued at 65 3 billion per year ifrc 2019 such devastating impacts require that droughts especially meteorological droughts the origin of other droughts be intensively studied american meteorological society 1997 van loon et al 2016a moreover because the regional supply and demand for moisture have changed greatly because of climate change and socioeconomic development alfieri et al 2018 dai 2013 understanding drought dynamics and the effects of changing supply and demand on drought occurrence is crucial to risk management the identification of droughts based on specific indicators lays the groundwork for drought assessments american meteorological society 1997 mishra and singh 2010 and indicators from a supply demand perspective are significant in the context of global warming dai 2011 stahle 2020 trenberth et al 2013 several indices have been developed to identify droughts by tracking the departure of drought related variables from their historical norms dai 2011 gibbs and maher 1967 mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 van rooy 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 among them the palmer drought severity index pdsi rainfall deciles standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei are commonly used proxies of meteorological drought pdsi and spei have been widely used because they account for the combined effects of water supply precipitation pre and demand potential evapotranspiration pet rather than precipitation alone changing water demands promotes drought by increasing the vapor pressure deficit and evapotranspiration under atmospheric warming dai 2011 recent studies have also noticed and analyzed the effects of warming on droughts including the attendant soil moisture deficit tree mortality and streamflow reduction brodribb et al 2018 naumann et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 samaniego et al 2018 sun et al 2019 for example martin et al 2020 found that warming increases drought severity by decreasing runoff efficiency a fivefold increase in the frequency of tree mortality events in the southwestern united states is predicted for 4 c of warming adams et al 2009 zhou et al 2019b have also highlighted the increasing negative compound effects of high vapor pressure deficit and low soil moisture on vegetation productivity and terrestrial carbon uptake given these influences of warming on drought occurrence especially those severe droughts causing tree mortality two major questions stand out 1 to what extent does pet affect drought identification compared to pre and 2 does this effect differ among droughts of varying severity some studies have used pre as the main variable determining drought onset duration termination and intensity based on the assumptions that the variability of pre is higher than that of other variables affecting the water balance and that these variables are relatively constant vicente serrano et al 2010 however by theoretical and observational analyses hu and willson 2000 showed that pdsi responds equally well to similar magnitude changes in temperature and precipitation david et al 2007 found that the effects of warming were offset by increased precipitation in parts of the united states whereas more spatially extensive severe to extreme droughts occurred in areas not receiving increased precipitation it is therefore necessary to clarify the relative effects of pre and pet on drought occurrence and severity the yellow river is the second and sixth longest river system in china and the world respectively like many other river basins in arid or semi arid areas the yellow river basin yrb faces a tough challenge of drought the climate here has become drier and warmer and this change is expected to aggravate drought risks in this region ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019 drying since the early 1970 s culminated in a severe drought at the end of the 20th century during which a river segment longer than 700 km became drying up chen and mu 2000 liu and zhang 2002 thus research on drought and its driving factors in this region is important for watershed management many studies have analyzed the spatial patterns temporal trends seasonal variation and periodicity of drought in the yrb by employing spi pdsi spei and new integrated drought indices that incorporate multiple observational and remote sensing based meteorological hydrological or ecological variables chang et al 2015 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 ma et al 2015 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019a zhu et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 among them droughts are commonly described according to their duration intensity frequency and spatial extent still a comprehensive analysis of drought evolution from the perspective of each of these aspects is needed sun and ma 2015 showed that temperature exerted a greater influence on drought trends than precipitation on the loess plateau located in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb but relative effects of precipitation and other factors on the different severity of droughts require further examination here we analyzed drought dynamics estimated the relative contributions of pre and pet to droughts of varying severity and long term trend in the yrb and explored underlying physical mechanisms of droughts specifically we first compared several kinds of drought indices before identifying droughts based on spei over six decades from 1956 to 2016 then described drought severity in terms of drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent section 4 1 we analyzed drought dynamics based on these four aspects to explore changing drought characteristics section 4 2 next and perhaps most importantly we estimated the relative contributions of pet and pre to droughts to compare their influence on droughts of varying severity and long term trend section 4 3 lastly we analyzed the relationships between ocean signals and droughts to examine the underlying causes of drought occurrence this study will contribute to a better understanding of drought in the yrb and provides a fresh perspective on the impact of pet on meteorological droughts 2 study area and data the yrb located in north central china extends from 32 10 n 95 53 e to 41 50 n 119 05 e covering a total area of 7 52 105 km2 fig 1 the climate here differs from an arid zone in the northwest to a humid zone in the southeast due to the various topographies and vast extent for example annual precipitation varies from about 100 to 1000 mm and increases from the northwest to the southeast while annual pan evaporation ranges from about 700 to 1800 mm chang et al 2015 influenced by atmospheric circulation and monsoon climate seasonal differentiation is distinct in the yrb with rainy hot summer and dry cold winter zhu et al 2019 to explore drought dynamics in different regions the whole yrb was divided into eight sub basins based on the secondary basin boundary in china http www geodata cn i the source region ii southwest and iii northeast of the upper reaches iv interior drainage areas v north vi south and vii southeast of the middle reaches and viii the lower reaches fig 1 the source region upper middle reaches and lower reaches are situated at the eastern qinghai tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain respectively with altitudes from high to low and the yr flows through them in turn from west to east we used data from 141 meteorological stations in and around the basin to obtain gridded monthly pre and pet datasets for spei calculation daily records of precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity and sunshine duration at each station were collected from the meteorological data set provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn we then calculated daily pet by the penman monteith method using most of the above mentioned meteorological variables as parameters details available in allen et al 1998 then the daily pre and pet records were each summed to obtain monthly data based on the monthly station data and a digital elevation model of the basin obtained from the international scientific data service platform http datamirror csdb cn the anusplin interpolation tool hutchinson and xu 2013 was used to produce 0 1 gridded monthly pre and pet datasets over the entire yrb spanning the period from 1956 to 2016 we also collected actual evapotranspiration et data to calculate other drought indices used to compare with spei given the lack of direct et observations in yrb two sets of modeled et productions were obtained the first dataset et crm is a monthly 0 1 terrestrial et production across china 1982 2017 it is derived from the complementary relationship method and developed by ma et al 2019b the second dataset et gleam is the daily 0 25 et product from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 5a 1980 2020 by martens et al 2017 the period from 1982 to 2016 remained for both datasets and the et gleam product was downscaled to 0 1 to unify the spatial resolutions of other datasets to investigate the physical causes of long term drought variations atmospheric teleconnections with drought were considered kim et al 2019 we collected several ocean signals including the multivariate enso index mei the pacific decadal oscillation index pdo the arctic oscillation index ao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo the nino3 4 the north atlantic oscillation nao and the southern oscillation index soi they are provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration physical sciences laboratory and can be downloaded from https psl noaa gov enso mei and https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries 3 methods 3 1 calculation of spei and other drought indices spei which represents deviations from normal conditions based on the standardized difference between pre and pet is commonly used to identify drought it is calculated as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 the monthly difference between pre and pet eq 1 and their cumulative difference at a particular time scale eq 2 are calculated for each month to obtain a data series 1 d i j pre i j pet i j 2 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i j if j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where pre i j pet i j and d i j are precipitation potential evapotranspiration and their difference mm respectively in a year i and month j x i j k is the cumulative difference in the year i and month j at the k month time scale mm k is the time scale used for different time lags of droughts because water deficits develop over different time scales and thus promote different drought phenomena it is important to associate drought indices with specific time scales for monitoring and water management purposes vicente serrano et al 2010 therefore we calculated the spei series at 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales and conducted all analyses separately for each series then the probability distribution function of the data series f x is estimated and spei can be obtained as the standardized probability values of the data series based on f x eqs 3 4 3 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 4 w 2 ln p p 1 f x if p 0 5 2 ln 1 p p 1 f x if p 0 5 where x is an element in the data series x and f x represents a probability distribution function candidate probability distribution f x is chosen based on its goodness of fit here three common types of distributions log logistic ll generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii p3 distributions were collected for spei calculation from previous studies their goodness of fit in the yrb was evaluated based on kolmogorov smirnov k s anderson darling a d and shapiro wilk s w tests stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 a n d d 3 are constants with respective values of 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 vicente serrano et al 2010 spei values near zero indicate normal conditions i e neither excessively wet nor dry more negative spei values indicate drier conditions while positive spei values indicate wet conditions a specific definition of the drought severity based on spei can be seen in the following section 3 2 other climate indices including standardized precipitation index spi and standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi were also estimated and we compared them with spei to make a more solid drought assessment spi and sedi represent deviations from normal conditions based on the standardized pre and the standardized difference between et and pet respectively we calculated them at 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales following the above procedure for spei in particular gamma and ll distributions were used for spi and sedi respectively according to suggestions from previous studies beguería et al 2014 kim et al 2019 stagge et al 2015 in addition two sets of sedi i e sedi gleam and sedi crm were calculated using et gleam and et crm respectively to reduce the inevitable uncertainties around et products 3 2 drought definition and description here we define drought as any month when spei is below a threshold e g 0 5 and drought events as consecutive months of droughts ma et al 2019a wang et al 2018 if the interval between two droughts is no more than one month we consider them the same event fig 2 we use drought duration intensity frequency and the spatial extent to describe identified drought events duration is defined as the interval months between the onset and end of a drought event intensity is the average spei value during a drought event units of month 1 as with spei more negative values indicate more severe droughts frequency is the proportion of drought months in an entire year and spatial extent is the proportion of drought affected areas within a certain region duration intensity and frequency were analyzed in each grid cell whereas spatial extent was estimated for the entire yrb and its sub basins the mann kendall test was used to analyze changes in the trends of these characteristics mann 1945 and sen s slope method was used to estimate their rates of change gocic and trajkovic 2013 sen 1968 to analyze the similarities and differences between drought characteristics of varying severity we divided drought events into several groups according to their duration intensity and frequency respectively he et al 2020 huopo and jianqi 2015 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 two criteria determined the intervals between groups i they should be consistent with classifications in previous studies for comparison and ii each drought event should be classified into one and only one group and each group should contain at least one drought event detailed information on the groups can be seen in table 1 the group number indicates the severity of the droughts i e droughts in groups 1 and 5 are the least and most severe respectively we also estimated drought severity across the entire yrb each year by summing the monthly spei values of each drought event in a given year to obtain a series of yearly drought values these values were then normalized as 5 nd i d m a x d i d m a x d m i n where nd i and d i are the normalized and yearly drought values of the ith year respectively and d m a x and d m i n are the respective maximum and minimum values of the series of yearly drought values normalized values range from 0 to 1 with larger values indicating more severe droughts 3 3 relative contributions of pet and pre to drought here we quantify the relative contributions of pet and pre to both drought events and drought variations at first following the approach proposed by pederson et al 2013 we used multiple regression to estimate the relative contributions of pet and pre to drought events martin et al 2020 we regressed the time series of spei against the monthly pet and pre z scores multiplied the pet and pre z score time series by the regression coefficients and summed the respective series to approximate the relative forcing by pet and pre this calculation was performed for each grid cell of the study area to obtain the spatial distribution of the variable dominantly affecting drought occurrence to eliminate any disturbances by wet periods we considered only z score time series for periods with original spei values lower than 0 5 moreover because residuals of the multiple regression are assumed to follow a standard normal distribution with an expected value of zero there is no extra error between sum of spei and sum of products of pet or pre with their respective coefficients so rationality of this approach is determined only by performance of the multiple regression and r2 and p value are used to evaluate its goodness of fit fig s1 left to compare the relative contributions of pre and pet to the drought groups based on duration intensity and frequency table 1 we performed a similar regression for each group multiple contribution values are needed for each group to evaluate whether differences between groups are statistically significant and a random sampling method is used in this study to achieve that specifically we randomly extracted a certain number of grid cells from each group to conduct regression and repeated this procedure 1000 times per group then we used one way analysis of variance to determine if the differences in contributions between groups are statistically significant in addition the number of grid cells extracted from each group per round depended on the number of droughts in each group especially it should smaller than the amount of data in the smallest group and was typically around 5 000 in this study secondly we estimate the relative contributions of changes in pet and pre to drought variations using a differential equation this approach as proposed by ding and peng 2020 separates the long term trend of spei into two parts 6 dspei dt s p e i p e t dpet dt s p e i p r e dpre dt where dspei dt dpet dt and dpre dt are the long term trends of spei pet and pre respectively and s p e i p e t and s p e i p r e are the sensitivity coefficients of spei to pet and pre respectively therefore the percentage of each part is supposed to be the relative contribution of change in pet or pre to spei variations long term trends of spei pet and pre were estimated using sen s slope method while sensitivity coefficients of spei to pet and pre were calculated according to the following equation 7 δ s p e i a δ p e t b δ p r e where δ s p e i δ p e t and δ p r e are the interannual variations of time series of spei pet and pre respectively and a and b i e s p e i p e t and s p e i p r e are regression coefficients obtained from multiple regression again r2 and p value are used to evaluate the goodness of fit in regression fig s1 right as for the rationality of this approach we compared the sum of the two parts in eq 6 with the actual spei trend fig s2 3 4 relationships between ocean signals and drought we used the pearson method to calculate correlation coefficients between ocean signals mei pdo ao amo the nino3 4 nao and soi and droughts and explore their relationships based on these correlation coefficients given the interannual or decadal oscillations of ocean signals multi decadal time scales from 10 to 600 months were analyzed in this study the moving average method was used to calculate values of ocean signals and droughts at different time scales two indicators using to represent droughts were the spei series at 12 month time scales spei 12 and the annual area fraction of i2 4 droughts drought intensity falls into groups 2 4 see table 1 identified by mean spei 12 in the yrb following the method in kim et al 2019 we also applied the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis to extract the top three principal components pcs of the spei 12 time series and further analyzed respective relationships between ocean signals and the three pcs at different time scales using pearson method all these analyses mentioned above were conducted in matlab r2020a 4 results 4 1 spei and drought our results show a drying trend in the yrb during the six decades of the study period especially in the southwest and east central areas fig 3 average annual spei values over the entire region decreased significantly p 0 09 0 11 0 05 and 0 02 at the 1 3 6 and 12 month time scales respectively at rates of 0 008 to 0 003 yr 1 spatially about 76 of the studied areas showed decreasing spei trends and the rates of decrease were significant p 0 05 in 42 of those areas these areas were mainly to the south of the junction between the source region and the upper reaches of the yrb and in the east central parts of the middle reaches of the areas showing increasing spei trends 24 only 10 showed significant increase rates these areas were primarily in the north and northwest of the upper reaches and dominating the lower reaches based on these spei results we identified and described drought events according to their duration intensity frequency and spatial extent almost 55 of the drought events were shorter than three months and 60 were of mild intensity 1 month 1 in about 13 of the years analyzed one or more drought events accounted for at least eight months of drought fig 4 a considering drought intensity frequency and spatial extent the most severe droughts occurred in 1965 1966 1972 1987 1997 2002 and 2013 fig 4b relatively severe droughts occurred almost every ten years and were characterized by different durations and intensities for example the 1997 2002 drought was the longest whereas the 1965 1966 drought was shorter but more intense differences are also evident between different time scales for instance droughts identified from the 1 and 3 month spei trends were more severe than those identified from the 12 month trend in 1979 2010 and 2013 fig 4b more drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month trends were of shorter duration than those identified from the 6 and 12 month trends the proportions of low and high frequency drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month trends were lower than those identified from the 6 and 12 month trends whereas the proportion of intermediate frequency events was greater in the 1 and 3 month trends fig 4a we also compared spei with other drought indices including spi sedi gleam and sedi crm with spei in two ways a correlations between monthly spei and spi sedi gleam sedi crm time series at each grid cell fig s3 and b similarities in their annual variations fig s4 results showed that spei is significantly related to spi sedi gleam and sedi crm at 1 3 6 and 12 month in almost all regions with average pearson s correlation coefficients of 0 91 0 72 and 0 70 respectively spatially spei had a closer relation with spi in southeast yrb than that in the northwest while it had closer relations with sedi gleam and sedi crm in the northwest the goodness of fit for the probability distributions of all drought indices had been tested most of the rejection frequencies for the tested distributions were lower than 5 more details can be seen in table s1 and s2 as for spei the goodness of fit of three probability distributions log logistic generalized extreme value and pearson type iii has been tested and pearson type iii distribution had lower rejection rates than the other two in the yrb so it was used in this study to calculate spei 4 2 changes in drought duration intensity frequency and spatial extent respective temporal changes of drought events in duration intensity and frequency for each gridded yrb were tested in this part as shown in fig 5 drought events in more than half of the yrb became longer 61 of the basin less intense 65 and more frequent 71 during 1956 2016 overall the increased frequency of drought events was more obvious than changes in duration and intensity because the larger areas showed significant trends although drought events were more intense in parts of the basin with decreasing spei trends these areas were relatively small they were located mainly southwest of the yellow river source region the spatial extent area fraction of drought affected areas in the entire basin increased at a rate of 0 10 0 22 per year fig 6 dominated by increases in areas affected by droughts of medium duration 4 6 months mild intensity 1 month 1 and moderate to high frequency 30 fig 7 a specifically significant increases in drought affected areas occurred in the yellow river source region fig 7b southwest of the upper reaches fig 7c and in most of the middle reaches fig 7f and fig 7g no significant changes in spatial extent occurred in the northeast of the upper reaches fig 7d in the interior drainage areas fig 7e and in the southeast of the middle reaches fig 7h in the lower reaches however significant increases and decreases in the spatial extents of different drought groups offset each other fig 7i 4 3 contributions of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to droughts precipitation pre exerted a more important control on drought events than potential evapotranspiration pet fig 8 left although the role of pet increased with increasing drought severity fig 9 moreover changes in pet contributed more to the long term spei trend than pet fig 8 right when 50 was used as the threshold between pre 50 and pet dominated 50 the occurrence of drought events was driven dominantly by pre in about 86 area of the yrb average contribution of 64 whereas pet was the dominant driver average contribution of 55 in the remaining 14 of the basin fig 8 left drought variations i e long term spei trends were mainly affected by changes in pet in about 60 area of the yrb average contribution of 72 while pre was the main driver in the other area about 40 of the basin with an average contribution of 69 fig 8 right we then used the ratio of pre to pet contributions as an indicator of the dominant driver of drought among drought events of varying severity table 1 as shown in fig 9 the ratios were decreasing they differed significantly within most of the groups which means pet contributed relatively more to severe droughts than it to the less intense ones significantly fig 9 moreover results mentioned above differed between droughts identified from the spei trends at different time scales for example pre had larger contributions to long time scale droughts fig 8g h and fig 9d than it to short time scale ones fig 8a b and fig 9a and thus the contributions of pet were opposite pre became less important and pet more important with increasing drought severity in all duration intensity and frequency groups derived from the 3 and 6 month spei time series fig 9b c however these relationships were not as straightforward for droughts identified from the 1 and 12 month time series the role of pre was strengthened relative to the 3 and 6 month data in the most severe drought groups of duration in 1 month data fig 9a and intensity in 12 month data fig 9d 4 4 teleconnections between ocean signals and drought as fig 10 shown the time series of mean spei 12 in the yrb was significantly related to the 12 month moving average of monthly multivariate enso index mei pearson s r 0 29 p 0 001 and severer droughts here which meant drought intensity fell into group 2 4 identified by spei 12 were also closely associated with the positive phases of enso which indicate el niño occurrence as for relationships of ocean signals with spei 12 and its three main principal components pcs at different time scales from 10 to 600 months we found that spei 12 and its pcs were significantly related to different ocean signals at different time scales fig s5 in general spei 12 and pcs had closer relationships with nao amo ao at more time scales than that with mei pdo nino3 4 and soi specifically spei 12 and pc3 were positively associated with nao while negatively associated with amo ao mei and pdo contrary to spei 12 and pc3 pc1 and pc2 had opposite relationships with these signals on the other hand spei 12 and pc1 had closer connections with nao and amo at shorter time scales than that with ao pdo and mei and closer connections of pc2 and pc3 with these ocean signals appeared simultaneously as spei 12 and pc1 except for nao 5 discussion 5 1 droughts of longer duration higher frequency and greater spatial extent the yellow river basin has become drier under the changing climate and droughts have become more severe and frequent ma et al 2020 here we concretized drought severity using multiple aspects of drought and found that although drought intensity did not significantly change in most areas drought events became longer more frequent and more spatially extensive during the study period figs 5 and 6 our results are consistent with zhu et al 2019 they showed a general drying tendency in this region with meteorological and hydrological droughts becoming longer and more spatially extensive however our analysis did not capture some shorter term fluctuations because we focused on the general trend during 1956 2016 for example wang et al 2018 divided the period 1961 2015 into three stages and found that both drought intensity and frequency increased from stage 1 1961 1996 to stage 2 1997 2002 and then decreased during stage 3 2003 2015 considering that the most severe drought occurred during stage 2 fig 4b it is reasonable that drought events were the most intense during that time our results showed that the increasing duration frequency and spatial extent of drought events apply only to drying areas of the yrb including the source region southwest of the upper reaches most of the middle reaches and not to wetter areas such as northeast of the upper reaches and the lower reaches fig 3 however drying extents are partly inconsistent among previous studies for example the dry gets drier and wet gets wetter ddww paradigm is popular and widely used to summarize the expected trends of the global hydrological cycle chia et al 2009 feng and zhang 2015 but we found the relationship between aridity index the ratio between pre and pet and long term spei trends in the yrb is against the ddww paradigm yang et al 2019 and presents an opposite pattern that dry gets wetter and wet gets drier fig s6 zhu et al 2016 reported that all yrb sub basins are drying but found less drastic drying trends in the source region southwest of the upper reaches and the lower reaches these differences may result from the various indicators used to identify drought some studies included only precipitation whereas others accounted for meteorological hydrological ecological and socioeconomic variables chang et al 2015 wang et al 2020a indeed meteorological hydrological agricultural and comprehensive droughts have unique spatial patterns and temporal trends and the ddww paradigm is more useful when only precipitation driven drought indices are applied yang et al 2019 5 2 increasing contributions of potential evapotranspiration to severe droughts under global warming and changing atmospheric water demands the importance of pet to drought should not be ignored dai 2013 stahle 2020 in this study we quantified the relative contributions of pre and pet to meteorological drought given the variability of pre it is not surprising that pre was the dominant driver of drought events in most of the studied areas fig 8 left however drought variation i e long term spei trend was mainly affected by the change in pet in about 60 area of the yrb fig 8 right and by classifying drought events according to their duration intensity and frequency we showed that the relative contribution of pet to severe droughts was always larger than that to mild ones fig 9 in addition to global warming this phenomenon may be associated with interrelated physical processes zhou et al 2019b during dry periods soil moisture is lower because of inadequate recharge from pre decreased soil moisture reduces evapotranspiration and causes a higher atmospheric water demand pet by reducing evaporative cooling and near surface humidity increased pet in turn promotes evapotranspiration on land and accelerates the drying of soils miralles et al 2014b yin et al 2014 this positive feedback between decreasing soil moisture and increasing pet exacerbates drought conditions and amplifies the importance of pet during more severe droughts global warming has also been shown to play a significant role in the occurrence of extreme drought events such as the mega droughts and consequently increased tree mortality and wildfires in southwestern north america since the early 2000 s and this kind of drought is called global change type drought adams et al 2009 breshears et al 2005 brodribb et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 furthermore the negative effects of extreme heat and dryness events on continental productivity are larger when compounded and the likelihood of such compound events is expected only to increase in future decades alizadeh et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b although we focused only on meteorological droughts our study highlights the increasing importance of pet in extreme drought conditions it confirms the interaction between and the compound effects of pre and pet 5 3 physical mechanism of drought from a view of ocean signals the atmospheric responses to ocean signals play a significant role in the variations of regional precipitation temperature and therefore drought kim et al 2019 miralles et al 2014a so teleconnections between ocean signals and drought might explain drought occurrence and the long term trend of spei from a physical perspective at a large scale wang et al 2020a our analysis highlighted the important role of el niño southern oscillation enso events on drought occurrence which is agreed with previous studies when the sea surface temperature sst in the eastern tropical pacific rises el niño occurs and weakens the east asian summer monsoon so there is no adequate water vapor being conveyed to the yrb and drought forms la niña which occurs when the sst is declining is opposite to el niño and always leads to floods besides ocean signals also contribute very much to the long term spei variations for example wang et al 2020a found strong effects of ocean signals including enso ao and pdo on drought evolution in the yrb by the cross wavelet transform approach kim et al 2019 illustrated seasonal teleconnection between long term enso and the general trend of sedi drought index calculated by et deficits over the contiguous united states they further revealed the top three principal components pcs of the sedi time series were significantly related to amo mean air temperature of the study area and pdo respectively in this study we found spei and its pcs were significantly associated with different ocean signals at different time scales fig s5 and they had closer relationships with nao amo ao at more time scales than with mei and pdo which is partly consistent with wang et al 2020a however the relationships of spei and its pcs with these ocean signals are complex in terms of direction positive or negative of relationship and time scale in which closer relationship appears in summary long term ocean signals impact the spei time series but the interaction between ocean signals and different periodicities of signals make their relationships more complex seung et al 2017 so more physical exploration and explanation for drought are needed in future research 5 4 implications and uncertainties in the yellow river basin drought represents the biggest threat to water resource availability which is critical to ecological and social development therefore understanding drought dynamics and the relative contributions of pre and pet to drought occurrence and variations is important to regional water resource management and regulation the increasing durations frequencies and spatial extents of droughts imply that longer droughts will affect larger areas so effective mitigation measures will require spatially extensive long term efforts such as well organized water planning and regulation based on reservoirs dams or planting crops with lower water consumption considering global warming and the grave consequences of extreme droughts on socio ecological systems such measures should be taken as early as possible to alleviate water stress and prevent intensive interactions between soil water and pet during severe droughts droughts are complex phenomena and we chose to use spei alone as the drought indicator in this study for two reasons 1 spei accounts for the effects of both pre and pet variability on drought occurrence which is more reasonable under the warming climate and 2 spei estimates water deficits surpluses across multiple time scales and can thus be used to analyze droughts with different time lags which have varied implications ault 2020 it is nonetheless inevitable that our analysis included some uncertainties although accounting for the atmospheric water demand is one of the great strengths of spei the choice of the indicator used to represent that demand remains under debate beguería et al 2014 showed that using pet rather than actual evapotranspiration is advantageous to calculate spei they recommended the penman monteith equation for pet estimation because it includes more comprehensive physical mechanisms fisher et al 2011 although we have followed their suggestion spei trends should be calculated using different methods of pet estimation to compare their differences in spatial patterns and temporal trends when used for drought identification indeed some studies have shown that the penman monteith equation might overestimate changes in pet under global warming because of its incorrect assumption that all surfaces have a fixed resistance for example pet and the extent of dry land based on the aridity index defined as pet pre are reduced when a co2 responsive surface resistance is used to improve the original penman monteith equation greve et al 2019 roderick et al 2015 furthermore droughts can occur at monthly seasonal yearly or decadal scales drought characteristics may vary at different temporal scales this study showed results at 1 3 6 and 12 month scales although their general trends and spatial patterns are roughly consistent our results show discrepancies among the identified drought events and the relative contributions of pre and pet for example drought events identified from the 1 and 3 month spei have greater proportions of shorter duration and intermediate frequency than those identified from the 6 and 12 month spei fig 4a these discrepancies are at least partly consistent with the properties of short term lag and long term lag droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 have pointed out that drought series identified from shorter time scales are of short duration and high frequency while the droughts identified from longer time scales show a lower frequency with longer duration as for the contribution discrepancies of pre and pet to droughts identified from different time scales figs 8 and 9 more exploration is needed such as discussion on the difference between accumulated variations of pre and pet the difference between spei and other drought indices results from the spatial discrepancy between pet and et for example the relationship between spei and spi is closer in southeast yrb than that in the northwest and this is consistent with fig 8 left that pet was the dominant driver of droughts in the northwest instead of pre although the general variation of spei is similar to that of spi values of the two indices differ in periods during which both pre and pet were higher than normal conditions for example there was more 13 1 rainfall than normal conditions and record breaking warming in 2016 yan et al 2020 and spi is larger than spei this year due to its neglect of the increasing pet contrary to spi relationships between spei and sedi are closer in the northwest than in the southeast given the strong relationship between et and pre in arid to sub humid regions and the strong relationship between et and pet in humid regions it s not strange that spei is highly related to sedi in the drier northwest than wetter southeast beguería et al 2014 also considered sedi an unreliable index due to its high frequency of et pet 0 in the humid region which is harmful to probability distribution fitting moreover correlation coefficients between spei and sedi are lowest in the southwest resulting from the complex hydrological cycle in qinghai tibet plateau where pre is not the major source of et moreover our analysis focused only on meteorological droughts as discussed above drought characteristics and the effects of driving factors may vary among drought types and indicators along with the processes of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological to socioeconomic droughts huang et al 2017 van loon et al 2012 furthermore moisture and heat conditions differ between arid and humid regions more research should thus focus on more critical regions and on multiple types of droughts to examine the robustness of existing results and obtain more universal findings at last it is noteworthy that drought in the yrb may also be influenced by anthropogenic factors besides climatological and meteorological drivers due to intense human activities here such as afforestation and the use of dams and reservoirs for controlling water aghakouchak et al 2021 afforestation affects drought by intensifying the water cycle thus increasing pre and et but decreasing soil moisture and runoff li et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 dams and reservoirs alter the local climate and improve water resource utilization performance which results in a decline in runoff and an exacerbation of hydrological drought downstream wang et al 2019 further research hence is needed for understanding the role of the human in drought formation and propagation due to its complicated effects on hydro meteorological processes 6 conclusions with climate change the effects of climatic warming on drought occurrence and variations are increasingly significant we compared several drought indices before using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to analyze drought dynamics duration intensity frequency and spatial extent in the yellow river basin china over six decades from 1956 to 2016 then estimated the relative effects of precipitation pre and potential evapotranspiration pet on drought occurrence and variations using multiple regression approaches and explored underlying physical causes of droughts formation from a view of ocean signals our results show that most areas in the yellow river basin have been drying since the 1950 s and increasing drought trends have manifested as longer more frequent drought events affecting larger areas pre was the main driver of drought events and contributed about 64 to drought occurrence in about 86 of the area in contrast the change in pet was the dominant driver 72 for drought variations in about 60 of the area moreover the effect of pet was larger in more severe drought events than it in the less severe ones as for the physical mechanism of droughts ocean signals such as the multivariate enso index mei the north atlantic oscillation nao the atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo and the arctic oscillation index ao had complicated impacts on drought occurrence and variation in general our study highlights the increasing influence of pet during extreme drought conditions and demonstrates the interaction between and
