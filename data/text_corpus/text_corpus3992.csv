19960,greywater recycling systems designed for high quality applications such as hand washing must deliver microbially safe and aesthetically acceptable water under the challenging operating conditions present where such systems are needed most urgently as chlorination is the most popular strategy for reducing bacterial concentrations in greywater understanding chlorination in the context of disruptive and challenging operation is essential to designing robust treatment in this study we have examined how disruptions through overall increased loading interrupted aeration and increased ammonia loading have impacted the chlorine demand of the water produced by a greywater recycling system we also presented concentrations of significant chemicals that contributed to this chlorine demand the results indicate that a 1 d period with 8 times 8x the normal design loading produced a peak chlorine demand of 0 74 mg cl2 l which is approximately double the baseline value while this chlorine demand can be overcome by adding more chlorine tests involving disruptions in aeration or feeding additional ammonia into the bioreactor produced much greater increases 30x the risks of increased chlorine demand on microbial safety can be overcome by limiting ammonia inputs to the system providing backup systems to ensure sufficient aeration or through additional anti bacterial measures that do not depend on maintaining residual chlorine graphical abstract image 1 keywords permeate quality hand washing water decentralized chlorination biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi gravity driven membrane gdm treatment 1 introduction decentralized biological greywater treatment systems able to reliably recycle greywater for high quality applications such as hand washing promise a valuable opportunity to expand global access to safe hygiene such systems could be most impactful in parts of the world where access to any water is limited and the costs of centralized water treatment and distribution is economically prohibitive unfortunately existing greywater research has largely focused on delivering water for less demanding applications such as toilet flushing shi et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 or irrigation busgang et al 2018 recent research has specifically investigated post treatment technologies that are able to improve effluent water quality for higher quality applications such as hand washing water or showering dubowski et al 2020 gassie and englehardt 2017 nguyen et al 2017 ziemba et al 2019 2020 these works have demonstrated the feasibility of decentralized and self contained systems appropriately sized for one home community installation or medical facility that will be filled initially with water and then repeatedly treat this water provide it for washing or showering recollect it and repeat this cycle what remains to be explored is how challenging or disruptive operation might affect water quality and in turn microbial safety the small scale of decentralized systems can make them sensitive to variability in loading the dirt soap skin and other materials added to the greywater in terms of amount and composition the application of decentralized systems in remote environments or areas with unreliable electricity access may impose additional challenges such as the inability to quickly replace broken components or frequent power interruptions understanding the implications of challenging and disruptive operating conditions on system performance is crucial to implement safe and effective biological greywater recycling for high quality applications critical analysis of current greywater technologies in practice has concluded that biologically based treatments can be the most environmentally friendly in terms of chemical requirements and energy demand while also providing high quality effluent with small footprint requirements boyjoo et al 2013 these advantages have caused biological treatment processes to become broadly accepted in the greywater treatment field pidou et al 2007 but the importance of understanding how different greywater treatment systems perform under variable conditions has also been noted ghunmi et al 2011 biological systems may exhibit reduced ability relative to physio chemical systems to adapt quickly to changes in operation or environment and may require specific conditions such as nutrient balance or minimum oxygen concentrations any type of operational disruptions increased loading altered composition of loading and interrupted aeration can result in reduced biological activity and accumulation of undesirable materials within the system this accumulation can create an unpleasant color odor or feel of the water ineffective hands cannot get clean or unsafe ineffective bacteria control experience for the user while the factors that contribute to a negative user perception are evident how disruptions affect microbial safety may be more complex the most common form of greywater disinfection is chlorination boyjoo et al 2013 chlorination is a particularly effective disinfection strategy because maintaining a free chlorine residual within a water system combats bacterial growth during storage studies conducted with a variety of greywater treatment technologies have concluded from results that a free chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l achieves acceptable anti bacteria control abdel kader 2013 winward et al 2008 ziemba et al 2019 maintaining a chlorine residual in the treated water requires overcoming the losses of chlorine to volatilization externally driven reactions e g photoreduction and the chlorine demand of the water to which the chlorine is added chlorine demand consists of all chemical constituents within the water that would rapidly react with chlorine ammonia nitrite and general organic carbon compounds can all exhibit significant chlorine demand throughout this study the term ammonia refers to the combination of ammonia and ammonium species while the chlorine demand of ammonia and nitrite can be estimated stoichiometrically we are not aware of any study that has measured the chlorine demand of organic materials in treated greywater our limited understanding of how disruptive operation contributes to chemical accumulation increases chlorine demand and opposes the efficacy of microbial control through chlorination represents a significant knowledge gap that prevents us from developing robust biological greywater recycling systems one important task for the further development of greywater recycling systems for high quality applications like handwashing will be the definition of quality targets over the past years there has been an increasing number of water reuse frameworks targeting lower quality reuse applications such as irrigation or toilet flushing however as yet only the iso 30500 standard for non sewered sanitation systems explicitly includes handwashing as an application for recycled water though it does not include recommendations or requirements specifically related to chlorinating systems microbial safety for high quality applications will require log removal performance for greywater treatment similar to drinking water treatment iso 30500 who 2017 a better understanding of the factors affecting the chlorine demand in greywater recycling systems designed for high quality applications can inform the developers of new or revised water reuse frameworks in the establishment of quality targets for greywater reuse systems that include a final chlorination step the impacts of disruptive operation were examined in this study using a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi which has been developed specifically for decentralized greywater recycling k√ºnzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 ziemba et al 2020 inside the bambi treatment is conducted by bacteria either in the bulk liquid phase or in a biofilm that develops on an immersed ultrafiltration membrane module and within a granular activated carbon gac filter that follows the membrane gentle aeration directly below the membrane module promotes aerobic conversion in external areas of the biofilm bambi reactors operating at steady state were subject to a series of 1 d disruptive events that could be encountered in practice i an increase in loading ii an increase in ammonia loading iii a loss of aeration the chlorine demand of the produced water was measured or stoichiometrically estimated from relevant measured compounds before during and after each disruption increasing aeration during increased loading has also been tested as a potential mitigation strategy by understanding the mechanisms and the magnitude of each potential disruption we can make informed design decisions for biological systems that utilize chlorination and help advance decentralized hand washing water recycling into the real and disruptive world 2 methods and materials 2 1 greywater treatment system the flow of water through the greywater recycling system is illustrated in fig 1 a concentrated nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing greywater was prepared and stored at 4 c with 10 rpm mixing under normal operation a total of 3 l d of the concentrated feed was pumped into the bambi in a series of 40 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day the daily loading of the 3 l of concentrated synthetic feed represents the loading soap skin material on hands that would be introduced to a total of 60 l of water during hand washing 1 5 l per hand washing event the bambi itself consisted of a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra ontario canada featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany placed into a 52 l wastewater tank fig 1 the operating volume of the bambi was approximately 42 l the membrane was positioned in the tank such that the top of the membrane matched the water level aeration was provided directly below the membrane module with a pair of aeration tubes that created bubbles approximately 3 4 mm in diameter air curtain 90 cm guangdong risheng shenzhen china under normal operation the rate of aeration was 6 l min this aeration creates regions within the bambi that permit aerobic processes such as nitrification and anaerobic processes such as denitrification within the same simple reactor no additional pressure was supplied to drive water through the membrane beyond the pressure head of water on the feed side of the membrane water that passed through the biofilm and through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir and then pumped to the clean water storage tank at 5 min intervals water entering the storage tank first passed vertically down through a 6 l granular activated carbon gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston ma usa submerged in the storage tank the gac was a mixture of new gac 25 combined with a balance of gac that had been previously used in a similar greywater treatment system for 6 months after passing through the gac the water entered the larger storage tank and was then returned to the bambi by an overflow the overflow maintained a constant volume of 17 5 l of water in the storage tank including water in the gac the passage of water from the clean water storage tank back to the bambi represented water that would be available for hand washing in an operational system extra water was pumped out of the clean water storage tank and discharged to compensate for the concentrated greywater feed and maintain a constant system volume though the standard loading corresponded to 60 l of daily water usage water was recirculated through the system at approximately the rate of membrane flux 120 l d the feeding permeate and water removal pumps were activated using automation software codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france aeration was controlled manually by a rotameter analyt mtc colmar france the bambi was initially started with tap water inoculated with 0 5 l of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and operated for approximately 30 d before stable performance was achieved 2 2 synthetic hand washing water feed the recipe for the concentrated synthetic hand washing water feed is presented in table 1 this recipe is based on the expected inputs to hand washing greywater and the nutrient balancing strategy presented previously ziemba et al 2018 in this study the nutrient demands were based on the estimate that 1 3 of the carbon in assimilated substrate will be converted to new biomass and that the production of this biomass will require nutrient balancing this yield of 1 3 biomass carbon substrate carbon was reduced from the yield of 1 which was used previously and we have also removed kaolin as an ingredient ziemba et al 2018 the concentrated feed water was prepared in tap water the tap water in z√ºrich has been measured as containing 0 7 mg l n 5 mg l s 50 mg l ca 1 2 mg l k 7 mg l mg 0 005 mg l p fe zn and 0 0005 mg l mn and cu city of z√ºrich 2016 mo and co were assumed to be zero the specific values provided in table 1 reflect what must be added to the tap water to get the desired nutrient content the humic acid was a naturally collected material 53680 sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa all other chemicals were reagent grade or better diluting the 20x concentrated synthetic hand washing water to 1x strength as used in the system contributed an organic carbon concentration of 130 mg toc l and an ammonia concentration of 3 1 mg n l 2 3 disruption experiments three types of disruptions were examined table 2 consisting of increasing loading scenarios 1 4 turning off the aeration scenario 5 or changing the composition of the feed scenario 6 increasing the loading was accomplished by increasing the amount of feed concentrate pumped into the bambi and removing more treated water to maintain constant volume the aeration flow rate was set to zero as a disruption the composition was changed by replacing the standard synthetic greywater feed with a feed that was modified with a spike of 1000 mg l nh4 n in the form of nh4cl this spike in the feed delivered an additional 3 g of nh4 n over the course of the disruption which corresponds to the amount of ammonia that would be released from the hydrolysis of 400 ml of fresh human urine udert et al 2006 the total ammonium dosing during the disruption was increased to approximately 17x the standard feed this corresponds after dilution to an ammonia concentration of 53 1 mg n l in the diluted feed compared to the standard 3 1 mg n l manually increasing aeration was examined as a disruption mitigation strategy for increased loading no aeration 4x loading with 2x aeration 8x loading 8x loading with 2x aeration and 17x ammonia loading disruption experiments were conducted in the same system in that order the system was operated for a minimum of 5 d with standard loading between experiments the 4x loading experiment was conducted in a second bambi system of identical configuration 2 4 chlorine demand measurement measurement procedures for chlorine demand were based on the standard methods 2350 for oxidant demand requirement protocol apha 2017 chlorine demand free glassware was utilized in all chlorine demand measurements glassware and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined lids were first cleaned with soap and water then soaked in chlorine solution 100 mg cl2 l free chlorine in de ionized water di for 12 h and dried at 60 c each measurement was prepared in a total volume of 31 ml in an 45 ml processing vial sample was added to each processing vial such that the sample represented dilutions of 1 in 2 1 in 10 1 in 20 or 1 in 50 of the total volume of 31 ml phosphate buffer final concentrations added 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2 3 g l kh2po4 nacl final concentration added 0 1 g l free chlorine final concentration added 2 mg cl2 l and di water to reach final volume were added the chlorine was added last to the processing vial by slowly pipetting the chlorine into the liquid phase after all other reagents were added and the vial was mixed the chlorine stock was stored in the dark at 4 c and returned immediately when not in use each processing vial was then gently mixed swirled by hand for about 10 s and then slowly inverted 5 times the contents were gently poured into a 23 ml incubation vial and capped leaving no air space the incubation vials were then incubated in the dark for 12 18 h at 20 c the final free chlorine was measured using hach kits lck 310 hach loveland colorado usa employing the dpd n n diethylparaphenylenediamine method samples were processed in triplicate and triplicate control vials were prepared for each measurement using the same procedure without the addition of sample chlorine demand was calculated by subtracting the free chlorine concentration in the sample from the average free chlorine concentration in the control and multiplying by the dilution of the sample the dilutions utilized for each sample were based on the estimated chlorine demand of previous baseline measurements 0 5 1 mg l cl2 demand and the concentration of ammonia in the sample the chlorine demand of ammonia was estimated 1 mg n l 7 6 mg cl2 l demand based on the stoichiometric oxidation of ammonia through monochloramine to n2 gas pressley et al 1972 dilutions were also based on maintaining a much higher chlorine concentration in the incubation vial compared to the ammonia concentration so the relationship between chlorine demand and ammonia nitrogen was preserved 1 mg n l 7 6 mg cl2 l demand the minimum incubation ratio utilized in this study was 50 mg cl2 mg ammonia with the exception of the 24 h data point in the experiment where the aeration was turned off scenario 5 this sample was not processed correctly at a ratio of 22 mg cl2 mg ammonia which may have resulted in an under measurement of chlorine demand chlorine demand was not accurately measured directly during the disruptive period of the experiment with increased ammonia loading scenario 6 because it became too difficult to control for factors that can affect accurate chlorine measurements ph chloride concentrations processing duration signal strength at measurement chlorine demand during this period has been estimated from the ammonia concentration 2 5 dissolved organic carbon doc assimilable organic carbon aoc anions and ammonia all samples for doc and aoc measurements were collected and processed in glass vials muffled at 450 c for 12 h and capped with ptfe lined lids doc was measured using an infrared detector calibrated to organic carbon standards doc labor dr huber karlsruhe germany aoc measurement procedure was based on an established protocol hammes and egli 2005 aoc samples 50 ml were first filtered through prewashed 50 ml of di water 0 2 Œºm polyethersulfone filters pall port washington new york usa trace elements fe solution and buffer solution were added in accordance with prest et al 2016 1 ml of a diverse bacteria inoculum was added as previously described ziemba et al 2018 the samples were mixed and then distributed equally into triplicate 45 ml vials capped incubated for 3 5 days at 30 c on a dark 150 rpm shaker and measured for total cell count tcc tcc was measured with a flow cytometer cytoflex bechman coulter brea california usa and sybr green i stain life technologies eugene or usa growth during incubation quantified as tcc was used to calculate aoc using the equation 1 Œºg aoc 107 cells hammes and egli 2005 ion chromatography metrohm 881 herisau switzerland was used to measure the nitrite and nitrate in the samples each with a minimum quantification limit of 0 2 mg n l ammonia was measured using hach kits lck 304 hach love land colorado usa with a minimum quantification limit of 0 05 mg n l 3 results 3 1 increasing loading without changing composition 3 1 1 increasing loading produced a small increase in chlorine demand aoc and doc but not ammonia the 4x increase in loading during a 1 d period scenario 1 did not produce any clear increase in chlorine demand the average chlorine demand observed during the 4x feeding experiment was 0 35 mg cl2 l which is comparable to the baseline values observed in the 8x feeding experiment fig 2 a in contrast the 8x increase in loading during a 1 d period scenario 3 produced a peak chlorine demand of 0 74 mg cl2 l 0 16 standard deviation this peak was almost twice the average baseline chlorine demand measured before and following this disruption starting at t1 d of 0 4 mg cl2 l doc aoc ph and chemical concentrations were measured in water following treatment with the bambi permeate and after the gac filter gac to better understand the relative contributions of each step the 4x feeding experiment scenario 1 produced a doc peak in the permeate at t1 d after 1 d at the end of the disruption of 1 7 mg l which is slightly higher than the baseline average of 1 15 mg l 0 1 standard deviation the 8x feeding experiment scenario 3 produced a doc peak at t0 5 d halfway into the disruption of 3 3 mg l which is almost 3 times the baseline value before the increased feeding increases in doc in the water following gac were less pronounced baseline values for aoc in the 4x and 8x feeding experiments were 36 5 5 8 mg l average standard deviation and 32 1 11 mg l respectively fig 2e a peak value of 80 1 9 mg l was observed in the 4x feed experiment scenario 1 at t0 5 d halfway into the increased loading period yet this is the only data point that appeared to be higher than the baseline the 8x feeding experiment scenario 3 produced a more pronounced increase to a peak of 179 4 5 mg l and a gradual return to baseline at t3 d all ammonia measurements were below quantification 0 05 mg n l for the 4x and 8x loading experiments increasing loading generally reduced ph values and these reductions were more significant in the permeate 0 4 ph units relative to the effluent of the gac 0 1 ph unit 3 1 2 increasing aeration mitigated increases in aoc from increased loading but did not mitigate increases in chlorine demand or doc fig 2 b d and f display changes in chlorine demand aoc and doc following increases of 4x or 8x in feed loading combined with 2x increases in aeration during the disruption period scenarios 2 and 4 respectively increases in aeration did not produce different responses in chlorine demand or doc the maximum chlorine demand value achieved in scenarios 4 with 8x feed and 2x aeration 0 73 mg cl2 l was quite similar to scenario 3 with 8x feed with 1x aeration 0 74 mg cl2 l increasing loading without increasing aeration either clearly increased aoc 8x feeding in scenario 3 or may have increased aoc 4x feeding in scenario 1 when the aeration was increased neither condition resulted in any aoc increases during the disruption period the 8x feeding with increased aeration scenario 4 did produce elevated aoc measurements of 142 Œºg l at t2 d and 68 Œºg l at t2 5 d but this peak is not consistent with position on the experimental timeline expected or observed in other scenarios 3 2 turning off aeration produces large increases in ammonia aoc doc and chlorine demand the increases in chlorine demand aoc doc and ammonia were much greater following a 1 d period of shutting off aeration scenario 5 fig 3 compared to an 8x increase in feeding scenarios 3 and 4 the chlorine demand without aeration increased 30x from the average baseline value of 0 6 mg cl2 l to a peak likely greater than the measured value of 20 mg cl2 l this peak measurement was not conducted properly and likely underestimated the true chlorine demand in the sample because the ratio of ammonia cl2 in the incubation vials was not correct measured chlorine demand values are generally higher across the experimental timeline than what would be estimated stoichiometrically from the concentration of ammonia aoc concentrations increased almost 20x during the disruption to a peak value of 1947 Œºg l 92 standard deviation from a pre disruption baseline of 100 Œºg l doc concentrations increased in permeate and reached a peak of 17 mg l up from a baseline concentration of 2 4 mg l 0 52 standard deviation the after gac doc concentration reached a peak of 5 1 mg l up from a baseline concentration of 1 5 mg l the concentration of ammonia increased in both the permeate and gac waters to reach peaks of 3 7 mg n l at t1 d and 2 3 mg n l at t1 25 d respectively nitrate fig 3e and nitrite not plotted were detected in the permeate at t0 5 d but were below quantification 0 2 mg n l at all other time points in the permeate and at all time points in the gac water baseline ph was approximately ph 7 2 in the permeate and gac effluent but dropped to respective minimums of ph 7 1 and 6 8 during the disruption fig 3f 3 3 a 17x increase in ammonia loading produced the largest increases in ammonia and chlorine demand but no increases in aoc or doc water quality responses to a 17x increase in ammonia loading scenario 6 are presented in fig 4 chlorine demand values for this disruption were estimated stoichiometrically from the concentration of ammonia producing a peak chlorine demand of 146 mg cl2 l which is 150 times greater than the pre disruption baseline value of 0 9 mg cl2 l ammonia concentrations in the gac effluent peaked at t1 5 d with a value of 19 2 mg n l 0 89 standard deviation the permeate reached a higher peak at t1 d with a value of 24 8 mg n l 1 4 standard deviation baseline values for ammonia were below quantification 0 05 mg n l in permeate and gac effluent aoc concentrations did not display a clear trend in response to the ammonia feeding disruption there was a decrease in aoc initially in the baseline that continued to a value of 21 Œºg l at t1 d then the aoc increased to a maximum value of 79 Œºg l this value of 79 Œºg l also matched the t 1 d value this range of aoc values is similar to the range of baseline aoc values observed testing other disruptive conditions the doc of the permeate increased over the course of the test from an initial value of 2 2 mg l to a final value of 2 7 mg l baseline values for ph were approximately 7 in the permeate and the gac water the ph of the permeate dropped to 6 at t0 5 d and reached a minimum of 5 6 at t8 d the ph of the gac water dropped to 6 1 at t1 d recovered to 6 8 at t1 5 d but then declined again until t10 d 4 discussion 4 1 increasing loading without changing the composition did not significantly disrupt system operation the bambi gac system was effective at minimizing the impact of 4x and 8x loading increases when standard aeration was provided scenarios 1 and 3 our previous study investigating tcc resulting from different concentrations of chlorine residual in recycled greywater recommended chlorine dosing to achieve a chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l though an average value of 0 2 mg cl2 l was sufficient to reduce tcc to drinking water levels ziemba et al 2019 this higher setpoint 0 8 mg cl2 l higher was selected to provide a buffer to compensate for expected variation in chlorine demand under standard conditions in our 8x loading disruptive testing scenario 3 the buffer of 0 8 mg cl2 l would have been more than sufficient to overcome the additional chlorine demand added 0 25 mg cl2 l the dominant removal mechanism in the bambi is biological metabolism k√ºnzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 gac is capable of removing carbon containing contaminants through a combination of biological conversion and physical sorption a mass balance performed on the 8x loading disruption scenario 3 demonstrated that the gac provided only polishing removing approximately 2 of the additional carbon loading the remaining 98 of the carbon removal can be attributed to the bambi as 4x and 8x increases in loading did not change the composition of the feed the existing bacterial community was likely well suited to remove the additional material the limited impacts on doc and aoc during 4x and 8x increases in loading indicates that oxygen limitation may not have been significant in contrast significant oxygen limitation during the no aeration disruption test scenario 5 was likely responsible for more significant doc accumulation above 15 mg doc l in the permeate increasing aeration during the 4x and 8x increases in loading scenarios 2 and 4 did not produce improvements in performance in doc removal compared to standard aeration scenarios 1 and 3 this further supports the case that the standard aeration of 6 l min may be significantly more than what is needed under standard loading 4 2 discontinued aeration and or increased ammonia loading can disrupt system operation in a system that relies on maintaining a free chlorine residual the chlorine demand concentrations produced by our examined aeration scenario 5 and ammonia loading scenario 6 disruptions peaking at 30 and 146 mg cl2 l respectively would overcome reasonable chlorine dosing strategies the accumulation of ammonia and doc during the no aeration testing scenario 5 indicates a collapse of biological treatment likely driven by oxygen limitation when the ratio of cl2 nh3 is high ammonia produces chlorine demand at a ratio of 7 6 1 mg cl2 l mg nh3 n l pressley et al 1972 using this relationship we can estimate that approximately half the chlorine demand produced during the no aeration test can be attributed to ammonia the increase in doc contributes to the chlorine demand not explained by ammonia even without aeration approximately half of the ammonia added to the system was removed by the end of the no aeration disruption the removal of ammonium was likely a combined effect of volatilization nitrification driven by oxygen that could enter the system and water removed from the system to maintain volume the recirculation of water through the system 120 l d would have provided a limited opportunity for volatilization and oxygen ingress the absence of nitrite and nitrate at the end of the disruption indicated that denitrification was also active increased ammonia loading scenario 6 led to an acute accumulation of ammonia in the system some ammonia was likely lost due to volatilization some was utilized in heterotrophic growth some was removed from the system while maintaining volume and the balance was likely oxidized through nitrification decreasing the ph the reduction in ph resulting from limited alkalinity may have negatively impacted further nitrification though heterotrophic metabolism did not appear hindered with doc and aoc in the permeate virtually unchanged during the disruption the eventual recovery of the ph and the ultimate removal of nitrogen from the system was likely driven by denitrification biological activity within the gac likely contributed to this denitrification as passage of water through the gac resulted in lower nitrate concentrations and increased ph testing failure of aeration and ammonia overloading demonstrated that the biological processes in the bambi can be disturbed to a level where downstream chlorine based disinfection cannot keep up unlike chlorine that reacts with organics the chlorine in scenarios 5 and 6 that reacts with ammonia can still contribute to anti microbial value through the formation of chloramines inactivation of disperse bacteria with chloramines requires extremely high concentration time ct values compared to free chlorine gray 2014 for example two log inactivation of escherichia coli requires 0 119 mg l min ct value with free chlorine but 11 mg l min ct value with monochloramine baker et al 2002 any changes in ph that occur while free chlorine is present will also significantly impact the inactivation potential of a given free chlorine concentration free chlorine in water is an equilibrium between hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite clo with a pka of approximately 7 5 shifting the ph lower increases the concentration of hocl which is approximately 80 times more effective at disinfection gray 2014 4 3 designing a system to overcome disruptions the current bambi gac system when operated as intended encounters very little risk of failure from practical increases in nutrient balanced loading this is in part due to the amount of water that can be recycled in the bambi being limited the flow of water through the membrane was observed to be approximately 120 l d under standard operating conditions demanding hand washing water at a higher rate than 120 l d would lead to exhaustion of the clean water tank and limit the rate of further inputs if the material contributed per hand washing event is consistent then the maximum daily water flux would limit the loading to 2x while ensuring that no foreign substances anti bacterial agents acids or bases membrane fouling materials are added to the bambi is an essential responsibility of the user washing hands in a manner that contributes significantly more loading than expected should also be prevented it is also essential to limit excessive ammonia loading on the bambi including urine previous research has demonstrated improved removal of target compounds in biological greywater treatment systems by supplementing nutrients in which the system was believed to be deficient jefferson et al 2001 ziemba et al 2018 the current study utilizes a combination of ammonia and nitrate stoichiometrically added for growth on the organic carbon in our synthetic feed bacteria generally prefer ammonia as a source of nitrogen and grow faster on ammonia than any other nitrogen source merrick and edwards 1995 but we have demonstrated that excess ammonia loading can pass through bambi and through the gac to introduce significant chlorine demand to the final water product excessive ammonia on a regular basis may also promote a population of nitrifying bacteria which may enable the system to better overcome excessive ammonia loading in the future we suggest further research to better understand how effectively nitrate can serve as a nitrogen source without contributing chlorine demand and also how conditioning a population for example by supplementing ammonia to support nitrifier growth can better enable a biological system to overcome disruptions in a recent field study we tested a handwashing water recycling system in durban south africa with a similar setup as presented in this study but with a design flow of 500 l day and including an electrolysis post treatment for the production of chlorine reynaert et al 2020 in spite of highly variable nitrogen concentrations in the greywater input between 14 and 260 mg total n l the treated water always contained residual chlorine under normal operation and ammonia concentrations were mostly below the detection limit of 0 05 mg n l the only disruption during the field test was due to a prolonged power outage no aeration and no chlorine production which resulted in the consumption of all free chlorine and 1 3 mg n l ammonia in the treated water although the effect of variable ammonia concentrations on the treatment performance was not the focus of this field tests the results support that nitrifying bacteria are capable of adapting to variable ammonia inputs overall system robustness can be improved by implementing redundant systems such as aeration pumps and or air distribution hardware diffusion tubing or stones to help overcome component failure battery backup or manually operated aeration systems could overcome power outages adding additional treatment steps can also mitigate the impacts of disruptions alternative disinfection technologies such as uv have demonstrated anti bacterial performance without chlorine and independent of chlorine demand beck et al 2013 gilboa and friedler 2008 electrochemical oxidation is one potential strategy to oxidize ammonia li and liu 2009 and organic material mart√≠nez huitle et al 2015 that contribute to chlorine demand we have previously demonstrated how adding electrochemical oxidation to the bambi either may ziemba et al 2020 or may not significantly impact organic carbon in favor of chlorine production ziemba et al 2019 differences in results were driven by variations in hardware configurations for the electrochemical units but also by the composition of the wastewaters being treated in this study we have elected to investigate the impacts of these disruptions using only the basic bambi gac system without electrolysis which has allowed us to identify for which circumstances additional treatment could be productive finally user safety should be ensured by smart system operation where problems in the system are detected and the system automatically prevents user access until operation is back to normal smart operation can include sensing of system components e g pumps and simple sensors e g redox potential in the clean water tank as indicators for normal operating conditions we have focused our disruption analysis on chlorine demand but if we look more broadly at system stability we see that the bambi gac system was able to recover from each of these disruptions once the standard operating conditions were resumed the biological processes were impacted with each disruption but the microbial community was not killed the membrane did not foul and the water flux did not stop we have suggested practical strategies that can improve the microbial safety for the user even under challenging conditions and we believe further development is justified because of the simplicity affordability and robustness of the core processes of the bambi gac system this future development would include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies we have identified in this paper and ultimately a quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra to demonstrate comprehensive microbial safety 5 conclusions the bambi gac treatment system delivers robust performance against increases in loading when the ratio of ammonia to carbon in the loading is maintained interruptions in aeration or increases in ammonia loading may produce chlorine demands sufficient to overcome any practical chlorine dosing strategy due to passage of ammonia and or organic materials through the system ammonia loading is controlled by user behavior geographic and social considerations but also through potential nutrient balancing strategies higher ammonia loading than required for heterotrophic growth may risk increases in chlorine demand when the ammonia is not biologically consumed maintaining microbial safety in greywater recycling is a complex and application specific task requiring hardware designed to overcome challenging operation but also effective communication to minimize inappropriate operation and ensure understanding of limitations appendix research data research data for this article are available at https doi org 10 25678 0002zn declaration of competing

19960,greywater recycling systems designed for high quality applications such as hand washing must deliver microbially safe and aesthetically acceptable water under the challenging operating conditions present where such systems are needed most urgently as chlorination is the most popular strategy for reducing bacterial concentrations in greywater understanding chlorination in the context of disruptive and challenging operation is essential to designing robust treatment in this study we have examined how disruptions through overall increased loading interrupted aeration and increased ammonia loading have impacted the chlorine demand of the water produced by a greywater recycling system we also presented concentrations of significant chemicals that contributed to this chlorine demand the results indicate that a 1 d period with 8 times 8x the normal design loading produced a peak chlorine demand of 0 74 mg cl2 l which is approximately double the baseline value while this chlorine demand can be overcome by adding more chlorine tests involving disruptions in aeration or feeding additional ammonia into the bioreactor produced much greater increases 30x the risks of increased chlorine demand on microbial safety can be overcome by limiting ammonia inputs to the system providing backup systems to ensure sufficient aeration or through additional anti bacterial measures that do not depend on maintaining residual chlorine graphical abstract image 1 keywords permeate quality hand washing water decentralized chlorination biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi gravity driven membrane gdm treatment 1 introduction decentralized biological greywater treatment systems able to reliably recycle greywater for high quality applications such as hand washing promise a valuable opportunity to expand global access to safe hygiene such systems could be most impactful in parts of the world where access to any water is limited and the costs of centralized water treatment and distribution is economically prohibitive unfortunately existing greywater research has largely focused on delivering water for less demanding applications such as toilet flushing shi et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 or irrigation busgang et al 2018 recent research has specifically investigated post treatment technologies that are able to improve effluent water quality for higher quality applications such as hand washing water or showering dubowski et al 2020 gassie and englehardt 2017 nguyen et al 2017 ziemba et al 2019 2020 these works have demonstrated the feasibility of decentralized and self contained systems appropriately sized for one home community installation or medical facility that will be filled initially with water and then repeatedly treat this water provide it for washing or showering recollect it and repeat this cycle what remains to be explored is how challenging or disruptive operation might affect water quality and in turn microbial safety the small scale of decentralized systems can make them sensitive to variability in loading the dirt soap skin and other materials added to the greywater in terms of amount and composition the application of decentralized systems in remote environments or areas with unreliable electricity access may impose additional challenges such as the inability to quickly replace broken components or frequent power interruptions understanding the implications of challenging and disruptive operating conditions on system performance is crucial to implement safe and effective biological greywater recycling for high quality applications critical analysis of current greywater technologies in practice has concluded that biologically based treatments can be the most environmentally friendly in terms of chemical requirements and energy demand while also providing high quality effluent with small footprint requirements boyjoo et al 2013 these advantages have caused biological treatment processes to become broadly accepted in the greywater treatment field pidou et al 2007 but the importance of understanding how different greywater treatment systems perform under variable conditions has also been noted ghunmi et al 2011 biological systems may exhibit reduced ability relative to physio chemical systems to adapt quickly to changes in operation or environment and may require specific conditions such as nutrient balance or minimum oxygen concentrations any type of operational disruptions increased loading altered composition of loading and interrupted aeration can result in reduced biological activity and accumulation of undesirable materials within the system this accumulation can create an unpleasant color odor or feel of the water ineffective hands cannot get clean or unsafe ineffective bacteria control experience for the user while the factors that contribute to a negative user perception are evident how disruptions affect microbial safety may be more complex the most common form of greywater disinfection is chlorination boyjoo et al 2013 chlorination is a particularly effective disinfection strategy because maintaining a free chlorine residual within a water system combats bacterial growth during storage studies conducted with a variety of greywater treatment technologies have concluded from results that a free chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l achieves acceptable anti bacteria control abdel kader 2013 winward et al 2008 ziemba et al 2019 maintaining a chlorine residual in the treated water requires overcoming the losses of chlorine to volatilization externally driven reactions e g photoreduction and the chlorine demand of the water to which the chlorine is added chlorine demand consists of all chemical constituents within the water that would rapidly react with chlorine ammonia nitrite and general organic carbon compounds can all exhibit significant chlorine demand throughout this study the term ammonia refers to the combination of ammonia and ammonium species while the chlorine demand of ammonia and nitrite can be estimated stoichiometrically we are not aware of any study that has measured the chlorine demand of organic materials in treated greywater our limited understanding of how disruptive operation contributes to chemical accumulation increases chlorine demand and opposes the efficacy of microbial control through chlorination represents a significant knowledge gap that prevents us from developing robust biological greywater recycling systems one important task for the further development of greywater recycling systems for high quality applications like handwashing will be the definition of quality targets over the past years there has been an increasing number of water reuse frameworks targeting lower quality reuse applications such as irrigation or toilet flushing however as yet only the iso 30500 standard for non sewered sanitation systems explicitly includes handwashing as an application for recycled water though it does not include recommendations or requirements specifically related to chlorinating systems microbial safety for high quality applications will require log removal performance for greywater treatment similar to drinking water treatment iso 30500 who 2017 a better understanding of the factors affecting the chlorine demand in greywater recycling systems designed for high quality applications can inform the developers of new or revised water reuse frameworks in the establishment of quality targets for greywater reuse systems that include a final chlorination step the impacts of disruptive operation were examined in this study using a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi which has been developed specifically for decentralized greywater recycling k√ºnzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 ziemba et al 2020 inside the bambi treatment is conducted by bacteria either in the bulk liquid phase or in a biofilm that develops on an immersed ultrafiltration membrane module and within a granular activated carbon gac filter that follows the membrane gentle aeration directly below the membrane module promotes aerobic conversion in external areas of the biofilm bambi reactors operating at steady state were subject to a series of 1 d disruptive events that could be encountered in practice i an increase in loading ii an increase in ammonia loading iii a loss of aeration the chlorine demand of the produced water was measured or stoichiometrically estimated from relevant measured compounds before during and after each disruption increasing aeration during increased loading has also been tested as a potential mitigation strategy by understanding the mechanisms and the magnitude of each potential disruption we can make informed design decisions for biological systems that utilize chlorination and help advance decentralized hand washing water recycling into the real and disruptive world 2 methods and materials 2 1 greywater treatment system the flow of water through the greywater recycling system is illustrated in fig 1 a concentrated nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing greywater was prepared and stored at 4 c with 10 rpm mixing under normal operation a total of 3 l d of the concentrated feed was pumped into the bambi in a series of 40 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day the daily loading of the 3 l of concentrated synthetic feed represents the loading soap skin material on hands that would be introduced to a total of 60 l of water during hand washing 1 5 l per hand washing event the bambi itself consisted of a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra ontario canada featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany placed into a 52 l wastewater tank fig 1 the operating volume of the bambi was approximately 42 l the membrane was positioned in the tank such that the top of the membrane matched the water level aeration was provided directly below the membrane module with a pair of aeration tubes that created bubbles approximately 3 4 mm in diameter air curtain 90 cm guangdong risheng shenzhen china under normal operation the rate of aeration was 6 l min this aeration creates regions within the bambi that permit aerobic processes such as nitrification and anaerobic processes such as denitrification within the same simple reactor no additional pressure was supplied to drive water through the membrane beyond the pressure head of water on the feed side of the membrane water that passed through the biofilm and through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir and then pumped to the clean water storage tank at 5 min intervals water entering the storage tank first passed vertically down through a 6 l granular activated carbon gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston ma usa submerged in the storage tank the gac was a mixture of new gac 25 combined with a balance of gac that had been previously used in a similar greywater treatment system for 6 months after passing through the gac the water entered the larger storage tank and was then returned to the bambi by an overflow the overflow maintained a constant volume of 17 5 l of water in the storage tank including water in the gac the passage of water from the clean water storage tank back to the bambi represented water that would be available for hand washing in an operational system extra water was pumped out of the clean water storage tank and discharged to compensate for the concentrated greywater feed and maintain a constant system volume though the standard loading corresponded to 60 l of daily water usage water was recirculated through the system at approximately the rate of membrane flux 120 l d the feeding permeate and water removal pumps were activated using automation software codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france aeration was controlled manually by a rotameter analyt mtc colmar france the bambi was initially started with tap water inoculated with 0 5 l of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and operated for approximately 30 d before stable performance was achieved 2 2 synthetic hand washing water feed the recipe for the concentrated synthetic hand washing water feed is presented in table 1 this recipe is based on the expected inputs to hand washing greywater and the nutrient balancing strategy presented previously ziemba et al 2018 in this study the nutrient demands were based on the estimate that 1 3 of the carbon in assimilated substrate will be converted to new biomass and that the production of this biomass will require nutrient balancing this yield of 1 3 biomass carbon substrate carbon was reduced from the yield of 1 which was used previously and we have also removed kaolin as an ingredient ziemba et al 2018 the concentrated feed water was prepared in tap water the tap water in z√ºrich has been measured as containing 0 7 mg l n 5 mg l s 50 mg l ca 1 2 mg l k 7 mg l mg 0 005 mg l p fe zn and 0 0005 mg l mn and cu city of z√ºrich 2016 mo and co were assumed to be zero the specific values provided in table 1 reflect what must be added to the tap water to get the desired nutrient content the humic acid was a naturally collected material 53680 sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa all other chemicals were reagent grade or better diluting the 20x concentrated synthetic hand washing water to 1x strength as used in the system contributed an organic carbon concentration of 130 mg toc l and an ammonia concentration of 3 1 mg n l 2 3 disruption experiments three types of disruptions were examined table 2 consisting of increasing loading scenarios 1 4 turning off the aeration scenario 5 or changing the composition of the feed scenario 6 increasing the loading was accomplished by increasing the amount of feed concentrate pumped into the bambi and removing more treated water to maintain constant volume the aeration flow rate was set to zero as a disruption the composition was changed by replacing the standard synthetic greywater feed with a feed that was modified with a spike of 1000 mg l nh4 n in the form of nh4cl this spike in the feed delivered an additional 3 g of nh4 n over the course of the disruption which corresponds to the amount of ammonia that would be released from the hydrolysis of 400 ml of fresh human urine udert et al 2006 the total ammonium dosing during the disruption was increased to approximately 17x the standard feed this corresponds after dilution to an ammonia concentration of 53 1 mg n l in the diluted feed compared to the standard 3 1 mg n l manually increasing aeration was examined as a disruption mitigation strategy for increased loading no aeration 4x loading with 2x aeration 8x loading 8x loading with 2x aeration and 17x ammonia loading disruption experiments were conducted in the same system in that order the system was operated for a minimum of 5 d with standard loading between experiments the 4x loading experiment was conducted in a second bambi system of identical configuration 2 4 chlorine demand measurement measurement procedures for chlorine demand were based on the standard methods 2350 for oxidant demand requirement protocol apha 2017 chlorine demand free glassware was utilized in all chlorine demand measurements glassware and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined lids were first cleaned with soap and water then soaked in chlorine solution 100 mg cl2 l free chlorine in de ionized water di for 12 h and dried at 60 c each measurement was prepared in a total volume of 31 ml in an 45 ml processing vial sample was added to each processing vial such that the sample represented dilutions of 1 in 2 1 in 10 1 in 20 or 1 in 50 of the total volume of 31 ml phosphate buffer final concentrations added 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2 3 g l kh2po4 nacl final concentration added 0 1 g l free chlorine final concentration added 2 mg cl2 l and di water to reach final volume were added the chlorine was added last to the processing vial by slowly pipetting the chlorine into the liquid phase after all other reagents were added and the vial was mixed the chlorine stock was stored in the dark at 4 c and returned immediately when not in use each processing vial was then gently mixed swirled by hand for about 10 s and then slowly inverted 5 times the contents were gently poured into a 23 ml incubation vial and capped leaving no air space the incubation vials were then incubated in the dark for 12 18 h at 20 c the final free chlorine was measured using hach kits lck 310 hach loveland colorado usa employing the dpd n n diethylparaphenylenediamine method samples were processed in triplicate and triplicate control vials were prepared for each measurement using the same procedure without the addition of sample chlorine demand was calculated by subtracting the free chlorine concentration in the sample from the average free chlorine concentration in the control and multiplying by the dilution of the sample the dilutions utilized for each sample were based on the estimated chlorine demand of previous baseline measurements 0 5 1 mg l cl2 demand and the concentration of ammonia in the sample the chlorine demand of ammonia was estimated 1 mg n l 7 6 mg cl2 l demand based on the stoichiometric oxidation of ammonia through monochloramine to n2 gas pressley et al 1972 dilutions were also based on maintaining a much higher chlorine concentration in the incubation vial compared to the ammonia concentration so the relationship between chlorine demand and ammonia nitrogen was preserved 1 mg n l 7 6 mg cl2 l demand the minimum incubation ratio utilized in this study was 50 mg cl2 mg ammonia with the exception of the 24 h data point in the experiment where the aeration was turned off scenario 5 this sample was not processed correctly at a ratio of 22 mg cl2 mg ammonia which may have resulted in an under measurement of chlorine demand chlorine demand was not accurately measured directly during the disruptive period of the experiment with increased ammonia loading scenario 6 because it became too difficult to control for factors that can affect accurate chlorine measurements ph chloride concentrations processing duration signal strength at measurement chlorine demand during this period has been estimated from the ammonia concentration 2 5 dissolved organic carbon doc assimilable organic carbon aoc anions and ammonia all samples for doc and aoc measurements were collected and processed in glass vials muffled at 450 c for 12 h and capped with ptfe lined lids doc was measured using an infrared detector calibrated to organic carbon standards doc labor dr huber karlsruhe germany aoc measurement procedure was based on an established protocol hammes and egli 2005 aoc samples 50 ml were first filtered through prewashed 50 ml of di water 0 2 Œºm polyethersulfone filters pall port washington new york usa trace elements fe solution and buffer solution were added in accordance with prest et al 2016 1 ml of a diverse bacteria inoculum was added as previously described ziemba et al 2018 the samples were mixed and then distributed equally into triplicate 45 ml vials capped incubated for 3 5 days at 30 c on a dark 150 rpm shaker and measured for total cell count tcc tcc was measured with a flow cytometer cytoflex bechman coulter brea california usa and sybr green i stain life technologies eugene or usa growth during incubation quantified as tcc was used to calculate aoc using the equation 1 Œºg aoc 107 cells hammes and egli 2005 ion chromatography metrohm 881 herisau switzerland was used to measure the nitrite and nitrate in the samples each with a minimum quantification limit of 0 2 mg n l ammonia was measured using hach kits lck 304 hach love land colorado usa with a minimum quantification limit of 0 05 mg n l 3 results 3 1 increasing loading without changing composition 3 1 1 increasing loading produced a small increase in chlorine demand aoc and doc but not ammonia the 4x increase in loading during a 1 d period scenario 1 did not produce any clear increase in chlorine demand the average chlorine demand observed during the 4x feeding experiment was 0 35 mg cl2 l which is comparable to the baseline values observed in the 8x feeding experiment fig 2 a in contrast the 8x increase in loading during a 1 d period scenario 3 produced a peak chlorine demand of 0 74 mg cl2 l 0 16 standard deviation this peak was almost twice the average baseline chlorine demand measured before and following this disruption starting at t1 d of 0 4 mg cl2 l doc aoc ph and chemical concentrations were measured in water following treatment with the bambi permeate and after the gac filter gac to better understand the relative contributions of each step the 4x feeding experiment scenario 1 produced a doc peak in the permeate at t1 d after 1 d at the end of the disruption of 1 7 mg l which is slightly higher than the baseline average of 1 15 mg l 0 1 standard deviation the 8x feeding experiment scenario 3 produced a doc peak at t0 5 d halfway into the disruption of 3 3 mg l which is almost 3 times the baseline value before the increased feeding increases in doc in the water following gac were less pronounced baseline values for aoc in the 4x and 8x feeding experiments were 36 5 5 8 mg l average standard deviation and 32 1 11 mg l respectively fig 2e a peak value of 80 1 9 mg l was observed in the 4x feed experiment scenario 1 at t0 5 d halfway into the increased loading period yet this is the only data point that appeared to be higher than the baseline the 8x feeding experiment scenario 3 produced a more pronounced increase to a peak of 179 4 5 mg l and a gradual return to baseline at t3 d all ammonia measurements were below quantification 0 05 mg n l for the 4x and 8x loading experiments increasing loading generally reduced ph values and these reductions were more significant in the permeate 0 4 ph units relative to the effluent of the gac 0 1 ph unit 3 1 2 increasing aeration mitigated increases in aoc from increased loading but did not mitigate increases in chlorine demand or doc fig 2 b d and f display changes in chlorine demand aoc and doc following increases of 4x or 8x in feed loading combined with 2x increases in aeration during the disruption period scenarios 2 and 4 respectively increases in aeration did not produce different responses in chlorine demand or doc the maximum chlorine demand value achieved in scenarios 4 with 8x feed and 2x aeration 0 73 mg cl2 l was quite similar to scenario 3 with 8x feed with 1x aeration 0 74 mg cl2 l increasing loading without increasing aeration either clearly increased aoc 8x feeding in scenario 3 or may have increased aoc 4x feeding in scenario 1 when the aeration was increased neither condition resulted in any aoc increases during the disruption period the 8x feeding with increased aeration scenario 4 did produce elevated aoc measurements of 142 Œºg l at t2 d and 68 Œºg l at t2 5 d but this peak is not consistent with position on the experimental timeline expected or observed in other scenarios 3 2 turning off aeration produces large increases in ammonia aoc doc and chlorine demand the increases in chlorine demand aoc doc and ammonia were much greater following a 1 d period of shutting off aeration scenario 5 fig 3 compared to an 8x increase in feeding scenarios 3 and 4 the chlorine demand without aeration increased 30x from the average baseline value of 0 6 mg cl2 l to a peak likely greater than the measured value of 20 mg cl2 l this peak measurement was not conducted properly and likely underestimated the true chlorine demand in the sample because the ratio of ammonia cl2 in the incubation vials was not correct measured chlorine demand values are generally higher across the experimental timeline than what would be estimated stoichiometrically from the concentration of ammonia aoc concentrations increased almost 20x during the disruption to a peak value of 1947 Œºg l 92 standard deviation from a pre disruption baseline of 100 Œºg l doc concentrations increased in permeate and reached a peak of 17 mg l up from a baseline concentration of 2 4 mg l 0 52 standard deviation the after gac doc concentration reached a peak of 5 1 mg l up from a baseline concentration of 1 5 mg l the concentration of ammonia increased in both the permeate and gac waters to reach peaks of 3 7 mg n l at t1 d and 2 3 mg n l at t1 25 d respectively nitrate fig 3e and nitrite not plotted were detected in the permeate at t0 5 d but were below quantification 0 2 mg n l at all other time points in the permeate and at all time points in the gac water baseline ph was approximately ph 7 2 in the permeate and gac effluent but dropped to respective minimums of ph 7 1 and 6 8 during the disruption fig 3f 3 3 a 17x increase in ammonia loading produced the largest increases in ammonia and chlorine demand but no increases in aoc or doc water quality responses to a 17x increase in ammonia loading scenario 6 are presented in fig 4 chlorine demand values for this disruption were estimated stoichiometrically from the concentration of ammonia producing a peak chlorine demand of 146 mg cl2 l which is 150 times greater than the pre disruption baseline value of 0 9 mg cl2 l ammonia concentrations in the gac effluent peaked at t1 5 d with a value of 19 2 mg n l 0 89 standard deviation the permeate reached a higher peak at t1 d with a value of 24 8 mg n l 1 4 standard deviation baseline values for ammonia were below quantification 0 05 mg n l in permeate and gac effluent aoc concentrations did not display a clear trend in response to the ammonia feeding disruption there was a decrease in aoc initially in the baseline that continued to a value of 21 Œºg l at t1 d then the aoc increased to a maximum value of 79 Œºg l this value of 79 Œºg l also matched the t 1 d value this range of aoc values is similar to the range of baseline aoc values observed testing other disruptive conditions the doc of the permeate increased over the course of the test from an initial value of 2 2 mg l to a final value of 2 7 mg l baseline values for ph were approximately 7 in the permeate and the gac water the ph of the permeate dropped to 6 at t0 5 d and reached a minimum of 5 6 at t8 d the ph of the gac water dropped to 6 1 at t1 d recovered to 6 8 at t1 5 d but then declined again until t10 d 4 discussion 4 1 increasing loading without changing the composition did not significantly disrupt system operation the bambi gac system was effective at minimizing the impact of 4x and 8x loading increases when standard aeration was provided scenarios 1 and 3 our previous study investigating tcc resulting from different concentrations of chlorine residual in recycled greywater recommended chlorine dosing to achieve a chlorine residual of 1 mg cl2 l though an average value of 0 2 mg cl2 l was sufficient to reduce tcc to drinking water levels ziemba et al 2019 this higher setpoint 0 8 mg cl2 l higher was selected to provide a buffer to compensate for expected variation in chlorine demand under standard conditions in our 8x loading disruptive testing scenario 3 the buffer of 0 8 mg cl2 l would have been more than sufficient to overcome the additional chlorine demand added 0 25 mg cl2 l the dominant removal mechanism in the bambi is biological metabolism k√ºnzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 gac is capable of removing carbon containing contaminants through a combination of biological conversion and physical sorption a mass balance performed on the 8x loading disruption scenario 3 demonstrated that the gac provided only polishing removing approximately 2 of the additional carbon loading the remaining 98 of the carbon removal can be attributed to the bambi as 4x and 8x increases in loading did not change the composition of the feed the existing bacterial community was likely well suited to remove the additional material the limited impacts on doc and aoc during 4x and 8x increases in loading indicates that oxygen limitation may not have been significant in contrast significant oxygen limitation during the no aeration disruption test scenario 5 was likely responsible for more significant doc accumulation above 15 mg doc l in the permeate increasing aeration during the 4x and 8x increases in loading scenarios 2 and 4 did not produce improvements in performance in doc removal compared to standard aeration scenarios 1 and 3 this further supports the case that the standard aeration of 6 l min may be significantly more than what is needed under standard loading 4 2 discontinued aeration and or increased ammonia loading can disrupt system operation in a system that relies on maintaining a free chlorine residual the chlorine demand concentrations produced by our examined aeration scenario 5 and ammonia loading scenario 6 disruptions peaking at 30 and 146 mg cl2 l respectively would overcome reasonable chlorine dosing strategies the accumulation of ammonia and doc during the no aeration testing scenario 5 indicates a collapse of biological treatment likely driven by oxygen limitation when the ratio of cl2 nh3 is high ammonia produces chlorine demand at a ratio of 7 6 1 mg cl2 l mg nh3 n l pressley et al 1972 using this relationship we can estimate that approximately half the chlorine demand produced during the no aeration test can be attributed to ammonia the increase in doc contributes to the chlorine demand not explained by ammonia even without aeration approximately half of the ammonia added to the system was removed by the end of the no aeration disruption the removal of ammonium was likely a combined effect of volatilization nitrification driven by oxygen that could enter the system and water removed from the system to maintain volume the recirculation of water through the system 120 l d would have provided a limited opportunity for volatilization and oxygen ingress the absence of nitrite and nitrate at the end of the disruption indicated that denitrification was also active increased ammonia loading scenario 6 led to an acute accumulation of ammonia in the system some ammonia was likely lost due to volatilization some was utilized in heterotrophic growth some was removed from the system while maintaining volume and the balance was likely oxidized through nitrification decreasing the ph the reduction in ph resulting from limited alkalinity may have negatively impacted further nitrification though heterotrophic metabolism did not appear hindered with doc and aoc in the permeate virtually unchanged during the disruption the eventual recovery of the ph and the ultimate removal of nitrogen from the system was likely driven by denitrification biological activity within the gac likely contributed to this denitrification as passage of water through the gac resulted in lower nitrate concentrations and increased ph testing failure of aeration and ammonia overloading demonstrated that the biological processes in the bambi can be disturbed to a level where downstream chlorine based disinfection cannot keep up unlike chlorine that reacts with organics the chlorine in scenarios 5 and 6 that reacts with ammonia can still contribute to anti microbial value through the formation of chloramines inactivation of disperse bacteria with chloramines requires extremely high concentration time ct values compared to free chlorine gray 2014 for example two log inactivation of escherichia coli requires 0 119 mg l min ct value with free chlorine but 11 mg l min ct value with monochloramine baker et al 2002 any changes in ph that occur while free chlorine is present will also significantly impact the inactivation potential of a given free chlorine concentration free chlorine in water is an equilibrium between hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite clo with a pka of approximately 7 5 shifting the ph lower increases the concentration of hocl which is approximately 80 times more effective at disinfection gray 2014 4 3 designing a system to overcome disruptions the current bambi gac system when operated as intended encounters very little risk of failure from practical increases in nutrient balanced loading this is in part due to the amount of water that can be recycled in the bambi being limited the flow of water through the membrane was observed to be approximately 120 l d under standard operating conditions demanding hand washing water at a higher rate than 120 l d would lead to exhaustion of the clean water tank and limit the rate of further inputs if the material contributed per hand washing event is consistent then the maximum daily water flux would limit the loading to 2x while ensuring that no foreign substances anti bacterial agents acids or bases membrane fouling materials are added to the bambi is an essential responsibility of the user washing hands in a manner that contributes significantly more loading than expected should also be prevented it is also essential to limit excessive ammonia loading on the bambi including urine previous research has demonstrated improved removal of target compounds in biological greywater treatment systems by supplementing nutrients in which the system was believed to be deficient jefferson et al 2001 ziemba et al 2018 the current study utilizes a combination of ammonia and nitrate stoichiometrically added for growth on the organic carbon in our synthetic feed bacteria generally prefer ammonia as a source of nitrogen and grow faster on ammonia than any other nitrogen source merrick and edwards 1995 but we have demonstrated that excess ammonia loading can pass through bambi and through the gac to introduce significant chlorine demand to the final water product excessive ammonia on a regular basis may also promote a population of nitrifying bacteria which may enable the system to better overcome excessive ammonia loading in the future we suggest further research to better understand how effectively nitrate can serve as a nitrogen source without contributing chlorine demand and also how conditioning a population for example by supplementing ammonia to support nitrifier growth can better enable a biological system to overcome disruptions in a recent field study we tested a handwashing water recycling system in durban south africa with a similar setup as presented in this study but with a design flow of 500 l day and including an electrolysis post treatment for the production of chlorine reynaert et al 2020 in spite of highly variable nitrogen concentrations in the greywater input between 14 and 260 mg total n l the treated water always contained residual chlorine under normal operation and ammonia concentrations were mostly below the detection limit of 0 05 mg n l the only disruption during the field test was due to a prolonged power outage no aeration and no chlorine production which resulted in the consumption of all free chlorine and 1 3 mg n l ammonia in the treated water although the effect of variable ammonia concentrations on the treatment performance was not the focus of this field tests the results support that nitrifying bacteria are capable of adapting to variable ammonia inputs overall system robustness can be improved by implementing redundant systems such as aeration pumps and or air distribution hardware diffusion tubing or stones to help overcome component failure battery backup or manually operated aeration systems could overcome power outages adding additional treatment steps can also mitigate the impacts of disruptions alternative disinfection technologies such as uv have demonstrated anti bacterial performance without chlorine and independent of chlorine demand beck et al 2013 gilboa and friedler 2008 electrochemical oxidation is one potential strategy to oxidize ammonia li and liu 2009 and organic material mart√≠nez huitle et al 2015 that contribute to chlorine demand we have previously demonstrated how adding electrochemical oxidation to the bambi either may ziemba et al 2020 or may not significantly impact organic carbon in favor of chlorine production ziemba et al 2019 differences in results were driven by variations in hardware configurations for the electrochemical units but also by the composition of the wastewaters being treated in this study we have elected to investigate the impacts of these disruptions using only the basic bambi gac system without electrolysis which has allowed us to identify for which circumstances additional treatment could be productive finally user safety should be ensured by smart system operation where problems in the system are detected and the system automatically prevents user access until operation is back to normal smart operation can include sensing of system components e g pumps and simple sensors e g redox potential in the clean water tank as indicators for normal operating conditions we have focused our disruption analysis on chlorine demand but if we look more broadly at system stability we see that the bambi gac system was able to recover from each of these disruptions once the standard operating conditions were resumed the biological processes were impacted with each disruption but the microbial community was not killed the membrane did not foul and the water flux did not stop we have suggested practical strategies that can improve the microbial safety for the user even under challenging conditions and we believe further development is justified because of the simplicity affordability and robustness of the core processes of the bambi gac system this future development would include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies we have identified in this paper and ultimately a quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra to demonstrate comprehensive microbial safety 5 conclusions the bambi gac treatment system delivers robust performance against increases in loading when the ratio of ammonia to carbon in the loading is maintained interruptions in aeration or increases in ammonia loading may produce chlorine demands sufficient to overcome any practical chlorine dosing strategy due to passage of ammonia and or organic materials through the system ammonia loading is controlled by user behavior geographic and social considerations but also

19961,ozonation is an advanced treatment technology that is increasingly used for the removal of organic micropollutants from wastewater and drinking water however reaction of organic compounds with ozone can also result in the formation of toxic transformation products in the present study the degradation of the antiviral drug zidovudine during ozonation was investigated to obtain further insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways results of zidovudine were compared with the transformation of the naturally occurring derivative thymidine kinetic experiments were accompanied by elucidation of formed transformation products using lab scale batch experiments and subsequent liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms analysis degradation rate constants for zidovudine with ozone in the presence of t buoh as radical scavenger varied between 2 8 104 m 1 s 1 ph 7 and 3 2 104 m 1 s 1 ph 3 the structural difference of zidovudine to thymidine is the exchange of the oh moiety by the azide function at position 3 in contrast to inorganic azide no reaction with ozone was observed for the organic bound azide in total nine transformation products tps were identified for both zidovudine and thymidine their formation can be attributed to the attack of ozone at the c c double bond of the pyrimidine base as a result of rearrangements the primary ozonide decomposed in three pathways forming two different tps including hydroperoxide tps rearrangement reactions followed by hydrolysis and subsequent release of h2o2 further revealed a cascade of tps containing amide moieties in addition a formyl amide riboside and a urea riboside were identified as tps indicating that oxidations of amide groups occur during ozonation processes graphical abstract

micropollutants mps that are originating from households and industries due to the incomplete elimination of these compounds during conventional wastewater treatment ben et al 2018 freeling et al 2020 scott et al 2018 in addition most organic mps that are eliminated during wastewater treatment undergo only partial degradation thus giving rise to the formation of transformation products tps as a result both parent compounds and their tps are discharged into receiving rivers and streams by wwtps wang et al 2018 weizel et al 2020 xu et al 2017 in order to reduce the emissions of organic mps by wwtps advanced treatment processes are increasingly used rodriguez chueca et al 2019 shin and lee 2016 von gunten 2018 wac≈Çawek et al 2017 amongst these ozonation has been shown to reduce the emission of a large variety of organic mps ozone reacts primarily with organic compounds containing electron rich moieties such as c c double bonds and amines or aromatic rings david yao and haag 1991 hermes et al 2020 lim et al 2019 von gunten 2018 however the applied ozone doses typically not result in a complete mineralization of the organic mps but rather to the formation of a multitude of tps

excreted largely unmodified via urine and feces acosta et al 1996 mosekiemang et al 2019 zong et al 2007 as a result a variety of antiviral drugs has been detected in raw wastewater highest

biodegradation in activated sludge treatment stable biotransformation products are formed which even have been detected in drinking water funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 2011 the presence of antiviral drugs and their tps in the environment is of concern due to their adverse effects on aquatic wildlife this includes reduced growth of green algae minguez et al 2016 or toxicity to daphnia magna schl√ºter vorberg et al 2015 thus there is a need to develop technologies that effectively eliminate the parent antiviral drugs and their biotransformation products from wastewater prasse et al 2015a 2015b russo et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 this includes the use of ozone which is increasingly used for the removal of mps from wastewater bourgin et al 2018 and has also been shown to be effective for the removal of acyclovir and its bio tp carboxy acyclovir prasse et al 2012 in this study the transformation of the antiviral drug zdv during ozonation of wastewater was investigated in order to obtain additional insights into the degradation pathways during ozonation the reaction mechanisms of zdv were compared with the naturally occurring derivative thymidine thy zdv is a thy analogue in

6 h total suspended solids approx 4 0 gss l 1 was used to conduct spiked ozonation experiments in wastewater to this end 100 ml of effluent was spiked with 5 mg l 1 of zdv before ozone was added in 10 fold molar excess 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation kinetics of zdv in order to determine the ozone dose required to achieve a complete transformation of analytes analyte to ozone ratios from 10 1 to 1 10 were tested as shown in fig 1 complete elimination of the analytes was obtained at an analyte ozone ratio of 1 2 competition kinetics used to determine rate constants of zdv revealed a linear correlation with a slope of 1 table 2 indicating that zdv and thy are reacting at the same rate with ozone second order rate constants of zdv ranged from 2 79 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 up to 3 18 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 corresponding to half lives from 21 to 24 s at concentration levels of 1 5 Œºm respectively table 2 the absence of a ph dependence is expected considering pka values of 9 45 for thy as well as 9 42 for zdv raviolo and brinon 2011 similar kinetics in the absence of t buoh indicate that contribution of hydroxyl radicals to zdv and thy degradation is negligible 3 2 identification of tp formation due to the high affinity of zdv and thy to sodium ions most analytes were identified based on detected m na ions instead of m h ions this has been described for thy before dubey et al 2001 girault et al 1994 the stability of m na ions during ms2 experiments required the addition of 0 1 lithium formate to the lc eluents to form m li ions of analytes and tps which are less stable and thus increases the detection of fragment ions observed in the ms identification of transformation products revealed similar products for both zdv and thy indicating that both compounds are undergoing similar transformation reactions and pathways fig 2 the primary attack of ozone takes place at the c5 c6 double bond of the thymine base leading to the primary ozonide intermediate im im1 according to the criegee mechanism confirming the previously described thy reaction mechanism with ozone flyunt et al 2002 girault et al 1994 homolytic cleavage of im1 followed by rearrangement results in the formation of tp 2 ms2 experiments of tp 2 exhibited a main fragment 146 0328 da which will be further discussed below for tp 4 subsequent loss of co which has previously been postulated by cadet et al 1999 then results in the formation of tp 3 ms2 experiments of tp 3 exhibited the same main fragment 146 0328 da as tp 2 tp 4 146 0328 da is formed by oxidation and subsequent cleavage of the ribose nucleobase bond of tp 3 ms2 experiments showed the cleavage of h2o2 indicating that tp 4 should be a cyclic hydantoin hydroperoxide si table 1 flyunt et al 2002 furthermore oxidation of tp 3 presumably leads to formation of tp 9 via an intramolecular oxidation of the amide carbonyl function resulting in most likely im4 an 1 2 dioxetane shimomura 2005 subsequently cleavage of the o o and c c bonds results in an unstable carbamic acid and acetyl derived amine im5 releases co2 forming tp 9 revealing the instability of dioxetanes under standard conditions vacher et al 2018 furthermore the formation of additional tps indicated that reaction of ozone with zdv and thy also result in heterolytic cleavage of the ozonide intermediates im2 3 followed by hydrolysis and or cleavage of hydrogen peroxide im6 7 leading to the pyruvic derivate tp 5 the most intense fragment observed in ms2 experiments of tp 5 showed the loss of pyruvic amide si table 2 on one hand a formal loss of carbon monoxide then leads to tp 6 which could also be formed by cleavage of the hydroperoxide tp 3 the cyclic hydantoin derivative and the linear urea derivative are tautomeric to each other although published results suggested that the equilibrium should be on the side of the cyclic hydantoin derivative hemiaminals tend to cleave into its linear tautomer iwasawa et al 2007 hence results did not allow for identifying the predominant tautomer on the other hand cleavage of methylglyoxal from tp 5 revealed the formation of the formyl urea derivative tp 8 the loss of the formyl group of tp 8 led to tp 7 whereas tp 10 is formed from the loss of formyl amide in comparison to results from literature flyunt et al 2002 girault et al 1994 our analytical approach using a direct injection hrms method allowed to experimentally confirming the formation of tp 2 tp 4 and tp 5 which have not been identified as ozonation products of thy before the proposed pathway for thy is in accordance with tps identified and suggested by girault et al 1994 cadet et al 1999 and flyunt et al 2002 and synthesizes the current knowledge about the different reaction mechanisms the obtained results demonstrate that the pathway proposed for thy can be transferred directly to zdv indicating that the azide moiety has no significant impact on the degradation mechanism it should be noted that the reactions of zdv and thy with other oxidants such as permanganate or hydroxyl radicals lead to similar tps kulkarni et al 2016 theruvathu et al 2001 wagner et al 1994 ozonation experiments in wwtp effluent with spiked zdv 5 mg l 1 revealed the formation of the same tps as observed in buffered ultrapure water with highest peak areas obtained for tp 7 8 10 fig 3 temporal trends of tps from ozonation of zdv and thy revealed that all identified tps are present in the first sampling point after 30 s stirring as shown in si figs 1 and 2 within eight hours most of the tps showed decreasing peak areas pa most likely resulting from their continuous degradation in solution in addition to reactions with ozone most described reactions could also be attributed to hydrolysis for example hydantoins and imides have hydrolysis half lives of hours e g shown for the pesticides iprodione and flumioxazine authority 2014 2016 organic bound azides will not be degraded using ozonation emitting a slightly mutagenic potential into the environment matsumura et al 1995 it is remarkable that organic hydroperoxides were scarcely identified with direct injection lc hrms methods ito et al 2015 2020 furthermore ozonation transformation processes could result in the same products as naturally occurring oxidation reactions in the human body as the urea tp 7a and formamide tp 10a of thy were found as potential lesion of dna rna resulting from ros reactions cadet et al 2012 irvoas et al 2014 toga et al 2009 4 conclusion ozonation of zdv and thy followed the same transformation pathway starting with the ozone attack at the c c double bond based on this activation zdv and thy formed nine equivalent tps each all transformation reactions took place at the nucleobase the riboside moiety was not attacked the azide moiety of zdv and hydroxyl moiety of thy remained inert and had no major impact on the reaction mechanisms three of the nine tps were identified as hydroperoxides remarkably the hrms method was able to measure these reactive compounds via direct injection as fragmentation experiments showed the loss of h2o2 the proposed pathway led to an acetamide tp a formamide tp and a urea tp as endpoints based on newly identified and previously reported tps a comprehensive mechanistic pathway for the reaction of thymidine with ozone was obtained all reactions of the transformation pathway could also be attributed to a biotic hydrolysis reactions thus ozonation was capable of activating compounds being stable in biological treatments the present study revealed the necessity to identify transformation products of antiviral drugs formed during ozonation an in depth understanding of oxidation reactions can lead to a better evaluation of potential effects on the environment declaration

formation due to the high affinity of zdv and thy to sodium ions most analytes were identified based on detected m na ions instead of m h ions this has been described for thy before dubey et al 2001 girault et al 1994 the stability of m na ions during ms2 experiments required the addition of 0 1 lithium formate to the lc eluents to form m li ions of analytes and tps which are less stable and thus increases the detection of fragment ions observed in the ms identification of transformation products revealed similar products for both zdv and thy indicating that both compounds are undergoing similar transformation reactions and pathways fig 2 the primary attack of ozone takes place at the c5 c6 double bond of the thymine base leading to the primary ozonide intermediate im im1 according to the criegee mechanism confirming the previously described thy reaction mechanism with ozone flyunt et al 2002 girault et al 1994 homolytic cleavage of im1 followed by rearrangement results in the formation of tp 2 ms2 experiments of tp 2 exhibited a main fragment 146 0328 da which will be further discussed below for tp 4 subsequent loss of co which has previously been postulated by cadet et al 1999 then results in the formation of tp 3 ms2 experiments of tp 3 exhibited the same main fragment 146 0328 da as tp 2 tp 4 146 0328 da is formed by oxidation and subsequent cleavage of the ribose nucleobase bond of tp 3 ms2 experiments showed the cleavage of h2o2 indicating that tp 4 should be a cyclic hydantoin hydroperoxide si table 1 flyunt et al 2002 furthermore oxidation of tp 3 presumably leads to formation of tp 9 via an intramolecular oxidation of the amide carbonyl function resulting in most likely im4 an 1 2 dioxetane shimomura 2005 subsequently cleavage of the o o and c c bonds results in an unstable carbamic acid and acetyl derived amine im5 releases co2 forming tp 9 revealing the instability of dioxetanes under standard conditions vacher et al 2018 furthermore the formation of additional tps indicated that reaction of ozone with zdv and thy also result in heterolytic cleavage of the ozonide intermediates im2 3 followed by hydrolysis and or cleavage of hydrogen peroxide im6 7 leading to the pyruvic derivate tp 5 the most intense fragment observed in ms2 experiments of tp 5 showed the loss of pyruvic amide si table 2 on one hand a formal loss of carbon monoxide then leads to tp 6 which could also be formed by cleavage of the hydroperoxide tp 3 the cyclic hydantoin derivative and the linear urea derivative are tautomeric to each other although published results suggested that the equilibrium should be on the side of the cyclic hydantoin derivative hemiaminals tend to cleave into its linear tautomer iwasawa et al 2007 hence results did not allow for identifying the predominant tautomer on the other hand cleavage of methylglyoxal from tp 5 revealed the formation of the formyl urea derivative tp 8 the loss of the formyl group of tp 8 led to tp 7 whereas tp 10 is formed from the loss of formyl amide in comparison to results from literature flyunt et al 2002 girault et al 1994 our analytical approach using a direct injection hrms method allowed to experimentally confirming the formation of tp 2 tp 4 and tp 5 which have not been identified as ozonation products of thy before the proposed pathway for thy is in accordance with tps identified and suggested by girault et al 1994 cadet et al 1999 and flyunt et al 2002 and synthesizes the current knowledge about the different reaction mechanisms the obtained results demonstrate that the pathway proposed for thy can be transferred directly to zdv indicating that the azide moiety has no significant impact on the degradation mechanism it should be noted that the reactions of zdv and thy with other oxidants such as permanganate or hydroxyl radicals lead to similar tps kulkarni et al 2016 theruvathu et al 2001 wagner et al 1994 ozonation experiments in wwtp effluent with spiked zdv 5 mg l 1 revealed the formation of the same tps as observed in buffered ultrapure water with highest peak areas obtained for tp 7 8 10 fig 3 temporal trends of tps from ozonation of zdv and thy revealed that all identified tps are present in the first sampling point after 30 s stirring as shown in si figs 1 and 2 within eight hours most of the tps showed decreasing peak areas pa most likely resulting from their continuous degradation in solution in addition to reactions with ozone most described reactions could also be attributed to hydrolysis for example hydantoins and imides have hydrolysis half lives of hours e g shown for the pesticides iprodione and flumioxazine authority 2014 2016 organic bound azides will not be degraded using ozonation emitting a slightly mutagenic potential into the environment matsumura et al 1995 it is remarkable that organic hydroperoxides were scarcely identified with direct injection lc hrms methods ito et al 2015 2020 furthermore ozonation transformation processes could result in the same products as naturally occurring oxidation reactions in the human body as the urea tp 7a and formamide tp 10a of thy were found as potential lesion of dna rna resulting from ros reactions cadet et al 2012 irvoas et al 2014 toga et al 2009 4 conclusion ozonation of zdv and thy followed the same transformation pathway starting with the ozone attack at the c c double bond based on this activation zdv and thy formed nine equivalent tps each all transformation reactions took place at the nucleobase the riboside moiety was not attacked the azide moiety of zdv and hydroxyl moiety of thy remained inert and had no major impact on the reaction mechanisms three of the nine tps were identified as hydroperoxides remarkably the hrms method was able to measure these reactive compounds via direct injection as fragmentation experiments showed the loss of h2o2 the proposed pathway led to an acetamide tp a formamide tp and a urea tp as endpoints based on newly identified and previously reported tps a comprehensive mechanistic pathway for the reaction of thymidine with ozone was obtained all reactions of the transformation pathway could also be attributed to a biotic hydrolysis reactions thus ozonation was capable of activating compounds being stable in biological treatments the present study revealed the necessity to identify transformation products of antiviral drugs formed during ozonation an in depth understanding of oxidation reactions can lead to a better evaluation of potential effects on the environment declaration

19962,wastewater reclamation and reuse have been practically applied to water stressed regions but waterborne pathogens remaining in insufficiently treated wastewater are of concern sanitation safety planning adopts the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp approach to manage human health risks upon exposure to reclaimed wastewater haccp requires a predetermined reference value critical limit cl at critical control points ccps in which specific parameters are monitored and recorded in real time a disinfection reactor of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp is regarded as a ccp and one of the ccp parameters is the disinfection intensity e g initial disinfectant concentration and contact time which is proportional to the log reduction value lrv of waterborne pathogens however the achievable lrvs are not always stable because the disinfection intensity is affected by water quality parameters which vary among wwtps in this study we established models for projecting virus lrvs using ozone in which water quality and operational parameters were used as explanatory variables for the model construction we used five machine learning algorithms and found that automatic relevance determination with interaction terms resulted in better prediction performances for norovirus and rotavirus lrvs poliovirus and coxsackievirus lrvs were predicted well by a bayesian ridge with interaction terms and lasso with quadratic terms respectively the established models were relatively robust to predict lrv using new datasets that were out of the range of the training data used here but it is important to collect lrv datasets further to make the models more predictable and flexible for newly obtained datasets the modeling framework proposed here can help wwtp operators and risk assessors determine the appropriate cl to protect human health in wastewater reclamation and reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords log reduction value ozone disinfection waterborne viruses regularized regression analyses hierarchical bayesian modeling 1 introduction water shortages are a critical global concern and endanger human lives all over the world wastewater reclamation and reuse have significantly contributed to the improvement of the accessibility of safe water but waterborne viruses such as norovirus rotavirus adenovirus and enterovirus have been detected from effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps subahir et al 2019 hoque et al 2018 croker et al 2018 bauri et al 2019 li et al 2018 silva sales et al 2020 katayama et al 2008 adeifisove et al 2016 shlindwein et al 2010 the risk of viral infection to humans including users of reclaimed wastewater needs to be addressed because waterborne viruses in wastewater have imposed a significant disease burden on human society utsumi et al 2020 subahir et al 2019 hoque et al 2018 croker et al 2018 bauri et al 2019 li et al 2018 international and domestic guidelines for wastewater reclamation and reuse employ the multiple barrier concept to address the waterborne disease risk in the usage of reclaimed wastewater in which the target log reduction value lrv of waterborne pathogens is determined beforehand and the target lrv is allocated to each step at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp ito et al 2017 sano et al 2016 the world health organization who has recommended applying sanitation safety planning ssp to the safe use of excreta wastewater and greywater and the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp approach is employed in ssp in order to manage human health risks upon exposure to reclaimed wastewater who 2006 and 2015 the haccp approach includes the identification of critical control points ccps which are important operational steps to determine the magnitude of hazardous factors in the final products u s fda 1997 the parameters at the ccp are monitored and recorded in real time in addition the parameters are compared to reference values called critical limit cl to maintain the safety of final products u s fda 1997 the corrective action needs to take place when the parameters monitored at ccp deviate from cl the disinfection intensity determined by some operational parameters such as ct value in a disinfection reactor is suitable as a ccp parameter at wwtps since it determines the lrv of waterborne pathogens at a disinfection reactor however an application of ssp to the wwtp operation is difficult at present since a universal method for cl determination has not yet been developed in addition the difference in water quality among wwtps makes it difficult to establish a universal approach that determines the cls appropriate for respective wwtps because chemical disinfectants are consumed by contaminants in wastewater and the decay of disinfectant concentration results in deviation from the expected disinfection intensity thus the disinfection intensity that achieves the target lrv needs to be determined by taking water quality and operational information at each wwtp into account previously we proposed the concept of predictive water virology in which the models predicted virus lrv by using water quality and operational parameters as explanatory variables kadoya et al 2019 the predictive water virology enables us to derive the appropriate cl to attain the target lrv under site specific water quality kadoya et al 2019 and 2020 previously proposed the concept of predictive water virology and reported that the predictive inactivation models based on hierarchical bayesian modeling hbm and regularized regressions flexibly correspond to the changes and variety in water quality parameters among wwtps e g seasonal variation predictive water virology can help us understand the required operational conditions to achieve the target lrv in which there is no gap between the predicted and target lrvs however these previous studies were limited in their predictions of newly obtained datasets that are not used for model construction in other words we need to know the predictable range of present models and identify which algorithms are more robust to predict lrvs using new datasets basic regularized regression analyses are ridge lasso and elastic net regressions in which the multicollinearity problem is solved and thus all explanatory variables can be used all these regression approaches are extended versions of the least square method by adding a regularization term corresponding to each algorithm the ridge regression shrinks absolute values of the coefficients of model variables hoerl and kennard 1970 whereas the lasso regression makes the coefficients of inessential variables zero with a decrease in the magnitude of model variables tibshirani 1996 the elastic net regression combines regularized terms used in both the ridge and lasso regressions zou and hastie 2006 the lasso and elastic net regressions are classified into the sparse estimation which selects the plausibly essential variables in bayesian regularized regression bayesian ridge and automatic relevance determination ard an objective variable is assumed to be expressed as gaussian functions and regularization terms are then estimated as hyperparameters by bayes rule a bayesian ridge employs all explanatory variables as well as basic ridge regression whereas ard is also one of the sparse estimations tipping 2001 previous studies have applied several machine learning algorithms to establish predictive models for water quality and rainfall runoff park et al 2018 lu and ma 2020 safari et al 2020 but the predictive inactivation models for waterborne viruses which are based on bayesian regularized regression analyses using water quality and operational parameters have not been reported in this study we introduced the bayesian regularized regression analysis into the predictive water virology to explore appropriate algorithms which indicated the best prediction performance and were capable of predicting newly obtained datasets and avoiding overfitting to training datasets we here have focused on inactivation datasets related to ozone which is one of disinfectants effective for inactivation of waterborne viruses roy et al 1981 kim et al 1980 and is utilized at many wwtps hembach et al 2019 kharel et al 2020 wang et al 2018 we first collected peer reviewed articles following a systematic review method and extracted lrv datasets with water quality and operational information from water disinfection experiments using ozone we applied three regularized regressions ridge lasso and elastic net and two bayesian regularized regressions bayesian ridge and ard to construct the predictive inactivation models and then verified the prediction performance and overfitting problem based on two validation approaches 1 the models constructed by training datasets 80 of total dataset predicted test datasets 20 of total dataset for evaluation of the prediction performance and 2 one article was selected and its dataset was used as a test dataset which had no relation to the training datasets to confirm whether the model overfitted we then tried to combine the best regularized regression based models with hbm which took experimental errors and virus type dependent sensitivity into account kadoya et al 2019 finally we provided the applicable range of explanatory variables to help readers obtain more precise prediction values and the required disinfection conditions under the water quality level to achieve 4 lrv which has been recommended by the usepa usepa 1999 2 methods 2 1 systematic review and data collection peer reviewed articles relating to virus inactivation using ozone were collected using google scholar from april 2019 to june 2020 following prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 the keywords input to google scholar were disinfection and ozone combined with keywords of each virus species norovirus rotavirus poliovirus adenovirus hepatitis a virus coxsackievirus and echovirus and we checked all records published from 1950 to 2020 dissertations book chapters reviews conference reports and non english articles were eliminated from the collected articles first screening we read whole texts in the first screened records and the articles relevant to this study aim which included the information about the virus lrv and ozone disinfection conditions such as contact time initial concentration and ct value were then selected from the first screened records to establish models using the highly qualified datasets we assumed that lrvs must be differentiated under varied conditions of disinfection in well performed experiments in which water quality and operational parameters were strictly controlled if the lrvs were same in spite of distinct disinfection conditions the datasets were excluded the process of systematic review was fulfilled by three persons the lrv was expressed as below 1 l r v l o g 10 n 0 n t where n 0 is virus concentration at time 0 and n t is that at time t imagej software was used to extract numerical datasets of the lrv from figures such as an inactivation curve shneider et al 2012 additionally we obtained water quality and operational parameters such as initial ozone concentration i mg l decay rate of ozone concentration k min 1 contact time t min ct value c min mg l ph p temperature t c

water and log10 initial virus concentration v log10 genome copy number pfu or mpn ml virus types s were also extracted from the collected articles table s1 of which rotavirus and coxsackievirus were used as categorical variables because they are the only two types that were tested in the articles when datasets did not include ct values we calculated them by an integration of the disinfectant decay formula eq 2 2 c t i exp k t where c t is ozone concentration at time t min i is initial concentration of ozone and k is the decay constant of ozone concentration in water 2 2 basic regularized

polynomialfeatures function of the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 in python 3 7 regularized regression analysis requires a standardization of explanatory variables mean 0 and standard deviation 1 which was performed by the function standardscaler in scikit learn library the response variable lrvs y were expressed as a linear function 3 y xŒ≤ Œµ where y is a matrix of response

min Œ≤ is a minimization function for Œ≤ Œª is the regularization parameter and a regularization term r Œ≤ determines which regularization methods are used for constructing models r Œ≤ for ridge regression is expressed as 1 2 Œ≤ 2 2 Œ≤ 2 2 i 1 n Œ≤ i 2 hoerl and kennard 1970 while for lasso regression Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 1 i 1 n Œ≤ i is applied tibshirani 1996 elastic net regression combines the r Œ≤ of ridge and lasso regressions Œ± Œ≤ 2 2 1 Œ± Œ≤ 1 where Œ± determines the proportion of the ridge to the lasso regression zou and hastie 2006 suitable values of two parameters Œª and Œ± were concurrently searched from 10 6 to 102 and from 0 to 1 respectively using the grid search method that enumerated all combinations of those parameters and identify an appropriate combination the standardization of variables and the addition of regularization term can ensure the homoscedasticity of errors 2 3 bayesian regularized regression analysis regularization parameters are determined not by fitting to data but by the random procedure in the grid search method as described above bayesian regularized regression analysis enables us to estimate regularization parameters with coefficients of regression models by fitting to data and can avoid overfitting by making the model less complex tipping 2001 the coefficient Œ≤ follows a spherical gaussian distribution in bayesian ridge regression analysis and two regularization parameters f and œÉ 2 are given by gamma distributions as prior distributions tipping 2001 bishop 2006 in this case the likelihood of y is expressed as 5 p y

maximizing the logarithmic posterior distribution ln p Œ≤ y is equal to the minimization of a regularization term automatic relevance determination ard employs the elliptical gaussian distribution for a prior distribution of Œ≤ and follows the same procedure of bayesian ridge regression tipping 2001 bishop 2006 these bayesian regularized regression analyses were also conducted by the scikit learn library in python 3 7 codes and source data are available in the supplementary materials 2 4 hierarchical bayesian modeling we adopted probability distributions specific to the objective variables lrv based on akaike s information criterion aic using the fitdistrplus packages of r software delignette muller and dutang 2015 the population parameter shaping the probability distribution y was described as a logarithmic link function because the lrv datasets followed a weibull or gamma distribution table s2 the logarithmic link function is expressed as below 9 l o g e y Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ e x where Œ≤ 0 is an intercept Œ≤ e is a matrix of coefficients and x is a design matrix we assumed that lrvs involved an experimental error and the matrix of coefficients was indexed e the Œ≤ e was assumed to follow a normal distribution because of experimental error 10 Œ≤ e n o r m a l Œº st i œÉ e where œÉ e is a standard deviation generating variations among inactivation experiments and Œº st i is a mean of virus type i which implies the type dependent sensitivity to ozone the virus type dependent parameter Œº st i also follows a normal distribution 11 Œº st i n o r m a l Œº o œÉ s t where Œº o is the averaged mean among all virus types and œÉ st is the standard deviation bearing the type dependent sensitivity the hierarchical bayesian models were constructed by two approaches that employed explanatory variables selected by the best regularized regression models or variance inflation factor vif a multicollinearity problem possibly remained in the hbm so the models that removed an explanatory variable having more than 10 vif values were prepared hbm was conducted on r software version 3 5 0 https www r project org and stan https mc stan org 2 5 model validation we conducted two trials to determine which regularized regression algorithms exhibited the best prediction performance and escaped overfitting to training datasets in trial 1 we randomly separated total datasets into training 80 and test datasets 20 to evaluate the prediction powers for interpolation in trial 2 the datasets derived from an article were used as test datasets which resulted in no relationship between training and test datasets and enabled us to understand the predictability for extrapolation both trials adopted leave one out loo cross validation in which temporal models were repeatedly generated using n 1 training datasets n is the number of training datasets and a remaining dataset was used for model validations the coefficients were the averaged values of the generated n models to evaluate the prediction performance we calculated mean squared values mses we also generated a number of the predicted lrvs by changing stepwise some explanatory variables having a higher coefficient to explore the out of predictable range in which a model generated obviously wrong prediction values such as a negative lrv 3 results 3 1 article collection and data characteristics we first identified 10102 records according to a systematic review method dissertations book chapters reviews and non english articles were eliminated from the list of the first collected articles which resulted in a decrease to 4058 articles after excluding the articles not relevant to our study e g no information about the lrv and no water disinfection 21 articles remained in detail the numbers of screened articles for norovirus rotavirus poliovirus coxsackievirus echovirus and adenovirus were 6 4 12 4 3 and 2 respectively the numbers of lrv data point were 68 norovirus 65 rotavirus 182

map index html and previous studies suggest that more than 50 datasets should be analyzed cui and gong 2018 leonard et al 2017 so we excluded echovirus and adenovirus data from our analyses water quality and operational parameters were also extracted from the screened articles initial concentrations of ozone i are mostly less than 5 mg l fig 1 i and the decay constant k is described only in articles for norovirus fig 1 k data points of the contact time t gather around lower values but a part of the data for rotavirus and poliovirus was distributed around 10 min fig 1 t ct values c were not listed in articles about rotavirus and poliovirus fig 1 c the articles about coxsackievirus listed c but included no descriptions of i the values of ph p are centered around 7 1 fig 1 p and almost all disinfection experiments are conducted at room temperature around 20 c or 4 c fig 1 t purified water like a buffer was mainly used for disinfection tests fig 1 w infectivity assay plaque assay or mpn method is one of the main methods to measure virus concentration fig 1 a1 and a2 initial log virus concentration ranges from approximately four to eight fig 1 v since the collected studies used only two types of rotavirus and coxsackievirus table 1 and table s1 the types were regarded as an explanatory variable in the regularized regression analyses taken together the number of explanatory variables was 9 norovirus 8 rotavirus 7 poliovirus and 7 coxsackievirus table 1 3 2 the prediction performance of regularized regression models in trial 1 based on training datasets randomly split from the total dataset predictive inactivation models for four virus species were constructed mses for both training and test datasets were calculated to identify the best algorithms for the lrv prediction and the required polynomial terms fig 2 the addition of higher terms to the norovirus inactivation model made prediction performances for both datasets better than only linear terms and decreased the differences of mses between training and test data Œ¥mse msetrain msetest except for ridge regression also mses decreased by adding interaction terms to the rotavirus inactivation models whereas Œ¥mses in the models with only linear terms were lower among models for predicting poliovirus lrv the ridge regression with polynomial terms indicated the best prediction performance and bayesian regularized regression based models with higher terms also showed smaller mses the coxsackievirus inactivation models were improved very slightly by the addition of polynomial terms and the ridge based model with linear terms had the smallest Œ¥mse the algorithms providing better prediction performance were ard with interaction terms norovirus and rotavirus and ridge with interaction terms poliovirus and coxsackievirus at this time 3 3 the prediction performance for new datasets trial 2 in trial 1 there could be relationships between training and test datasets which made it difficult to confirm the ability to predict newly obtained datasets therefore we selected datasets extracted from an article as test datasets in trial 2 to validate the models appropriate for predicting new datasets not related to training datasets the model indicating smaller mse and Œ¥mse is preferable for the predictive inactivation model in norovirus models lasso and elastic net with linear terms and ard with interaction terms indicated smaller mse and Œ¥mse fig 3 only ard with interaction terms in rotavirus models seemed to avoid the overfitting problem all poliovirus models had very small Œ¥mse and smaller mses and bayesian regularized regressions with polynomial terms slightly improved prediction performances the coxsackievirus model based on lasso regression with quadratic terms had lower mses and Œ¥mse 3 4 the best predictive inactivation models and their characteristics taken together with the results from trial 1 and 2 the best predictive inactivation models were ard with interaction terms for norovirus and rotavirus bayesian ridge with interaction terms for poliovirus and lasso with quadratic terms for coxsackievirus table 3 comparative results for observed and predicted lrvs indicated that not only training datasets but also many of the test datasets were predicted well by the best models but some predicted values two test data of norovirus in trial 2 both training and test data of coxsackievirus in trial 1 and 2 largely deviated from the observed values fig 4 many of prediction values tended to be on the y x line and some were randomly deviated from the line i e residuals are distributed randomly which indicates the independence of residuals the estimated coefficients of explanatory variables in the best prediction models are displayed in fig 5 except for the poliovirus model the number of explanatory variables decreased because of the sparse estimations all models had the variables directly related to the disinfection condition such as i c and t indicating that they are essential to explain lrvs other water quality parameters are also included in the best models although some of them are interaction terms 3 5 no improvement of the prediction performance by hbm we designed vif based and regularized regression based hierarchical bayesian models table s3 and compared mse values among them table 2 the hierarchical bayesian models based on regularized regression analyses showed higher prediction performances than those based on vif however the prediction performances in hbm for test datasets of norovirus poliovirus and coxsackievirus were lower than the best regularized regression models indicating that the hbm did not contribute to an improvement of the predictive inactivation models using ozone figs s1 and 2 3 6 identification of disinfection conditions achieving 4lrv and unpredictable ranges the lrvs were generated using the major variables indicated in fig 5 to identify the predictable ranges in the models constructed and the disinfection conditions that achieved 4lrv for all simulations we set fixed values based on a practical wwtp in sendai city japan according to the seasonal prevalence of the viruses summer poliovirus and coxsackievirus winter norovirus and rotavirus the p slightly affected the 4lrv achievement fig 6 a but as the k increased the 4lrv was achieved easily fig 6b which does not seem to be intuitive since a high value of k reduced the effectiveness of ozone disinfection the rotavirus model clearly demonstrated the out of predictable ranges in certain i values fig 6c d as well as norovirus the p had a small effect on the lrv in the poliovirus model fig 7 a but the higher t made it difficult to achieve the 4lrv in a disinfection reactor fig 7b the linear relationship between i and t was likely to be found fig 7c the coxsackievirus model also indicated unpredictable regions and higher p and t made it easy to achieve 4lrv fig 7d e 4 discussion in this study we constructed ozone inactivation models predicting virus lrv by regularized regression analyses the best performances for predicting norovirus and rotavirus lrvs were found in ard with interaction terms in which overfitting to training datasets could be avoided figs 2 4 and table 3 bayesian ridge with interaction terms and lasso with quadratic terms indicated the best prediction performance for poliovirus and coxsackievirus respectively and had the ability to predict new datasets not relevant to the training dataset figs 2 4 and table 3 however some test and training datasets have still not been predicted well fig 4 and the hbm did not improve the prediction performances table 2 we also provided information about the unpredictable range of some variables and the desirable disinfection condition for the achievement of 4lrv figs 6 and 7 the conventional kinetics of disinfection for viruses such as the chick watson hom and efficiency factor hom efh models use only disinfection parameters disinfectant concentration contact time and decay constant as model parameters chick 1908 watson 1908 hom 1972 haas and joffe 1994 boehm et al established the predictive model for the natural decay of enteric viruses in which several water quality parameters were used as explanatory variables and found the larger effects of water quality on natural decay rates boehm et al 2019 the disinfection intensity of ozone is also affected by water quality parameters as the decay rate of ozone increases at higher temperatures sohn et al 2004 classical models are likely to be inadequate to predict lrvs under varied water quality status but predictive water virology provides more practical models for lrv prediction using disinfectants because some operational and water quality information can be incorporated into the model fig 5 the selection of explanatory variables is critical for model construction abdul wahab et al 2005 in fact sparse estimation which is applied for the predictive inactivation models except for poliovirus implies a mitigation of overfitting to training datasets fig 3 although an addition of polynomial terms is required to improve prediction performances ozone is generally consumed by organic contaminants in water park et al 2001 and the established models lack variables related to disinfectant consuming substances e g doc and ss sohn et al 2004 du et al 2020 so the polynomial terms might compensate for the missing but essential variables however in this study only the small number of variables was available and thus an addition of polynomial terms does not always support the prediction which might attribute to the lack of fit to some datasets to predict lrvs that are not predicted well with current models fig 4 other types of water quality information needs to be incorporated into our models the collection of datasets that completely involve water quality information is required to improve the prediction performance which may be achievable by establishing a widely accessible database that includes datasets provided from laboratories and wwtps such as global water pathogen project gwpp https www waterpathogens org if water quality information is difficult to prepare the ct value that is calculated using a decay constant can be a substitution of disinfectant consuming matters kadoya et al 2019 additionally we are able to construct the robust regularized regression based models that exclude outliers from an estimation of model coefficients by using other machine learning algorithms e g random sample consensus theil sen estimator fischler and bolles 1981 dang et al 2008 predictive water virology helps us identify the water quality and operational conditions that are required for 4lrv but the models established here have to be updated continuously because the out of predictable range has remained large figs 6 and 7 the lrvs for norovirus rotavirus and poliovirus are relatively stable under near neutral ph levels figs 6 and 7 which is consistent with previous reports lin et al 2014 meng et al 1987 ward and ashley 1979 on the other hand coxsackievirus lrvs are positively proportional to the ph value since coxsackievirus is easily inactivated by higher ph mcgeady et al 1979 although waterborne viruses are easily inactivated with higher temperatures moresco et al 2016 biziagos et al 1988 the model implies that poliovirus is inactivated more easily with low temperatures which may be attributable to a data bias e g small datasets using low temperature in which higher lrvs are observed also as shown in fig 6b an unintuitive result that the lrv became high as decay rate k increased is likely to be explained by the data bias owing to the small number of low k values fig 1 thus virus lrv datasets obtained under various water quality conditions need to be collected to eliminate the data bias and expand the predictable range of models the predictive inactivation models established here are mostly based on datasets obtained in bench scale experiments so the models need to be carefully applied to lrv prediction at real scale plants in practice there can be uncertainty related to hydraulics for example heterogeneity of doc concentration which is caused by the degree of incomplete mixing could affect the decay of ozone concentration and the ct value also under the mixing effect at a wwtp water quality parameters need to be expressed using probability distributions sin et al 2009 and 2011 again the model limitation must be solved by preparing a high quality database of virus lrv in which water quality parameters at wwtp are deposited alternatively the prediction performance is developed by making the regularized regression based models with explanatory variables that are expressed using probability distributions several descriptions about the cl determination at wwtps are available in the literature but we do not have a common and flexible approach for such a determination hallowell 2014 the current models for the lrv prediction help us determine the cl at the disinfection step at any wwtps the accepted concentration of virus in effluent is determined so as to correspond to the reference values of tolerable infectious risk and disease burden e g daly loss per person per year usepa 1990 who 2017 when a probability distribution of virus concentration in influent is known the accepted virus concentration in effluent derives the target lrv ito et al 2017 the operational and water quality parameters at wwtps are monitored and then we can apply the predictive inactivation models established in this study to determine the cl which retains the target lrv 5 conclusions under the concept of predictive water virology we provided the ozone inactivation models for waterborne viruses which enable operators at a wwtp and risk assessors to determine the cl at the disinfection reactor the proposed models are useful for predicting lrvs that are affected by some water quality parameters within the predictable range and to make the models predictable we need to continue to collect water quality information with lrv data and then update the

19962,wastewater reclamation and reuse have been practically applied to water stressed regions but waterborne pathogens remaining in insufficiently treated wastewater are of concern sanitation safety planning adopts the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp approach to manage human health risks upon exposure to reclaimed wastewater haccp requires a predetermined reference value critical limit cl at critical control points ccps in which specific parameters are monitored and recorded in real time a disinfection reactor of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp is regarded as a ccp and one of the ccp parameters is the disinfection intensity e g initial disinfectant concentration and contact time which is proportional to the log reduction value lrv of waterborne pathogens however the achievable lrvs are not always stable because the disinfection intensity is affected by water quality parameters which vary among wwtps in this study we established models for projecting virus lrvs using ozone in which water quality and operational parameters were used as explanatory variables for the model construction we used five machine learning algorithms and found that automatic relevance determination with interaction terms resulted in better prediction performances for norovirus and rotavirus lrvs poliovirus and coxsackievirus lrvs were predicted well by a bayesian ridge with interaction terms and lasso with quadratic terms respectively the established models were relatively robust to predict lrv using new datasets that were out of the range of the training data used here but it is important to collect lrv datasets further to make the models more predictable and flexible for newly obtained datasets the modeling framework proposed here can help wwtp operators and risk assessors determine the appropriate cl to protect human health in wastewater reclamation and reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords log reduction value ozone disinfection waterborne viruses regularized regression analyses hierarchical bayesian modeling 1 introduction water shortages are a critical global concern and endanger human lives all over the world wastewater reclamation and reuse have significantly contributed to the improvement of the accessibility of safe water but waterborne viruses such as norovirus rotavirus adenovirus and enterovirus have been detected from effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps subahir et al 2019 hoque et al 2018 croker et al 2018 bauri et al 2019 li et al 2018 silva sales et al 2020 katayama et al 2008 adeifisove et al 2016 shlindwein et al 2010 the risk of viral infection to humans including users of reclaimed wastewater needs to be addressed because waterborne viruses in wastewater have imposed a significant disease burden on human society utsumi et al 2020 subahir et al 2019 hoque et al 2018 croker et al 2018 bauri et al 2019 li et al 2018 international and domestic guidelines for wastewater reclamation and reuse employ the multiple barrier concept to address the waterborne disease risk in the usage of reclaimed wastewater in which the target log reduction value lrv of waterborne pathogens is determined beforehand and the target lrv is allocated to each step at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp ito et al 2017 sano et al 2016 the world health organization who has recommended applying sanitation safety planning ssp to the safe use of excreta wastewater and greywater and the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp approach is employed in ssp in order to manage human health risks upon exposure to reclaimed wastewater who 2006 and 2015 the haccp approach includes the identification of critical control points ccps which are important operational steps to determine the magnitude of hazardous factors in the final products u s fda 1997 the parameters at the ccp are monitored and recorded in real time in addition the parameters are compared to reference values called critical limit cl to maintain the safety of final products u s fda 1997 the corrective action needs to take place when the parameters monitored at ccp deviate from cl the disinfection intensity determined by some operational parameters such as ct value in a disinfection reactor is suitable as a ccp parameter at wwtps since it determines the lrv of waterborne pathogens at a disinfection reactor however an application of ssp to the wwtp operation is difficult at present since a universal method for cl determination has not yet been developed in addition the difference in water quality among wwtps makes it difficult to establish a universal approach that determines the cls appropriate for respective wwtps because chemical disinfectants are consumed by contaminants in wastewater and the decay of disinfectant concentration results in deviation from the expected disinfection intensity thus the disinfection intensity that achieves the target lrv needs to be determined by taking water quality and operational information at each wwtp into account previously we proposed the concept of predictive water virology in which the models predicted virus lrv by using water quality and operational parameters as explanatory variables kadoya et al 2019 the predictive water virology enables us to derive the appropriate cl to attain the target lrv under site specific water quality kadoya et al 2019 and 2020 previously proposed the concept of predictive water virology and reported that the predictive inactivation models based on hierarchical bayesian modeling hbm and regularized regressions flexibly correspond to the changes and variety in water quality parameters among wwtps e g seasonal variation predictive water virology can help us understand the required operational conditions to achieve the target lrv in which there is no gap between the predicted and target lrvs however these previous studies were limited in their predictions of newly obtained datasets that are not used for model construction in other words we need to know the predictable range of present models and identify which algorithms are more robust to predict lrvs using new datasets basic regularized regression analyses are ridge lasso and elastic net regressions in which the multicollinearity problem is solved and thus all explanatory variables can be used all these regression approaches are extended versions of the least square method by adding a regularization term corresponding to each algorithm the ridge regression shrinks absolute values of the coefficients of model variables hoerl and kennard 1970 whereas the lasso regression makes the coefficients of inessential variables zero with a decrease in the magnitude of model variables tibshirani 1996 the elastic net regression combines regularized terms used in both the ridge and lasso regressions zou and hastie 2006 the lasso and elastic net regressions are classified into the sparse estimation which selects the plausibly essential variables in bayesian regularized regression bayesian ridge and automatic relevance determination ard an objective variable is assumed to be expressed as gaussian functions and regularization terms are then estimated as hyperparameters by bayes rule a bayesian ridge employs all explanatory variables as well as basic ridge regression whereas ard is also one of the sparse estimations tipping 2001 previous studies have applied several machine learning algorithms to establish predictive models for water quality and rainfall runoff park et al 2018 lu and ma 2020 safari et al 2020 but the predictive inactivation models for waterborne viruses which are based on bayesian regularized regression analyses using water quality and operational parameters have not been reported in this study we introduced the bayesian regularized regression analysis into the predictive water virology to explore appropriate algorithms which indicated the best prediction performance and were capable of predicting newly obtained datasets and avoiding overfitting to training datasets we here have focused on inactivation datasets related to ozone which is one of disinfectants effective for inactivation of waterborne viruses roy et al 1981 kim et al 1980 and is utilized at many wwtps hembach et al 2019 kharel et al 2020 wang et al 2018 we first collected peer reviewed articles following a systematic review method and extracted lrv datasets with water quality and operational information from water disinfection experiments using ozone we applied three regularized regressions ridge lasso and elastic net and two bayesian regularized regressions bayesian ridge and ard to construct the predictive inactivation models and then verified the prediction performance and overfitting problem based on two validation approaches 1 the models constructed by training datasets 80 of total dataset predicted test datasets 20 of total dataset for evaluation of the prediction performance and 2 one article was selected and its dataset was used as a test dataset which had no relation to the training datasets to confirm whether the model overfitted we then tried to combine the best regularized regression based models with hbm which took experimental errors and virus type dependent sensitivity into account kadoya et al 2019 finally we provided the applicable range of explanatory variables to help readers obtain more precise prediction values and the required disinfection conditions under the water quality level to achieve 4 lrv which has been recommended by the usepa usepa 1999 2 methods 2 1 systematic review and data collection peer reviewed articles relating to virus inactivation using ozone were collected using google scholar from april 2019 to june 2020 following prisma guidelines moher et al 2009 the keywords input to google scholar were disinfection and ozone combined with keywords of each virus species norovirus rotavirus poliovirus adenovirus hepatitis a virus coxsackievirus and echovirus and we checked all records published from 1950 to 2020 dissertations book chapters reviews conference reports and non english articles were eliminated from the collected articles first screening we read whole texts in the first screened records and the articles relevant to this study aim which included the information about the virus lrv and ozone disinfection conditions such as contact time initial concentration and ct value were then selected from the first screened records to establish models using the highly qualified datasets we assumed that lrvs must be differentiated under varied conditions of disinfection in well performed experiments in which water quality and operational parameters were strictly controlled if the lrvs were same in spite of distinct disinfection conditions the datasets were excluded the process of systematic review was fulfilled by three persons the lrv was expressed as below 1 l r v l o g 10 n 0 n t where n 0 is virus concentration at time 0 and n t is that at time t imagej software was used to extract numerical datasets of the lrv from figures such as an inactivation curve shneider et al 2012 additionally we obtained water quality and operational parameters such as initial ozone concentration i mg l decay rate of ozone concentration k min 1 contact time t min ct value c min mg l ph p temperature t c

water and log10 initial virus concentration v log10 genome copy number pfu or mpn ml virus types s were also extracted from the collected articles table s1 of which rotavirus and coxsackievirus were used as categorical variables because they are the only two types that were tested in the articles when datasets did not include ct values we calculated them by an integration of the disinfectant decay formula eq 2 2 c t i exp k t where c t is ozone concentration at time t min i is initial concentration of ozone and k is the decay constant of ozone concentration in water 2 2 basic regularized

polynomialfeatures function of the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 in python 3 7 regularized regression analysis requires a standardization of explanatory variables mean 0 and standard

min Œ≤ is a minimization function for Œ≤ Œª is the regularization parameter and a regularization term r Œ≤ determines which regularization methods are used for constructing models r Œ≤ for ridge regression is expressed as 1 2 Œ≤ 2 2 Œ≤ 2 2 i 1 n Œ≤ i 2 hoerl and kennard 1970 while for lasso regression Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 1 i 1 n Œ≤ i is applied tibshirani 1996 elastic net regression combines the r Œ≤ of ridge and lasso regressions Œ± Œ≤ 2 2 1 Œ± Œ≤ 1 where Œ± determines the proportion of the ridge to the lasso regression zou and hastie 2006 suitable values of two parameters Œª and Œ± were concurrently searched from 10 6 to 102 and from 0 to 1 respectively using the grid search method that enumerated all combinations of those parameters and identify an appropriate combination the standardization of variables and the addition of regularization term can ensure the homoscedasticity of errors 2 3 bayesian regularized regression analysis regularization parameters are determined not by fitting to data but by the random procedure in the grid search method as described above bayesian regularized regression analysis enables us to estimate regularization parameters with coefficients of regression models by fitting to data and can avoid overfitting by making the model less complex tipping 2001 the coefficient Œ≤ follows a spherical gaussian distribution in bayesian ridge

maximizing the logarithmic posterior distribution ln p Œ≤ y is equal to the minimization of a regularization term automatic relevance determination ard employs the elliptical gaussian distribution for a prior distribution of Œ≤ and follows the same procedure of bayesian ridge regression tipping 2001 bishop 2006 these bayesian regularized regression analyses were also conducted by the scikit learn library in python 3 7 codes and source data are available in the supplementary materials 2 4 hierarchical bayesian modeling we adopted probability distributions specific to the objective variables lrv based on akaike s information criterion aic using the fitdistrplus packages of r software delignette muller and dutang 2015 the population parameter shaping the probability distribution y was described as a logarithmic link function because the lrv datasets followed a weibull or gamma distribution table s2 the logarithmic link function is expressed as below 9 l o g e y Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ e x where Œ≤ 0 is an intercept Œ≤ e is a matrix of coefficients and x is a design matrix we assumed that lrvs involved an experimental error and the matrix of coefficients was indexed e the Œ≤ e was assumed to follow a normal distribution because of experimental error 10 Œ≤ e n o r m a l Œº st i œÉ e where œÉ e is a standard deviation generating variations among inactivation experiments and Œº st i is a mean of virus type i which implies the type dependent sensitivity to ozone the virus type dependent parameter Œº st i also follows a normal distribution 11 Œº st i n o r m a l Œº o œÉ s t where Œº o is the averaged mean among all virus types and œÉ st is the standard deviation bearing the type dependent sensitivity the hierarchical bayesian models were constructed by two approaches that employed explanatory variables selected by the best regularized regression models or variance inflation factor vif a multicollinearity problem possibly remained in the hbm so the models that removed an explanatory variable having more than 10 vif values were prepared hbm was conducted on r software version 3 5 0 https www r project org and stan https mc stan org 2 5 model validation we conducted two trials to determine which regularized regression algorithms exhibited the best prediction performance and escaped overfitting to training datasets in trial 1 we randomly separated total datasets into training 80 and test datasets 20 to evaluate the prediction powers for interpolation in trial 2 the datasets derived from an article were used as test datasets which resulted in no relationship between training and test datasets and enabled us to understand the predictability for extrapolation both trials adopted leave one out loo cross validation in which temporal models were repeatedly generated using n 1 training datasets n is the number of training datasets and a remaining dataset was used for model validations the coefficients were the averaged values of the generated n models to evaluate the prediction performance we calculated mean squared values mses we also generated a number of the predicted lrvs by changing stepwise some explanatory variables having a higher coefficient to explore the out of predictable range in which a model generated obviously wrong prediction values such as a negative lrv 3 results 3 1 article collection and data characteristics we first identified 10102 records according to a systematic review method dissertations book chapters reviews and non english articles were eliminated from the list of the first collected articles which resulted in a decrease to 4058 articles after excluding the articles not relevant to our study e g no information about the lrv and no water disinfection 21 articles remained in detail the numbers of screened articles for norovirus rotavirus poliovirus coxsackievirus echovirus and adenovirus were 6 4 12 4 3 and 2 respectively the numbers of lrv data point were 68 norovirus 65 rotavirus 182

map index html and previous studies suggest that more than 50 datasets should be analyzed cui and gong 2018 leonard et al 2017 so we excluded echovirus and adenovirus data from our analyses water quality and operational parameters were also extracted from the screened articles initial concentrations of ozone i are mostly less than 5 mg l fig 1 i and the decay constant k is described only in articles for norovirus fig 1 k data points of the contact time t gather around lower values but a part of the data for rotavirus and poliovirus was distributed around 10 min fig 1 t ct values c were not listed in articles about rotavirus and poliovirus fig 1 c the articles about coxsackievirus listed c but included no descriptions of i the values of ph p are centered around 7 1 fig 1 p and almost all disinfection experiments are conducted at room temperature around 20 c or 4 c fig 1 t purified water like a buffer was mainly used for disinfection tests fig 1 w infectivity assay plaque assay or mpn method is one of the main methods to measure virus concentration fig 1 a1 and a2 initial log virus concentration ranges from approximately four to eight fig 1 v since the collected studies used only two types of rotavirus and coxsackievirus table 1 and table s1 the types were regarded as an explanatory variable in the regularized regression analyses taken together the number of explanatory variables was 9 norovirus 8 rotavirus 7 poliovirus and 7 coxsackievirus table 1 3 2 the prediction performance of regularized regression models in trial 1 based on training datasets randomly split from the total dataset predictive inactivation models for four virus species were constructed mses for both training and test datasets were calculated to identify the best algorithms for the lrv prediction and the required polynomial terms fig 2 the addition of higher terms to the norovirus inactivation model made prediction performances for both datasets better than only linear terms and decreased the differences of mses between training and test data Œ¥mse msetrain msetest except for ridge regression also mses decreased by adding interaction terms to the rotavirus inactivation models whereas Œ¥mses in the models with only linear terms were lower among models for predicting poliovirus lrv the ridge regression with polynomial terms indicated the best prediction performance and bayesian regularized regression based models with higher terms also showed smaller mses the coxsackievirus inactivation models were improved very slightly by the addition of polynomial terms and the ridge based model with linear terms had the smallest Œ¥mse the algorithms providing better prediction performance were ard with interaction terms norovirus and rotavirus and ridge with interaction terms poliovirus and coxsackievirus at this time 3 3 the prediction performance for new datasets trial 2 in trial 1 there could be relationships between training and test datasets which made it difficult to confirm the ability to predict newly obtained datasets therefore we selected datasets extracted from an article as test datasets in trial 2 to validate the models appropriate for predicting new datasets not related to training datasets the model indicating smaller mse and Œ¥mse is preferable for the predictive inactivation model in norovirus models lasso and elastic net with linear terms and ard with interaction terms indicated smaller mse and Œ¥mse fig 3 only ard with interaction terms in rotavirus models seemed to avoid the overfitting problem all poliovirus models had very small Œ¥mse and smaller mses and bayesian regularized regressions with polynomial terms slightly improved prediction performances the coxsackievirus model based on lasso regression with quadratic terms had lower mses and Œ¥mse 3 4 the best predictive inactivation models and their characteristics taken together with the results from trial 1 and 2 the best predictive inactivation models were ard with interaction terms for norovirus and rotavirus bayesian ridge with interaction terms for poliovirus and lasso with quadratic terms for coxsackievirus table 3 comparative results for observed and predicted lrvs indicated that not only training datasets but also many of the test datasets were predicted well by the best models but some predicted values two test data of norovirus in trial 2 both training and test data of coxsackievirus in trial 1 and 2 largely deviated from the observed values fig 4 many of prediction values tended to be on the y x line and some were randomly deviated from the line i e residuals are distributed randomly which indicates the independence of residuals the estimated coefficients of explanatory variables in the best prediction models are displayed in fig 5 except for the poliovirus model the number of explanatory variables decreased because of the sparse estimations all models had the variables directly related to the disinfection condition such as i c and t indicating that they are essential to explain lrvs other water quality parameters are also included in the best models although some of them are interaction terms 3 5 no improvement of the prediction performance by hbm we designed vif based and regularized regression based hierarchical bayesian models table s3 and compared mse values among them table 2 the hierarchical bayesian models based on regularized regression analyses showed higher prediction performances than those based on vif however the prediction performances in hbm for test datasets of norovirus poliovirus and coxsackievirus were lower than the best regularized regression models indicating that the hbm did not contribute to an improvement of the predictive inactivation models using ozone figs s1 and 2 3 6 identification of disinfection conditions achieving 4lrv and unpredictable ranges the lrvs were generated using the major variables indicated in fig 5 to identify the predictable ranges in the models constructed and the disinfection conditions that achieved 4lrv for all simulations we set fixed values based on a practical wwtp in sendai city japan according to the seasonal prevalence of the viruses summer poliovirus and coxsackievirus winter norovirus and rotavirus the p slightly affected the 4lrv achievement fig 6 a but as the k increased the 4lrv was achieved easily fig 6b which does not seem to be intuitive since a high value of k reduced the effectiveness of ozone disinfection the rotavirus model clearly demonstrated the out of predictable ranges in certain i values fig 6c d as well as norovirus the p had a small effect on the lrv in the poliovirus model fig 7 a but the higher t made it difficult to achieve the 4lrv in a disinfection reactor fig 7b the linear relationship between i and t was likely to be found fig 7c the coxsackievirus model also indicated unpredictable regions and higher p and t made it easy to achieve 4lrv fig 7d e 4 discussion in this study we constructed ozone inactivation models predicting virus lrv by regularized regression analyses the best performances for predicting norovirus and rotavirus lrvs were found in ard with interaction terms in which overfitting to training datasets could be avoided figs 2 4 and table 3 bayesian ridge with interaction terms and lasso with quadratic terms indicated the best prediction performance for poliovirus and coxsackievirus respectively and had the ability to predict new datasets not relevant to the training dataset figs 2 4 and table 3 however some test and training datasets have still not been predicted well fig 4 and the hbm did not improve the prediction performances table 2 we also provided information about the unpredictable range of some variables and the desirable disinfection condition for the achievement of 4lrv figs 6 and 7 the conventional kinetics of disinfection for viruses such as the chick watson hom and efficiency factor hom efh models use only disinfection parameters disinfectant concentration contact time and decay constant as model parameters chick 1908 watson 1908 hom 1972 haas and joffe 1994 boehm et al established the predictive model for the natural decay of enteric viruses in which several water quality parameters were used as explanatory variables and found the larger effects of water quality on natural decay rates boehm et al 2019 the disinfection intensity of ozone is also affected by water quality parameters as the decay rate of ozone increases at higher temperatures sohn et al 2004 classical models are likely to be inadequate to predict lrvs under varied water quality status but predictive water virology provides more practical models for lrv prediction using disinfectants because some operational and water quality information can be incorporated into the model fig 5 the selection of explanatory variables is critical for model construction abdul wahab et al 2005 in fact sparse estimation which is applied for the predictive inactivation models except for poliovirus implies a mitigation of overfitting to training datasets fig 3 although an addition of polynomial terms is required to improve prediction performances ozone is generally consumed by organic contaminants in water park et al 2001 and the established models lack variables related to disinfectant consuming substances e g doc and ss sohn et al 2004 du et al 2020 so the polynomial terms might compensate for the missing but essential variables however in this study only the small number of variables was available and thus an addition of polynomial terms does not always support the prediction which might attribute to the lack of fit to some datasets to predict lrvs that are not predicted well with current models fig 4 other types of water quality information needs to be incorporated into our models the collection of datasets that completely involve water quality information is required to improve the prediction performance which may be achievable by establishing a widely accessible database that includes datasets provided from laboratories and wwtps such as global water pathogen project gwpp https www waterpathogens org if water quality information is difficult to prepare the ct value that is calculated using a decay constant can be a substitution of disinfectant consuming matters kadoya et al 2019 additionally we are able to construct the robust regularized regression based models that exclude outliers from an estimation of model coefficients by using other machine learning algorithms e g random sample consensus theil sen estimator fischler and bolles 1981 dang et al 2008 predictive water virology helps us identify the water quality and operational conditions that are required for 4lrv but the models established here have to be updated continuously because the out of predictable range has remained large figs 6 and 7 the lrvs for norovirus rotavirus and poliovirus are relatively stable under near neutral ph levels figs 6 and 7 which is consistent with previous reports lin et al 2014 meng et al 1987 ward and ashley 1979 on the other hand coxsackievirus lrvs are positively proportional to the ph value since coxsackievirus is easily inactivated by higher ph mcgeady et al 1979 although waterborne viruses are easily inactivated with higher temperatures moresco et al 2016 biziagos et al 1988 the model implies that poliovirus is inactivated more easily with low temperatures which may be attributable to a data bias e g small datasets using low temperature in which higher lrvs are observed also as shown in fig 6b an unintuitive result that the lrv became high as decay rate k increased is likely to be explained by the data bias owing to the small number of low k values fig 1 thus virus lrv datasets obtained under various water quality conditions need to be collected to eliminate the data bias and expand the predictable range of models the predictive inactivation models established here are mostly based on datasets obtained in bench scale experiments so the models need to be carefully applied to lrv prediction at real scale plants in practice there can be uncertainty related to hydraulics for example heterogeneity of doc concentration which is caused by the degree of incomplete mixing could affect the decay of ozone concentration and the ct value also under the mixing effect at a wwtp water quality parameters need to be expressed using probability distributions sin et al 2009 and 2011 again the model limitation must be solved by preparing a high quality database of virus lrv in which water quality parameters at wwtp are deposited alternatively the prediction performance is developed by making the regularized regression based models with explanatory variables that are expressed using probability distributions several descriptions about the cl determination at wwtps are available in the literature but we do not have a common and flexible approach for such a determination hallowell 2014 the current models for the lrv prediction help us determine the cl at the disinfection step at any wwtps the accepted concentration of virus in effluent is determined so

19963,rare earth elements rees are used in increasing amounts in technical applications and consumer products however to date the contribution of industrial sources to the loads of individual rees in wastewater streams have not been quantified here we determine the ree contents in sludge collected from 63 wastewater treatment plants wwtps across switzerland to quantify the industrial fraction of individual rees in the sewage sludge we develop two complementary approaches based on ree ratios and ree pattern fitting unspecific background inputs with ree patterns similar to the averaged ree pattern of soils collected across switzerland dominate the ree budget of most wwtps a few wwtps receive significant ree inputs from specific industrial sources based on population equivalents of switzerland we estimate a total annual load of 4200 kg cerium ce 0 5 g ce year 1 capita 1 with an industrial contribution of 2000 kg year 1 the latter agrees with estimates of probabilistic mass flow models for engineered nanoscale ceo2 particles discharged to the sewer network about 7 kg year 1 of samarium sm total for switzerland 184 kg year 1 or 0 02 g sm year 1 capita 1 and 3 kg year 1 of europium eu total for switzerland 44 kg year 1 or 0 005 g eu year 1 capita 1 are assigned to industrial inputs from single wwtps gadolinium gd is used in the form of a stable complex as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging assuming 10 removal of gd during wastewater treatment we calculate an annual discharge of 90 kg of gd from one individual wwtp to surface waters wwtps with exceptionally high industrial inputs of specific rees warrant detailed investigations to identify the respective sources and to assess whether ree concentrations in effluents are elevated to the same degree keywords sewage sludge rare earth elements industry wastewater soil 1 introduction rare earth elements rees include the lanthanides la to lu and share comparable geochemical properties according to the iupac definition also scandium sc and yttrium y belong to the rees connelly et al 2005 but are often excluded in studies focusing on rees starting from lanthanum la with an outer electron configuration of 5d16s2 the 4f orbitals are filled up with increasing atomic weight thus all rees have an almost identical ionic radius ranging from 1 15 √• la to 0 97 √• for lutetium lu which together with their common trivalent oxidation state explains their similar geochemical behavior the only exceptions are ce and eu which can also occur in the tetravalent ce4 or the divalent eu2 oxidation state the different properties of ce4 and eu2 compared to their trivalent counterparts results in well described anomalies bau 1991 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 kidder et al 2003 sinha 1983 although rees are not as rare as the name suggests the name relates to rare minerals rather than to low abundances the rees are classified as technologically critical elements because of their importance in high tech applications in the fields of energy technology communication and mobility cobelo garc√≠a et al 2015 therefore the identification and quantification of relevant ree waste streams in combination with the development of efficient and green recycling approaches are required in addition rees are considered as emerging micropollutants for which still limited knowledge of impacts on ecosystems is available celis et al 2020 gwenzi et al 2018 several high tech industries including automotive electronics and renewable energy are dependent on rees which therefore are intensively mined du and graedel 2013 ramos et al 2016 the world production in 2018 amounted to 170 000 metric tons of ree oxides with more than 70 mined in china the application of rees is generally distributed as follows catalysts 60 ceramics and glass 15 metallurgical applications and alloys 10 polishing 10 mineral commodity summaries 2015 elevated post archean australian shale paas normalized values of specific rees relative to the normalized values of the remaining rees can only be achieved by a selective input of specific rees and point towards an industrial contribution of the respective rees amongst all rees the fate of gd received the most attention due to the use of gd based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging mri european medicines agency 2017 elevated concentrations of gd in surface waters are associated with hospital wastewater kovalova et al 2013 k√ºmmerer and helmers 2000 as first reported by bau and dulski 1996 more than two decades ago since then elevated gd contents have been detected in several rivers and lakes bau et al 2006 elbaz poulichet et al 2002 klaver et al 2014 knappe et al 2005 lerat hardy et al 2019 m√∂ller et al 2002 2003 parant et al 2018 rabiet et al 2009 song et al 2017 following gd also la klaver et al 2014 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2011 and more recently sm associated with anthropogenic uses were observed in surface waters kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 compared to gd which is present in aqueous solutions as a stable complex la and sm are transported together with the particulate phase and occur mainly in the colloidal size range between 10 kda and 0 2 Œºm klaver et al 2014 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 furthermore slightly elevated la and sm concentrations in the han river have been associated with emissions from fluid catalytic converters song et al 2017 elevated ree concentrations reported for western xiamen bay china were explained by inputs of sewage sludge and fallout from coal combustion hu et al 2019 however all rees were enriched to a comparable degree indicating that specific ree sources in the wastewater were absent high concentrations of la ce pr nd and sm and enrichment of light rees lrees la gd compared to the heavy rees hrees tb lu in selected sewage sludge samples were explained by industrial discharges to wastewater systems kawasaki et al 1998 vivian 1986 however no attempts were made to quantify these industrial inputs elevated concentrations of rees were also reported from three different wwtps in china and were assigned to industrial sources suanon et al 2017 in the same study only the enrichments relative to the average crust were determined and the quantitative industrial inputs of the respective elements were not assessed nkinahamira et al 2019 suggested crustal materials as the main source of rees reported from 7 wwtps in xiamen city china as opposed to industrial inputs selectively increased la and ce values compared to other normalized rees however pointed towards an industrial input of la and ce verplanck et al 2010 investigated the ree patterns in sewage sludge from four large metropolitan wwtps in the united states but did not observe any ree anomalies the available data from the literature therefore suggest that a wide range of different amounts of individual rees from specific industrial sources are discharged to wastewater systems but this has not been addressed systematically to obtain an overview of the rees contents in sewage sludge we determined the ree concentrations in sewage sludge samples collected from 63 representative wwtps across switzerland for the identification of the fraction of all rees related to specific industrial inputs we refined the approach recently presented by gogos et al 2020 which relies on the change of ree ratios in sewage sludge due to the selective input of specific rees additionally the industrial fractions of individual rees were estimated by fitting the ree patterns of the sludge to a background ree pattern represented by the averaged ree pattern of 10 soils collected across switzerland both approaches included the whole suite of rees and enabled us to identify ree anomalies estimate the industrial fractions of rees in sewage sludge and quantify their contents in the sludge in terms of kg year 1 as both approaches rely on a change of the ree patterns industrial inputs having similar ree patterns as the background will not be detected and will contribute to the background ree loads in the manuscript we therefore define industrial ree inputs as inputs from industrial sources with specific ree patterns which are different from the ree patters of the background we also attribute excess gd which is mostly related to contrast agents for mri to industrial sources gd based contrast agents are mainly found in hospital waters but they still have an industrial origin with a very specific ree signature 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil samples soil samples were obtained from the swiss soil monitoring network nabo 2019 and included a range of different lithologies and land uses the locations of the 10 soils and the characteristics of the respective soils are given in the si figure s1 table s1 2 2 collection of sewage sludge samples all sludges included in this work were collected between february and march 2016 and are described in vriens et al 2017 the locations of the corresponding wwtps are provided in the si figure s2 the data on the connected population and on the sludge production volumes were updated and correspond to the years 2016 sludge production volumes and 2017 connected population table s2 2 3 characterization of soils and sewage sludge to determine the total ree content of the sludge and the soil samples between 30 and 50 mg of powdered material were digested using a two step digestion protocol the samples were first digested in 5 ml nitric acid hno3 69 wt suprapur rotipuran carl roth gmbh and 300 Œºl hydrofluoric acid hf 48 wt suprapur sigma aldrich using a microwave system mls ultraclave mls gmbh leutkirch germany in the second step the digests were reacted with 2 4 ml boric acid h3bo3 5 wt merck germany and afterwards filled to 50 ml with doubly deionized ddi water millipore 18 2 mœâ cm the measurements were conducted using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 8900 agilent technologies inc ca usa a certified reference material bcr 667 estuarine sediment with reference values for all rees was used for quality assurance recoveries were determined based on bcr samples digested and measured along with the sludge and soil samples the bcr material digested in duplicates or triplicates on 10 different days gave mean recoveries for all rees ranging between 95 lu and 113 pr figure s3 experimental samples sludge and soil were mostly digested in triplicates and in a few cases in duplicates for further data evaluation the average of the triplicates duplicates were used all data are presented in table s2 sludge and s3 soil oxide and hydroxide formation of lighter rees in the plasma of the icp ms is well documented and can lead to interferences with heavier rees aries et al 2000 dulski 1994 we therefore measured single elements standards of ba and selected rees la ce eu gd dy ho er lu most important for the current project were possible interferences between ceo ceoh and gd as ce showed the highest abundances of all rees in the sewage sludge icp ms measurements of a ce single element standard indeed resulted in increasing counts of 157gd figure s4 however the oxide hydroxide production rate was 0 1 and a respective correction of the measured gd values did only marginally affect the calculated industrial fractions of gd in the sewage sludge nevertheless the gd values were corrected accordingly furthermore up to 10 ppb of ba did not result in quantifiable counts for eu and thus the bao baoh production rates were considered negligible in addition single element standards of sn and sb were measured to evaluate interferences of these elements and their oxides 123sb16o hydroxides 122sn16oh with 139la even 10 ppb of sb and sn did not result in any quantifiable la counts also ba up to 10 pbb did not result in any quantifiable counts of the neighboring 139la 2 4 quantification of the industrial ree fractions in several studies ree anomalies mainly gd but more recently also la and sm were quantified by estimating the background concentrations of an element of interest eoi via an inter la sm or an extrapolation la of the concentrations of other mostly neighboring rees bau and dulski 1996 hatje et al 2016 klaver et al 2014 knappe et al 2005 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 m√∂ller et al 2002 used a third order polynomial fit to the log10 transformed ree patterns to assess the background concentration of gd recently an alternative method to identify and quantify industrial contributions of rees in sewage sludge has been presented gogos et al 2020 which exploits the difference between specific ree ratios in the sewage sludge and in the background in this work we further modified and extended this approach later referred to as a1 to include the whole suite of rees la lu alternatively we fit ree patterns of the individual sewage sludge samples the background ree pattern and assign the differences to the industrial contribution of the respective rees approach a2 in both approaches which are explained below we use the averaged ree pattern of 10 soils collected across switzerland as a proxy for the background ree pattern in sewage sludge individual wwtps receiving substantial amounts of selected rees were identified based on outlier criteria 2 4 1 calculations based on the ree ratios the approach a1 is based on the assumption that the total amount of rees in the sludge can be described as the sum of an industrial and a background fraction whereas the background fraction exhibits a constant ree pattern reflecting the averaged ree pattern of the collected soil samples any modification of this background ree pattern results from an input of specific industrial rees the industrial fraction of specific rees in the sewage sludge can thus be calculated as follows eq 1 r e e r e f s l g r e e e o i s l g f r e e b k r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k f r e e i n d r e e r e f i n d r e e e o i i n d w i t h r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k c o n s t r e e r e f i n d r e e e o i i n d 0 eq 2 f r e e b k r e e r e f s l g r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k r e e e o i s l g eq 3 f r e e i n d 1 r e e r e f s l g r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k r e e e o i s l g r e e e o i s l g r e e e o i b k and r e e e o i i n d refer to the concentrations of a specific element of interest in sludge slg and in the background bk with a possibly elevated concentration in the sludge due to specific industrial inputs ind r e e r e f s l g and r e e r e f b k refer to the concentrations of reference rees in the sludge and in the background which are assumed to be unaffected by specific industrial inputs therefore the term r e e r e f i n d reflecting the industrial contribution to the specific reference element becomes zero if a selected reference element is affected by industrial contributions which occasionally will be the case as our approach is based on using the whole suit of rees the calculated background factions f r e e b k will be larger than 1 pointing to an unsuitable choice of the reference element our full factorial approach results in 13 individual estimates 14 rees minus the eoi for every ree in all sewage sludge samples the data are visualized using boxplots where the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered as outliers and the outliers are plotted individually using the symbol outliers are defined as values that deviate more than 1 5 times from the interquartile range top or bottom of the box 2 4 2 calculations based on ree pattern fitting in the a2 approach it is assumed that most of the rees follow a background pattern represented by the averaged ree pattern of the soils the log10 transformed ree concentration values of the sewage sludge samples are fitted to the log10 transformed and averaged ree concentration values of the soil samples background following equation 4 and 5 eq 4 r e e s l g f r e e b k Œµ eq 5 r e e Œµ r e e r e e s l g f r e e b k r e e s l g refers to the concentration of specific rees in individual sludge samples and r e e b k refers to the average concentration of specific rees in the background f represents the background fraction of rees in the sewage sludge samples and Œµ represents the difference between the calculated and the measured ree concentrations in the individual sludge samples the sum of the absolute values of Œµ over all rees is minimized for each sewage sludge sample using the fminsearch routine in matlab r2019a the obtained background fraction f of rees in the sewage sludge samples can be converted to linear scale according to f b k 10 f the difference Œ¥ in log10 scale between the measured and the fitted ree concentrations of the sewage sludge samples can be assigned to the specific industrial input of individual rees and the share of each ree related to specific industrial inputs can be calculated according to f i n d 1 10 Œ¥ assuming that most of the ree are unaffected by industrial inputs of individual ree using log10 transformed ree concentration values the fit of the ree patterns between the sludge and the background is only marginally affected by occasionally increased concentrations of individual rees representing specific industrial inputs wwtps receiving substantial contributions of selected rees were identified based on the same outlier criteria as used for the a1 approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 ree patterns of sludge and soil samples the ree concentrations of the sludge samples and the medians thereof together with the average of the investigated soil samples and the paas concentrations reflecting the average compositions of the earth crust are given in fig 1 a the individual ree patterns of the soils are very similar to the ree pattern of the paas also the hree patterns of the sewage sludges were similar amongst each other and closely followed the ree patterns of the soils although at consistently lower concentrations this can be explained by variable inputs of unspecific ree loads having the same hree patterns as the averaged soils and thus supports the hypothesis that the averaged ree pattern of the soils can be used as a proxy for the background pattern of the rees in sewage sludge this is in contrast to the lrees where the concentrations show considerable differences and individual lines connecting neighboring rees cross each other ce and la concentrations of selected sludge samples project even above the soil ree patterns the considerable range in l ree concentrations in the sludge samples compared to the soil samples essentially representing anomalies of specific rees in the sludge is highlighted by normalizing the data to the paas values fig 1b individual spikes suggest an industrial contribution of individual rees to the sludge and ce appears to have the highest share interestingly a slight enrichment of the la concentrations mean values compared to the other normalized rees can be observed 3 2 background and industrial fractions of individual rees in sewage sludge based on ree ratios and using eq 2 and 3 approach a1 background f r e e b k and industrial f r e e i n d fractions contributing to the total amount of ree observed in the individual sludge samples were calculated the resulting fractions are visualized as boxplots either with respect to the rees used as reference elements or with respect to the wwtps and will be discussed based on the cases of ce figs 2a and 3 a and sm figs 2b and 3b as eoi these two elements were selected to represent rees which are used in high amounts ce and moderate amounts sm 3 2 1 differences in the background and industrial fractions of ce and sm calculated using different reference rees when plotting the background fractions of ce and sm f c e s m b k with respect to the individual reference elements rees on the x axis used for the calculations f c e s m b k close to 1 suggests that the ce and sm contents in the sludge samples are dominated by inputs from the background a f c e s m b k lower than 1 indicates industrial inputs of ce and sm an f c e s m b k larger than 1 indicates that the reference element rather than the eoi was affected by industrial contributions cerium the modal values of f c e b k indicated by the blue bars in the box plots and representing the majority of the wwtps are close to 1 for almost all rees used as reference elements fig 2a suggesting that the majority of the investigated wwtps do not receive substantial amounts of ce from industrial sources the only exception is observed when la is used as reference element leading to a modal value of f c e b k above 1 suggesting that most wwtps are affected by additional la inputs this is consistent with the higher paas normalized la values compared to all other rees fig 1b when ce is used as reference element its modal value must be 1 as in this case the reference element and the eoi coincide of interest are the outliers marked as red crosses below 1 indicating wwtps that receive substantial amounts of ce from industrial sources the outliers above 1 are caused by our full factorial approach and represent sludge samples where the ree used as reference element contain substantial industrial inputs the sludge from one wwtp location visp consistently resulted in f c e b k larger than 1 this wwtp mainly treats industrial wastewater which may be depleted in ce and thus resulting in ce depleted sewage sludge figure s5 this would explain the high f c e b k when ce is used as eoi alternatively an unusual ree signature of the soil exhibiting a strong ce depletion may also explain the ree pattern in the sludge however the ree pattern of a soil collected within the catchment area of this wwtp nicely aligns with the other soil ree patterns figure s5 we thus consider industrial processes resulting in either i the selective removal of ce from the wastewater before ce is incorporated into the sludge or ii higher amounts of ce passing the wwtp as more likely samarium for sm the modal values of f s m n a t also scatter around 1 and only the values calculated when using la as a reference element are significantly larger than 1 fig 2b this observation is in agreement with the data discussed for ce and again suggests that most wwtps receive la from additional sources la thus cannot be used as a reference element to quantify f r e e b k and f r e e i n d in sewage sludge a single outlier below the modal values of f s m b k can consistently be observed when using any of the other ree as reference elements this outlier represents a specific wwtp location windisch where the industrial inputs of sm dominate over the background contributions several outliers are located above 1 when ce is used as a reference element to calculate f s m b k sm as eoi this is consistent with the fact that we previously identified industrial ce in sewage sludge from several wwtps when using ce as an eoi fig 2a this industrial ce input distorted the background contributions and resulted in artificially high f s m b k exceeding 1 in addition several outliers above 1 were observed when gd was used as a reference element suggesting that also numerous wwtps receive industrial gd this is in line with reports where positive gd anomalies have been associated with gd used in contrast agents for mri bau and dulski 1996 klaver et al 2014 kovalova et al 2013 k√ºmmerer and helmers 2000 and will be discussed in more detail in section 3 5 3 2 2 differences in the background and industrial ce and sm fractions calculated for individual wwtps when rearranging the data along the different wwtps instead of along the different rees used as reference elements fig 3a and b modal values of f c e s m b k below 1 blue horizontal lines in the boxes indicate that the respective wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial ce and sm it is important to note that the modal values of f c e s m b k are estimated based on the ratios between ce sm and all other rees for better visibility and based on the reason discussed above the largest outliers above 1 have been omitted in fig 3a and b furthermore la was excluded as reference element as it has been identified as unsuitable for this purpose in the above discussions in the boxplots also the eoi was excluded as a reference element to avoid the situation of using for example ce as reference and as eoi which would by definition result in f c e s m b k of 1 see eq 1 for ce fig 3a the modal values for f c e b k of a few wwtps are substantially below 1 suggesting that the amounts of ce in the respective wwtp are affected by industrial inputs only for one wwtp the modal values project substantially above 1 it is the same wwtp location visp already identified previously based on the outliers above 1 consistently observed for all rees used as reference ree fig 2a for sm fig 3b the modal values of f s m b k of all but of one wwtp location windisch are close to 1 thus sm seems to be used and released to the wastewater systems only very locally the low modal value of f s m b k for this specific wwtp is reflected in the outliers close to the bottom of fig 2b 3 2 3 differences in the background and industrial fractions of all rees in all wwtps the calculations of the f c e s m b k individually discussed for ce and sm are extended to include all rees as eoi and are summarized in the form of boxplots presented in fig 4 the boxplots represent the modal values of f r e e b k for the different wwtps based on all rees and the outliers below 1 indicate wwtps that receive substantial fractions of the respective rees from specific industrial sources the boxplot for la is very different to the boxplots of the other rees and shows a modal value around 0 6 for f l a b k furthermore the individual values of f l a b k show large variations this means that most wwtps apparently receive substantial and very diverse amounts of la from additional sources for all other rees the modal values of f r e e b k scatter around 1 with the exception of a few wwtps which receive substantial amounts of specific rees most prominently ce and gd the reason for the unexpected occurrence la is not clear but would imply that industrial la is almost omnipresent in wwtps la is used in hybrid engines metal alloys and also various applications in the field of catalysis haque et al 2014 however emissions from such applications are less likely to end up in wastewater streams and the emission from possible production facilities would rather result in high input rates to a few selected wwtps furthermore la is commonly found in flints for cigarette lighters representing a pervasive application of la behrsing et al 2014 haque et al 2014 however in this application la is contained in a mischmetal which contains twice as much ce compared to la behrsing et al 2014 and respective emissions would go parallel with ce alternatively selected soil fertilizers show strong enrichments of la compared to other rees otero et al 2005 ramos et al 2016 a contribution from such fertilizers to the wastewater through agricultural runoff may therefore modify the ree patterns in the sludge and help to explain the elevated la concentrations observed in the sludge samples furthermore biological processes within the wwtps may fractionate la and thus modify the ree patterns of the sewage sludge for example lree dependent enzymes required for the methanol metabolism have been discovered in methylotrophic bacteria about a decade ago cotruvo 2019 hibi et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2012 l l wang et al 2020 more recently x wang et al 2020 identified methanotrophic bacteria whose enzymatic activities are strongly dependent on the la availability to what extent biological processes or fertilizer inputs into the wastewater are responsible for the high industrial fraction of la calculated for the sewage sludge samples remains open and needs to be addressed in future studies 3 3 industrial contributions of specific rees in specific wwtps the quantified industrial fractions for the individual rees and for each of the 63 wwtps derived from approach a1 are presented as a heat map fig 5 which allows an easy identification of wwtps that receive substantial amounts of industrial rees significant industrial fractions of specific rees in individual wwtps are identified as outliers and are projected in grey scale in the heat map this heat map clearly shows that only a small number of wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial rees a special case again is la as discussed above the fact that industrial fractions of la scatter around 0 4 background contribution of around 0 6 and show a very broad distribution results in large interquartile ranges without the identification of any outliers for the remaining rees ce is most important in terms of the number of wwtps receiving industrial inputs 7 wwtps followed by gd 5 wwtps high shares for sm and eu from industrial sources were detected in a single wwtp each these data generally support the hypothesis that rees are used in rather specialized applications and their release to the wastewater reflects individual point sources these results are in line with for example industrial sm detected in the river rhine which was assigned to a single cracking catalyst production facility kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 within a mass flow study addressing the role of different sewer systems controlling the amount of engineered nanomaterials discharged to the environment via stormwater runoff zheng et al 2019 assigned the majority of ceo2 np discharged to wastewater systems to industrial discharges ceo2 np are used as polishing agents for glass and silicon which limits the discharge to a few hotspots westerhoff et al 2015 concluded that the share of industrial sources of rees is small and nearly negligible compared to the crustal input on average this is certainly true but as demonstrated by our data the input of specific rees to individual wwtps can be dominated by industrial point sources 3 4 comparison of the results from the two model approaches ree ratio vs ree pattern fitting to compare the results of the ree ratio a1 and the pattern fitting a2 approaches to estimate the industrial fractions f r e e i n d of the rees in sewage sludge the same heat map as shown in fig 5 based on a1 is constructed using a2 figure s6 both heat maps are very similar reflected by the marginal differences of the two heat maps figure s7 based on both approaches essentially the same wwtp receiving substantial amounts of specific rees were identified minor differences in the absolute industrial fractions were mostly around 5 10 and may be explained by slight variations of the ree patterns of the soils the results discussed so far were addressing industrial and background fractions of rees in individual wwtps these relative industrial background fractions can be transformed into absolute masses using the sludge production rates of the individual wwtps and are discussed in the following section as both approaches to estimate the industrial background fractions of ree in sewage sludge produced almost identical results the following discussions are independent of the calculation method 3 5 mass based industrial contributions of ree to sewage sludge the mass based contributions of individual rees to the sewage sludge from individual wwtps were calculated by multiplying the industrial ree fractions with the measured concentrations and the annual sludge production digested sludge dry mass basis table s3 ce and considerably lower amounts of sm eu and gd dominate the annual industrial ree loads scaled to switzerland based on population equivalents fig 6 a the data for la have to be treated with care as explained in section 3 3 in most wwtps la from additional possibly industrial sources were detected modal values for f r e e i n d around 0 4 however based on our outlier criterion no wwtps were identified where the industrial la contributions following both evaluation schemes a1 and a2 qualified as outliers of the 63 investigated wwtps the locations of yverdon bioggio hofen and thal dominanted the total amount of rees attributed to specific industrial sources fig 6b the same pattern can be observed when looking at the loads of ce from industrial sources reflecting the dominat role of ce in controlling the total amount of industrial rees in sewage sludge figure s8a in the case of gd one wwtp dominates the total amount of industrial gd identified in all 63 wwtp figure s8b these results only partially reflect the reports documenting industrial rees in river waters from various locations industrial ce from the loire river in orleans and in the form of ceo2 nanoparticles has only been reported very recently phalyvong et al 2020 industrial gd however has been observed in river water lake water coastal water ground water and drinking water selected references are provided in the introduction and the presence of sm in river water rhine has only been reported in one study kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 this bias is related to the chemical speciation of the respective rees in the waste and surface waters and also to the different sample preparation procedures most of the studies available in the literature targeted the dissolved fractions and thus most samples were filtered and often an exchange resin was used to further enrich the dissolved rees any rees present in the particulate fraction would not have been detected using these preparation schemes the low solubility products of ree3 phosphates 10 25 firsching and brune 1991 in combination with po4 3 concentrations of 10 9 5 m 3 10 10 m calculated using the software code spana version 2020 june 08 for a ph of 7 2 and a total orthophosphate p concentration of 3 mgl 1 100 Œºm gujer 2007 results in a calculated ree3 concentration of about 3 10 16 m or 4 6 10 11 mgl 1 calculated for nd thus we assume that the majority of the rees are transported in particulate form in the wastewater and thus are efficiently accumulated in the sewage sludge nevertheless future studies on selected wwtps should also investigate the dissolved fraction of the rees in the raw and treated wastewater to evaluate to what extent organic ree complexes contribute to the total flux of rees in wastewater systems gadolinium the fact that industrial gd is used in contrast agents in dissolved form as a stable and poorly sorbing chelate limits its incorporation into the sewage sludge in wwtps where removal efficiencies in the order of 10 have been reported telgmann et al 2012 kovalova et al 2013 even reported lower removal efficiencies 5 in a membrane bioreactor and only insignificant oxidation by ozonation and adsorption to activated carbon in this study we identified individual wwtps with elevated gd contents in the sewage sludge total amounts of industrial gd in the inflow and in the effluent of the 63 wwtps were estimated based on the gd concentrations in the sewage sludge and assuming 10 removal during the wastewater treatment the results indicate that in total 110 kg of gd are discharged annually to the 63 wwtps and thereof 100 kg are released to the surface waters and 11 kg gd remain in the sludge from these 11 kg about 80 can be assigned to one single wwtp 9 kg estimated for the sludge in the wwtp of ramsen and would correspond to a discharge of 90 kg to the surface water the wwtp of ramsen is located in the northeastern part of switzerland close to lake constance at the border between switzerland and germany it treats the wastewater amongst others from the city of singen germany where a cancer center including mri facilities is located hegau bodensee klinikum singen in addition industrial facilities producing large amounts of gd based contrast agents are also located within the catchment of the wwtp of ramsen thus the gd detected in this wwtp most probably is linked to the production and use of gd containing contrast agents cerium compared to gd which occurs as a complex and thus shows a poor removal during the wastewater treatment industrial ce is expected to be present in the nano particulate phase as suggested by gogos et al 2020 and phalyvong et al 2020 and is thus removed much more efficiently during wastewater treatment reported removal efficiencies for nanoscale particles generally exceed 95 georgantzopoulou et al 2018 kaegi et al 2011 ma et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2011 the total amounts of ce found in the sludge of the investigated wwtps which is related to industrial inputs amounts to 1000 kg and is dominated by 4 wwtps located in bioggio yverdon hofen and thal contributing to around 80 of the industrial ce found in the sewage sludge from the 63 wwtps however assuming an average removal efficiency of 95 1050 kg would be discharged annually to the wwtps and thereof 50 kg would be released to the aquatic environment thus although much larger amounts of industrial ce are discharged to individual wwtps compared to gd 1000 kg ce vs 110 kg gd the amount of gd released to the surface waters is expected to be considerably higher 100 kg gd vs 50 kg ce furthermore the ce particles in the effluent of the wwtp are expected to be present as heteroaggregates and may be incorporated into larger aggregates and eventually become integrated into the sediment industrial gd however will be present in the dissolved form as a stable complex with limited removal from the water phase over time combined with the higher natural abundance of ce compared to gd it is understandable that industrial gd has been frequently reported in the surface waters but industrial ce not yet the annual discharge of ceo2 np to sewer systems has recently been estimated for germany giese et al 2018 and values are around 28 000 kg year 1 scaling these amounts to switzerland based on population equivalents 83 mio in germany vs 8 6 mio in switzerland results in a value 2900 kg year 1 of ceo2 np discharged to wastewater systems when scaling the total amounts of industrial ce in the investigated wwtps 1000 kg year 1 to the whole of switzerland based on population equivalents 4 6 mio considered in this study vs 8 6 mio total in switzerland in 2019 the integrated mass of ce in sewage sludge in switzerland amounts to 2000 kg year 1 assuming a 95 removal efficiency and converting ce to ceo2 results in a flux of industrial ce to sewer systems of 2600 kg year 1 in agreement with the value of 2900 kg year 1 obtained from the mass flow model study giese et al 2018 however our data also indicate that discharge of industrial rees from wastewater systems is dominated by a few wwtps making the scale up to discharge amounts across switzerland challenging and the respective results should therefore be treated with great care 4 conclusions the ree patterns from several soil samples were very similar and represent the background ree patterns observed in the sewage sludge these patterns are distorted by inputs of specific rees resulting from industrial sources the extent of distortion of the ree patterns can be used to estimate the industrial contribution of individual rees in the sewage sludge very similar industrial fractions of specific rees in sewage sludge were calculated based on ree ratios and on ree pattern fitting approaches the deviations resulting from the two approaches were mostly 5 both approaches include the whole suite of rees and do not require prior knowledge on which industrial rees are present in the sludge digested sewage sludge with a typical hydraulic retention time of 12 16 days in anaerobic digesters integrates ree inputs over an extended period of time and is thus less susceptible to short term variations of the influent concentrations we showed that the fluxes of industrial rees in swiss sewage sludges are dominated by a few wwtps implying that point sources rather than diffuse sources control the amounts of industrial rees discharged to wwtps in future studies it may thus be most rewarding to identify industrial facilities processing specific rees and then including wwtps from the respective catchments the impact of different treatment steps e g primary clarification activated sludge treatment on the ree concentration in wastewater streams of the respective wwtps should be evaluated to get a better understanding of how and in which forms rees move through wastewater facilities based on the current dataset showing that several wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial ce it can be concluded that industrial ce is likely the next ree that will be detected more frequently in surface waters or groundwater and or in sediments downstream of selected wwtps enrichments of gd observed in selected sewage sludge samples were associated with the release of gd based contrast agents from hospitals and or production facilities la seems enriched in most of the wwtps but without showing clear outliers and therefore we could not assign the la enrichments to specific industrial inputs biological processes modifying the retention of la in wwtps may help to explain the unexpectedly high apparent industrial fractions of la in sewage sludge alternatively la contributions from diffuse sources such as agricultural runoff of fertilizers with enriched la contents may additionally contribute to the la enrichments observed in the sewage sludge apart from the poorly understood ecological consequences of the ree discharge to the environment applications relying on stable ree background patterns may be challenged in the future for example the use of ree patterns to study geochemical processes in natural waters e g elderfield and greaves 1982 johannesson et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 smedley 1991 may become increasingly difficult furthermore it has been suggested to use ree patterns for a source apportionment of food products to warrant specific quality labels magdas et al 2020 also this approach may become limited if for example sewage sludge enriched in specific industrial rees is used as fertilizer in agriculture our results supported by other previous reports on the occurrence of industrial rees in surface waters suggest that human activities can change the background ree patterns in urban environments and the increasing ree demand will further accentuate these changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

19963,rare earth elements rees are used in increasing amounts in technical applications and consumer products however to date the contribution of industrial sources to the loads of individual rees in wastewater streams have not been quantified here we determine the ree contents in sludge collected from 63 wastewater treatment plants wwtps across switzerland to quantify the industrial fraction of individual rees in the sewage sludge we develop two complementary approaches based on ree ratios and ree pattern fitting unspecific background inputs with ree patterns similar to the averaged ree pattern of soils collected across switzerland dominate the ree budget of most wwtps a few wwtps receive significant ree inputs from specific industrial sources based on population equivalents of switzerland we estimate a total annual load of 4200 kg cerium ce 0 5 g ce year 1 capita 1 with an industrial contribution of 2000 kg year 1 the latter agrees with estimates of probabilistic mass flow models for engineered nanoscale ceo2 particles discharged to the sewer network about 7 kg year 1 of samarium sm total for switzerland 184 kg year 1 or 0 02 g sm year 1 capita 1 and 3 kg year 1 of europium eu total for switzerland 44 kg year 1 or 0 005 g eu year 1 capita 1 are assigned to industrial inputs from single wwtps gadolinium gd is used in the form of a stable complex as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging assuming 10 removal of gd during wastewater treatment we calculate an annual discharge of 90 kg of gd from one individual wwtp to surface waters wwtps with exceptionally high industrial inputs of specific rees warrant detailed investigations to identify the respective sources and to assess whether ree concentrations in effluents are elevated to the same degree keywords sewage sludge rare earth elements industry wastewater soil 1 introduction rare earth elements rees include the lanthanides la to lu and share comparable geochemical properties according to the iupac definition also scandium sc and yttrium y belong to the rees connelly et al 2005 but are often excluded in studies focusing on rees starting from lanthanum la with an outer electron configuration of 5d16s2 the 4f orbitals are filled up with increasing atomic weight thus all rees have an almost identical ionic radius ranging from 1 15 √• la to 0 97 √• for lutetium lu which together with their common trivalent oxidation state explains their similar geochemical behavior the only exceptions are ce and eu which can also occur in the tetravalent ce4 or the divalent eu2 oxidation state the different properties of ce4 and eu2 compared to their trivalent counterparts results in well described anomalies bau 1991 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 kidder et al 2003 sinha 1983 although rees are not as rare as the name suggests the name relates to rare minerals rather than to low abundances the rees are classified as technologically critical elements because of their importance in high tech applications in the fields of energy technology communication and mobility cobelo garc√≠a et al 2015 therefore the identification and quantification of relevant ree waste streams in combination with the development of efficient and green recycling approaches are required in addition rees are considered as emerging micropollutants for which still limited knowledge of impacts on ecosystems is available celis et al 2020 gwenzi et al 2018 several high tech industries including automotive electronics and renewable energy are dependent on rees which therefore are intensively mined du and graedel 2013 ramos et al 2016 the world production in 2018 amounted to 170 000 metric tons of ree oxides with more than 70 mined in china the application of rees is generally distributed as follows catalysts 60 ceramics and glass 15 metallurgical applications and alloys 10 polishing 10 mineral commodity summaries 2015 elevated post archean australian shale paas normalized values of specific rees relative to the normalized values of the remaining rees can only be achieved by a selective input of specific rees and point towards an industrial contribution of the respective rees amongst all rees the fate of gd received the most attention due to the use of gd based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging mri european medicines agency 2017 elevated concentrations of gd in surface waters are associated with hospital wastewater kovalova et al 2013 k√ºmmerer and helmers 2000 as first reported by bau and dulski 1996 more than two decades ago since then elevated gd contents have been detected in several rivers and lakes bau et al 2006 elbaz poulichet et al 2002 klaver et al 2014 knappe et al 2005 lerat hardy et al 2019 m√∂ller et al 2002 2003 parant et al 2018 rabiet et al 2009 song et al 2017 following gd also la klaver et al 2014 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2011 and more recently sm associated with anthropogenic uses were observed in surface waters kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 compared to gd which is present in aqueous solutions as a stable complex la and sm are transported together with the particulate phase and occur mainly in the colloidal size range between 10 kda and 0 2 Œºm klaver et al 2014 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 furthermore slightly elevated la and sm concentrations in the han river have been associated with emissions from fluid catalytic converters song et al 2017 elevated ree concentrations reported for western xiamen bay china were explained by inputs of sewage sludge and fallout from coal combustion hu et al 2019 however all rees were enriched to a comparable degree indicating that specific ree sources in the wastewater were absent high concentrations of la ce pr nd and sm and enrichment of light rees lrees la gd compared to the heavy rees hrees tb lu in selected sewage sludge samples were explained by industrial discharges to wastewater systems kawasaki et al 1998 vivian 1986 however no attempts were made to quantify these industrial inputs elevated concentrations of rees were also reported from three different wwtps in china and were assigned to industrial sources suanon et al 2017 in the same study only the enrichments relative to the average crust were determined and the quantitative industrial inputs of the respective elements were not assessed nkinahamira et al 2019 suggested crustal materials as the main source of rees reported from 7 wwtps in xiamen city china as opposed to industrial inputs selectively increased la and ce values compared to other normalized rees however pointed towards an industrial input of la and ce verplanck et al 2010 investigated the ree patterns in sewage sludge from four large metropolitan wwtps in the united states but did not observe any ree anomalies the available data from the literature therefore suggest that a wide range of different amounts of individual rees from specific industrial sources are discharged to wastewater systems but this has not been addressed systematically to obtain an overview of the rees contents in sewage sludge we determined the ree concentrations in sewage sludge samples collected from 63 representative wwtps across switzerland for the identification of the fraction of all rees related to specific industrial inputs we refined the approach recently presented by gogos et al 2020 which relies on the change of ree ratios in sewage sludge due to the selective input of specific rees additionally the industrial fractions of individual rees were estimated by fitting the ree patterns of the sludge to a background ree pattern represented by the averaged ree pattern of 10 soils collected across switzerland both approaches included the whole suite of rees and enabled us to identify ree anomalies estimate the industrial fractions of rees in sewage sludge and quantify their contents in the sludge in terms of kg year 1 as both approaches rely on a change of the ree patterns industrial inputs having similar ree patterns as the background will not be detected and will contribute to the background ree loads in the manuscript we therefore define industrial ree inputs as inputs from industrial sources with specific ree patterns which are different from the ree patters of the background we also attribute excess gd which is mostly related to contrast agents for mri to industrial sources gd based contrast agents are mainly found in hospital waters but they still have an industrial origin with a very specific ree signature 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil samples soil samples were obtained from the swiss soil monitoring network nabo 2019 and included a range of different lithologies and land uses the locations of the 10 soils and the characteristics of the respective soils are given in the si figure s1 table s1 2 2 collection of sewage sludge samples all sludges included in this work were collected between february and march 2016 and are described in vriens et al 2017 the locations of the corresponding wwtps are provided in the si figure s2 the data on the connected population and on the sludge production volumes were updated and correspond to the years 2016 sludge production volumes and 2017 connected population table s2 2 3 characterization of soils and sewage sludge to determine the total ree content of the sludge and the soil samples between 30 and 50 mg of powdered material were digested using a two step digestion protocol the samples were first digested in 5 ml nitric acid hno3 69 wt suprapur rotipuran carl roth gmbh and 300 Œºl hydrofluoric acid hf 48 wt suprapur sigma aldrich using a microwave system mls ultraclave mls gmbh leutkirch germany in the second step the digests were reacted with 2 4 ml boric acid h3bo3 5 wt merck germany and afterwards filled to 50 ml with doubly deionized ddi water millipore 18 2 mœâ cm the measurements were conducted using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 8900 agilent technologies inc ca usa a certified reference material bcr 667 estuarine sediment with reference values for all rees was used for quality assurance recoveries were determined based on bcr samples digested and measured along with the sludge and soil samples the bcr material digested in duplicates or triplicates on 10 different days gave mean recoveries for all rees ranging between 95 lu and 113 pr figure s3 experimental samples sludge and soil were mostly digested in triplicates and in a few cases in duplicates for further data evaluation the average of the triplicates duplicates were used all data are presented in table s2 sludge and s3 soil oxide and hydroxide formation of lighter rees in the plasma of the icp ms is well documented and can lead to interferences with heavier rees aries et al 2000 dulski 1994 we therefore measured single elements standards of ba and selected rees la ce eu gd dy ho er lu most important for the current project were possible interferences between ceo ceoh and gd as ce showed the highest abundances of all rees in the sewage sludge icp ms measurements of a ce single element standard indeed resulted in increasing counts of 157gd figure s4 however the oxide hydroxide production rate was 0 1 and a respective correction of the measured gd values did only marginally affect the calculated industrial fractions of gd in the sewage sludge nevertheless the gd values were corrected accordingly furthermore up to 10 ppb of ba did not result in quantifiable counts for eu and thus the bao baoh production rates were considered negligible in addition single element standards of sn and sb were measured to evaluate interferences of these elements and their oxides 123sb16o hydroxides 122sn16oh with 139la even 10 ppb of sb and sn did not result in any quantifiable la counts also ba up to 10 pbb did not result in any quantifiable counts of the neighboring 139la 2 4 quantification of the industrial ree fractions in several studies ree anomalies mainly gd but more recently also la and sm were quantified by estimating the background concentrations of an element of interest eoi via an inter la sm or an extrapolation la of the concentrations of other mostly neighboring rees bau and dulski 1996 hatje et al 2016 klaver et al 2014 knappe et al 2005 kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 m√∂ller et al 2002 used a third order polynomial fit to the log10 transformed ree patterns to assess the background concentration of gd recently an alternative method to identify and quantify industrial contributions of rees in sewage sludge has been presented gogos et al 2020 which exploits the difference between specific ree ratios in the sewage sludge and in the background in this work we further modified and extended this approach later referred to as a1 to include the whole suite of rees la lu alternatively we fit ree patterns of the individual sewage sludge samples the background ree pattern and assign the differences to the industrial contribution of the respective rees approach a2 in both approaches which are explained below we use the averaged ree pattern of 10 soils collected across switzerland as a proxy for the background ree pattern in sewage sludge individual wwtps receiving substantial amounts of selected rees were identified based on outlier criteria 2 4 1 calculations based on the ree ratios the approach a1 is based on the assumption that the total amount of rees in the sludge can be described as the sum of an industrial and a background fraction whereas the background fraction exhibits a constant ree pattern reflecting the averaged ree pattern of the collected soil samples any modification of this background ree pattern results from an input of specific industrial rees the industrial fraction of specific rees in the sewage sludge can thus be calculated as follows eq 1 r e e r e f s l g r e e e o i s l g f r e e b k r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k f r e e i n d r e e r e f i n d r e e e o i i n d w i t h r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k c o n s t r e e r e f i n d r e e e o i i n d 0 eq 2 f r e e b k r e e r e f s l g r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k r e e e o i s l g eq 3 f r e e i n d 1 r e e r e f s l g r e e r e f b k r e e e o i b k r e e e o i s l g r e e e o i s l g r e e e o i b k and r e e e o i i n d refer to the concentrations of a specific element of interest in sludge slg and in the background bk with a possibly elevated concentration in the sludge due to specific industrial inputs ind r e e r e f s l g and r e e r e f b k refer to the concentrations of reference rees in the sludge and in the background which are assumed to be unaffected by specific industrial inputs therefore the term r e e r e f i n d reflecting the industrial contribution to the specific reference element becomes zero if a selected reference element is affected by industrial contributions which occasionally will be the case as our approach is based on using the whole suit of rees the calculated background factions f r e e b k will be larger than 1 pointing to an unsuitable choice of the reference element our full factorial approach results in 13 individual estimates 14 rees minus the eoi for every ree in all sewage sludge samples the data are visualized using boxplots where the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered as outliers and the outliers are plotted individually using the symbol outliers are defined as values that deviate more than 1 5 times from the interquartile range top or bottom of the box 2 4 2 calculations based on ree pattern fitting in the a2 approach it is assumed that most of the rees follow a background pattern represented by the averaged ree pattern of the soils the log10 transformed ree concentration values of the sewage sludge samples are fitted to the log10 transformed and averaged ree concentration values of the soil samples background following equation 4 and 5 eq 4 r e e s l g f r e e b k Œµ eq 5 r e e Œµ r e e r e e s l g f r e e b k r e e s l g refers to the concentration of specific rees in individual sludge samples and r e e b k refers to the average concentration of specific rees in the background f represents the background fraction of rees in the sewage sludge samples and Œµ represents the difference between the calculated and the measured ree concentrations in the individual sludge samples the sum of the absolute values of Œµ over all rees is minimized for each sewage sludge sample using the fminsearch routine in matlab r2019a the obtained background fraction f of rees in the sewage sludge samples can be converted to linear scale according to f b k 10 f the difference Œ¥ in log10 scale between the measured and the fitted ree concentrations of the sewage sludge samples can be assigned to the specific industrial input of individual rees and the share of each ree related to specific industrial inputs can be calculated according to f i n d 1 10 Œ¥ assuming that most of the ree are unaffected by industrial inputs of individual ree using log10 transformed ree concentration values the fit of the ree patterns between the sludge and the background is only marginally affected by occasionally increased concentrations of individual rees representing specific industrial inputs wwtps receiving substantial contributions of selected rees were identified based on the same outlier criteria as used for the a1 approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 ree patterns of sludge and soil samples the ree concentrations of the sludge samples and the medians thereof together with the average of the investigated soil samples and the paas concentrations reflecting the average compositions of the earth crust are given in fig 1 a the individual ree patterns of the soils are very similar to the ree pattern of the paas also the hree patterns of the sewage sludges were similar amongst each other and closely followed the ree patterns of the soils although at consistently lower concentrations this can be explained by variable inputs of unspecific ree loads having the same hree patterns as the averaged soils and thus supports the hypothesis that the averaged ree pattern of the soils can be used as a proxy for the background pattern of the rees in sewage sludge this is in contrast to the lrees where the concentrations show considerable differences and individual lines connecting neighboring rees cross each other ce and la concentrations of selected sludge samples project even above the soil ree patterns the considerable range in l ree concentrations in the sludge samples compared to the soil samples essentially representing anomalies of specific rees in the sludge is highlighted by normalizing the data to the paas values fig 1b individual spikes suggest an industrial contribution of individual rees to the sludge and ce appears to have the highest share interestingly a slight enrichment of the la concentrations mean values compared to the other normalized rees can be observed 3 2 background and industrial fractions of individual rees in sewage sludge based on ree ratios and using eq 2 and 3 approach a1 background f r e e b k and industrial f r e e i n d fractions contributing to the total amount of ree observed in the individual sludge samples were calculated the resulting fractions are visualized as boxplots either with respect to the rees used as reference elements or with respect to the wwtps and will be discussed based on the cases of ce figs 2a and 3 a and sm figs 2b and 3b as eoi these two elements were selected to represent rees which are used in high amounts ce and moderate amounts sm 3 2 1 differences in the background and industrial fractions of ce and sm calculated using different reference rees when plotting the background fractions of ce and sm f c e s m b k with respect to the individual reference elements rees on the x axis used for the calculations f c e s m b k close to 1 suggests that the ce and sm contents in the sludge samples are dominated by inputs from the background a f c e s m b k lower than 1 indicates industrial inputs of ce and sm an f c e s m b k larger than 1 indicates that the reference element rather than the eoi was affected by industrial contributions cerium the modal values of f c e b k indicated by the blue bars in the box plots and representing the majority of the wwtps are close to 1 for almost all rees used as reference elements fig 2a suggesting that the majority of the investigated wwtps do not receive substantial amounts of ce from industrial sources the only exception is observed when la is used as reference element leading to a modal value of f c e b k above 1 suggesting that most wwtps are affected by additional la inputs this is consistent with the higher paas normalized la values compared to all other rees fig 1b when ce is used as reference element its modal value must be 1 as in this case the reference element and the eoi coincide of interest are the outliers marked as red crosses below 1 indicating wwtps that receive substantial amounts of ce from industrial sources the outliers above 1 are caused by our full factorial approach and represent sludge samples where the ree used as reference element contain substantial industrial inputs the sludge from one wwtp location visp consistently resulted in f c e b k larger than 1 this wwtp mainly treats industrial wastewater which may be depleted in ce and thus resulting in ce depleted sewage sludge figure s5 this would explain the high f c e b k when ce is used as eoi alternatively an unusual ree signature of the soil exhibiting a strong ce depletion may also explain the ree pattern in the sludge however the ree pattern of a soil collected within the catchment area of this wwtp nicely aligns with the other soil ree patterns figure s5 we thus consider industrial processes resulting in either i the selective removal of ce from the wastewater before ce is incorporated into the sludge or ii higher amounts of ce passing the wwtp as more likely samarium for sm the modal values of f s m n a t also scatter around 1 and only the values calculated when using la as a reference element are significantly larger than 1 fig 2b this observation is in agreement with the data discussed for ce and again suggests that most wwtps receive la from additional sources la thus cannot be used as a reference element to quantify f r e e b k and f r e e i n d in sewage sludge a single outlier below the modal values of f s m b k can consistently be observed when using any of the other ree as reference elements this outlier represents a specific wwtp location windisch where the industrial inputs of sm dominate over the background contributions several outliers are located above 1 when ce is used as a reference element to calculate f s m b k sm as eoi this is consistent with the fact that we previously identified industrial ce in sewage sludge from several wwtps when using ce as an eoi fig 2a this industrial ce input distorted the background contributions and resulted in artificially high f s m b k exceeding 1 in addition several outliers above 1 were observed when gd was used as a reference element suggesting that also numerous wwtps receive industrial gd this is in line with reports where positive gd anomalies have been associated with gd used in contrast agents for mri bau and dulski 1996 klaver et al 2014 kovalova et al 2013 k√ºmmerer and helmers 2000 and will be discussed in more detail in section 3 5 3 2 2 differences in the background and industrial ce and sm fractions calculated for individual wwtps when rearranging the data along the different wwtps instead of along the different rees used as reference elements fig 3a and b modal values of f c e s m b k below 1 blue horizontal lines in the boxes indicate that the respective wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial ce and sm it is important to note that the modal values of f c e s m b k are estimated based on the ratios between ce sm and all other rees for better visibility and based on the reason discussed above the largest outliers above 1 have been omitted in fig 3a and b furthermore la was excluded as reference element as it has been identified as unsuitable for this purpose in the above discussions in the boxplots also the eoi was excluded as a reference element to avoid the situation of using for example ce as reference and as eoi which would by definition result in f c e s m b k of 1 see eq 1 for ce fig 3a the modal values for f c e b k of a few wwtps are substantially below 1 suggesting that the amounts of ce in the respective wwtp are affected by industrial inputs only for one wwtp the modal values project substantially above 1 it is the same wwtp location visp already identified previously based on the outliers above 1 consistently observed for all rees used as reference ree fig 2a for sm fig 3b the modal values of f s m b k of all but of one wwtp location windisch are close to 1 thus sm seems to be used and released to the wastewater systems only very locally the low modal value of f s m b k for this specific wwtp is reflected in the outliers close to the bottom of fig 2b 3 2 3 differences in the background and industrial fractions of all rees in all wwtps the calculations of the f c e s m b k individually discussed for ce and sm are extended to include all rees as eoi and are summarized in the form of boxplots presented in fig 4 the boxplots represent the modal values of f r e e b k for the different wwtps based on all rees and the outliers below 1 indicate wwtps that receive substantial fractions of the respective rees from specific industrial sources the boxplot for la is very different to the boxplots of the other rees and shows a modal value around 0 6 for f l a b k furthermore the individual values of f l a b k show large variations this means that most wwtps apparently receive substantial and very diverse amounts of la from additional sources for all other rees the modal values of f r e e b k scatter around 1 with the exception of a few wwtps which receive substantial amounts of specific rees most prominently ce and gd the reason for the unexpected occurrence la is not clear but would imply that industrial la is almost omnipresent in wwtps la is used in hybrid engines metal alloys and also various applications in the field of catalysis haque et al 2014 however emissions from such applications are less likely to end up in wastewater streams and the emission from possible production facilities would rather result in high input rates to a few selected wwtps furthermore la is commonly found in flints for cigarette lighters representing a pervasive application of la behrsing et al 2014 haque et al 2014 however in this application la is contained in a mischmetal which contains twice as much ce compared to la behrsing et al 2014 and respective emissions would go parallel with ce alternatively selected soil fertilizers show strong enrichments of la compared to other rees otero et al 2005 ramos et al 2016 a contribution from such fertilizers to the wastewater through agricultural runoff may therefore modify the ree patterns in the sludge and help to explain the elevated la concentrations observed in the sludge samples furthermore biological processes within the wwtps may fractionate la and thus modify the ree patterns of the sewage sludge for example lree dependent enzymes required for the methanol metabolism have been discovered in methylotrophic bacteria about a decade ago cotruvo 2019 hibi et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2012 l l wang et al 2020 more recently x wang et al 2020 identified methanotrophic bacteria whose enzymatic activities are strongly dependent on the la availability to what extent biological processes or fertilizer inputs into the wastewater are responsible for the high industrial fraction of la calculated for the sewage sludge samples remains open and needs to be addressed in future studies 3 3 industrial contributions of specific rees in specific wwtps the quantified industrial fractions for the individual rees and for each of the 63 wwtps derived from approach a1 are presented as a heat map fig 5 which allows an easy identification of wwtps that receive substantial amounts of industrial rees significant industrial fractions of specific rees in individual wwtps are identified as outliers and are projected in grey scale in the heat map this heat map clearly shows that only a small number of wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial rees a special case again is la as discussed above the fact that industrial fractions of la scatter around 0 4 background contribution of around 0 6 and show a very broad distribution results in large interquartile ranges without the identification of any outliers for the remaining rees ce is most important in terms of the number of wwtps receiving industrial inputs 7 wwtps followed by gd 5 wwtps high shares for sm and eu from industrial sources were detected in a single wwtp each these data generally support the hypothesis that rees are used in rather specialized applications and their release to the wastewater reflects individual point sources these results are in line with for example industrial sm detected in the river rhine which was assigned to a single cracking catalyst production facility kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 within a mass flow study addressing the role of different sewer systems controlling the amount of engineered nanomaterials discharged to the environment via stormwater runoff zheng et al 2019 assigned the majority of ceo2 np discharged to wastewater systems to industrial discharges ceo2 np are used as polishing agents for glass and silicon which limits the discharge to a few hotspots westerhoff et al 2015 concluded that the share of industrial sources of rees is small and nearly negligible compared to the crustal input on average this is certainly true but as demonstrated by our data the input of specific rees to individual wwtps can be dominated by industrial point sources 3 4 comparison of the results from the two model approaches ree ratio vs ree pattern fitting to compare the results of the ree ratio a1 and the pattern fitting a2 approaches to estimate the industrial fractions f r e e i n d of the rees in sewage sludge the same heat map as shown in fig 5 based on a1 is constructed using a2 figure s6 both heat maps are very similar reflected by the marginal differences of the two heat maps figure s7 based on both approaches essentially the same wwtp receiving substantial amounts of specific rees were identified minor differences in the absolute industrial fractions were mostly around 5 10 and may be explained by slight variations of the ree patterns of the soils the results discussed so far were addressing industrial and background fractions of rees in individual wwtps these relative industrial background fractions can be transformed into absolute masses using the sludge production rates of the individual wwtps and are discussed in the following section as both approaches to estimate the industrial background fractions of ree in sewage sludge produced almost identical results the following discussions are independent of the calculation method 3 5 mass based industrial contributions of ree to sewage sludge the mass based contributions of individual rees to the sewage sludge from individual wwtps were calculated by multiplying the industrial ree fractions with the measured concentrations and the annual sludge production digested sludge dry mass basis table s3 ce and considerably lower amounts of sm eu and gd dominate the annual industrial ree loads scaled to switzerland based on population equivalents fig 6 a the data for la have to be treated with care as explained in section 3 3 in most wwtps la from additional possibly industrial sources were detected modal values for f r e e i n d around 0 4 however based on our outlier criterion no wwtps were identified where the industrial la contributions following both evaluation schemes a1 and a2 qualified as outliers of the 63 investigated wwtps the locations of yverdon bioggio hofen and thal dominanted the total amount of rees attributed to specific industrial sources fig 6b the same pattern can be observed when looking at the loads of ce from industrial sources reflecting the dominat role of ce in controlling the total amount of industrial rees in sewage sludge figure s8a in the case of gd one wwtp dominates the total amount of industrial gd identified in all 63 wwtp figure s8b these results only partially reflect the reports documenting industrial rees in river waters from various locations industrial ce from the loire river in orleans and in the form of ceo2 nanoparticles has only been reported very recently phalyvong et al 2020 industrial gd however has been observed in river water lake water coastal water ground water and drinking water selected references are provided in the introduction and the presence of sm in river water rhine has only been reported in one study kulaksƒ±z and bau 2013 this bias is related to the chemical speciation of the respective rees in the waste and surface waters and also to the different sample preparation procedures most of the studies available in the literature targeted the dissolved fractions and thus most samples were filtered and often an exchange resin was used to further enrich the dissolved rees any rees present in the particulate fraction would not have been detected using these preparation schemes the low solubility products of ree3 phosphates 10 25 firsching and brune 1991 in combination with po4 3 concentrations of 10 9 5 m 3 10 10 m calculated using the software code spana version 2020 june 08 for a ph of 7 2 and a total orthophosphate p concentration of 3 mgl 1 100 Œºm gujer 2007 results in a calculated ree3 concentration of about 3 10 16 m or 4 6 10 11 mgl 1 calculated for nd thus we assume that the majority of the rees are transported in particulate form in the wastewater and thus are efficiently accumulated in the sewage sludge nevertheless future studies on selected wwtps should also investigate the dissolved fraction of the rees in the raw and treated wastewater to evaluate to what extent organic ree complexes contribute to the total flux of rees in wastewater systems gadolinium the fact that industrial gd is used in contrast agents in dissolved form as a stable and poorly sorbing chelate limits its incorporation into the sewage sludge in wwtps where removal efficiencies in the order of 10 have been reported telgmann et al 2012 kovalova et al 2013 even reported lower removal efficiencies 5 in a membrane bioreactor and only insignificant oxidation by ozonation and adsorption to activated carbon in this study we identified individual wwtps with elevated gd contents in the sewage sludge total amounts of industrial gd in the inflow and in the effluent of the 63 wwtps were estimated based on the gd concentrations in the sewage sludge and assuming 10 removal during the wastewater treatment the results indicate that in total 110 kg of gd are discharged annually to the 63 wwtps and thereof 100 kg are released to the surface waters and 11 kg gd remain in the sludge from these 11 kg about 80 can be assigned to one single wwtp 9 kg estimated for the sludge in the wwtp of ramsen and would correspond to a discharge of 90 kg to the surface water the wwtp of ramsen is located in the northeastern part of switzerland close to lake constance at the border between switzerland and germany it treats the wastewater amongst others from the city of singen germany where a cancer center including mri facilities is located hegau bodensee klinikum singen in addition industrial facilities producing large amounts of gd based contrast agents are also located within the catchment of the wwtp of ramsen thus the gd detected in this wwtp most probably is linked to the production and use of gd containing contrast agents cerium compared to gd which occurs as a complex and thus shows a poor removal during the wastewater treatment industrial ce is expected to be present in the nano particulate phase as suggested by gogos et al 2020 and phalyvong et al 2020 and is thus removed much more efficiently during wastewater treatment reported removal efficiencies for nanoscale particles generally exceed 95 georgantzopoulou et al 2018 kaegi et al 2011 ma et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2011 the total amounts of ce found in the sludge of the investigated wwtps which is related to industrial inputs amounts to 1000 kg and is dominated by 4 wwtps located in bioggio yverdon hofen and thal contributing to around 80 of the industrial ce found in the sewage sludge from the 63 wwtps however assuming an average removal efficiency of 95 1050 kg would be discharged annually to the wwtps and thereof 50 kg would be released to the aquatic environment thus although much larger amounts of industrial ce are discharged to individual wwtps compared to gd 1000 kg ce vs 110 kg gd the amount of gd released to the surface waters is expected to be considerably higher 100 kg gd vs 50 kg ce furthermore the ce particles in the effluent of the wwtp are expected to be present as heteroaggregates and may be incorporated into larger aggregates and eventually become integrated into the sediment industrial gd however will be present in the dissolved form as a stable complex with limited removal from the water phase over time combined with the higher natural abundance of ce compared to gd it is understandable that industrial gd has been frequently reported in the surface waters but industrial ce not yet the annual discharge of ceo2 np to sewer systems has recently been estimated for germany giese et al 2018 and values are around 28 000 kg year 1 scaling these amounts to switzerland based on population equivalents 83 mio in germany vs 8 6 mio in switzerland results in a value 2900 kg year 1 of ceo2 np discharged to wastewater systems when scaling the total amounts of industrial ce in the investigated wwtps 1000 kg year 1 to the whole of switzerland based on population equivalents 4 6 mio considered in this study vs 8 6 mio total in switzerland in 2019 the integrated mass of ce in sewage sludge in switzerland amounts to 2000 kg year 1 assuming a 95 removal efficiency and converting ce to ceo2 results in a flux of industrial ce to sewer systems of 2600 kg year 1 in agreement with the value of 2900 kg year 1 obtained from the mass flow model study giese et al 2018 however our data also indicate that discharge of industrial rees from wastewater systems is dominated by a few wwtps making the scale up to discharge amounts across switzerland challenging and the respective results should therefore be treated with great care 4 conclusions the ree patterns from several soil samples were very similar and represent the background ree patterns observed in the sewage sludge these patterns are distorted by inputs of specific rees resulting from industrial sources the extent of distortion of the ree patterns can be used to estimate the industrial contribution of individual rees in the sewage sludge very similar industrial fractions of specific rees in sewage sludge were calculated based on ree ratios and on ree pattern fitting approaches the deviations resulting from the two approaches were mostly 5 both approaches include the whole suite of rees and do not require prior knowledge on which industrial rees are present in the sludge digested sewage sludge with a typical hydraulic retention time of 12 16 days in anaerobic digesters integrates ree inputs over an extended period of time and is thus less susceptible to short term variations of the influent concentrations we showed that the fluxes of industrial rees in swiss sewage sludges are dominated by a few wwtps implying that point sources rather than diffuse sources control the amounts of industrial rees discharged to wwtps in future studies it may thus be most rewarding to identify industrial facilities processing specific rees and then including wwtps from the respective catchments the impact of different treatment steps e g primary clarification activated sludge treatment on the ree concentration in wastewater streams of the respective wwtps should be evaluated to get a better understanding of how and in which forms rees move through wastewater facilities based on the current dataset showing that several wwtps receive substantial amounts of industrial ce it can be concluded that industrial ce is likely the next ree that will be detected more frequently in surface waters or groundwater and or in sediments downstream of selected wwtps enrichments of gd observed in selected sewage sludge samples were associated with the release of gd based contrast agents from hospitals and or production facilities la seems enriched in most of the wwtps but without showing clear outliers and therefore we could not assign the la enrichments to specific industrial inputs biological processes modifying the retention of la in wwtps may help to explain the unexpectedly high apparent industrial fractions of la in sewage sludge alternatively la contributions from diffuse sources such as agricultural runoff of fertilizers with enriched la contents may additionally contribute to the la enrichments observed in the sewage sludge apart from the poorly understood ecological consequences of the ree discharge to the environment applications relying on stable ree background patterns may be challenged in the future for example the use of ree patterns to study geochemical processes in natural waters e g elderfield and greaves 1982 johannesson et al 2000 sholkovitz 1995 smedley 1991 may become increasingly difficult furthermore it has been suggested to use ree patterns for a source apportionment of food products to warrant specific quality labels magdas et al 2020 also this approach may become limited if for example sewage sludge enriched in specific industrial rees is used as fertilizer in agriculture our results supported by other previous reports on the occurrence of industrial rees in surface waters suggest that human activities can change the background ree patterns in urban environments and the increasing ree demand will further accentuate these changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

19964,eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs has prompted interest in using sediment capping technology to reduce the sediment contribution to internal nutrient loading one such sediment capping technology is phoslock a lanthanum embedded clay which can bind phosphate at the sediment surface and limit its diffusion into the water column however in well oxygenated lakes naturally occurring iron can bind phosphate by a similar mechanism we sought to test the efficacy of phoslock in limiting phosphate po4 3 fluxes relative to untreated iron rich lake sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia through laboratory batch core incubations of intact sediment cores from jordan lake a reservoir in central north carolina we found that phoslock decreased phosphate fluxes relative to the control under anoxic conditions 7 5 9 5 vs 236 74 ¬µmol po4 3 m 2 d 1 but provided no benefit relative to the control when the water column was oxygenated 4 5 4 3 vs 7 0 11 4 ¬µmol po4 3 m 2 d 1 we also found that phoslock itself can act as a source of nh4 to jordan lake waters applied at recommended levels to the whole lake phoslock addition would result in a pulse increase in water column nh4 concentrations of approximately 2 6 0 8 Œºm an increase of 10 to 275 compared to ambient graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords phoslock phosphate flux nutrient management core incubations oxia anoxia iron rich sediments 1 introduction nutrient loading including both nitrogen n and phosphorus p is responsible for widespread and long term eutrophication in lakes a process that is increasing in magnitude as humans continue to affect freshwater ecosystems through agriculture and development dodds et al 2013 smith et al 2006 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 once nutrients enter a freshwater lake or reservoir from the watershed they can stimulate primary productivity and harmful algal blooms and enhance the delivery of organic matter to the sediments le moal et al 2019 here various remineralization processes regenerate nutrients that accumulate in the porewater and can be returned to the water column through processes of diffusion berg et al 1998 bioirrigation murniati et al 2017 renz et al 2018 and bioturbation berg et al 2001 as a result of this benthic recycling often referred to as internal nutrient loading nutrients that enter a lake can contribute to eutrophication for many years s√∏ndergaard et al 2013 strategies for coping with nitrogen loading often rely on the establishment of denitrification favorable conditions vymazal 2007 aimed at permanent removal of reactive n from the environment by the biological reduction to non reactive n2 gas however managers hoping to reduce or reverse eutrophication in lakes often focus on reducing phosphorus loading schindler et al 2008 2016 which increases the n p ratio potentially limiting the dominance of n2 fixing cyanobacteria that can be a health hazard and nuisance schindler 2012 still the concept that p loading alone can solve lake eutrophication is controversial paerl et al 2011 due to the negative impacts that excess n can have on lake macrophyte communities moss et al 2013 additionally managed reductions of p in lakes without accompanying n management can decrease the ability of lakes to remove reactive n through nitrification denitrification finlay et al 2013 and exacerbate downstream eutrophication in often n limited estuaries and coastal areas paerl 2009 in some lakes especially those with clay rich sediments iron can effectively cap the release of phosphate from the sediments when the water column is oxygenated through the redox dependent formation of fe iii phosphate complexes in the oxygenated layers of sediment orihel et al 2015 2016 additionally lake sediments with low sulfide and high iron can permanently sequester p through the formation of the stable mineral vivianite in anoxic sediments eventually reducing concentrations of leachable p and thus its release to the water column g√§chter and m√ºller 2003 rothe et al 2014 when these natural processes are insufficient sinks for p loading and or it is not practical to decrease p loading from the watershed stakeholders may increasingly turn to engineering solutions such as sediment capping or dredging to decrease internal p loading l√ºrling et al 2017 l√ºrling and faassen 2012 guido waajen et al 2016 zamparas and zacharias 2014 one such approach is the capping of sediment with lanthanum embedded bentonite clay known commercially as phoslock phoslock has already been applied to a variety of lakes worldwide across broad ranges in morphology and designated use bishop et al 2014 bishop and richardson 2018 copetti et al 2015 dithmer et al 2016b spears et al 2013 2016 while these studies generally show a reduction in water column soluble reactive phosphorus srp other studies have highlighted unintended impacts of phoslock on sediment biogeochemistry such as changing the location of the sediment oxic anoxic boundary vopel et al 2008 additional risks include ecological toxicity related to the leaching of lanthanum from phoslock especially in lakes of low alkalinity gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 and associated bioaccumulation of lanthanum in the ecosystem has been reported van oosterhout et al 2014 g waajen et al 2017 other studies have indicated that phoslock may act as a direct source of ammonium nh4 when leached with ultrapure water in the laboratory including nanopore van oosterhout and l√ºrling 2013 and milli q reitzel et al 2013 water this ammonium may come from the bentonite clay matrix itself hanway et al 1957 and may not be removed during the phoslock manufacturing process while studies have shown that the phoslock clay matrix can be unstable under particular natural lake conditions such as low alkalinity and or high humic substance content as demonstrated by the release of la reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 studies have yet to demonstrate whether nh4 is leached from phoslock in natural lake water furthermore evidence is presently lacking for the efficacy of phoslock on intact sediment water interfaces as opposed to homogenized surface sediment egemose et al 2010 gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2013 wang et al 2016 where its effects on sediment biogeochemistry are expected to be more representative of the natural lake bed core incubation studies have demonstrated that phoslock amendment can decrease the release of p from homogenized sediments from lake rotorua gibbs et al 2011 and lake langes√∏ reitzel et al 2013 relative to untreated sediment even under oxic conditions when surface iron iii oxides would be potentially available to bind p it is probable that the relative efficacy of phoslock is dependent on characteristics of particular lakes such as the iron content in the sediments and we were interested in testing this relative efficacy for clay rich lake sediments common to the southeastern united states in this study we tested the relative efficacy of phoslock in reducing benthic phosphate fluxes compared to untreated iron rich cores under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia this study took place in a shallow reservoir in central north carolina representative of piedmont clay rich reservoirs throughout the southeastern united states we used batch incubations of intact sediment cores to measure the impact of phoslock on sediment water phosphate fluxes under conditions of oxia and anoxia and also observed whether ammonium is leached from phoslock with natural lake water 2 methods 2

recreation and other services to the broader triangle region berke et al 2013 the reservoir was constructed from 1973 to 1983 with the damming of the haw and new hope rivers within the cape fear river

stratification and bottom water anoxia during the summer cain 2017 2 2 sampling strategy short sediment cores 15 30 cm in length with core length determined by the availability of sediment above the historic riverbed were collected using a kajak brinkhurst kb corer with 4 7 cm id core liner wildco supply company all cores were taken near the north carolina division of water resources station cpf086f northeast of the state road 1008 bridge in jordan lake fig 1 between october 2017 and april 2018 in october 2017 8 cores were collected with 4 designated for use in the flux experiments and 4 sectioned immediately for pore water and solid phase analysis in february 2018 8 cores were again collected 5 for flux experiments and 3 for immediate sectioning while in april 2018 7 cores were collected 5 for flux experiments and 2 for immediate sectioning cores were collected during a 1 2 h period capped immediately along with the overlying water and stored upright on ice during transport within 1 h to a refrigerated room 4 c where they were kept in the dark until either sectioning or flux experiments in addition to the cores 20 l of bottom water was collected during each sampling trip from 0 5 m above the sediment surface with a van dorn sampler and stored in 10 l acid washed cubitainers this bottom water was quickly 1 h returned to a refrigerated room where it was kept until use in the flux experiments bottom water 10 ml was subsampled filtered 0 45 ¬µm and frozen for phosphate po4 3 ammonium nh4 and nitrate nitrite no3 no2 concentration analysis at wetland biogeochemistry analytical services wbas louisiana state university standard us epa methods were applied for all nutrient analyses o dell 1993 zhang et al 1997 zimmermann and keefe 1997 2 3 flux experiments flux experiments began within 2 weeks of sediment core collection and 3 separate experiments were conducted to test the impact of phoslock and redox conditions on sediment water nutrient fluxes experiment 1 with the first collection of cores tested nutrient fluxes in unaltered sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia experiment 2 with the second collection of cores considered the effect of phoslock treatment with oxic bottom waters experiment 3 with the third collection of cores considered the effect of phoslock treatment with anoxic bottom waters the use of unaltered sediment as controls in experiments 2 and 3 allowed us to test the relevant research question while minimizing the influence of seasonal differences between late winter and early spring for each experiment fluxes were generally measured multiple times per core after the replacement of overlying water with fresh bottom water and these separate flux measurements are referred to as trials with the combination of replicate cores and trials multiple pseudo replicates were established for each treatment condition prior to the first trial of each experiment cores and bottom water were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature 19 20 c and overlying water was carefully removed from each core via syphon and replaced with 150 ml of bottom water this volume was chosen to be small enough to be responsive to benthic nutrient fluxes yet large enough to not be substantially affected by the removal of 9 10 ml sample volume deviations from the following procedure when phoslock was dosed are described in the next paragraph humidified air or nitrogen gas depending on oxic vs anoxic treatment was bubbled through the overlying water at a metered flow rate sufficient to ensure mixing of the water column without re suspending sediment using j shaped steel hplc tubing which lay just above the sediment water interface in this way the bubbles flowed gently upwards from the sediment water interface mixing the water column without resuspending the sediment this rate was tested and confirmed with a dye tracer experiment all cores were wrapped with aluminum foil throughout the experiment to keep the sediments and overlying water dark and the temperature of the room measured multiple times each day was consistently 19 20 c overlying water samples were taken at known time intervals with the initial sample taken at the start of gas bubbling over a period of 1 5 days samples were filtered 0 45 ¬µm 9 10 ml and frozen prior to analysis for po4 3 nh4 and no3 no2 at wbas after removing an aliquot of overlying water the same volume of bottom water was added to each core maintaining an overlying water volume of 150 ml nutrient concentrations in this bottom water were measured for each sampling day and used to correct the overlying water concentration for the effect of replacement for experiment 1 all 4 cores were run under oxic conditions for the first trial after which the bottom water was replaced and 2 cores were run under oxic conditions and 2 cores under anoxic conditions for the second trial for experiments 2 and 3 three cores were treated with phoslock and two cores remained untreated as the control and the experiments continued over the course of 3 trials sediment cores treated with phoslock were dosed prior to the start of the first trial only phoslock was provided by sepro corporation sepro research and technology campus whitakers north carolina usa the mass of phoslock added was determined from the proposed addition to jordan lake given by sepro at 1 8 m3 ha 1 scaled to the surface area of the core west bishop personal communication this amounted to 0 5 g phoslock per 4 7 cm id diameter core creating a phoslock layer approximately 1 2 mm thick this dosage is in the range of dosage rates used in previous studies e g 100 200 the dosage used by gibbs et al 2011 and 25 of the dosage rate of reitzel et al 2013 when phoslock was dosed 140 ml of bottom water was added to the core instead of the full 150 ml then 5 ml overlying water was added to a scintillation vial containing 0 5 g phoslock which was poured over the core followed by 5 ml of overlying water as a rinse our application method was intended to create an even distribution of phoslock across the sediment water interface after phoslock had settled 5 6 h gas flow was turned on for all phoslock and control cores and the initial sample of the experiment was taken the po4 3 flux was calculated from the slope of corrected po4 3 concentration vs time multiplied by the volume of overlying water and divided by the surface area of the sediment in the first trial of anoxic treatments experiment 1 trial 2 or experiment 3 trial 1 po4 3 fluxes appeared to be delayed by 20 h which was likely caused by the slow transition of surface sediments from oxic to anoxic more precisely we presume this time lag was caused by the slow reduction of fe iii to fe ii given our observation of a change in color from red to gray at the sediment surface this is consistent with recent observations from lake erie where po4 3 release was not observed under hypoxic conditions but instead was observed between 12 and 24 h following the onset of anoxic conditions anderson et al 2021 due to this suppression of po4 3 fluxes at the start of the anoxic trials po4 3 fluxes were only calculated after this 20 hour time window had passed once the po4 3 concentration started increasing the nh4 flux was calculated in a similar manner however because we observed a non negligible accumulation of nh4 in the overlying water at longer incubation times which artificially depresses measured and calculated sediment water fluxes we calculated nh4 fluxes using the first 24 40 h of each trial 2 4 core sectioning and porewater chemistry sediment cores selected for immediate sectioning were processed within 1 week of retrieval from jordan lake while those used in flux experiments were sectioned 1 3 days following the termination of the flux experiment prior to core sectioning overlying water was carefully removed via syphon and cores were extruded at 1 cm intervals for the top 3 cm followed by 3 cm intervals for the remainder of the core extruded sediment was collected in clean 65 ml centrifuge tubes cooled in a refrigerator 4 c then centrifuged at 4 c to separate porewater and sediment porewater was passed through a 0 45 ¬µm syringe filter and frozen until po4 3 nh4 and no3 no2 analysis at wbas as we did not expect to find no3 no2 below 3 cm we analyzed no3 no2 for the top 3 cm only care was taken throughout the process to minimize the introduction of oxygen prior to filtering which could decrease the amount of po4 3 by forming particulate fe iii complexes samples for po4 3 were acidified prior to analysis which would free any po4 3 adsorbed on fe iii in the post filtered sample 3 results 3 1 flux experiments in experiment 1 oxia vs anoxia in untreated lake sediment we found that po4 3 did not appreciably increase with time for untreated cores under oxic conditions fig 2 a filled symbols for either trial however under anoxic conditions there was a measurable release of po4 3 from the sediment fig 2 a open symbols we observed a 20 hour delay of po4 3 release for cores 2 and 4 presumably due to the time required to reduce fe iii to fe ii on the sediment surface as the cores transitioned from oxic to anoxic conditions anderson et al 2021 we observed variable response of nh4 under oxic conditions with concentrations increasing during the first trial by large amounts for core 1 and core 2 and smaller amounts for core 3 and core 4 increases in nh4 continued for core 1 in the second trial while reductions in nh4 were observed for core 3 fig 2 b filled symbols under anoxic conditions overlying nh4 increased the most for core 2 with a moderate increase observed for core 4 fig 2 b open symbols changes in no3 no2 were not observed under anoxic conditions fig 2 c open symbols while increases were observed under oxic conditions especially in trial 2 after 48 h had passed fig 2 c filled symbols in experiment 2 phoslock treatment under oxic conditions we found that the overlying water po4 3 concentration did not appreciably change with time under oxic conditions for both phoslock treatment and the control for all three trials fig 3 a note the y axis scale for both nh4 and no3 no2 we found very strong differences between trials fig 3 b and c nh4 concentrations at the first timepoint were elevated in the phoslock treatments and remained slightly elevated relative to bottom water even after overlying water was replaced for the second trial fig 3 b red symbols and blue triangle despite the elevated initial concentration we observed nh4 uptake in each subsequent trial for both phoslock and control which we attribute to apparent nitrification fig 3 b bottom waters collected for experiment 2 were elevated in no3 no2 compared to bottom waters for experiments 1 and 3 fig 3 c blue triangles this concentration gradient fueled sediment uptake of no3 and no2 during the first half of trial 1 for both phoslock and control fig 3 c in subsequent trials overlying water no3 no2 concentrations increased with time fig 3 c most strongly for the phoslock treated core 4 in experiment 3 phoslock treatment under anoxic conditions we found that under anoxic conditions untreated sediment cores exhibited a measurable po4 3 concentration increase fig 4 a black symbols while phoslock treatment prevented such po4 3 release under otherwise identical conditions fig 4 a red symbols we again observed an increase in nh4 concentration for the first timepoint of trial 1 with phoslock treatment fig 4 b red symbols for untreated cores as well as phoslock treated cores after trial 1 nh4 concentrations increased in the overlying water with time although this trend was weaker for core 2 in trial 2 fig 4 b no3 no2 concentrations remained low for all treatments and cores consistent with the suppression of nitrification under anoxia fig 4 c note the y axis scale we are cautious about interpreting the relative impact of phoslock on the nitrogen cycle under either oxic or anoxic conditions because the potential impact of the large and sudden increase in nh4 concentration 130 240 ¬µm is enhanced by our experimental choice of a batch incubation setup however previously reported flow through incubations may have missed this nh4 release due to the exchange of water between phoslock dosing and the start of the experiment gibbs et al 2011 due to our artificially small overlaying water volume 150 ml vs 7 5 l for the average water column depth over the same area in jordan lake the concentration increases in nh4 due to phoslock treatment would be much greater in our experimental setup than it would if applied to jordan lake this in turn could have lingering impacts on nh4 and no3 no2 observations in subsequent trials either by artificially affecting nitrification and subsequent denitrification rates or by artificially increasing the porewater concentrations in the upper few centimeters of the core 3 2 core profiles and bottom water chemistry our approach to quantifying sediment water fluxes requires that porewater po4 3 and nh4 concentrations remained stable for the 0 2 weeks prior to the start of the flux experiment storage at 4 c and for the 5 15 day duration of the flux experiments room temperature in general porewater nutrient profiles for cores that were sectioned shortly after collection fig 5 all charts non flux green were similar to profiles of cores that were sectioned after the completion of the flux experiments fig 5 all charts black and red however there are some important deviations to point out for each treatment non flux post flux control and phoslock and experiment we conducted anova rstudio to compare the means while the small sample size n 2 4 is an issue for this analysis the results for the top 5 cm can be found in the supporting information supplementary figure s1 in experiment 1 core 5 non flux showed elevated po4 3 concentrations in the top three cm fig 5 a green diamond although the other three non flux cores were much more similar to the post flux cores fig 5 a and the differences were not significant p 0 1 in depths lower than the top three cm core 8 and core 6 non flux also had at least one elevated fraction fig 5 a green circle and triangle however it should be noted that the flux experiments would be most sensitive to the uppermost fraction po4 3 concentrations as these have the greatest influence on diffusive fluxes post flux cores showed a small elevation in nh4 concentration relative to non flux cores p 0 05 in the uppermost fractions and this trend was reversed at depths below 7 cm fig 5 b for no3 no2 all concentrations were low for both post flux and non flux cores fig 5 c although a slight elevation was observed at 0 5 cm for core 5 non flux fig 5 c green diamond for this experiment a trend in nh4 or no3 no2 porewater concentrations based on trial 2 oxic treatment core 1 and core 3 vs anoxic treatment core 2 and core 4 could not be established in experiment 2 porewater po4 3 concentrations were broadly similar between non flux control and phoslock cores especially through the top 5 cm fig 5 d although core 6 non flux was elevated relative to the others at depths fig 5 d green diamond all cores exhibited lower po4 3 concentrations in the upper 5 cm relative to those cores sectioned for experiment 1 fig 5 a vs d for nh4 we observed moderately higher concentrations in the top 3 cm for non flux cores p 0 05 and phoslock cores also moderately elevated over control cores fig 5 e although these trends did not continue with depths although studies with different experimental setups have associated elevated porewater nh4 concentrations with reductions in nitrification rates due to phoslock treatment lin et al 2017 song et al 2020 we are unable to say whether the elevated porewater nh4 that we observed was due to phoslock itself or due to the pulse of nh4 to the overlaying water upon phoslock dispersal the control cores had much higher no3 no2 concentrations at 0 5 cm p 0 001 than either the non flux or phoslock cores fig 5 f black which is likely related to the lower nh4 values due to increased nitrification under the oxic conditions in experiment 3 po4 3 concentrations in control and phoslock cores were elevated relative to the non flux cores in the first 0 5 cm fraction however this difference did not continue down core fig 5 g black and red vs green and it was also not significant p 0 1 however because only data from the top 5 cm were available for core 6 non flux we only have one full profile of a non flux core for this experiment nh4 profiles were broadly similar across treatments fig 5 h p 0 1 however core 5 phoslock had somewhat lower concentrations below 5 cm fig 5 h red star no3 no2 concentrations were low regardless of treatment fig 5 i for all three experiments bottom water concentrations were generally lower than the first porewater 0 5 cm fraction for all analytes with the exception of experiment 2 in which the bottom water had the same po4 3 concentration as most porewater 0 5 cm fractions fig 5 d blue triangle and no3 no2 was much higher than all porewater 0 5 cm fractions including the control cores fig 5 f blue triangle 4 discussion prior experimental determinations of the impact of phoslock on po4 3 flux used cores packed with homogenized sediment with the intention of reducing variability between cores egemose et al 2010 gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2013 however homogenization also has the unintended effect of blurring the gradients near the sediment water interface and affects sediment physico chemical properties thereby artificially changing diffusive fluxes hence homogenized cores are considered less representative of the natural lake sediments than intact cores our strategy of using some cores only for sectioning allows us to use intact cores and also address the variability and the impact of the experimental design on the results we did so by conducting a two factor anova test rstudio aov condition trial type iii considering the impact of trial number and condition oxic control oxic phoslock anoxic control anoxic phoslock on sediment water fluxes which showed that mean po4 3 fluxes were not significantly different between trials p 0 05 despite significant differences based on condition p 0 05 given the visible similarity of our porewater profiles and the lack of significant relationship between po4 3 flux and trial number we can conclude that our experimental design was reasonably effective at operating under steady state conditions allowing us to consider our pseudo replicates as true replicates the primary goal of this study was to establish the relative efficacy of phoslock amendment and natural sedimentary iron under oxic and anoxic bottom water conditions in clay rich sediments we found that when the overlying water was oxygenated po4 3 flux was not statistically different p 0 05 between the control 7 0 11 4 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and phoslock treatments 4 5 4 3 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 fig 6 oxic these results are in contrast to a prior study in lake rotorua a volcanic lake with very high internal p in new zealand where it was found that phoslock amendment could increase sediment uptake of drp dissolved reactive phosphate under oxic conditions to approximately 12 mg m 2 d 1 from approximately 2 5 mg m 2 d 1 for the control gibbs et al 2011 our results are also in contrast with results from lake langes√∏ which indicated that phoslock could improve p uptake from 44 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 control to 51 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 this highlights the importance of sediment and lake type when assessing the potential efficacy of phoslock jordan lake s bottom waters often become suboxic in mid summer and under anoxic conditions we found that phoslock treatment effectively decreased sediment po4 3 fluxes 7 5 9 5 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 relative to untreated sediment 236 74 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 fig 6 anoxic this finding is similar to the results reported from lake rotorua gibbs et al 2011 where a drp flux of 8 mg m 2 d 1 was observed with phoslock treatment and 27 mg m 2 d 1 flux for the control the iron rich jordan lake sediment creates a natural barrier to po4 3 release but only under oxic conditions as po4 3 bonds nearly irreversibly with fe iii this natural barrier to po4 3 release was active during our study as seen in the statistically indistinguishable po4 3 fluxes between the phoslock and oxic control treatments fig 6 p 0 05 in other words unamended jordan lake sediments are just as effective at reducing po4 3 fluxes as sediments with phoslock treatment provided that the bottom water is oxygenated jordan lake experiences water quality issues throughout the year even when the bottom water is oxygenated during the fall through spring cain 2017 wiltsie et al 2018 our results suggest that phoslock treatment will not mitigate these water quality issues when the water column is mixed and may only be effective at reducing the intensity summer algal blooms we also observed an unexpected and large release of nh4 directly from phoslock this nh4 release was enough to increase the nh4 concentration of the 150 ml overlying water by 129 40 ¬µm above bottom water levels for the first trial fig 7 a trial 1 red this nh4 release from phoslock could be a significant input of labile n to jordan lake assuming a 4 3 m water column the average depth of jordan lake the nh4 released from phoslock amounts to an increase in lake nh4 concentration of 2 6 0 8 Œºm as the observed bottom water nh4 concentrations ranged from 1 22 to 19 4 Œºm fig 5 b e and h blue this increase represents a roughly 10 to 275 increase in whole lake water column nh4 concentrations using the nh4 benthic flux for the anoxic controls 2 0 1 0 mmol nh4 m 2 d 1 fig 7 b anoxic black we can estimate that the sediment contribution of nh4 increases water column concentrations by roughly 0 48 0 24 ¬µm d 1 in this case the anoxic control nh4 flux is used because the nh4 flux is less affected by either nitrification or the pulse of nh4 from phoslock treatment thus phoslock could contribute the equivalent of roughly 2 5 14 days median 5 5 days of sediment nh4 loading within minutes to hours of its application although this estimate is calculated using our experimental results from a temperature of 19 20 c a small increase in nh4 was also observed in the control for the first trial fig 7 a trial 1 black which was likely a result of the initial sample for this trial being collected 5 6 h after the addition of bottom water to allow for phoslock settling and could represent a 5 6 hour nh4 flux this factor was not present in subsequent trials fig 5 a trial 2 and trial 3 black which did not have such a delay which indicates that our bottom water addition process was minimally disruptive to the sediment water interface as phoslock was only added prior to the first trial and overlying waters were replaced between trials the impact of phoslock on the initial nh4 concentration was greatly reduced for trial 2 and eliminated for trial 3 fig 7 a trial 2 and trial 3 red despite the increase in initial nh4 concentrations we saw sediment uptake of nh4 under oxic conditions relative to anoxic conditions and this difference persisted across control and phoslock treatments fig 7 b suggesting rapid nitrification of nh4 fig 3 b and c while the reduction in overlying water nh4 throughout experiment 2 suggests that this input of nh4 could be rapidly cycled in an oxygenated jordan lake fig 3 b red there is reason to suspect that phoslock treatment could reduce the ability of the sediments to remove excess nh4 through nitrification denitrification processes relative to untreated lake sediment phoslock has been shown to decrease the oxygen penetration depth in sediments potentially into the phoslock layer itself for larger phoslock treatments vopel et al 2008 which could decrease nitrification rates which occur in the thin oxygenated zone of sediments extended phoslock treatment has been linked to a reduction in nitrification rates estimated either through increased porewater nh4 song et al 2020 or through reductions in abundance of archaeal ammonia oxidizers lin et al 2017 in our study phoslock treated cores also showed elevated nh4 and reduced no3 no2 porewater concentrations relative to the control cores fig 5 e and f red vs black which provides some evidence for this effect however the results of experiment 2 phoslock under oxic conditions offer mixed evidence of reduced nitrification with phoslock as phoslock treated cores 3 and 5 show reduced water column no3 no2 relative to the control cores 1 and 2 while core 4 phoslock shows elevated no3 no2 fig 3 c as the batch incubation heightened the impact of the nh4 input from phoslock and as we did not measure n2 or quantify nitrification or denitrification rates these results can only provide limited qualitative rather than quantitative support for phoslock reducing nitrification rates in lake sediments our study is not the first to identify phoslock as a potential source of nh4 for example van oosterhout et al found that phoslock released nh4 into nanopore water at a rate of 223 mg kg 1 phoslock van oosterhout and l√ºrling 2013 reitzel et al reported that 4 grams of phoslock could release 10 3 mmol nh4 m 2 when dispersed in milli q water however they did not observe a corresponding increase in nh4 when dispersed in their lake langes√∏ water during their laboratory incubations which they attributed to the lake s high alkalinity reitzel et al 2013 thus the nh4 release from phoslock may vary with lake water chemistry especially alkalinity however our study shows that substantial nh4 release is likely in jordan lake and should be considered when deciding whether phoslock application is appropriate this is especially true because as a reservoir jordan lake is connected to the cape fear river and is upstream of the cape fear estuary a potentially more n limited system burkholder et al 2006 paerl 2009 simultaneously increasing n while effectively managing summertime p could have unintended consequences for jordan lake s n filtration ecosystem service finlay et al 2013 our experiments did not fully address the reasons for nh4 release from phoslock but other studies have indicated that low alkalinity reitzel et al 2013 could contribute to the release of nh4 potentially due to an increase in the phoslock clay dispersion in soft water vs hard waters with high ca2 concentration reitzel et al 2017 if clay dispersion is the reason for this nh4 release then it is reasonable to expect that lanthanum may also be released with jordan lake water although we did not measure it lanthanum is released under variable ph conditions ross et al 2008 when humic or fulvic acid content is high dithmer et al 2016 reitzel et al 2017 reitzel et al 2013 wang et al 2016 or when alkalinity is low reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 our observed large release of nh4 suggests that the phoslock matrix might not be stable in jordan lake waters and might be a source of heavy metal pollutants including lanthanum 5 conclusion this study tested the efficacy of phoslock in reducing internal phosphate nutrient loading from iron rich sediments in comparison with simple bottom water oxygenation we found that phoslock did not provide an additional benefit compared to untreated sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia in jordan lake representative of fall through spring conditions a piedmont reservoir in central north carolina however during stratified summertime periods when jordan lake bottom waters experience anoxia our results show that phoslock is more effective at lowering sediment phosphate fluxes compared with the anoxic control without phoslock this study did not test the long term effectiveness of phoslock which may decrease as sediments bury the phoslock amended layer we also found that phoslock itself can be a source of ammonium when dispersed in jordan lake water our experimental treatment of 500 mg of phoslock per core increased nh4 concentration by 129 40 ¬µm in our 150 ml overlying waters an equivalent to roughly 5 5 days of estimated sediment nh4 loadings from untreated sediment this nh4 release could exacerbate issues of n export to downstream areas

19964,eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs has prompted interest in using sediment capping technology to reduce the sediment contribution to internal nutrient loading one such sediment capping technology is phoslock a lanthanum embedded clay which can bind phosphate at the sediment surface and limit its diffusion into the water column however in well oxygenated lakes naturally occurring iron can bind phosphate by a similar mechanism we sought to test the efficacy of phoslock in limiting phosphate po4 3 fluxes relative to untreated iron rich lake sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia through laboratory batch core incubations of intact sediment cores from jordan lake a reservoir in central north carolina we found that phoslock decreased phosphate fluxes relative to the control under anoxic conditions 7 5 9 5 vs 236 74 ¬µmol po4 3 m 2 d 1 but provided no benefit relative to the control when the water column was oxygenated 4 5 4 3 vs 7 0 11 4 ¬µmol po4 3 m 2 d 1 we also found that phoslock itself can act as a source of nh4 to jordan lake waters applied at recommended levels to the whole lake phoslock addition would result in a pulse increase in water column nh4 concentrations of approximately 2 6 0 8 Œºm an increase of 10 to 275 compared to ambient graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords phoslock phosphate flux nutrient management

enter a freshwater lake or reservoir from the watershed they can stimulate primary productivity and harmful algal blooms and enhance the delivery of organic matter to the sediments le moal et al 2019

murniati et al 2017 renz et al 2018 and bioturbation berg et al 2001 as a result of this benthic recycling often referred to as internal nutrient loading nutrients that enter a lake can contribute to eutrophication for many years s√∏ndergaard et al 2013 strategies for coping with nitrogen loading often rely on the establishment of denitrification favorable conditions vymazal 2007 aimed at permanent removal of reactive n from the environment by the biological reduction to non reactive n2 gas however managers hoping to reduce or reverse eutrophication in lakes often focus on reducing phosphorus loading schindler et al 2008 2016 which increases the n p ratio potentially limiting the dominance of n2 fixing cyanobacteria that can be a health hazard and nuisance schindler 2012 still the concept that p loading alone can solve lake eutrophication is controversial paerl et al 2011 due to the negative impacts that excess n can have on lake macrophyte communities moss et al 2013 additionally managed reductions of p in lakes without accompanying n management can decrease the ability of lakes to remove reactive n through nitrification denitrification finlay et al 2013 and exacerbate downstream eutrophication in often n limited estuaries and coastal areas paerl 2009 in some lakes especially those with clay rich sediments iron can effectively cap the release of phosphate from the sediments when the water column is oxygenated through the redox dependent formation of fe iii phosphate complexes in the oxygenated layers of sediment orihel et al 2015 2016 additionally lake sediments with low sulfide and high iron can permanently sequester p through the formation of the stable mineral vivianite in anoxic sediments eventually reducing concentrations of leachable p and thus its release to the water column g√§chter and m√ºller 2003 rothe et al 2014 when these natural processes are insufficient sinks for p loading and or it is not practical to decrease p loading from the watershed stakeholders may increasingly turn to engineering solutions such as sediment capping or dredging to decrease internal p loading l√ºrling et al 2017 l√ºrling and faassen 2012 guido waajen et al 2016 zamparas and zacharias 2014 one such approach is the capping of sediment with lanthanum embedded bentonite clay known commercially as phoslock phoslock has already been applied to a variety

generally show a reduction in water column soluble reactive phosphorus srp other studies have highlighted unintended impacts of phoslock on sediment biogeochemistry such as changing the location of the sediment oxic anoxic boundary vopel et al 2008 additional risks include ecological toxicity related to the leaching of lanthanum from phoslock especially in lakes of low alkalinity gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 and associated bioaccumulation of lanthanum in the ecosystem has been reported van oosterhout et al 2014 g waajen et al 2017 other studies have indicated that phoslock may act as a direct source of ammonium nh4 when leached with ultrapure water in the laboratory including nanopore van oosterhout and l√ºrling 2013 and milli q reitzel et al 2013 water this ammonium may come from the bentonite clay matrix itself hanway et al 1957 and may not be removed during the phoslock manufacturing process while studies have shown that the phoslock clay matrix can be unstable under particular natural lake conditions such as low alkalinity and or high humic substance content as demonstrated by the release of la reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 studies have yet to demonstrate whether nh4 is leached from phoslock in natural lake water furthermore evidence is presently lacking for the efficacy of phoslock on intact sediment water interfaces as opposed to homogenized surface sediment egemose et al 2010 gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2013 wang et al 2016 where its effects on sediment biogeochemistry are expected to be more representative of the natural lake bed core incubation studies have demonstrated that phoslock amendment can decrease the release of p from homogenized sediments from lake rotorua gibbs et al 2011 and lake langes√∏ reitzel et al 2013 relative to untreated sediment even under oxic conditions when surface iron iii oxides would be potentially available to bind p it is probable that the relative efficacy of phoslock is dependent on characteristics of particular lakes such as the iron content in the sediments and we were interested in testing this relative efficacy for clay rich lake sediments common to the southeastern united states in this study we tested the relative efficacy of phoslock in reducing benthic phosphate fluxes compared to untreated iron rich cores under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia this study took place in a shallow reservoir in central north carolina representative of piedmont clay rich reservoirs throughout the southeastern united states we used batch incubations of intact sediment cores to measure the impact of phoslock on sediment water phosphate fluxes under conditions of oxia and anoxia and also observed whether ammonium is leached from phoslock with natural lake water 2 methods 2

historic riverbed were collected using a kajak brinkhurst kb corer with 4 7 cm id core liner wildco supply company all cores were taken near the north carolina division of water resources station cpf086f northeast of the state road 1008 bridge in jordan lake fig 1 between october 2017 and april 2018 in october 2017 8 cores were collected with 4 designated for use in the flux experiments and 4 sectioned immediately for pore water and solid phase analysis in february 2018 8 cores were again collected 5 for flux experiments and 3 for immediate sectioning while in april 2018 7 cores were collected 5 for flux experiments and 2 for immediate sectioning cores were collected during a 1 2 h period capped immediately along with the overlying water and stored upright on ice during transport within 1 h to a refrigerated room 4 c where they were kept in the dark until either sectioning or flux experiments in addition to the cores 20 l of bottom water was collected during each sampling trip

experiments began within 2 weeks of sediment core collection and 3 separate experiments were conducted to test the impact of phoslock and redox conditions on sediment water nutrient fluxes experiment 1 with the first collection of cores tested nutrient fluxes in unaltered sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia and anoxia experiment 2 with the second collection of cores considered the effect of phoslock treatment with oxic bottom waters experiment 3 with the third collection of cores considered the effect of phoslock treatment with anoxic bottom waters the use of unaltered sediment as controls in experiments 2 and 3 allowed us to test the relevant research question while minimizing the influence of seasonal differences between late winter and early spring for each experiment fluxes were generally measured multiple times per core after the replacement of overlying water with fresh bottom water and these separate flux measurements are referred to as trials with the combination of replicate cores and trials multiple pseudo replicates were established for each treatment condition prior to the first trial of each experiment cores and bottom water were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature 19 20 c and overlying water was carefully removed from each core via syphon and replaced with 150 ml of bottom water this volume was chosen to be small enough to be responsive to benthic nutrient fluxes yet large enough to not be substantially affected by the removal of 9 10 ml sample volume deviations from the following procedure when phoslock was dosed are described in the next paragraph humidified air or nitrogen gas depending on oxic vs anoxic treatment was bubbled through the overlying water at a metered flow rate sufficient to ensure mixing of the water column without re suspending sediment using j shaped steel hplc tubing which lay just above the sediment water interface in this way the bubbles flowed gently upwards from the sediment water interface mixing the water column without resuspending the sediment this rate was tested and confirmed with a dye tracer experiment all cores were wrapped with aluminum foil throughout the experiment to keep the sediments and overlying water dark and the temperature of the room measured multiple times each day was consistently 19 20 c overlying water samples were taken at known time intervals with the initial sample taken at the start of gas bubbling over a period of 1 5 days samples were filtered 0 45 ¬µm 9 10 ml and frozen prior to analysis for po4 3 nh4 and no3 no2 at wbas after removing an aliquot of overlying water the same volume of bottom water was added to each core maintaining an overlying water volume of 150 ml nutrient concentrations in this bottom water were measured for each sampling day and used to correct the overlying water concentration for the effect of replacement for experiment 1 all 4 cores were run under oxic conditions for the first trial after which the bottom water was replaced and 2 cores were run under oxic conditions and 2 cores under anoxic conditions for the second trial for experiments 2 and 3 three cores were treated with phoslock and two cores remained untreated as the control and the experiments continued over the course of 3 trials sediment cores treated with phoslock were dosed prior to the start of the first trial only phoslock was provided by sepro corporation sepro research and technology campus whitakers north carolina usa the mass of phoslock added was determined from the proposed addition to jordan lake given by sepro at 1 8 m3 ha 1 scaled to the surface area of the core west bishop personal communication this amounted to 0 5 g phoslock per 4 7 cm id diameter core creating a phoslock layer approximately 1 2 mm thick this dosage is in the range of dosage rates used in previous studies e g 100 200 the dosage used by gibbs et al 2011 and 25 of the dosage rate of reitzel et al 2013 when phoslock was dosed 140 ml of bottom water was added to the core instead of the full 150 ml then 5 ml overlying water was added to a scintillation vial containing 0 5 g phoslock which was poured over the core followed by 5 ml of overlying water as a rinse our application method was intended to create an even distribution of phoslock across the sediment water interface after phoslock had settled 5 6 h gas flow was turned on for all phoslock and control cores and the initial sample of the experiment was taken the po4 3 flux was calculated from the slope of corrected po4 3 concentration vs time multiplied by the volume of overlying water and divided by the surface area of the sediment in the first trial of anoxic treatments experiment 1 trial 2 or experiment 3 trial 1 po4 3 fluxes appeared to be delayed by 20 h which was likely caused by the slow transition of surface sediments from oxic to anoxic more precisely we presume this time lag was caused by the slow reduction of fe iii to fe ii given our observation of a change in color from red to gray at the sediment surface this is consistent with recent observations from lake erie where po4 3 release was not observed under hypoxic conditions but instead was observed between 12 and 24 h following the onset of anoxic conditions anderson et al 2021 due to this suppression of po4 3 fluxes at the start of the anoxic trials po4 3 fluxes were only calculated after this 20 hour time window had passed once the po4 3 concentration started increasing the nh4 flux was calculated in a similar manner however because we observed a non negligible accumulation of nh4 in the overlying water at longer incubation times which artificially depresses measured and calculated sediment water fluxes we calculated nh4 fluxes using the first 24 40 h of each trial 2 4 core sectioning and porewater chemistry sediment cores selected for immediate sectioning were processed within 1 week of retrieval from jordan lake while those used in flux experiments were sectioned 1 3 days following the termination of the flux experiment prior to core sectioning overlying water was carefully removed via syphon and cores were extruded at 1 cm intervals for the top 3 cm followed by 3 cm intervals for the remainder of the core extruded sediment was collected in clean 65 ml centrifuge tubes cooled in a refrigerator 4 c then centrifuged at 4 c to separate porewater and sediment porewater was passed through a 0 45 ¬µm syringe filter and frozen until po4 3 nh4 and no3 no2 analysis at wbas as we did not expect to find no3 no2 below 3 cm we analyzed no3 no2 for the top 3 cm only care was taken throughout the process to minimize the introduction of oxygen prior to filtering which could decrease the amount of po4 3 by forming particulate fe iii complexes samples for po4 3 were acidified prior to analysis which would free any po4 3 adsorbed on fe iii in the post filtered sample 3 results 3 1 flux experiments in experiment 1 oxia vs anoxia in untreated lake sediment we found that po4 3 did not appreciably increase with time for untreated cores under oxic conditions fig 2 a filled symbols for either trial however under anoxic conditions there was a measurable release of po4 3 from the sediment fig 2 a open symbols we observed a 20 hour delay of po4 3 release for cores 2 and 4 presumably due to the time required to reduce fe iii to fe ii on the sediment surface as the cores transitioned from oxic to anoxic conditions anderson et al 2021 we observed variable response of nh4 under oxic conditions with concentrations increasing during the first trial by large amounts for core 1 and core 2 and smaller amounts for core 3 and core 4 increases in nh4 continued for core 1 in the second trial while reductions in nh4 were observed for core 3 fig 2 b filled symbols under anoxic conditions overlying nh4 increased the most for core 2 with a moderate increase observed for core 4 fig 2 b open symbols changes in no3 no2 were not observed under anoxic conditions fig 2 c open symbols while increases were observed under oxic conditions especially in trial 2 after 48 h had passed fig 2 c filled symbols in experiment 2 phoslock treatment under oxic conditions we found that the overlying water po4 3 concentration did not appreciably change with time under oxic conditions for both phoslock treatment and the control for all three trials fig 3 a note the y axis scale for both nh4 and no3 no2 we found very strong differences between trials fig 3 b and c nh4 concentrations at the first timepoint were elevated in the phoslock treatments and remained slightly elevated relative to bottom water even after overlying water was replaced for the second trial fig 3 b red symbols and blue triangle despite the elevated initial concentration we observed nh4 uptake in each subsequent trial for both phoslock and control which we attribute to apparent nitrification fig 3 b bottom waters collected for experiment 2 were elevated in no3 no2 compared to bottom waters for experiments 1 and 3 fig 3 c blue triangles this concentration gradient fueled sediment uptake of no3 and no2 during the first half of trial 1 for both phoslock and control fig 3 c in subsequent trials overlying water no3 no2 concentrations increased with time fig 3 c most strongly for the phoslock treated core 4 in experiment 3 phoslock treatment under anoxic conditions we found that under anoxic conditions untreated sediment cores exhibited a measurable po4 3 concentration increase fig 4 a black symbols while phoslock treatment prevented such po4 3 release under otherwise identical conditions fig 4 a red symbols we again observed an increase in nh4 concentration for the first timepoint of trial 1 with phoslock treatment fig 4 b red symbols for untreated cores as well as phoslock treated cores after trial 1 nh4 concentrations increased in the overlying water with time although this trend was weaker for core 2 in trial 2 fig 4 b no3 no2 concentrations remained low for all treatments and cores consistent with the suppression of nitrification under anoxia fig 4 c note the y axis scale we are cautious about interpreting the relative impact of phoslock on the nitrogen cycle under either oxic or anoxic conditions because the potential impact of the large and sudden increase in nh4 concentration 130 240 ¬µm is enhanced by our experimental choice of a batch incubation setup however previously reported flow through incubations may have missed this nh4 release due to the exchange of water between phoslock dosing and the start of the experiment gibbs et al 2011 due to our artificially small overlaying water volume 150 ml vs 7 5 l for the average water column depth over the same area in jordan lake the concentration increases in nh4 due to phoslock treatment would be much greater in our experimental setup than it would if applied to jordan lake this in turn could have lingering impacts on nh4 and no3 no2 observations in subsequent trials either by artificially affecting nitrification and subsequent denitrification rates or by artificially increasing the porewater concentrations in the upper few centimeters of the core 3 2 core profiles and bottom water chemistry our approach to quantifying sediment water fluxes requires that porewater po4 3 and nh4 concentrations remained stable for the 0 2 weeks prior to the start of the flux experiment storage at 4 c and for the 5 15 day duration of the flux experiments room temperature in general porewater nutrient profiles for cores that were sectioned shortly after collection fig 5 all charts non flux green were similar to profiles of cores that were sectioned after the completion of the flux experiments fig 5 all charts black and red however there are some important deviations to point out for each treatment non flux post flux control and phoslock and experiment we conducted anova rstudio to compare the means while the small sample size n 2 4 is an issue for this analysis the results for the top 5 cm can be found in the supporting information supplementary figure s1 in experiment 1 core 5 non flux showed elevated po4 3 concentrations in the top three cm fig 5 a green diamond although the other three non flux cores were much more similar to the post flux cores fig 5 a and the differences were not significant p 0 1 in depths lower than the top three cm core 8 and core 6 non flux also had at least one elevated fraction fig 5 a green circle and triangle however it should be noted that the flux experiments would be most sensitive to the uppermost fraction po4 3 concentrations as these have the greatest influence on diffusive fluxes post flux cores showed a small elevation in nh4 concentration relative to non flux cores p 0 05 in the uppermost fractions and this trend was reversed at depths below 7 cm fig 5 b for no3 no2 all concentrations were low for both post flux and non flux cores fig 5 c although a slight elevation was observed at 0 5 cm for core 5 non flux fig 5 c green diamond for this experiment a trend in nh4 or no3 no2 porewater concentrations based on trial 2 oxic treatment core 1 and core 3 vs anoxic treatment core 2 and core 4 could not be established in experiment 2 porewater po4 3 concentrations were broadly similar between non flux control and phoslock cores especially through the top 5 cm fig 5 d although core 6 non flux was elevated relative to the others at depths fig 5 d green diamond all cores exhibited lower po4 3 concentrations in the upper 5 cm relative to those cores sectioned for experiment 1 fig 5 a vs d for nh4 we observed moderately higher concentrations in the top 3 cm for non flux cores p 0 05 and phoslock cores also moderately elevated over control cores fig 5 e although these trends did not continue with depths although studies with different experimental setups have associated elevated porewater nh4 concentrations with reductions in nitrification rates due to phoslock treatment lin et al 2017 song et al 2020 we are unable to say whether the elevated porewater nh4 that we observed was due to phoslock itself or due to the pulse of nh4 to the overlaying water upon phoslock dispersal the control cores had much higher no3 no2 concentrations at 0 5 cm p 0 001 than either the non flux or phoslock cores fig 5 f black which is likely related to the lower nh4 values due to increased nitrification under the oxic conditions in experiment 3 po4 3 concentrations in control and phoslock cores were elevated relative to the non flux cores in the first 0 5 cm fraction however this difference did not continue down core fig 5 g black and red vs green and it was also not significant p 0 1 however because only data from the top 5 cm were available for core 6 non flux we only have one full profile of a non flux core for this experiment nh4 profiles were broadly similar across treatments fig 5 h p 0 1 however core 5 phoslock had somewhat lower concentrations below 5 cm fig 5 h red star no3 no2 concentrations were low regardless of treatment fig 5 i for all three experiments bottom water concentrations were generally lower than the first porewater 0 5 cm fraction for all analytes with the exception of experiment 2 in which the bottom water had the same po4 3 concentration as most porewater 0 5 cm fractions fig 5 d blue triangle and no3 no2 was much higher than all porewater 0 5 cm fractions including the control cores fig 5 f blue triangle 4 discussion prior experimental determinations of the impact of phoslock on po4 3 flux used cores packed with homogenized sediment with the intention of reducing variability between cores egemose et al 2010 gibbs et al 2011 reitzel et al 2013 however homogenization also has the unintended effect of blurring the gradients near the sediment water interface and affects sediment physico chemical properties thereby artificially changing diffusive fluxes hence homogenized cores are considered less representative of the natural lake sediments than intact cores our strategy of using some cores only for sectioning allows us to use intact cores and also address the variability and the impact of the experimental design on the results we did so by conducting a two factor anova test rstudio aov condition trial type iii considering the impact of trial number and condition oxic control oxic phoslock anoxic control anoxic phoslock on sediment water fluxes which showed that mean po4 3 fluxes were not significantly different between trials p 0 05 despite significant differences based on condition p 0 05 given the visible similarity of our porewater profiles and the lack of significant relationship between po4 3 flux and trial number we can conclude that our experimental design was reasonably effective at operating under steady state conditions allowing us to consider our pseudo replicates as true replicates the primary goal of this study was to establish the relative efficacy of phoslock amendment and natural sedimentary iron under oxic and anoxic bottom water conditions in clay rich sediments we found that when the overlying water was oxygenated po4 3 flux was not statistically different p 0 05 between the control 7 0 11 4 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and phoslock treatments 4 5 4 3 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 fig 6 oxic these results are in contrast to a prior study in lake rotorua a volcanic lake with very high internal p in new zealand where it was found that phoslock amendment could increase sediment uptake of drp dissolved reactive phosphate under oxic conditions to approximately 12 mg m 2 d 1 from approximately 2 5 mg m 2 d 1 for the control gibbs et al 2011 our results are also in contrast with results from lake langes√∏ which indicated that phoslock could improve p uptake from 44 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 control to 51 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 this highlights the importance of sediment and lake type when assessing the potential efficacy of phoslock jordan lake s bottom waters often become suboxic in mid summer and under anoxic conditions we found that phoslock treatment effectively decreased sediment po4 3 fluxes 7 5 9 5 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 relative to untreated sediment 236 74 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 fig 6 anoxic this finding is similar to the results reported from lake rotorua gibbs et al 2011 where a drp flux of 8 mg m 2 d 1 was observed with phoslock treatment and 27 mg m 2 d 1 flux for the control the iron rich jordan lake sediment creates a natural barrier to po4 3 release but only under oxic conditions as po4 3 bonds nearly irreversibly with fe iii this natural barrier to po4 3 release was active during our study as seen in the statistically indistinguishable po4 3 fluxes between the phoslock and oxic control treatments fig 6 p 0 05 in other words unamended jordan lake sediments are just as effective at reducing po4 3 fluxes as sediments with phoslock treatment provided that the bottom water is oxygenated jordan lake experiences water quality issues throughout the year even when the bottom water is oxygenated during the fall through spring cain 2017 wiltsie et al 2018 our results suggest that phoslock treatment will not mitigate these water quality issues when the water column is mixed and may only be effective at reducing the intensity summer algal blooms we also observed an unexpected and large release of nh4 directly from phoslock this nh4 release was enough to increase the nh4 concentration of the 150 ml overlying water by 129 40 ¬µm above bottom water levels for the first trial fig 7 a trial 1 red this nh4 release from phoslock could be a significant input of labile n to jordan lake assuming a 4 3 m water column the average depth of jordan lake the nh4 released from phoslock amounts to an increase in lake nh4 concentration of 2 6 0 8 Œºm as the observed bottom water nh4 concentrations ranged from 1 22 to 19 4 Œºm fig 5 b e and h blue this increase represents a roughly 10 to 275 increase in whole lake water column nh4 concentrations using the nh4 benthic flux for the anoxic controls 2 0 1 0 mmol nh4 m 2 d 1 fig 7 b anoxic black we can estimate that the sediment contribution of nh4 increases water column concentrations by roughly 0 48 0 24 ¬µm d 1 in this case the anoxic control nh4 flux is used because the nh4 flux is less affected by either nitrification or the pulse of nh4 from phoslock treatment thus phoslock could contribute the equivalent of roughly 2 5 14 days median 5 5 days of sediment nh4 loading within minutes to hours of its application although this estimate is calculated using our experimental results from a temperature of 19 20 c a small increase in nh4 was also observed in the control for the first trial fig 7 a trial 1 black which was likely a result of the initial sample for this trial being collected 5 6 h after the addition of bottom water to allow for phoslock settling and could represent a 5 6 hour nh4 flux this factor was not present in subsequent trials fig 5 a trial 2 and trial 3 black which did not have such a delay which indicates that our bottom water addition process was minimally disruptive to the sediment water interface as phoslock was only added prior to the first trial and overlying waters were replaced between trials the impact of phoslock on the initial nh4 concentration was greatly reduced for trial 2 and eliminated for trial 3 fig 7 a trial 2 and trial 3 red despite the increase in initial nh4 concentrations we saw sediment uptake of nh4 under oxic conditions relative to anoxic conditions and this difference persisted across control and phoslock treatments fig 7 b suggesting rapid nitrification of nh4 fig 3 b and c while the reduction in overlying water nh4 throughout experiment 2 suggests that this input of nh4 could be rapidly cycled in an oxygenated jordan lake fig 3 b red there is reason to suspect that phoslock treatment could reduce the ability of the sediments to remove excess nh4 through nitrification denitrification processes relative to untreated lake sediment phoslock has been shown to decrease the oxygen penetration depth in sediments potentially into the phoslock layer itself for larger phoslock treatments vopel et al 2008 which could decrease nitrification rates which occur in the thin oxygenated zone of sediments extended phoslock treatment has been linked to a reduction in nitrification rates estimated either through increased porewater nh4 song et al 2020 or through reductions in abundance of archaeal ammonia oxidizers lin et al 2017 in our study phoslock treated cores also showed elevated nh4 and reduced no3 no2 porewater concentrations relative to the control cores fig 5 e and f red vs black which provides some evidence for this effect however the results of experiment 2 phoslock under oxic conditions offer mixed evidence of reduced nitrification with phoslock as phoslock treated cores 3 and 5 show reduced water column no3 no2 relative to the control cores 1 and 2 while core 4 phoslock shows elevated no3 no2 fig 3 c as the batch incubation heightened the impact of the nh4 input from phoslock and as we did not measure n2 or quantify nitrification or denitrification rates these results can only provide limited qualitative rather than quantitative support for phoslock reducing nitrification rates in lake sediments our study is not the first to identify phoslock as a potential source of nh4 for example van oosterhout et al found that phoslock released nh4 into nanopore water at a rate of 223 mg kg 1 phoslock van oosterhout and l√ºrling 2013 reitzel et al reported that 4 grams of phoslock could release 10 3 mmol nh4 m 2 when dispersed in milli q water however they did not observe a corresponding increase in nh4 when dispersed in their lake langes√∏ water during their laboratory incubations which they attributed to the lake s high alkalinity reitzel et al 2013 thus the nh4 release from phoslock may vary with lake water chemistry especially alkalinity however our study shows that substantial nh4 release is likely in jordan lake and should be considered when deciding whether phoslock application is appropriate this is especially true because as a reservoir jordan lake is connected to the cape fear river and is upstream of the cape fear estuary a potentially more n limited system burkholder et al 2006 paerl 2009 simultaneously increasing n while effectively managing summertime p could have unintended consequences for jordan lake s n filtration ecosystem service finlay et al 2013 our experiments did not fully address the reasons for nh4 release from phoslock but other studies have indicated that low alkalinity reitzel et al 2013 could contribute to the release of nh4 potentially due to an increase in the phoslock clay dispersion in soft water vs hard waters with high ca2 concentration reitzel et al 2017 if clay dispersion is the reason for this nh4 release then it is reasonable to expect that lanthanum may also be released with jordan lake water although we did not measure it lanthanum is released under variable ph conditions ross et al 2008 when humic or fulvic acid content is high dithmer et al 2016 reitzel et al 2017 reitzel et al 2013 wang et al 2016 or when alkalinity is low reitzel et al 2017 spears et al 2013 our observed large release of nh4 suggests that the phoslock matrix might not be stable in jordan lake waters and might be a source of heavy metal pollutants including lanthanum 5 conclusion this study tested the efficacy of phoslock in reducing internal phosphate nutrient loading from iron rich sediments in comparison with simple bottom water oxygenation we found that phoslock did not provide an additional benefit compared to untreated sediment under conditions of bottom water oxia in jordan lake representative of fall through spring conditions a piedmont reservoir in central north carolina however during stratified summertime periods when jordan lake bottom waters experience anoxia our results show that phoslock is more effective at lowering sediment phosphate fluxes compared with the anoxic control without phoslock this study did not test the long term effectiveness of phoslock which may decrease as sediments bury the phoslock amended layer we also found that phoslock itself can be a source of ammonium when dispersed in jordan lake water our experimental treatment of 500 mg of phoslock per core increased nh4 concentration by 129 40 ¬µm in our 150 ml overlying waters an equivalent to roughly 5 5 days of estimated sediment nh4 loadings from untreated sediment this nh4 release could exacerbate issues of n export to downstream areas
