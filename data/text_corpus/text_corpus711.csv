3555,infrastructure resilience is quite an emerging topic that has captured tremendous interest among researchers and practitioners resilience of water distribution networks wdns established itself as one of the most promising and growing hotspots in the realm of sustainable management against extreme hazards this study aims to delve into the manifestation genesis progression and gaps of the resilience research related to wdns the study comprises a meticulous quantitative and qualitative delineation of 184 articles between 2000 and 2021 utilizing a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review network analysis co word co citation co author and clustering was employed to determine and visualize the prominent topics influential publications citation patterns and productive authors and countries along with their interconnections subsequently text mining tools and critical content analysis were adopted to explore extant research characteristics and gaps three thematic clusters were identified 1 hydraulic simulation for resilience assessment 2 surrogate measures and comparative studies and 3 connectivity and topological metrics a bias in the research literature towards classical resilience assessment overlooking organizational adaptive and interdependency aspects was reported the in depth understanding provided in this study is expected to unlock new research and investment opportunities in the domain of wdns resilience keywords bibliometric analysis resilience assessment water distribution networks clustering content analysis systematic review 1 introduction owing to their significant impact on public health economic growth and social welfare the sustaining functionality of water distribution networks wdns has always attracted the interest of researchers and utility managers accordingly substantial endeavors mostly based on risk assessment and reliability theory have been postulated to counteract disruptions to these critical systems gheisi et al 2016 tsitsifli et al 2011 these efforts sought to avoid or mitigate the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of expected disruptive events through protective and preventive measures nonetheless lessons learned from previous anomalous events including convoluted prioritization of restoration measures limited capacity to address multiple widespread failures and aftershocks technical and logistic constraints proved the inadequacy of classical risk based approaches in maintaining continuous function of wdns porter 2016 consequently the attention was recently shifted towards resilience based management of wdns originated from the field of ecology and increasingly progressing in the engineering sector the concept of resilience is gaining increased momentum in water research such interest is derived by several organizations such as water environment research foundation and the international water association gay alanis 2013 for example sendai framework for disaster risk reduction is a framework adopted by the united nations to minimize disaster risk and losses due to future hazards it emphasizes resilience planning and enhancing preparedness for effective response of wdns as part of critical infrastructure systems of future cities undrr 2015 the need to incorporate resilience in planning and management of wdns is fueled by the unprecedented challenges pressing to reframe their capabilities including climate change increased urbanization and continuously deteriorating assets butler et al 2014 assad et al 2019 nonetheless there is a lack of consensus on the definition and measures of resilience furthermore various researchers proposed different assessment frameworks and in some cases computationally expensive simulations hindering their practical implementation meerow et al 2016 examples of these resilience assessment frameworks are illustrated in section 5 3 hence this paper aims to systematically review the literature of wdns resilience to determine current approaches limitations and future directions to achieve this goal a bibliometric analysis is conducted to comprehensively analyze this research domain over the past 20 years since the notion of resilience in connection to wdns was first reported in 2000 todini 2000 to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first paper that provides a holistic bibliometric analysis of the literature content focused on wdns resilience besides the qualitative insights this study presents a quantitative analysis of the field as a whole distinguishing itself from existing review papers shin et al 2018 shuang et al 2019 quitana et al 2020 the remainder of this paper is structured as follows first a brief overview of resilience is outlined followed by a description of the research method leading to the findings of the bibliometric analysis current research insights and future recommendations are subsequently provided before drawing the concluding remarks 2 resilience background the word resilience is originated from the latin root resiliere which means to bounce back the notion has captured mounting attention since the 1970 s when it was first introduced to describe ecological systems a resilient ecological system is characterized by its ability to adapt survive and grow under unfavorable changing conditions holling 1973 since then the concept of resilience has been incorporated in many fields such as social sciences economics and engineering bonanno et al 2007 dinh et al 2012 helmrich et al 2020 presented a recent biomimicry based approach to support infrastructures resilience design considering the continuous temporal change of their states helmrich et al 2020 resilience of infrastructure systems is a subdomain of engineering resilience that exploits engineering knowledge for sustainable operation and restoration of such systems the aim is to maximize the service life of these infrastructures by exploiting an optimum utilization of available resources american society of civil engineers conceptualizes resilience as the capability to mitigate significant hazards and promptly recover and restore critical services with minimum damage to the economy public health and safety asce 2018 woods 2015 asserted the significance of considering adaptability and transformation in quantifying resilience woods 2015 similarly the us department of homeland security defined the resilience of infrastructure systems as their ability to resist tolerate absorb recover from prepare for or adapt to an adverse occurrence that causes destruction or loss dhs 2017 existing literature reveals a set of diverse approaches to analyze the resilience of wdns such as surrogate measure liu et al 2017 simulation methods zhang et al 2020 complex network theory meng et al 2018 fault detections cuguer√≥ escofet et al 2016 and others multiple distinct metrics were employed within each category to quantify the resilience of wdns in light of these endeavors a holistic resilience analysis of wdns shall evaluate absorptive adaptive and restorative capacities of resilience elaboration on these capacities and relevant system properties is provided below 2 1 fundamental resilience characterization of wdns robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity are the main qualities that characterize the system s absorptive adaptive and restorative capacities bruneau et al 2003 yodo and wang 2016 in the context of resilience absorptive capacity measures the system s capability to alleviate damage propagation under disruptive events jung et al 2014 adaptive capacity is the degree to which a disrupted system can rearrange itself to cope with an ongoing perturbation and continue to provide services decision makers and governing agencies exploit both technology development and innovative logistic solutions to enhance the adaptive capacity and secure stable performance of wdns bi et al 2016 finally restorative capacity is a unique attribute that distinguishes resilience from other concepts such as risk and vulnerability restorative capacity features the system s ability to be restored easily restoration rapidity and degree are highly influenced by emergency protocols and available resources allocated to identify failed components isolate them and dispatch repair crews shuang et al 2019 in addition the resilience of wdns shall be defined within a multi attribute context that extends the technical analysis to account for social economic and organizational aspects markolf et al 2018 due to limited resources and scarce budgets socioeconomic factors may play a dominant role in prioritizing enhancement and restorative decisions such prioritization can be elicited based on a set of pre determined criteria such as population size expected costs tax base and others what is considered resilient in a specific zone may not be deemed so in other locations weichselgartner and kelman 2015 as such socioeconomic factors can be exploited to set performance targets for different zones across the network in addition the organizational structure and decision making protocols within water agencies are vital cornerstones in determining their capacity to strategically manage wdns and promptly take disaster related responses bruneau et al 2003 hence this study illustrates bibliometric analysis and systematic review to assess the completeness of research endeavors related to the resilience of wdns 3 methods 3 1 research questions this section illustrates the methodology utilized to review resilience related literature of wdns fig 1 depicts the framework of this methodology which comprises three main stages 1 problem definition 2 data acquisition and 3 review analysis this review seeks to explore the trends of around 20 years of research outputs related to the resilience of wdns the research questions addressed herein are defined as follows 1 what is the intellectual structure of this research domain how did it evolve over the years 2 which authors and publications are most influential what is the extent of collaborative patterns 3 what are the methods and metrics adopted to quantify the resilience of wdns are they focused on natural hazards or anthropic events can they be used to evaluate resilience against all extreme events or are they specific only to certain types of hazards 4 what are the current gaps and future challenges directing the resilience of wdns research 3 2 data acquisition publications related to the resilience of wdns were retrieved from scopus database the most comprehensive multidisciplinary extended abstract and citation database scopus was chosen because of its superiority in terms of journal coverages compared to other databases such as web of science and pubmed mongeon and paul hus 2016 to capture the maximum possible number of relevant publications the search protocol was set using two strings the first reflects data regarding wdns using the terms water distribution or water supply or water pipes or water main the second string contains resilience related terms to such as resilien the asterisk wildcard character was used to cover studies containing variations of the same keyword for example the term resilien was used to retrieve publications with either resilience resilient or resiliency in their contents the search method was set to title abstract keywords to cover all the publications containing the selected keywords in any of these fields the subject area was limited to engineering and environmental science using these settings the search resulted in 306 items limiting the document types to peer reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings brought this number to 230 documents a manual review of both titles and abstracts was then adopted as inclusion and exclusion criteria for the final consideration of relevant articles studies related to optimal design segmentation or pump scheduling of wdns without considering resilience context were excluded similarly studies assessing resilience of systems other than wdns such as microbial communities within these networks were also excluded in contrast studies related to wdns resilience assessment quantification enhancement and restoration were included consequently 184 papers out of 230 were shortlisted for further analyses the list of the retrieved publications is provided in the supplementary materials data cleansing was the last step conducted in the data acquisition phase to ensure the quality of the obtained results examples of such cleansing include correcting the names of authors and institutions and standardizing referencing styles 3 3 analysis a two tier analysis was adopted in this study to systemically review the retrieved literature bibliometric analysis was firstly conducted followed by critical content analysis bibliometric analysis was defined for the first time by pritchard 1969 as the application of mathematical and statistical methods to books and other media of communication since then it has gained growing popularity in exploring the knowledge anatomy and evolvement of many domains donthu et al 2021 unlike classical literature reviews bibliometric analysis exploits quantitative and statistical methods to explore the knowledge body hence obtained results are less prone to bias and subjectivity xu et al 2018 network analysis which is a common technique in bibliometric studies employs the author s details keywords and abstract terms as informative units to elicit the underlying prolificacy of authors publications and prominent clusters of the investigated field al et al 2012 subsequently content analysis is conducted in this study considering each cluster to thoroughly grasp the research themes and respective challenges the current study exploited multiple software packages such as bibexcel persson et al 2009 vosviewer van eck and waltman 2013 and gephi bastian et al 2009 bibexcel was used for data acquisition initial processing statistical analysis bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric tasks bibexcel was chosen because of its ability to retrieve documents of various referencing formats in addition the output files generated from bibexcel are fully compatible with various network analysis and visualization tools persson et al 2009 gephi and vosviewer were utilized for network graphical analysis because of their ability to handle various data formats advanced filtering options versatile analysis techniques and augmented clustering capabilities bastian et al 2009 van eck and waltman 2013 gephi was specifically employed for clustering and page rank analysis vosviewer was adopted for citation analysis co authorship analysis co word analysis and term map generation further elaboration on these techniques along with the obtained results are presented in the subsequent sections 4 bibliometric analysis 4 1 trend of documents outputs fig 2 illustrates the progression of publication and citation numbers in the retrieved database despite a general increasing trend in the number of annual publications from 2000 to 2021 three different stages can be observed first there were very low publication numbers between 2000 and 2010 with a maximum annual publication of six in 2009 secondly the publication number started to increase between 2011 and 2014 with an average of 7 75 publications per year the last period between 2015 and 2021 june witnessed the fastest growth with an annual mean of 19 publications specifically a minimum of 20 publications was recorded each year from 2018 to 2020 the first publication presented by todini 2000 is the only recorded publication before 2004 while the publication member reached a peak of 29 in 2020 a declining trend is remarked in 2021 due to incomplete data finally a surge in citation numbers is observed between 2011 and 2018 reflecting an increasingly recent interest with a maximum citation number of 536 in 2016 4 2 citation analysis 4 2 1 document analysis citation analysis portrays the popularity of publications in any research field ding and cronin 2011 fig 3 depicts a map of the retrieved publications with a minimum of 20 citations each publication is signified by a node whose size is determined by the respective number of citations twenty citations limit was chosen after several trials to obtain a readable clear and representative citation network of the studied field a higher citation limit would result in missing some publications while a lower one would result in a network that cannot be read a list of the most cited studies in this research domain is illustrated in table 1 todini 2000 ranks the first with 496 citations followed by prasad and park 2004 and farmani et al 2005 with 415 and 222 citations respectively 4 2 2 page rank analysis initially proposed by brin and page 1998 to prioritize web search results page rank analysis represents a complementary method to citation analysis that extends the evaluation beyond mere citations number a citation by highly prestigious articles implies higher importance page rank analysis measures the publications eminence by assigning more values to those cited by highly prestigious articles ding and cronin 2011 page rank score is a non negative real value with the scores of all the publications in a citation network summing up to an exact unity table 2 depicts the top ten publications based on page rank score some discrepancies can be observed between the most influential publications based on citation number and page rank score the articles introduced by yazdani et al 2011 diao et al 2016 and herrera et al 2016 are the only common publications among the two ranking approaches the top eminent publications shown in table 2 presented integrative and comparative studies between different resilience assessment approaches of wdns 4 3 co authorship analysis and research collaboration 4 3 1 co author analysis the retrieved collection comprises 357 authors from 37 countries table 3 lists the most influential authors based on the number of citations ezio todini ranks first with 572 citations followed by raziyeh farmani and marco franchini with 483 and 264 citations respectively in addition raziyeh farmani published the highest number of publications 13 followed by david butler and enrico creaco with 11 publications for each as such these authors may be considered experts in the domain of wdns resilience the fact that most of the influential authors are from italy and the uk can be attributed to several factors italy has one of the most deteriorating wdns because of the highly fragmented sector inefficient planning and insufficient investment baldino and sauri 2018 the average water loss due to leakage from deteriorated pipelines is around 40 of the produced water the largest in the european union national institute of statistics istat 2017 in fact highly deteriorated networks are more vulnerable and susceptible to widespread failure due to even low level disruptions as such many researchers devoted their efforts to enhancing the resilience of wdns by combating these challenges in the uk the governmental office of water services regulates the privatized water sector ofwat imposes a firm policy regarding level of service leakage targets water quality and serviceability standards engelhardt et al 2000 consequently a strong partnership was developed between private companies and the research community such as the center of water systems at exeter university to secure necessary know how and technology recently the water companies reported significant success bringing down the leakage levels to the lowest since records began in the 1990 s ofwat 2020 to better grasp the microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of research collaboration in the field of wdns resilience vosviewer visualization tool was used to generate co authorship and country relationships networks only 49 authors of the 357 met the criterion of producing a minimum of three publications this number of publications was chosen after several trials to obtain a readable clear and representative co author network of the studied field to help identify the most influential authors a higher publications limit would result in missing some authors while a lower one would result in a network that cannot be read fig 4 shows 27 of these authors organized in six clusters other authors were excluded as they had no links to other authors for example the green cluster presents a robust collaborative relationship between raziyeh farmani david butler guangtao fu chris sweetapple and fanlin meng david butler is the central author of this research community featured by more collaborative activities than other members the sparse topology of the co authorship network emphasizes the need for more collaborative activities especially between different research communities to advance the resilience research related to wdns 4 3 2 countries network map similarly a network of countries was generated to explore the worldwide distribution of publications in this domain fig 5 shows 18 countries represented as nodes arranged in four clusters the uk contributed the most to this field with 58 publications followed by the usa italy china and canada with 39 36 21 and 13 publications respectively these countries are leading in applying resilience enhancement strategies derived by several governmental regulations such as the presidential policy directive launched in 2013 to protect critical infrastructure systems in the united states ayyub 2014 generally speaking this map is less scarce than the co author network demonstrating a better collaboration between authors across various countries the uk collaborated the most with other countries with a total link strength of 44 followed by china and netherland with total link strengths of 30 and 24 respectively in particular researchers from the uk collaborated the most with their counterparts from china as evidenced by the greatest link strength of 9 on the other hand a minimum collaboration exists between the us and colombia with a link strength of only one although co author relationships are mainly be influenced by individual researchers collaboration preferences national initiatives can significantly boost these relationships the uk china partnership for water research is an example of such initiatives that promote joint research projects between authors from both countries uk center for ecology and hydrology 2010 4 3 3 co word analysis and research evolution authors keywords present an abstract depiction of the publication s content keyword co occurrence is employed to explore the intellectual structure and prominent topics of this research domain donthu et al 2021 among the 416 keywords vosviewer identified 44 keywords that were reported more than three times table 4 besides water distribution networks and resilience the most commonly utilized keywords are optimization graph theory and reliability with 31 61 and 11 occurrences respectively it is worth mentioning that variations of the same keywords were counted only once for example the water distribution networks can be found as either water networks water distribution systems water infrastructure or others therefore the occurrences of all these words were summated and assigned to the term water distribution networks complementing the keyword analysis with the time factor helps understand the development of the research field and trends change over time fig 6 shows the progression of resilience based keywords between 2000 and 2021 the term water distribution network was omitted since it does not reflect the current research trend before 2014 the resilience of wdns was indirectly assessed as evidenced by the terms reliability design and rehabilitation reliable design and optimal rehabilitation contribute to enhancing the resilience absorptive capacity of wdns by increasing their robustness the word resilience took the lead towards 2016 marking a new era of explicit resilience assessment this aligns with the research shift from classical risk based protections to resilience based ones supported by the increased frequency and destructive consequences of hazardous events shin et al 2018 unsurprisingly more innovative techniques to assess and enhance resilience started to emerge over the past recent years indicated by the keywords topology simulation and sustainability this progression coincides with the reported successful achievements of incorporating graph theory and sustainability objectives in developing integrated resilience based management of wdns ahmed et al 2021 it shall be noted that the retrieved documents circumscribe all co authorship analyses only journal articles and conference proceedings published in english were extracted from the results of the search protocol detailed in section 3 2 although there is a bias in the results because of the language used this bias is not expected to affect the general trends of the results since the vast majority of publications in science and engineering are in english in fact 98 of publications in science are written in english according to some recent statistics ram√≠rez casta√±eda and manalo 2020 5 clustering and content analysis 5 1 thematic clustering the knowledge base of any publication can be realized by analyzing its cited references xu et al 2018 bibliographic coupling is a semantic technique used to determine underlying connections between publications and objectively explore the structure of any research domain donthu et al 2021 in this study bibliographic coupling was utilized for thematic clustering because of its ability to visualize even recent publications that would have been cited less often donthu et al 2021 a bibliographic coupling link is generated between two publications that both cite the same reference publications sharing a common theme that differs from other publications are designated by the same cluster in this sense edge densities of links connecting nodes publications of the same cluster are higher than those of links commencing nodes of different clusters xu et al 2018 bibexcel was used to prepare the bibliographic coupling network file which was exported to gephi software for graphical visualization the network consists of 177 nodes and 9 152 bibliographic coupling links this network was subsequently partitioned into clusters based on the relative degree of correlation between publications louvain algorithm was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters by maximizing the modularity index a clustering quality indicator blondel et al 2008 the process starts by assigning a distinct cluster for each node these nodes are then iteratively rearranged until realizing the maximum modularity index blondel et al 2008 fig 7 shows three clusters depicting the results of applying this algorithm to the collected database cluster 1 comprises 53 publications whereas clusters 2 and 3 contain 61 and 63 publications respectively cluster 1 comprises the early applications of resilience assessment through hydraulic simulations while cluster 2 includes comparative analyses between various surrogate measures for resilience assessment the evolvement and capabilities of topological metrics in resilience assessment are investigated in cluster 3 the evolution of each cluster from 2000 to 2021 is illustrated in fig 8 cluster 1 emerged in 2004 with only one publication it persisted at a low pace until 2014 where five publications were recorded a steady development is then observed between 2014 and 2021 with an annual average of four publications although cluster 2 emerged at the earliest stage since 2000 this cluster did not gain any momentum during the subsequent years except for the years 2004 2007 2008 with only one publication reported in each the cluster has shown consistent growth until reaching an all time maximum number of publications nine in 2020 research related to cluster 3 started the latest with two publications in 2011 and 2012 an interruption was reported in 2013 with no publication followed by an accelerated progression that peaked at 15 publications in 2018 and 2020 recently publications related to clusters 2 and 3 continue to grow at a higher rate than cluster 1 indicating the hotspot themes in the resilience of wdns research 5 2 content analysis in this subsection the most frequent terms in each cluster were leveraged to identify the cluster s generic theme exploiting the text mining and visualization functionalities of vosviewer a term map was then generated for each cluster van eck and waltman 2011 fig 9 depicts these maps with the term size indicating its prominence subsequently the content of the top 15 publications was reviewed to explore the main research trends in each cluster 5 2 1 cluster 1 hydraulic simulation and evolution of surrogate measures for resilience assessment of wdns this cluster has emerged since 2004 and encompasses 53 publications that mainly employ hydraulic simulation and associated metrics for resilience assessment of wdns owing to its capability to thoroughly analyze the performance of wdns during various operating conditions hydraulic simulation is the most commonly utilized approach in resilience assessment studies among the most influential publications eight studies presented hydraulic based resilience applications of wdns reca et al 2008 jung et al 2014 in all of these applications resilience was quantified via a diverse set of indicators that were derived based on simulation results diao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 various properties were also analyzed utilizing this approach including robustness jung et al 2014 vulnerability laucelli and giustolisi 2015 and dependency guidotti et al 2016 the remaining publications introduced a new class of flow based metrics surrogate measures that are also based on hydraulic simulations resilience index network resilience index and modified resilience index are examples of the main surrogate measures extensively utilized in resilience studies these measures were employed as resilience objectives to determine the optimal design and rehabilitation actions farmani et al 2005 jayaram and srinivasan 2008 for example reca et al 2008 developed a multi objective optimization framework to determine the best design of looped wdns based on resilience index and cost the authors utilized simulated annealing and tabu search optimization algorithms to find the optimal design reca et al 2008 as evidenced in fig 9a terms such as hydraulic simulation and optimization represent the most frequently investigated concepts in this cluster 5 2 2 cluster 2 comparison among surrogate measures for resilience assessment of wdns cluster 2 contains 61 publications with the first publication dated back to 2000 the main focus of this cluster is to present a retrospective comparison among various resilience surrogate measures as presented in nine of the top 15 studies analyzed for example banos et al 2011 compared the respective performance of resilience index network resilience index and modified resilience index in achieving the optimum design of wdns under demand uncertainty similarly tanyimboh et al 2016 and sirsant and reddy 2020 evaluated the performance of resilience index network resilience index and flow entropy in assessing the resilience of wdns against pipe failures and demand variations results of such comparative studies were not always consistent for example tanyimboh et al 2016 reported superiority of flow entropy index regarding accuracy and computational efforts whereas sirsant and reddy 2020 postulated a combination of entropy and resilience index as a viable indicator of resilience level the extent of these comparisons studies among various surrogate measures is depicted in fig 9b the other six studies presented a comparison between various optimization algorithms and hydraulic simulation approaches to maximize the resilience of wdns bi et al 2016 creaco et al 2016 for instance zheng et al 2016 developed a framework for exploring the search navigation efficiency of various optimization algorithms instead of solely focusing on the final solution quality the authors compared between nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii self adaptive differential evolution and borg evolution algorithms in identifying the optimal trade off between cost and resilience objectives zheng et al 2016 5 2 3 cluster 3 topological metrics for resilience assessment of wdns representing the largest cluster with 63 publications this cluster has emerged since 2011 in this cluster research efforts were devoted towards utilizing graph theory and complex network indicators in assessing the resilience of wdns fig 9c among the top publications in this cluster six studies employed topological based metrics to investigate resilience assessment enhancement and restoration for example yazdani et al 2011 studied the relationship between topological features and the performance of wdns by quantifying robustness and redundancy subsequently the authors evaluated various expansion and enhancement strategies to meet a continuously increased demand yazdani et al 2011 among other metrics agathokleous et al 2017 exploited betweenness centrality index bci to assess the time dependent impact of the network s topology on resilience in addition three other studies coupled the network s failure history and component s characteristics with topological metrics in resilience assessment of wdns for instance farahmandfar et al 2017 employed pipes failure history in developing a new metric for assessing and enhancing the resilience of actual wdns in an earthquake prone region the remaining studies provided a comparative analysis between various types of resilience assessment metrics farahmandfar and piratla 2018 di nardo et al 2014 for example meng et al 2018 conducted a comparison between hydraulic system performance and various topological metrics in resilience enhancement and restoration spread and duration of failure exhibited strong correlations with some topological metrics such as connectivity modularity and centrality on the other hand spectral coefficient showed a weak correlation with the resilience performance of wdns due to their grid like structure meng et al 2018 5 3 current research tables 5 7 depict a brief content analysis of the top influential publications due to the space limitation only the top ten articles in each cluster are presented this section presents first a brief description of resilience properties and assessment methods next a critical analysis of the current research directions based on various resilience approaches is provided 5 3 1 objectives capacities and properties research efforts addressing resilience generally aim to assess enhance and or restore the resilience of wdns resilience assessment applications usually evaluate the current resilience level against single or multiple hazards resilience assessment is the most common type of resilience studies as it represents the core upon which other applications are based a novel framework for assessing the resilience of wdns is proposed by diao et al 2016 besides resilience evaluation resilience enhancement studies complement the resilience analysis by proposing some improving benchmarking interventions these models may investigate potential expansions and new network designs yazdani et al 2011 or resilience enhancement of existing networks farahmandfar et al 2017 finally restoration studies investigate the recovery stage following disruptive events the total number of these studies is less than resilience assessment and enhancement applications zhang et al 2020 as previously mentioned robustness redundancy rapidity and resourcefulness are the main four properties to describe any system s resilience bruneau et al 2003 in wdns robustness is the strength to withstand stressing conditions whether gradual or abrupt without significant degradation in fulfilling operational requirements bruneau et al 2003 it represents the main criterion that defines the system s absorptive capacity redundancy is the ability to minimize the likelihood and impact of disruptions to satisfy functional requirements while redundancy enhances the absorptive capacity it can be exploited to improve the system s adaptive capacity rapidity and resourcefulness are two properties that distinguish resilience restorative capacity rapidity is the pace at which a system can be restored to an acceptable level after hazard occurrence whereas resourcefulness is the efficient utilization of available resources both physical and institutional to achieve rapid recovery bruneau et al 2003 5 3 2 analysis methods and classifications resilience models can be categorized as either deterministic or stochastic unlike deterministic analysis stochastic models account for the random nature of failures and inherited uncertainties in the restoration process sirsant and reddy 2020 due to the complexity of their analysis and their higher computational requirements stochastic models are less common in the literature despite superior practical value each resilience category can be further classified as static or dynamic depending on whether the time factor is considered when assessing the system s performance static models tackle resilience as a snapshot in time while dynamic models consider the extended deterioration over a long time period in resilience planning accounting for the continuous deterioration prior to hazard occurrence yields more realistic results compared to the subjective assumption of an arbitrary performance level before disruptions optimal decisions regarding enhancement interventions can only be determined when pondering the deterioration of various components assad et al 2021 resilience models can also be classified against the considered hazard context in a single hazard analysis hazard intensity and duration are exploited to simulate the system s response most of the current studies assessed the resilience of wdns against single hazards such as seismic hazards guidotti et al 2016 floods tarani et al 2019 intentional attacks shin et al 2020 or others in multi hazard analysis the focus is shifted from investigating single incidents towards addressing the impact of various hazards on wdns these impacts include structural failures hydraulic failures or quality related failures the advantage of this approach is the ability to address multiple threats that inflict the same impacts in one single analysis diao et al 2016 pagani et al 2020 in both cases assessment and restoration decisions shall account for the social economic and organizational aspects to provide a comprehensive resilience planning framework 5 3 3 flow based metrics resilience assessment of wdns can be formulated based on flow based or topological based metrics in the earlier hydraulic simulation is conducted to analyze the network s performance against one or more hazards in the latter graph theory and other structural attributes are employed to evaluate performance and restoration behaviors todini 2000 presented a static deterministic model for assessing and enhancing resilience absorptive capacity of newly constructed wdns the model considered both technical and economic aspects of resilience by accounting for the hydraulic reliability and enhancement actions this model is the earliest work related to the resilience of wdns that was utilized and modified in numerous subsequent research endeavors for example prasad and park 2004 extended todini s index to account for the network s redundancy jayaram and srinivasan 2008 formulated another dynamic resilience based design and rehabilitation framework that alleviates the shortcomings of todini s index the authors introduced a new metric that accounts for multiple sources to assess the resilience of wdns against both excess demand and pipe failures dynamic deterioration was modeled through leaks and roughness growth recently hydraulic simulation has been employed in stochastic resilience applications of wdns shin et al 2020 evaluated the resilience of wdns against intentional physical and cyber attacks the authors introduced an integrated resilience metric to simulate 15 failure scenarios and investigate various recovery behaviors similarly zhang et al 2020 stochastically assessed the resilience of wdns against seismic hazards the authors developed a multi objective restoration model to improve the restorative capacity of an actual wdn with more than 6 000 pipes several comparative studies mainly in research cluster 2 have emerged to evaluate the performance of flow based metrics cimorelli et al 2018 zhan et al 2020 cimorelli et al 2018 assessed the effectiveness of creaco s resilience index and the entropy index in enhancement applications creaco et al 2016 a posteriori reliability analysis was adopted to estimate the solution quality of each index considering various pipe replacement options subject to budgetary constraints because of explicitly satisfying minimum nodal pressure requirements creaco s index outperformed the entropy index in terms of optimal rehabilitation planning 5 3 4 topological based metrics in topological models wdns are featured as configurations of spatially interconnected components metrics of graph models and complex networks can be utilized for systematic quantification and classification of various network characteristics yazdani et al 2011 introduced the most representative resilience enhancement model based on network theory through exploiting a wide range of statistical and spectral metrics the authors investigated the underlying relationships between structural features and the performance of wdns to optimize expansion decisions similarly herrera et al 2016 employed weighted shortest paths from consumption nodes to water sources to quantify resilience coupled with a multiscale decomposition method the authors assessed the resilience of a large scale network made of more than 100 000 nodes and pipes topological models emerged as viable alternatives to alleviate the extensive computations required to hydraulically simulate large and complex wdns however these models alone can not fully characterize the actual performance of wdns meng et al 2018 therefore several researchers attempted to complement topological metrics with other structural or hydraulic attributes for instance assad et al 2020 integrated reliability criticality and redundancy in formulating a multi attribute resilience metric that accounts for the dynamic deterioration of pipelines due to aging a stochastic multi objective framework was developed to optimize the restoration of an actual wdn subjected to multiple pipe breaks and leaks the output was an optimal plan comprising the sequence and type of recovery actions in a different approach he and yuan 2019 assessed the restoration priority of damaged wdns based on an integrated hydraulic simulation and mechanical repairs optimization model a stochastic scoring methodology was proposed to determine the restoration priority of damaged segments a high correlation was found between the proposed methodology and some graph theoretic metrics such as the betweenness metric the authors however asserted the need for a more detailed exploration of this correlation before adopting the betweenness metric as a reliable indicator in restoration applications of wdns he and yuan 2019 from the previous review one can conclude that resilience assessment of wdns was initially based on hydraulic simulation this has always been the most precise mean to capture the performance of wdns under various operating conditions nonetheless the tedious calibration process of numerous parameters and the extended computational time needed as the size and complexity of wdns increase necessitate the need for assessing the suitability of other metrics as such the topological metrics emerged as an alternative for classical hydraulic based approaches however it was shortly recognized that such metrics are not adequate alone to measure resilience of wdns therefore current research endeavors advance hybrid frameworks that integrate both hydraulic and topological metrics 6 discussion 6 1 overview driven by the growing interest in resilience planning this study applied bibliometric analysis techniques to explore the resilience research of wdns presenting the first bibliometric analysis of this specific field this paper complements existing reviews with essential quantitative insights utilizing science mapping techniques a trend graph of the retrieved publications shows that the first study that explicitly assessed the resilience of wdns was published in 2000 however it was only during the past five years that the highest publication numbers were observed indeed resilience studies continued to rise reaching a maximum of 29 publications in 2020 while initial resilience studies focused on resilience assessment and enhancement restoration studies emerged more recently this trend is mainly stimulated by the recently increased disasters and related governmental regulations bibexcel coupled with vosviewer and gephi visualization tools were then employed to perform various bibliometric analyses first citation analysis and page rank analysis were conducted to identify the most cited and most prominent publications in this research field respectively a disparity was observed between the top ten publications since the page rank algorithm asserts more wrights to citations in prestigious journals this disparity is significant to determine the most influential studies and stat of the art endeavors in the field of wdns resilience research contributions cited and published in highly cited journals are the most significant efforts that advance research progress in any field next co author and countries network maps were analyzed to determine the most contributing authors and to portray the global collaboration among researchers in this field a scarce structure of small communities was observed in the co authorship network map exhibiting the need for more collaboration across various communities to unlock new opportunities for advancing resilience research nonetheless these small communities of authors produced some of the most influential publications asserting the value of research collaboration in this field authors keywords were also analyzed to determine the emerging research themes coupled with timespan analysis the chronological progress of wdns resilience research was explored while the resilience of wdns was initially focused on investigating various hydraulic indicators for reliable design of wdns before 2014 a shift towards utilizing other techniques such as complex network analysis is recently observed in fact complementing resilience assessment with sustainability objectives and topological metrics represents the cutting edge research in this domain the term optimization maintained its existence over the years derived from the need to meet various operational objectives related to wdns resilience this aligns with the results in table 4 where the term optimization was the most frequent keyword after wdns and resilience multiple algorithms varying from deterministic single objective optimization to stochastic multi objective optimization were employed as illustrated in section 5 optimizing resilience of wdns is a continuous process to combat increasingly uncertain disruptions and minimize costs and emissions associated with enhancement actions utilizing physical and institutional resources finally bibliographic coupling and clustering were performed to classify the retrieved publications three clusters were identified to serve as the basis for subsequent content analysis research evolution and term maps were generated for each cluster to uncover their latent themes while clusters 1 and 2 emerged before cluster 3 the latter advanced with the highest momentum championed by the maximum number of publications among the three clusters this momentum suggests once again that integrating topological attributes in resilience assessment is a current hotspot topic research outcomes and resilience assessment methodologies were then critically reviewed to pave the way for postulating future research recommendations 6 2 future trends this study unfolded the genesis and progression of the literature related to the resilience of wdns thematic trends were quantitatively explored and latent topics were carefully analyzed some research gaps that can help elicit future research agenda in this domain were identified this section is dedicated to present these gaps classified into three main categories theory context and methods 6 2 1 theory towards resilience based management of wdns as previously illustrated several studies have assessed the resilience of wdns against specific hazards bi et al 2016 tarani et al 2019 yet far less attention has been directed towards resilience assessment in a multi hazard context there is a need for more comprehensive frameworks that study different hazards impacts on wdns deliberate attacks whether physical cyber or biochemical were also rarely assessed qiao et al 2007 shin et al 2020 detailed analysis of possible intentional attacks can help strengthen the most vulnerable and critical assets thus improving resilience and averting widespread cascading consequences in addition most of the existing models focused solely on either resilience enhancement or restoration nonetheless rehabilitation and restoration measures are interrelated and contribute to reinforcing one another as such holistic models that combine pre hazards and post hazards system responses to sudden disruptions and gradual deterioration are needed furthermore the lack of common standards and easy to use resilience metrics that practitioners can exploit hinders the wide incorporation of resilience within asset management plans future efforts should be devoted to developing new practical metrics and guidelines that facilitate implementation benchmarking and comparison purposes 6 2 2 context towards a meticulous assessment of wdns resilience meticulous resilience assessment entails systematic consideration of all resilience capacities while absorptive and restorative capacities were exhaustively analyzed studies investigating adaptive capacity are rather rare among the top 45 publications only three studies assessed resilience adaptive capacity mugume et al 2015 bi et al 2016 shin et al 2020 future efforts should be directed to investigate various adaptive measures such as demand redistribution performance rationing flexibility agility and others in addition resilience assessment should integrate social economic and organizational aspects besides the technical one both economic and social though less often aspects were also analyzed in the retrieved literature on the contrary very few studies explicitly assessed organizational aspects of wdns resilience indirect measures mainly operational were integrated in some applications such as the maximum number of failures before pipe abandonment and the number of allowed interventions per pipe per period assad et al 2021 more studies are required to assess the impact of decision making protocols organizational structures emergency policies repositioning regulations and other organizational factors on the resilience of wdns wdns exhibit assorted types of interdependencies with other infrastructures whether geographical with road networks functional with power plants or both with sewer systems rinaldi et al 2001 for example energy generated by power plants is essential for the sustainable operation of pumping units across wdns water is also crucial to the cooling process at power plants extending current resilience analysis to model various interdependencies is vital to minimize the cascading damages from to wdns this is especially important to alleviate the propagated socioeconomic consequences of critical components failures such as those that supply water to power plants and health care facilities 6 2 3 methods towards a smart assessment of wdns resilience in the era of digitalization the success of any planning process is highly contingent on the sufficient availability of reliable relevant data data acquisition regarding a system s performance condition assessment and fault detection are essential for resilience planning smart models that estimate a system s response to various loading intensities and enhancement actions should be devised based on both experimental and historical records new wireless sensors and remote detection mechanisms can be leveraged for coherent condition assessment and automated fault detection complementing these datasets with real time information shared on social media during failure events can be considerably significant in case of sensors damage and cyberattacks researchers in the near future should advance a new version of resilience frameworks that automatically pair fault detection with response decisions cloud computing and big data analytics can immensely contribute to advancing these frameworks however security privacy and cost of data acquired are associated concerns that need to be addressed in addition investigating temporal and spatial resilience variations before and after hazards necessitates using hydraulic simulation engines stochastic analysis platforms and geographical mapping tools technology integration and computational challenges should be tackled to ensure the efficacy of the proposed methodologies in addition future efforts should also explore possible solutions to handle problems arising from the accretion of new technologies over aging existing wdns 7 conclusion the resilience of wdns has gained momentous attention to combat the ever increasing detrimental threats that jeopardize their sustainable function the present review builds upon previous work but distances itself from others by presenting the first bibliometric study of the entire field as a whole since the emergence of resilience in the context of wdns key authors topics publications and countries were identified along with their underlying interrelationships utilizing science mapping approach main insights drawn from the systemic bibliometric and content analyses are summarized below 1 research in this field emerged since 2000 and continued to grow remarkably during the past five years 2 the article published by tondini et al 2000 is the most cited article with 496 citations and the paper presented by yazdani et al 2011 achieved the highest page rank score these two articles presented the first formulations of flow based and topological based metrics for assessing resilience of wdns respectively various subsequent efforts either utilized them directly or proposed some enhancement and modification to their metrics 3 six scholars were recognized as experts in the field of wdns resilience the contributions advanced by raziyeh farmani are specifically impactful in this field the uk is the most contributing country with a total of 58 publications 4 bibliographic coupling identified three main clusters in this research domain cluster 1 investigates the utilization of hydraulic simulation in resilience assessment of wdns whereas cluster 2 comprises several comparative studies between various surrogate measures and simulation methodologies finally cluster 3 encompasses the implementation of topological indicators to integrate network connectivity in resilience applications 5 the authors keywords analysis demonstrated the progression of research themes and revealed that integrated resilience assessment is the current hotspot the knowledge derived from this study can be exploited by several stakeholders including 1 journal editors and conference organizers to define the scope of upcoming editions 2 researchers to address current gaps and advance new contributions and 3 utility managers and regulators to improve current resilience planning and prioritize strategic investments however these findings need to be considered in light of certain limitations depending on scopus database as a sole source for publications retrieval may render some relevant publications unconsidered including other bibliographic databases would minimize this possibility additionally the collected literature is circumscribed by the selected search keywords one might need to examine other keywords across future junctures to cope with the evolving nature of this research domain in addition exploiting features of other bibliometric tools could provide further informative insights credit authorship contribution statement ahmed assad conceptualization methodology data curation writing

3555,infrastructure resilience is quite an emerging topic that has captured tremendous interest among researchers and practitioners resilience of water distribution networks wdns established itself as one of the most promising and growing hotspots in the realm of sustainable management against extreme hazards this study aims to delve into the manifestation genesis progression and gaps of the resilience research related to wdns the study comprises a meticulous quantitative and qualitative delineation of 184 articles between 2000 and 2021 utilizing a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review network analysis co word co citation co author and clustering was employed to determine and visualize the prominent topics influential publications citation patterns and productive authors and countries along with their interconnections subsequently text mining tools and critical content analysis were adopted to explore extant research characteristics and gaps three thematic clusters were identified 1 hydraulic simulation for resilience assessment 2 surrogate measures and comparative studies and 3 connectivity and topological metrics a bias in the research literature towards classical resilience assessment overlooking organizational adaptive and interdependency aspects was reported the in depth understanding provided in this study is expected to unlock new research and investment opportunities in the domain of wdns resilience keywords bibliometric analysis resilience assessment water distribution networks clustering content analysis systematic review 1 introduction owing to their significant impact on public health economic growth and social welfare the sustaining functionality of water distribution networks wdns has always attracted the interest of researchers and utility managers accordingly substantial endeavors mostly based on risk assessment and reliability theory have been postulated to counteract disruptions to these critical systems gheisi et al 2016 tsitsifli et al 2011 these efforts sought to avoid or mitigate the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of expected disruptive events through protective and preventive measures nonetheless lessons learned from previous anomalous events including convoluted prioritization of restoration measures limited capacity to address multiple widespread failures and aftershocks technical and logistic constraints proved the inadequacy of classical risk based approaches in maintaining continuous function of wdns porter 2016 consequently the attention was recently shifted towards resilience based management of wdns originated from the field of ecology and increasingly progressing in the engineering sector the concept of resilience is gaining increased momentum in water research such interest is derived by several organizations such as water environment research foundation and the international water association gay alanis 2013 for example sendai framework for disaster risk reduction is a framework adopted by the united nations to minimize disaster risk and losses due to future hazards it emphasizes resilience planning and enhancing preparedness for effective response of wdns as part of critical infrastructure systems of future cities undrr 2015 the need to incorporate resilience in planning and management of wdns is fueled by the unprecedented challenges pressing to reframe their capabilities including climate change increased urbanization and continuously deteriorating assets butler et al 2014 assad et al 2019 nonetheless there is a lack of consensus on the definition and measures of resilience furthermore various researchers proposed different assessment frameworks and in some cases computationally expensive simulations hindering their practical implementation meerow et al 2016 examples of these resilience assessment frameworks are illustrated in section 5 3 hence this paper aims to systematically review the literature of wdns resilience to determine current approaches limitations and future directions to achieve this goal a bibliometric analysis is conducted to comprehensively analyze this research domain over the past 20 years since the notion of resilience in connection to wdns was first reported in 2000 todini 2000 to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first paper that provides a holistic bibliometric analysis of the literature content focused on wdns resilience besides the qualitative insights this study presents a quantitative analysis of the field as a whole distinguishing itself from existing review papers shin et al 2018 shuang et al 2019 quitana et al 2020 the remainder of this paper is structured as follows first a brief overview of resilience is outlined followed by a description of the research method leading to the findings of the bibliometric analysis current research insights and future recommendations are subsequently provided before drawing the concluding remarks 2 resilience background the word resilience is originated from the latin root resiliere which means to bounce back the notion has captured mounting attention since the 1970 s when it was first introduced to describe ecological systems a resilient ecological system is characterized by its ability to adapt survive and grow under unfavorable changing conditions holling 1973 since then the concept of resilience has been incorporated in many fields such as social sciences economics and engineering bonanno et al 2007 dinh et al 2012 helmrich et al 2020 presented a recent biomimicry based approach to support infrastructures resilience design considering the continuous temporal change of their states helmrich et al 2020 resilience of infrastructure systems is a subdomain of engineering resilience that exploits engineering knowledge for sustainable operation and restoration of such systems the aim is to maximize the service life of these infrastructures by exploiting an optimum utilization of available resources american society of civil engineers conceptualizes resilience as the capability to mitigate significant hazards and promptly recover and restore critical services with minimum damage to the economy public health and safety asce 2018 woods 2015 asserted the significance of considering adaptability and transformation in quantifying resilience woods 2015 similarly the us department of homeland security defined the resilience of infrastructure systems as their ability to resist tolerate absorb recover from prepare for or adapt to an adverse occurrence that causes destruction or loss dhs 2017 existing literature reveals a set of diverse approaches to analyze the resilience of wdns such as surrogate measure liu et al 2017 simulation methods zhang et al 2020 complex network theory meng et al 2018 fault detections cuguer√≥ escofet et al 2016 and others multiple distinct metrics were employed within each category to quantify the resilience of wdns in light of these endeavors a holistic resilience analysis of wdns shall evaluate absorptive adaptive and restorative capacities of resilience elaboration on these capacities and relevant system properties is provided below 2 1 fundamental resilience characterization of wdns robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity are the main qualities that characterize the system s absorptive adaptive and restorative capacities bruneau et al 2003 yodo and wang 2016 in the context of resilience absorptive capacity measures the system s capability to alleviate damage propagation under disruptive events jung et al 2014 adaptive capacity is the degree to which a disrupted system can rearrange itself to cope with an ongoing perturbation and continue to provide services decision makers and governing agencies exploit both technology development and innovative logistic solutions to enhance the adaptive capacity and secure stable performance of wdns bi et al 2016 finally restorative capacity is a unique attribute that distinguishes resilience from other concepts such as risk and vulnerability restorative capacity features the system s ability to be restored easily restoration rapidity and degree are highly influenced by emergency protocols and available resources allocated to identify failed components isolate them and dispatch repair crews shuang et al 2019 in addition the resilience of wdns shall be defined within a multi attribute context that extends the technical analysis to account for social economic and organizational aspects markolf et al 2018 due to limited resources and scarce budgets socioeconomic factors may play a dominant role in prioritizing enhancement and restorative decisions such prioritization can be elicited based on a set of pre determined criteria such as population size expected costs tax base and others what is considered resilient in a specific zone may not be deemed so in other locations weichselgartner and kelman 2015 as such socioeconomic factors can be exploited to set performance targets for different zones across the network in addition the organizational structure and decision making protocols within water agencies are vital cornerstones in determining their capacity to strategically manage wdns and promptly take disaster related responses bruneau et al 2003 hence this study illustrates bibliometric analysis and systematic review to assess the completeness of research endeavors related to the resilience of wdns 3 methods 3 1 research questions this section illustrates the methodology utilized to review resilience related literature of wdns fig 1 depicts the framework of this methodology which comprises three main stages 1 problem definition 2 data acquisition and 3 review analysis this review seeks to explore the trends of around 20 years of research outputs related to the resilience of wdns the research questions addressed herein are defined as follows 1 what is the intellectual structure of this research domain how did it evolve over the years 2 which authors and publications are most influential what is the extent of collaborative patterns 3 what are the methods and metrics adopted to quantify the resilience of wdns are they focused on natural hazards or anthropic events can they be used to evaluate resilience against all extreme events or are they specific only to certain types of hazards 4 what are the current gaps and future challenges directing the resilience of wdns research 3 2 data acquisition publications related to the resilience of wdns were retrieved from scopus database the most comprehensive multidisciplinary extended abstract and citation database scopus was chosen because of its superiority in terms of journal coverages compared to other databases such as web of science and pubmed mongeon and paul hus 2016 to capture the maximum possible number of relevant publications the search protocol was set using two strings the first reflects data regarding wdns using the terms water distribution or water supply or water pipes or water main the second string contains resilience related terms to such as resilien the asterisk wildcard character was used to cover studies containing variations of the same keyword for example the term resilien was used to retrieve publications with either resilience resilient or resiliency in their contents the search method was set to title abstract keywords to cover all the publications containing the selected keywords in any of these fields the subject area was limited to engineering and environmental science using these settings the search resulted in 306 items limiting the document types to peer reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings brought this number to 230 documents a manual review of both titles and abstracts was then adopted as inclusion and exclusion criteria for the final consideration of relevant articles studies related to optimal design segmentation or pump scheduling of wdns without considering resilience context were excluded similarly studies assessing resilience of systems other than wdns such as microbial communities within these networks were also excluded in contrast studies related to wdns resilience assessment quantification enhancement and restoration were included consequently 184 papers out of 230 were shortlisted for further analyses the list of the retrieved publications is provided in the supplementary materials data cleansing was the last step conducted in the data acquisition phase to ensure the quality of the obtained results examples of such cleansing include correcting the names of authors and institutions and standardizing referencing styles 3 3 analysis a two tier analysis was adopted in this study to systemically review the retrieved literature bibliometric analysis was firstly conducted followed by critical content analysis bibliometric analysis was defined for the first time by pritchard 1969 as the application of mathematical and statistical methods to books and other media of communication since then it has gained growing popularity in exploring the knowledge anatomy and evolvement of many domains donthu et al 2021 unlike classical literature reviews bibliometric analysis exploits quantitative and statistical methods to explore the knowledge body hence obtained results are less prone to bias and subjectivity xu et al 2018 network analysis which is a common technique in bibliometric studies employs the author s details keywords and abstract terms as informative units to elicit the underlying prolificacy of authors publications and prominent clusters of the investigated field al et al 2012 subsequently content analysis is conducted in this study considering each cluster to thoroughly grasp the research themes and respective challenges the current study exploited multiple software packages such as bibexcel persson et al 2009 vosviewer van eck and waltman 2013 and gephi bastian et al 2009 bibexcel was used for data acquisition initial processing statistical analysis bibliographic coupling and other bibliometric tasks bibexcel was chosen because of its ability to retrieve documents of various referencing formats in addition the output files generated from bibexcel are fully compatible with various network analysis and visualization tools persson et al 2009 gephi and vosviewer were utilized for network graphical analysis because of their ability to handle various data formats advanced filtering options versatile analysis techniques and augmented clustering capabilities bastian et al 2009 van eck and waltman 2013 gephi was specifically employed for clustering and page rank analysis vosviewer was adopted for citation analysis co authorship analysis co word analysis and term map generation further elaboration on these techniques along with the obtained results are presented in the subsequent sections 4 bibliometric analysis 4 1 trend of documents outputs fig 2 illustrates the progression of publication and citation numbers in the retrieved database despite a general increasing trend in the number of annual publications from 2000 to 2021 three different stages can be observed first there were very low publication numbers between 2000 and 2010 with a maximum annual publication of six in 2009 secondly the publication number started to increase between 2011 and 2014 with an average of 7 75 publications per year the last period between 2015 and 2021 june witnessed the fastest growth with an annual mean of 19 publications specifically a minimum of 20 publications was recorded each year from 2018 to 2020 the first publication presented by todini 2000 is the only recorded publication before 2004 while the publication member reached a peak of 29 in 2020 a declining trend is remarked in 2021 due to incomplete data finally a surge in citation numbers is observed between 2011 and 2018 reflecting an increasingly recent interest with a maximum citation number of 536 in 2016 4 2 citation analysis 4 2 1 document analysis citation analysis portrays the popularity of publications in any research field ding and cronin 2011 fig 3 depicts a map of the retrieved publications with a minimum of 20 citations each publication is signified by a node whose size is determined by the respective number of citations twenty citations limit was chosen after several trials to obtain a readable clear and representative citation network of the studied field a higher citation limit would result in missing some publications while a lower one would result in a network that cannot be read a list of the most cited studies in this research domain is illustrated in table 1 todini 2000 ranks the first with 496 citations followed by prasad and park 2004 and farmani et al 2005 with 415 and 222 citations respectively 4 2 2 page rank analysis initially proposed by brin and page 1998 to prioritize web search results page rank analysis represents a complementary method to citation analysis that extends the evaluation beyond mere citations number a citation by highly prestigious articles implies higher importance page rank analysis measures the publications eminence by assigning more values to those cited by highly prestigious articles ding and cronin 2011 page rank score is a non negative real value with the scores of all the publications in a citation network summing up to an exact unity table 2 depicts the top ten publications based on page rank score some discrepancies can be observed between the most influential publications based on citation number and page rank score the articles introduced by yazdani et al 2011 diao et al 2016 and herrera et al 2016 are the only common publications among the two ranking approaches the top eminent publications shown in table 2 presented integrative and comparative studies between different resilience assessment approaches of wdns 4 3 co authorship analysis and research collaboration 4 3 1 co author analysis the retrieved collection comprises 357 authors from 37 countries table 3 lists the most influential authors based on the number of citations ezio todini ranks first with 572 citations followed by raziyeh farmani and marco franchini with 483 and 264 citations respectively in addition raziyeh farmani published the highest number of publications 13 followed by david butler and enrico creaco with 11 publications for each as such these authors may be considered experts in the domain of wdns resilience the fact that most of the influential authors are from italy and the uk can be attributed to several factors italy has one of the most deteriorating wdns because of the highly fragmented sector inefficient planning and insufficient investment baldino and sauri 2018 the average water loss due to leakage from deteriorated pipelines is around 40 of the produced water the largest in the european union national institute of statistics istat 2017 in fact highly deteriorated networks are more vulnerable and susceptible to widespread failure due to even low level disruptions as such many researchers devoted their efforts to enhancing the resilience of wdns by combating these challenges in the uk the governmental office of water services regulates the privatized water sector ofwat imposes a firm policy regarding level of service leakage targets water quality and serviceability standards engelhardt et al 2000 consequently a strong partnership was developed between private companies and the research community such as the center of water systems at exeter university to secure necessary know how and technology recently the water companies reported significant success bringing down the leakage levels to the lowest since records began in the 1990 s ofwat 2020 to better grasp the microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of research collaboration in the field of wdns resilience vosviewer visualization tool was used to generate co authorship and country relationships networks only 49 authors of the 357 met the criterion of producing a minimum of three publications this number of publications was chosen after several trials to obtain a readable clear and representative co author network of the studied field to help identify the most influential authors a higher publications limit would result in missing some authors while a lower one would result in a network that cannot be read fig 4 shows 27 of these authors organized in six clusters other authors were excluded as they had no links to other authors for example the green cluster presents a robust collaborative relationship between raziyeh farmani david butler guangtao fu chris sweetapple and fanlin meng david butler is the central author of this research community featured by more collaborative activities than other members the sparse topology of the co authorship network emphasizes the need for more collaborative activities especially between different research communities to advance the resilience research related to wdns 4 3 2 countries network map similarly a network of countries was generated to explore the worldwide distribution of publications in this domain fig 5 shows 18 countries represented as nodes arranged in four clusters the uk contributed the most to this field with 58 publications followed by the usa italy china and canada with 39 36 21 and 13 publications respectively these countries are leading in applying resilience enhancement strategies derived by several governmental regulations such as the presidential policy directive launched in 2013 to protect critical infrastructure systems in the united states ayyub 2014 generally speaking this map is less scarce than the co author network demonstrating a better collaboration between authors across various countries the uk collaborated the most with other countries with a total link strength of 44 followed by china and netherland with total link strengths of 30 and 24 respectively in particular researchers from the uk collaborated the most with their counterparts from china as evidenced by the greatest link strength of 9 on the other hand a minimum collaboration exists between the us and colombia with a link strength of only one although co author relationships are mainly be influenced by individual researchers collaboration preferences national initiatives can significantly boost these relationships the uk china partnership for water research is an example of such initiatives that promote joint research projects between authors from both countries uk center for ecology and hydrology 2010 4 3 3 co word analysis and research evolution authors keywords present an abstract depiction of the publication s content keyword co occurrence is employed to explore the intellectual structure and prominent topics of this research domain donthu et al 2021 among the 416 keywords vosviewer identified 44 keywords that were reported more than three times table 4 besides water distribution networks and resilience the most commonly utilized keywords are optimization graph theory and reliability with 31 61 and 11 occurrences respectively it is worth mentioning that variations of the same keywords were counted only once for example the water distribution networks can be found as either water networks water distribution systems water infrastructure or others therefore the occurrences of all these words were summated and assigned to the term water distribution networks complementing the keyword analysis with the time factor helps understand the development of the research field and trends change over time fig 6 shows the progression of resilience based keywords between 2000 and 2021 the term water distribution network was omitted since it does not reflect the current research trend before 2014 the resilience of wdns was indirectly assessed as evidenced by the terms reliability design and rehabilitation reliable design and optimal rehabilitation contribute to enhancing the resilience absorptive capacity of wdns by increasing their robustness the word resilience took the lead towards 2016 marking a new era of explicit resilience assessment this aligns with the research shift from classical risk based protections to resilience based ones supported by the increased frequency and destructive consequences of hazardous events shin et al 2018 unsurprisingly more innovative techniques to assess and enhance resilience started to emerge over the past recent years indicated by the keywords topology simulation and sustainability this progression coincides with the reported successful achievements of incorporating graph theory and sustainability objectives in developing integrated resilience based management of wdns ahmed et al 2021 it shall be noted that the retrieved documents circumscribe all co authorship analyses only journal articles and conference proceedings published in english were extracted from the results of the search protocol detailed in section 3 2 although there is a bias in the results because of the language used this bias is not expected to affect the general trends of the results since the vast majority of publications in science and engineering are in english in fact 98 of publications in science are written in english according to some recent statistics ram√≠rez casta√±eda and manalo 2020 5 clustering and content analysis 5 1 thematic clustering the knowledge base of any publication can be realized by analyzing its cited references xu et al 2018 bibliographic coupling is a semantic technique used to determine underlying connections between publications and objectively explore the structure of any research domain donthu et al 2021 in this study bibliographic coupling was utilized for thematic clustering because of its ability to visualize even recent publications that would have been cited less often donthu et al 2021 a bibliographic coupling link is generated between two publications that both cite the same reference publications sharing a common theme that differs from other publications are designated by the same cluster in this sense edge densities of links connecting nodes publications of the same cluster are higher than those of links commencing nodes of different clusters xu et al 2018 bibexcel was used to prepare the bibliographic coupling network file which was exported to gephi software for graphical visualization the network consists of 177 nodes and 9 152 bibliographic coupling links this network was subsequently partitioned into clusters based on the relative degree of correlation between publications louvain algorithm was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters by maximizing the modularity index a clustering quality indicator blondel et al 2008 the process starts by assigning a distinct cluster for each node these nodes are then iteratively rearranged until realizing the maximum modularity index blondel et al 2008 fig 7 shows three clusters depicting the results of applying this algorithm to the collected database cluster 1 comprises 53 publications whereas clusters 2 and 3 contain 61 and 63 publications respectively cluster 1 comprises the early applications of resilience assessment through hydraulic simulations while cluster 2 includes comparative analyses between various surrogate measures for resilience assessment the evolvement and capabilities of topological metrics in resilience assessment are investigated in cluster 3 the evolution of each cluster from 2000 to 2021 is illustrated in fig 8 cluster 1 emerged in 2004 with only one publication it persisted at a low pace until 2014 where five publications were recorded a steady development is then observed between 2014 and 2021 with an annual average of four publications although cluster 2 emerged at the earliest stage since 2000 this cluster did not gain any momentum during the subsequent years except for the years 2004 2007 2008 with only one publication reported in each the cluster has shown consistent growth until reaching an all time maximum number of publications nine in 2020 research related to cluster 3 started the latest with two publications in 2011 and 2012 an interruption was reported in 2013 with no publication followed by an accelerated progression that peaked at 15 publications in 2018 and 2020 recently publications related to clusters 2 and 3 continue to grow at a higher rate than cluster 1 indicating the hotspot themes in the resilience of wdns research 5 2 content analysis in this subsection the most frequent terms in each cluster were leveraged to identify the cluster s generic theme exploiting the text mining and visualization functionalities of vosviewer a term map was then generated for each cluster van eck and waltman 2011 fig 9 depicts these maps with the term size indicating its prominence subsequently the content of the top 15 publications was reviewed to explore the main research trends in each cluster 5 2 1 cluster 1 hydraulic simulation and evolution of surrogate measures for resilience assessment of wdns this cluster has emerged since 2004 and encompasses 53 publications that mainly employ hydraulic simulation and associated metrics for resilience assessment of wdns owing to its capability to thoroughly analyze the performance of wdns during various operating conditions hydraulic simulation is the most commonly utilized approach in resilience assessment studies among the most influential publications eight studies presented hydraulic based resilience applications of wdns reca et al 2008 jung et al 2014 in all of these applications resilience was quantified via a diverse set of indicators that were derived based on simulation results diao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 various properties were also analyzed utilizing this approach including robustness jung et al 2014 vulnerability laucelli and giustolisi 2015 and dependency guidotti et al 2016 the remaining publications introduced a new class of flow based metrics surrogate measures that are also based on hydraulic simulations resilience index network resilience index and modified resilience index are examples of the main surrogate measures extensively utilized in resilience studies these measures were employed as resilience objectives to determine the optimal design and rehabilitation actions farmani et al 2005 jayaram and srinivasan 2008 for example reca et al 2008 developed a multi objective optimization framework to determine the best design of looped wdns based on resilience index and cost the authors utilized simulated annealing and tabu search optimization algorithms to find the optimal design reca et al 2008 as evidenced in fig 9a terms such as hydraulic simulation and optimization represent the most frequently investigated concepts in this cluster 5 2 2 cluster 2 comparison among surrogate measures for resilience assessment of wdns cluster 2 contains 61 publications with the first publication dated back to 2000 the main focus of this cluster is to present a retrospective comparison among various resilience surrogate measures as presented in nine of the top 15 studies analyzed for example banos et al 2011 compared the respective performance of resilience index network resilience index and modified resilience index in achieving the optimum design of wdns under demand uncertainty similarly tanyimboh et al 2016 and sirsant and reddy 2020 evaluated the performance of resilience index network resilience index and flow entropy in assessing the resilience of wdns against pipe failures and demand variations results of such comparative studies were not always consistent for example tanyimboh et al 2016 reported superiority of flow entropy index regarding accuracy and computational efforts whereas sirsant and reddy 2020 postulated a combination of entropy and resilience index as a viable indicator of resilience level the extent of these comparisons studies among various surrogate measures is depicted in fig 9b the other six studies presented a comparison between various optimization algorithms and hydraulic simulation approaches to maximize the resilience of wdns bi et al 2016 creaco et al 2016 for instance zheng et al 2016 developed a framework for exploring the search navigation efficiency of various optimization algorithms instead of solely focusing on the final solution quality the authors compared between nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii self adaptive differential evolution and borg evolution algorithms in identifying the optimal trade off between cost and resilience objectives zheng et al 2016 5 2 3 cluster 3 topological metrics for resilience assessment of wdns representing the largest cluster with 63 publications this cluster has emerged since 2011 in this cluster research efforts were devoted towards utilizing graph theory and complex network indicators in assessing the resilience of wdns fig 9c among the top publications in this cluster six studies employed topological based metrics to investigate resilience assessment enhancement and restoration for example yazdani et al 2011 studied the relationship between topological features and the performance of wdns by quantifying robustness and redundancy subsequently the authors evaluated various expansion and enhancement strategies to meet a continuously increased demand yazdani et al 2011 among other metrics agathokleous et al 2017 exploited betweenness centrality index bci to assess the time dependent impact of the network s topology on resilience in addition three other studies coupled the network s failure history and component s characteristics with topological metrics in resilience assessment of wdns for instance farahmandfar et al 2017 employed pipes failure history in developing a new metric for assessing and enhancing the resilience of actual wdns in an earthquake prone region the remaining studies provided a comparative analysis between various types of resilience assessment metrics farahmandfar and piratla 2018 di nardo et al 2014 for example meng et al 2018 conducted a comparison between hydraulic system performance and various topological metrics in resilience enhancement and restoration spread and duration of failure exhibited strong correlations with some topological metrics such as connectivity modularity and centrality on the other hand spectral coefficient showed a weak correlation with the resilience performance of wdns due to their grid like structure meng et al 2018 5 3 current research tables 5 7 depict a brief content analysis of the top influential publications due to the space limitation only the top ten articles in each cluster are presented this section presents first a brief description of resilience properties and assessment methods next a critical analysis of the current research directions based on various resilience approaches is provided 5 3 1 objectives capacities and properties research efforts addressing resilience generally aim to assess enhance and or restore the resilience of wdns resilience assessment applications usually evaluate the current resilience level against single or multiple hazards resilience assessment is the most common type of resilience studies as it represents the core upon which other applications are based a novel framework for assessing the resilience of wdns is proposed by diao et al 2016 besides resilience evaluation resilience enhancement studies complement the resilience analysis by proposing some improving benchmarking interventions these models may investigate potential expansions and new network designs yazdani et al 2011 or resilience enhancement of existing networks farahmandfar et al 2017 finally restoration studies investigate the recovery stage following disruptive events the total number of these studies is less than resilience assessment and enhancement applications zhang et al 2020 as previously mentioned robustness redundancy rapidity and resourcefulness are the main four properties to describe any system s resilience bruneau et al 2003 in wdns robustness is the strength to withstand stressing conditions whether gradual or abrupt without significant degradation in fulfilling operational requirements bruneau et al 2003 it represents the main criterion that defines the system s absorptive capacity redundancy is the ability to minimize the likelihood and impact of disruptions to satisfy functional requirements while redundancy enhances the absorptive capacity it can be exploited to improve the system s adaptive capacity rapidity and resourcefulness are two properties that distinguish resilience restorative capacity rapidity is the pace at which a system can be restored to an acceptable level after hazard occurrence whereas resourcefulness is the efficient utilization of available resources both physical and institutional to achieve rapid recovery bruneau et al 2003 5 3 2 analysis methods and classifications resilience models can be categorized as either deterministic or stochastic unlike deterministic analysis stochastic models account for the random nature of failures and inherited uncertainties in the restoration process sirsant and reddy 2020 due to the complexity of their analysis and their higher computational requirements stochastic models are less common in the literature despite superior practical value each resilience category can be further classified as static or dynamic depending on whether the time factor is considered when assessing the system s performance static models tackle resilience as a snapshot in time while dynamic models consider the extended deterioration over a long time period in resilience planning accounting for the continuous deterioration prior to hazard occurrence yields more realistic results compared to the subjective assumption of an arbitrary performance level before disruptions optimal decisions regarding enhancement interventions can only be determined when pondering the deterioration of various components assad et al 2021 resilience models can also be classified against the considered hazard context in a single hazard analysis hazard intensity and duration are exploited to simulate the system s response most of the current studies assessed the resilience of wdns against single hazards such as seismic hazards guidotti et al 2016 floods tarani et al 2019 intentional attacks shin et al 2020 or others in multi hazard analysis the focus is shifted from investigating single incidents towards addressing the impact of various hazards on wdns these impacts include structural failures hydraulic failures or quality related failures the advantage of this approach is the ability to address multiple threats that inflict the same impacts in one single analysis diao et al 2016 pagani et al 2020 in both cases assessment and restoration decisions shall account for the social economic and organizational aspects to provide a comprehensive resilience planning framework 5 3 3 flow based metrics resilience assessment of wdns can be formulated based on flow based or topological based metrics in the earlier hydraulic simulation is conducted to analyze the network s performance against one or more hazards in the latter graph theory and other structural attributes are employed to evaluate performance and restoration behaviors todini 2000 presented a static deterministic model for assessing and enhancing resilience absorptive capacity of newly constructed wdns the model considered both technical and economic aspects of resilience by accounting for the hydraulic reliability and enhancement actions this model is the earliest work related to the resilience of wdns that was utilized and modified in numerous subsequent research endeavors for example prasad and park 2004 extended todini s index to account for the network s redundancy jayaram and srinivasan 2008 formulated another dynamic resilience based design and rehabilitation framework that alleviates the shortcomings of todini s index the authors introduced a new metric that accounts for multiple sources to assess the resilience of wdns against both excess demand and pipe failures dynamic deterioration was modeled through leaks and roughness growth recently hydraulic simulation has been employed in stochastic resilience applications of wdns shin et al 2020 evaluated the resilience of wdns against intentional physical and cyber attacks the authors introduced an integrated resilience metric to simulate 15 failure scenarios and investigate various recovery behaviors similarly zhang et al 2020 stochastically assessed the resilience of wdns against seismic hazards the authors developed a multi objective restoration model to improve the restorative capacity of an actual wdn with more than 6 000 pipes several comparative studies mainly in research cluster 2 have emerged to evaluate the performance of flow based metrics cimorelli et al 2018 zhan et al 2020 cimorelli et al 2018 assessed the effectiveness of creaco s resilience index and the entropy index in enhancement applications creaco et al 2016 a posteriori reliability analysis was adopted to estimate the solution quality of each index considering various pipe replacement options subject to budgetary constraints because of explicitly satisfying minimum nodal pressure requirements creaco s index outperformed the entropy index in terms of optimal rehabilitation planning 5 3 4 topological based metrics in topological models wdns are featured as configurations of spatially interconnected components metrics of graph models and complex networks can be utilized for systematic quantification and classification of various network characteristics yazdani et al 2011 introduced the most representative resilience enhancement model based on network theory through exploiting a wide range of statistical and spectral metrics the authors investigated the underlying relationships between structural features and the performance of wdns to optimize expansion decisions similarly herrera et al 2016 employed weighted shortest paths from consumption nodes to water sources to quantify resilience coupled with a multiscale decomposition method the authors assessed the resilience of a large scale network made of more than 100 000 nodes and pipes topological models emerged as viable alternatives to alleviate the extensive computations required to hydraulically simulate large and complex wdns however these models alone can not fully characterize the actual performance of wdns meng et al 2018 therefore several researchers attempted to complement topological metrics with other structural or hydraulic attributes for instance assad et al 2020 integrated reliability criticality and redundancy in formulating a multi attribute resilience metric that accounts for the dynamic deterioration of pipelines due to aging a stochastic multi objective framework was developed to optimize the restoration of an actual wdn subjected to multiple pipe breaks and leaks the output was an optimal plan comprising the sequence and type of recovery actions in a different approach he and yuan 2019 assessed the restoration priority of damaged wdns based on an integrated hydraulic simulation and mechanical repairs optimization model a stochastic scoring methodology was proposed to determine the restoration priority of damaged segments a high correlation was found between the proposed methodology and some graph theoretic metrics such as the betweenness metric the authors however asserted the need for a more detailed exploration of this correlation before adopting the betweenness metric as a reliable indicator in restoration applications of wdns he and yuan 2019 from the previous review one can conclude that resilience assessment of wdns was initially based on hydraulic simulation this has always been the most precise mean to capture the performance of wdns under various operating conditions nonetheless the tedious calibration process of numerous parameters and the extended computational time needed as the size and complexity of wdns increase necessitate the need for assessing the suitability of other metrics as such the topological metrics emerged as an alternative for classical hydraulic based approaches however it was shortly recognized that such metrics are not adequate alone to measure resilience of wdns therefore current research endeavors advance hybrid frameworks that integrate both hydraulic and topological metrics 6 discussion 6 1 overview driven by the growing interest in resilience planning this study applied bibliometric analysis techniques to explore the resilience research of wdns presenting the first bibliometric analysis of this specific field this paper complements existing reviews with essential quantitative insights utilizing science mapping techniques a trend graph of the retrieved publications shows that the first study that explicitly assessed the resilience of wdns was published in 2000 however it was only during the past five years that the highest publication numbers were observed indeed resilience studies continued to rise reaching a maximum of 29 publications in 2020 while initial resilience studies focused on resilience assessment and enhancement restoration studies emerged more recently this trend is mainly stimulated by the recently increased disasters and related governmental regulations bibexcel coupled with vosviewer and gephi visualization tools were then employed to perform various bibliometric analyses first citation analysis and page rank analysis were conducted to identify the most cited and most prominent publications in this research field respectively a disparity was observed between the top ten publications since the page rank algorithm asserts more wrights to citations in prestigious journals this disparity is significant to determine the most influential studies and stat of the art endeavors in the field of wdns resilience research contributions cited and published in highly cited journals are the most significant efforts that advance research progress in any field next co author and countries network maps were analyzed to determine the most contributing authors and to portray the global collaboration among researchers in this field a scarce structure of small communities was observed in the co authorship network map exhibiting the need for more collaboration across various communities to unlock new opportunities for advancing resilience research nonetheless these small communities of authors produced some of the most influential publications asserting the value of research collaboration in this field authors keywords were also analyzed to determine the emerging research themes coupled with timespan analysis the chronological progress of wdns resilience research was explored while the resilience of wdns was initially focused on investigating various hydraulic indicators for reliable design of wdns before 2014 a shift towards utilizing other techniques such as complex network analysis is recently observed in fact complementing resilience assessment with sustainability objectives and topological metrics represents the cutting edge research in this domain the term optimization maintained its existence over the years derived from the need to meet various operational objectives related to wdns resilience this aligns with the results in table 4 where the term optimization was the most frequent keyword after wdns and resilience multiple algorithms varying from deterministic single objective optimization to stochastic multi objective optimization were employed as illustrated in section 5 optimizing resilience of wdns is a continuous process to combat increasingly uncertain disruptions and minimize costs and emissions associated with enhancement actions utilizing physical and institutional resources finally bibliographic coupling and clustering were performed to classify the retrieved publications three clusters were identified to serve as the basis for subsequent content analysis research evolution and term maps were generated for each cluster to uncover their latent themes while clusters 1 and 2 emerged before cluster 3 the latter advanced with the highest momentum championed by the maximum number of publications among the three clusters this momentum suggests once again that integrating topological attributes in resilience assessment is a current hotspot topic research outcomes and resilience assessment methodologies were then critically reviewed to pave the way for postulating future research recommendations 6 2 future trends this study unfolded the genesis and progression of the literature related to the resilience of wdns thematic trends were quantitatively explored and latent topics were carefully analyzed some research gaps that can help elicit future research agenda in this domain were identified this section is dedicated to present these gaps classified into three main categories theory context and methods 6 2 1 theory towards resilience based management of wdns as previously illustrated several studies have assessed the resilience of wdns against specific hazards bi et al 2016 tarani et al 2019 yet far less attention has been directed towards resilience assessment in a multi hazard context there is a need for more comprehensive frameworks that study different hazards impacts on wdns deliberate attacks whether physical cyber or biochemical were also rarely assessed qiao et al 2007 shin et al 2020 detailed analysis of possible intentional attacks can help strengthen the most vulnerable and critical assets thus improving resilience and averting widespread cascading consequences in addition most of the existing models focused solely on either resilience enhancement or restoration nonetheless rehabilitation and restoration measures are interrelated and contribute to reinforcing one another as such holistic models that combine pre hazards and post hazards system responses to sudden disruptions and gradual deterioration are needed furthermore the lack of common standards and easy to use resilience metrics that practitioners can exploit hinders the wide incorporation of resilience within asset management plans future efforts should be devoted to developing new practical metrics and guidelines that facilitate implementation benchmarking and comparison purposes 6 2 2 context towards a meticulous assessment of wdns resilience meticulous resilience assessment entails systematic consideration of all resilience capacities while absorptive and restorative capacities were exhaustively analyzed studies investigating adaptive capacity are rather rare among the top 45 publications only three studies assessed resilience adaptive capacity mugume et al 2015 bi et al 2016 shin et al 2020 future efforts should be directed to investigate various adaptive measures such as demand redistribution performance rationing flexibility agility and others in addition resilience assessment should integrate social economic and organizational aspects besides the technical one both economic and social though less often aspects were also analyzed in the retrieved literature on the contrary very few studies explicitly assessed organizational aspects of wdns resilience indirect measures mainly operational were integrated in some applications such as the maximum number of failures before pipe abandonment and the number of allowed interventions per pipe per period assad et al 2021 more studies are required to assess the impact of decision making protocols organizational structures emergency policies repositioning regulations and other organizational factors on the resilience of wdns wdns exhibit assorted types of interdependencies with other infrastructures whether geographical with road networks functional with power plants or both with sewer systems rinaldi et al 2001 for example energy generated by power plants is essential for the sustainable operation of pumping units across wdns water is also crucial to the cooling process at power plants extending current resilience analysis to model various interdependencies is vital to minimize the cascading damages from to wdns this is especially important to alleviate the propagated socioeconomic consequences of critical components failures such as those that supply water to power plants and health care facilities 6 2 3 methods towards a smart assessment of wdns resilience in the era of digitalization the success of any planning process is highly contingent on the sufficient availability of reliable relevant data data acquisition regarding a system s performance condition assessment and fault detection are essential for resilience planning smart models that estimate a system s response to various loading intensities and enhancement actions should be devised based on both experimental and historical records new wireless sensors and remote detection mechanisms can be leveraged for coherent condition assessment and automated fault detection complementing these datasets with real time information shared on social media during failure events can be considerably significant in case of sensors damage and cyberattacks researchers in the near future should advance a new version of resilience frameworks that automatically pair fault detection with response decisions cloud computing and big data analytics can immensely contribute to advancing these frameworks however security privacy and cost of data acquired are associated concerns that need to be addressed in addition investigating temporal and spatial resilience variations before and after hazards necessitates using hydraulic simulation engines stochastic analysis platforms and geographical mapping tools technology integration and computational challenges should be tackled to ensure the efficacy of the proposed methodologies in addition future efforts should also explore possible solutions to handle problems arising from the accretion of new technologies over aging existing wdns 7 conclusion the resilience of wdns has gained momentous attention to combat the ever increasing detrimental threats that jeopardize their sustainable function the present review builds upon previous work but distances itself from others by presenting the first bibliometric study of the entire field as a whole since the emergence of resilience in the context of wdns key authors topics publications and countries were identified along with their underlying interrelationships utilizing science mapping approach main insights drawn from the systemic bibliometric and content analyses are summarized below 1 research in this field emerged since 2000 and

3556,spontaneous imbibition si of wetting fluids is an important process for many hydrological and geological applications in this study we investigated experimentally and theoretically the si process in a dual porosity medium consisting of the matrix and the filled fracture low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology was used to dynamically monitor the distribution of the imbibed water in the dual porosity media during the si experiments based on the lf nmr theory a cut off method was proposed to quantitatively distinguish the imbibed water from the matrix and the filled fracture the results showed that the rate of matrix imbibition was greater in the dual porosity media than in single porosity media this inconsistent rate of matrix imbibition between the single porosity media and the dual porosity media was caused by the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture an analytical model was then proposed to characterize this enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture it was found that the rate of matrix imbibition was not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but also depended on the size of the particles filled in the fracture a clear non monotonic relationship was found between the rate of matrix imbibition and the size of the particles filled in the fracture the rate of matrix imbibition initially increased and then decreased as the size of the particles filled in the fracture increased the proposed analytical model not only highlighted the mechanism of enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture but was also able to determine the optimum equivalent capillary diameter of the filled particles in the fracture for enhanced rate of matrix imbibition in dual porosity media keywords spontaneous imbibition lf nmr dual porosity media mass transfer fracture unsaturated porous media 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition si is the spontaneous entry of a wetting fluid into a porous medium driven only by capillary forces displacing a pre existing nonwetting fluid as a fundamental mass transfer process the importance of si mechanism has long been recognized in many hydrological and geotechnical applications such as sequestration of carbon dioxide lyu et al 2020 plug and bruining 2007 prather et al 2016 oil and gas extraction gao and hu 2016 standnes 2010 zhou et al 2016 and the protection of groundwater resources jim√©nez mart√≠nez et al 2020 in the early time stage the si process is capillary dominated and the influence of gravity could be neglected due to the insignificant amount of imbibed water however due to the ubiquitous heterogeneity of geologic formations zhao et al 2020 the early time si process is complex and still less well understood in fractured porous media especially in dual porosity media i e with both matrix and filled fracture in a typical fractured medium consisting of fracture and matrix the fracture aperture is generally larger than the mean pore size of the matrix even for a filled fracture as a result a wetting fluid invades a fracture much faster than the matrix in early time while the ultimate imbibition height is usually less in a fracture than in the surrounding matrix this inconsistent imbibition rate between the matrix and the fracture contributed to dispersion of solutes in the vadose zone cheng et al 2015 schmid et al 2011 provided a potential migration pathway for groundwater contaminants in aquifer aquitard system and fractured media dou et al 2013 navarre sitchler et al 2015 and affected the enhanced oil recovery from fractured reservoirs in recent decades extensive studies involving both experimental and theoretical methods have been applied to investigate the behavior of si and have shown that the imbibition rate as a metric of characterizing the mass transfer during the si process is related to pore structure fluid properties initial water saturation boundary conditions and mineralization cai et al 2020 gao and hu 2016 lyu et al 2019 morrow and mason 2001 thus the inconsistent imbibition rate in the fractured media depends strongly on the dynamics of capillary uptake at different stages of the si process on the one hand and is sensitive to differences in pore structure between the matrix and the fracture on the other consequently the wetting front moves laterally from the fracture into the matrix at the late time stage of si process in fact the wetting front may spread laterally from the fracture into the matrix at the early time because of the inconsistent imbibition rate throughout the entire si process however little attention has been paid to the mass transfer behavior between the matrix and the fracture at the early time stage of si process quantitatively distinguishing the origin of the imbibed water from the matrix and the fracture is critical for characterizing the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture in recent years many advanced technologies have improved the experimental capabilities for analyzing the si process such as neutron radiographic techniques cheng et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 ct scanning techniques akin and kovscek 1999 alyafei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 low field nuclear magnetic resonance technique lf nmr lyu et al 2019 meng et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 due to its rapid non invasive and quantitative advantages lf nmr has won worldwide recognition and demonstrated a reliable ability to quantitatively characterize pore structure and seepage behavior for the si process lf nmr can be used to distinguish the amount of water imbibed in pores of different sizes and it is capable of characterizing the type of water content chen et al 2021 meng et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 since the si process and mass transfer between the matrix and the fracture strongly depend on the multi scale pore system and complex pore structure in this study the si experiment was conducted in a dual porosity media with a porous matrix and a filled fracture based on the lf nmr many advanced mathematical models have been proposed to analyze and characterize the si mechanism pioneering models for the si process includes the handy model handy 1960 the lucas washburn lw model washburn 1921 and the aronofsky model aronofsky et al 1958 in the past decades these pioneering models for a multi scale pore system have been improved and incorporated a shape factor to account for different pore sizes and shape effects cai et al 2017 hinds and mortensen 2005 maier et al 2013 miao et al 2015 nonweiler et al 1975 spooner et al 2021 cai and yu 2011 derived an analytical model based on the lw model to consider the effect of tortuosity on capillary imbibition in wet porous media in terms of the fractal dimension for tortuous capillaries after that based on the hagen poiseuille and laplace young equations cai et al 2014 proposed a generalized spontaneous imbibition model with variably shaped pores to account for the effects of tortuous capillaries and noncircular cross sectional shapes for the si process in a horizontally multi layered porous medium ashraf and phirani 2019b developed a generalized lubrication approximation model to predict the wetting front based on the washburn model and they found that the wetting front was not always in the fine pores and depended strongly on the contrasts in the permeability and capillary pressure this result is consistent with their previous findings and assumptions ashraf and phirani 2019a ashraf et al 2017 li et al 2016 established a multiple fractal model for estimating the permeability of dual porosity media embedded with randomly distributed fractures the validity of the fractal aperture distribution was verified by comparing with the in situ measurement results reported in literature the above studies were interpreted qualitatively or quantitatively in terms of the dynamics of capillary uptake for the si process however the fractured porous media with the matrix and the filled fracture as a typical geologic formation have a multi scale pore system and the understanding of the si and the corresponding mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture is still limited this study focuses on the mass transfer phenomena of the imbibed water between the matrix and the filled fracture during the si process the main objectives of this study were to i investigate the si process in both dual porosity and single porosity media based on the lf nmr technology and ii highlight the mechanism of mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture in a dual porosity medium for this purpose the si experiments were performed for yellow sandstone cores with and without the glass beads filled fracture the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix and the filled fracture was quantitatively distinguished by the lf nmr measurement the influence of the particle size of the glass beads on the rate of matrix imbibition was discussed an analytical model was proposed to analyze the mechanism of enhanced matrix imbibition by the filled fracture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials since yellow sandstone is widespread in nature and is a typical reservoir rock in this study yellow sandstone cores were selected as matrix in dual porosity media for the si experiment the sandstone cores were cylinders with a diameter of about 2 4 cm and a length of about 5 9 cm some of the cores were drilled a hole in the middle to mimic the fracture in the matrix i e sample s in fig 1 b and to further structure a matrix filled fracture system the hole in the core was filled with glass beads and under this condition the core sample are considered as a dual porosity medium e g sample d1 in fig 1c the main component of glass beads is silica which shows no signal in the nmr test therefore the composition and content of glass beads do not affect the experimental results and when used as fracture filler the glass beads are loose enough to be well distinguished from the yellow sandstone in the matrix in this study five different sizes of glass beads with the same mass were uniformly packed into the hole of sample s to ensure consistency of porosity as shown in table 1 the porosity of the matrix in all samples was 12 24 the particle size of the filled glass beads varied significantly between samples d1 d5 while the porosity of the glass bead filled fracture of all samples was almost the same and was about 33 32 although the porosity in the glass bead filled fracture was only nearly three times that in the matrix of the yellow sandstone core the pore structure and connectivity between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix differed significantly due to the different formation patterns therefore the yellow sandstone with glass bead filled fracture could be considered as a matrix filled fracture system of dual porosity media for the si process the porosity of the matrix of all samples was determined based on the lf nmr measurement the porosity of the glass bead filled fracture of all samples was determined based on the dry unit weight of the filled glass beads which measured by the hydrometer method das 2019 in addition ultrapure water was used in all si experiments conducted at a room temperature of 25 c 2 2 experimental device and steps the lf nmr analyzer macromr12 150h i manufactured by the suzhou niumag co ltd china was used for lf nmr measurements of the samples during the si experiments the lf nmr analyzer has a magnetic induction intensity of 0 3 t and a constant magnet temperature of 32 c in addition the pressurized saturator hx ii was used to saturate the samples for the si experiment the mass of the samples was measured with the electronic balance with an accuracy of 10 4 g the oven hn101 2 was used to dry the samples at a temperature of 105 c first the samples were prepared the glass beads were dried at 105 in the oven for 24 h to evaporate the potential water and then weighed on the electronic balance the dry glass beads were packed into the holes reserved for the matrix of the sample s after that the sample was sealed with a nylon screen to avoid disturbing the filled glass beads second the si experiment was performed the prepared sample was placed in the imbibition apparatus the apparatus consists of stainless steel shallow square tray 300 mm 200 mm and a permeable stone both the shallow square tray and the permeable stone provide adequate hydraulic contact between the core bottom and the water in the tray as shown in figs 2 and 3 the prepared sample came into contact with water only at the bottom and was immersed in the water surface to a depth of 1 mm after 0 5 min 1 min 2 min 6 min 25 min 120 min 280 min 460 min and 640 min of imbibition the sandstone core samples were then passed over to lf nmr before lf nmr measurements the bottom of the samples was wiped with a damp cloth to prevent adhering water from interfering with the measurements in addition the samples were quickly wrapped with nmr insensitive transparent films to prevent evaporation of water during the lf nmr measurements after the measurements the sample was dried at 105 c until no water was present in the samples and then saturated in the pressurized saturator at a pressure of 10 mpa for 10 h the lf nmr measurements were performed on the saturated samples to measure the porosity and t2 spectrum 2 3 lf nmr measurement and principle in this study the standard carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used to measure the transverse relaxation time t2 during the lf nmr measurement this cpmg pulse sequence provided 200 data points in one echo acquisition time the number of echoes acquired by each cpmg sequence is 10 000 and the corresponding cpmg parameters are set as follows an echo spacing te of 0 15 ms a waiting time tw of 6000 ms an echo numbers of 2048 and the scanning numbers ns of 16 the nmr signal or magnetization m t from a fluid containing non zero spin state i e 1h nuclei that is bound in a porous medium is the convolution of all contribution volumes related to n pores the signal attenuation is characterized by a different t2 relaxation constant the m t can be described as follows connolly et al 2017 1 m t m 0 1 v 0 i n v i e t t 2 s where v 0 and v i denote the total volume of the sample and the contribution of the ith pore volume respectively m 0 is the equilibrium magnetization and t 2 i is the relaxation rate for the ith pore in this study the lf nmr measurement used the nmr transverse relaxation spectroscopy technique the typical nmr relaxation process includes bulk relaxation t2b surface relaxation t2s and diffusion relaxation t2d xu et al 2020 the t2 is controlled by these three different relaxations and can be expressed as follows 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 d the t2b is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity since the viscosity of water is low 1 t2b is small enough to be ignored xu et al 2020 t2s is the lateral relaxation time caused by surface relaxation and is inversely proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of liquids and the square of the echo spacing te bendel 1990 the 1 t2d is negligible when the te is small since the diffusion of water molecules is very fast consequently t2 is dominated by t2s and the eq 2 can be simplified as chen et al 2021 hun et al 2021 wang et al 2010 3 1 t 2 œÅ 2 s v pore œÅ 2 2 r where œÅ 2 is the surface relaxation ratio and r is the radius of the pore from eq 3 it can be seen that t2 is proportional to the pore radius which means that the larger the pore radius the stronger the nmr signal in fact the t2 distribution reflects the pore size distribution when the sample is saturated therefore in this study the water imbibed into the glass bead filled fracture or the matrix of the yellow sandstone can be easily distinguished during the si process because the distribution of the pore space between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix of the sample is significantly different with the resulting t2 distribution being different this provides a reliable non invasive method to study the mass transfer behavior between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix of the sample during the si processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of the imbibed water in dual porosity media the t2 spectrum during si processes for sample s and samples d1 d5 is compared in fig 4 it can be seen that the t2 spectrum of sample s see fig 4 a is a unimodal distribution whereas the t2 spectrum of samples d1 d5 see fig 4 b f shows a bimodal distribution this difference between samples s and d1 d5 can be attributed to the different distribution of the pore space it should be mentioned that the t2 relaxation time is proportional to the pore space when the pore is saturated the distribution of the pore space in sample s is determined by the matrix and is concentrated in a relatively narrow range whereas the distribution of the pore space in samples d1 d5 are determined by both the matrix and the glass beads since there is a multi scale pore system between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture in samples d1 d5 the t2 spectrum of samples d1 d5 are bimodal while the t2 spectrum of sample s is unimodal this result also indicates that the samples d1 d5 is not only a dual porosity media but also has two different distributions of pore space between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture furthermore it is found that as the range of the particle size of the glass beads increases from 0 071 to 0 090 mm to 0 500 0 710 mm the peak of t2 spectrum varies from about 100 ms to 800 ms for samples d1 d5 this variation in the peak of the t2 spectrum is caused by the increasing particle size of the glass beads based on the multi scale pore system and the resulting distinct t2 spectrum in samples d1 d5 we can quantitatively distinguish the distribution of the imbibed water from the matrix and glass bead filled fracture here we introduced a t2 cut off method to identify the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix or the glass bead filled fracture to determine the cut off value of the t2 spectrum in the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture the referencing sample s was saturated then the t2 spectrum of the saturated sample s was measured using lf nmr it should be noted that the sample s has the same matrix as samples d1 d5 but the fracture is not filled with the glass beads comparing the saturated t2 spectrum in samples s and d1 d5 in fig 5 we find that the t2 distributions in both samples s and d1 d5 almost overlap when t2 is less than 16 ms since the t2 distribution in sample s only reflects the water distribution in the matrix the overlapping t2 distribution in samples d1 d5 can be derived as a t2 spectrum from the water distribution in the same matrix it is also evident from fig 5 that t2 does not overlap for more than 16 ms and varies with samples d1 d5 this can be attributed to the water distributions in the different glass bead filled fracture in samples d1 d5 it should be mentioned that the integrated area of the t2 spectrum of less than 16 ms is more than 95 of the total area of the t2 spectrum in sample s the t2 spectrum of more than 16 ms occupies the rest 5 of the t2 spectrum area because of the relatively large pore space in sample s thus in this study t2 cutoff value was determined as 16 ms since the rest 5 in the total area of the t2 spectrum area was trivial this means that t2 spectrum at t2 16 ms is contributed by water in the matrix while at t2 16 ms is related to the water in the glass bead filled fracture once the t2 cutoff value was determined it was possible to distinguish the dynamic distribution of the imbibed water from the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture recalling the t2 spectrum in fig 4 the water saturation of the matrix e g the rate of matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 during the si process can be easily determined from fig 6 although the matrix is the same in samples s and d1 d5 the rate of matrix imbibition is inconsistent between the single porosity media and the dual porosity media as can be seen in fig 6 the rate of matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 is much greater than in sample s until the imbibed water saturates the matrix in samples d1 d5 the imbibed water saturates the matrix after 120 min while the matrix in sample s is saturated after 640 min this accelerated rate of the matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 can be attributed to the presence of the glass bead filled fractures since the filled fractures increase the contact area between the matrix and the water therefore we could confirm that the matrix imbibition in the dual porosity media was enhanced by the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture moreover the water saturation of the matrix in samples d1 d5 is different at the same time indicating that the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture depends on the particle sizes of the glass bead filled in fracture 3 2 inconsistent imbibition rate and the division of imbibition stages to quantitatively analyze the inconsistent rate of matrix imbibition and divide different imbibition stages in the si process there are two assumptions to simplify the problem first it is assumed that the water is imbibed into the matrix in a piston like manner second the pressure gradient in the gas phase is neglected therefore the handy model handy 1960 can be used to describe the imbibition process in the matrix based on the above assumptions 4 q w 2 2 p c k w s w œï a 2 Œº w t where q w is the volume of the imbibed water in the matrix t is the imbibition time Œº w is the viscosity of water p c is the capillary pressure at the wetting front k w is the effective hydraulic conductivity œï is the porosity of the medium and a is the contact area between matrix and water for sample s the contact area a equals to the bottom area of the sandstone core a0 e g a a0 while for samples d1 d5 the contact area a equals to the sum of bottom area a0 and the fracture contact area at e g a a0 at it should be noted that the fracture contact area at increases with time t at the beginning of the si process furthermore considering that the parameters Œº w œï p c s w and k w are constant for samples s and d1 d5 the handy model can be reduced to 5 q w a d t 1 2 k t 1 2 where k is the ratio of matrix imbibition volume q w to square root of imbibition time t 1 2 which can be used as a measure of the imbibition rate and d represents the absorptivity of the sandstone matrix and is a constant for samples s and d1 d5 which can be derived by 6 d 2 p c k w s w œï Œº w according to the handy model form eq 5 it can be inferred that the volume of the imbibed water in the matrix q w should be proportional to the square root of the imbibition time t 1 2 the measured relationship between q w and t 1 2 during the si experiments are shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a the measured q w in the early time stage of the si process generally follows the proportional relationship with t 1 2 which is consistent with the handy model from eq 5 in fig 7 a it was also found that the slope of the fitted line k for sample s was smaller than k for samples d1 d5 indicating that the rate of matrix imbibition was not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but was also sensitive to the particle sizes of the glass beads filled in the fracture from the perspective of mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture the smaller k for sample s can be attributed to the smaller contact area a a0 while the larger k for samples d1 d5 is caused by larger contact area a a0 at where at was dynamically increased due to the rapid imbibition of the filled fracture during the si process based on the relationship between q w and t 1 2 throughout the si process in fig 7 b the characteristics of the measured matrix imbibition can be divided into three stages as follows i early stage stage 1 in this stage the influence of gravity can be neglected and the si process can be characterized by the handy model eq 5 thus q w is linearly correlated with t 1 2 at this stage and the imbibition rate of sample s is smaller than the imbibition rate of samples d1 d5 due to the smaller matrix water contact area a ii middle stage stage 2 in this stage the volume of the imbibed water continues to increase and the influence of gravity becomes more evident under the influence of gravity the imbibition rate gradually decreases and consequently the slope of the q w t 1 2 curve also decreases iii late stage stage 3 in this stage the imbibition rate is close to zero and the volume of the imbibed water hardly increases as the medium gradually becomes saturated with the imbibed water 3 3 influence of particle size of glass bead on the imbibition rate of the matrix since the rate of matrix imbibition is not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but also depends on the particle sizes of the glass bead filled in the fracture a dimensionless imbibition rate ratio k r is introduced to evaluate the influence of the particle sizes of the glass beads on the rate of matrix imbibition the k r is defined by 7 k r k d k s where k d is the overall slope of q w t 1 2 curve in the early stage of the si in the dual porosity media samples d1 d5 and k s is the overall slope of q w t 1 2 curve in the early time stage of the si in the single porosity medium sample s the calculated k r at the early time stage of the si process were listed in table 2 table 2 showed that all calculated k r for samples d1 d5 were greater than 1 0 indicating that on the one hand the presence of a filled fracture significantly enhanced the si process of dual porosity medium on the other hand a clear non monotonic relationship was found between k r and the particle size of the glass beads as shown in table 2 as the particle size of the glass beads increased from 0 071 0 090 mm to 0 500 0 710 mm k r first increased from 2 11 to 2 82 and then decreased to 2 12 this non monotonic dependence of k r on the particle size of the glass beads suggests that a potentially optimum particle size of the glass beads could most effectively enhance the rate of matrix imbibition which was originally limited due to low permeability and porosity 3 4 analytical model for mechanism of enhanced rate of matrix imbibition the si process was analyzed in terms of eq 5 for a dual porosity porous medium for understanding the mechanism of the enhanced rate of matrix imbibition as mentioned above for the case of a dual porosity medium the contact area a in eq 5 consists of two components e g the bottom area a0 and the fracture contact area at during the si process the bottom area a0 is a constant and does not change with time while the fracture contact area at increases with time and is closely correlated with the imbibition height in the fracture in the early time stage of the si process see fig 3 thus considering the filled fracture as a bundle of capillary tubes the si process in the filled facture can be described by the lw law 8 h Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ 4 Œº w t 1 2 t t max h max t t max where h is the imbibition height t is the imbibition time Œª is the equivalent diameter of the capillary tubes œÉ is the surface tension of water Œ∏ is the contact angle for water and glass beads h max is the maximum height of the capillary imbibed water and t max is the time when the height of the capillary imbibed water reaches h max the h max and t max can be calculated by 9 h max 4 œÉ cos Œ∏ Œª œÅ g t max 4 Œº w h max 2 Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ according to previous studies czachor 2006 li et al 2015 when the particle size of the glass beads is between 0 045 and 0 500 mm the contact angle between water and glass beads is between 75 2 and 80 3 e g 0 99985 0 cos Œ∏ 99987 thus in this study the value of cos Œ∏ is set as 0 99986 in the following calculations based on eq 8 the fracture contact area a t can be determined by 10 a t œÄ d 0 h œÄ d 0 Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ 4 Œº w t 1 2 t t max œÄ d 0 h max t t max where d0 is the diameter of the cylindrical fracture considering that is determined by the structure of the fracture m increases with the fracture diameter d0 and the equivalent capillary diameter Œª and does not change with time t eq 10 can be simplified as follows 12 a t m t 1 2 t t max œÄ d 0 h max t t max substituting eqs 11 and 12 into lw law yields 13 q w d a 0 t 1 2 dmt 2 t t max d a 0 œÄ d 0 h max t 1 2 dm t max 2 t t max the proposed eq 13 analytically indicates that if the matrix properties a0 and d are considered as constants the relationship between q w and t 1 2 in a dual porosity porous medium is determined by the structure of the fractures more especially when t t max the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is controlled by m when t t max the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is determined by both hmax and tmax in this study all parameters m hmax and tmax are controlled by the equivalent capillary diameter Œª of the filled glass beads thus the relationship between q w and t 1 2 in a dual porosity medium can be predicted using eq 13 the comparison of the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted q w t 1 2 relationships are shown in fig 8 and the parameters used for the theoretical prediction are listed in table 3 it should be mentioned that the hmax in eq 13 are reduced by a reduction factor of 0 54 to represent the influence of gravity on the maximum capillary imbibition height from fig 8 it can be seen that the slope between q w and t 1 2 is not a constant even for a given dual porosity porous media this change of q w t 1 2 relationship with time can be attributed to the change in the fracture contact area a t when t t max a t increases linearly with t 1 2 while t t max a t remains a constant i e a t œÄ d 0 h max when t t max since q w is linearly correlated with a t t 1 2 it can be concluded that the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is a quadratic relationship when t t max while t t max q w follows a linear function of t 1 2 it can also be found from fig 8 and table 3 that as the equivalent capillary diameter Œª increases from 0 0181 to 0 1361 mm the overall slope kr between q w and t 1 2 initially increases and then decreases with Œª an increasing kr between q w and t 1 2 indicates the increasingly promoting influence of the filled fracture on the matrix imbibition with increasing Œª while a decreasing kr between q w and t 1 2 indicates decreasingly promoting influence of the filled fracture when Œª becomes too large thus it can be inferred that there is an optimum Œª that most strongly enhances the matrix imbibition for a given imbibition time t the partial derivative of q w with respect to Œª is q w Œª œÄ d d 0 t 4 œÉ cos Œ∏ Œº w Œª 1 2 Œª Œª t œÄ d d 0 œÉ c o s Œ∏ t 1 2 œÅ g Œª 7 2 5 Œª t 3 2 4 Œª 3 2 Œª Œª t where 15 Œª t 4 œÉ Œº w cos Œ∏ œÅ 2 g 2 t 1 3 Œª t is the equivalent capillary diameter under which the capillary imbibition height in the fracture reaches its maximum height h max just at time t from eq 14 when Œª Œª t q w Œª is always greater than zero which means that the imbibition volume increases with Œª and when Œª Œª t q w Œª is first larger and then smaller than zero which means that q w first increases with Œª and then decreases combining the two intervals in eq 14 the critical Œª for the specified imbibition time t can be calculated as 5 4 2 3 Œª t 1 16 Œª t this means that when Œª 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume increases with Œª while Œª 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume decreases with Œª when Œª approaches the optimum value of 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume reaches its maximum value at time t which means that the filled fracture enhances matrix imbibition most significantly at the Œª of 1 16 Œª t according to eq 15 Œª t in the early time stage of the si process i e t 84 s equals to 0 0799 mm thus the optimum equivalent capillary diameter Œª o which has the best promoting influence should be 0 0926 mm from table 3 it can be seen that Œª o 0 0926 is between the Œª of samples d3 and d4 which explains why samples d3 and d4 have a better promoting influence on matrix imbibition than the other samples 4 conclusions in this study the si process was investigated experimentally and theoretically in a dual porosity medium consisting of the matrix and the filled fracture the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix and the filled fracture during the si experiments was quantitatively distinguished using a lf nmr based cut off method an analytical model was proposed to characterize the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture the main conclusions are as follows 1 lf nmr technology is capable not only of dynamically monitoring the distribution of the imbibed water in both dual porosity and single porosity media but also of quantitatively distinguishing the imbibed water from the matrix and the filled fracture the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture during the si process was confirmed from the lf nmr measurements 2 the rate of matrix imbibition was greater in the dual porosity media than in the single porosity media the enhanced rate of matrix imbibition was not only influenced by the presence of the filled fractures but also depended on the size of the particles filled in the fracture a clear non monotonic relationship was found between the rate of matrix imbibition and the size of the particles filled in the fracture the rate of matrix imbibition initially increased and then decreased as the size of the particles filled in the fracture increased 3 the proposed model showed the non monotonic dependence of k r on the particle size of the glass bead it was also found that the promoting influence of the filled fractures on the matrix imbibition first increased and then decreased with increasing size of glass beads the promoting influence of the filled fractures on matrix imbibition is closely correlated with the optimal equivalent capillary diameter Œª o the predicted Œª o was equal to 0 0926 mm which is between the Œª of samples d3 and d4 although the proposed analytical model was able to characterize the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture it should be mentioned that the current analytical model was developed without the influence of gravity and at the early stage of the si process where a piston like displacement was assumed future work on the analytical model should take into account the influence of gravity and the complex displacement process during the different stages of the si process credit authorship contribution statement zhi dou

3556,spontaneous imbibition si of wetting fluids is an important process for many hydrological and geological applications in this study we investigated experimentally and theoretically the si process in a dual porosity medium consisting of the matrix and the filled fracture low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology was used to dynamically monitor the distribution of the imbibed water in the dual porosity media during the si experiments based on the lf nmr theory a cut off method was proposed to quantitatively distinguish the imbibed water from the matrix and the filled fracture the results showed that the rate of matrix imbibition was greater in the dual porosity media than in single porosity media this inconsistent rate of matrix imbibition between the single porosity media

and the filled fracture but was also able to determine the optimum equivalent capillary diameter of the filled particles in the fracture for enhanced rate of matrix imbibition in dual porosity media keywords spontaneous imbibition lf nmr dual porosity media mass transfer fracture unsaturated porous media 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition si is the spontaneous entry of a wetting fluid into a porous medium driven only by capillary forces displacing a pre existing nonwetting fluid as a fundamental mass transfer process the importance of si mechanism has long been recognized in many hydrological and geotechnical applications such as sequestration of carbon dioxide lyu et al 2020 plug and bruining 2007 prather et al 2016 oil and gas extraction gao and hu 2016 standnes 2010 zhou et al 2016 and the protection of groundwater resources jim√©nez mart√≠nez et al 2020 in the early time stage the si process is capillary dominated and the influence of gravity could be neglected due to the insignificant amount of imbibed water however due to the ubiquitous heterogeneity of geologic formations zhao et al 2020 the early time si process is complex and still less well understood in fractured porous media especially in dual porosity media i e with both matrix and filled fracture in a typical fractured medium consisting of fracture and matrix the fracture aperture is generally larger than the mean pore size of the matrix even for a filled fracture as a result a wetting fluid invades a fracture much faster than the matrix in early time while the ultimate imbibition height is usually less in a fracture than in the surrounding matrix this inconsistent imbibition rate between the matrix and the fracture contributed to dispersion of solutes in the vadose zone cheng et al 2015 schmid et al 2011 provided a potential migration pathway for groundwater contaminants in aquifer aquitard system and fractured media dou et al 2013 navarre sitchler et al 2015 and affected the enhanced oil recovery from fractured reservoirs in recent decades extensive studies involving both experimental and theoretical methods have been applied to investigate the behavior of si and have shown that the imbibition rate as a metric of characterizing the mass transfer during the si process is related to pore structure fluid properties initial water saturation boundary conditions and mineralization cai et al 2020 gao and hu 2016 lyu et al 2019 morrow and mason 2001 thus the inconsistent imbibition rate in the fractured media depends strongly on the dynamics of capillary uptake at different stages of the si process on the one hand and is sensitive to differences in pore structure between the matrix and the fracture on the other consequently the wetting front moves laterally from the fracture into the matrix at the late time stage of si process in fact the wetting front may spread laterally from the fracture into the matrix at the early time because of the inconsistent imbibition rate throughout the entire si process however little attention has been paid to the mass transfer behavior between the matrix and the fracture at the early time stage of si process quantitatively distinguishing the origin of the imbibed water from the matrix and the fracture is critical for characterizing the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture in recent years many advanced technologies have improved the experimental capabilities for analyzing the si process such as neutron radiographic techniques cheng et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 ct scanning techniques akin and kovscek 1999 alyafei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 low field nuclear magnetic resonance technique lf nmr lyu et al 2019 meng et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 due to its rapid non invasive and quantitative advantages lf nmr has won worldwide recognition and demonstrated a reliable ability to quantitatively characterize pore structure and seepage behavior for the si process lf nmr can be used to distinguish the amount of water imbibed in pores of different sizes and it is capable of characterizing the type of water content chen et al 2021 meng et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 since the si process and mass transfer between the matrix and the fracture strongly depend on the multi scale pore system and complex pore structure in this study the si experiment was conducted in a dual porosity media with a porous matrix and a filled fracture based on the lf nmr many advanced mathematical models have been proposed to analyze and characterize the si mechanism pioneering models for the si process includes the handy model handy 1960 the lucas washburn lw model washburn 1921 and the aronofsky model aronofsky et al 1958 in the past decades these pioneering models for a multi scale pore system have been improved and incorporated a shape factor to account for different pore sizes and shape effects cai et al 2017 hinds and mortensen 2005 maier et al 2013 miao et al 2015 nonweiler et al 1975 spooner et al 2021 cai and yu 2011 derived an analytical model based on the lw model to consider the effect of tortuosity on capillary imbibition in wet porous media in terms of the fractal dimension for tortuous capillaries after that based on the hagen poiseuille and laplace young equations cai et al 2014 proposed a generalized spontaneous imbibition model with variably shaped pores to account for the effects of tortuous capillaries and noncircular cross sectional shapes for the si process in a horizontally multi layered porous medium ashraf and phirani 2019b developed a generalized lubrication approximation model to predict the wetting front based on the washburn model and they found that the wetting front was not always in the fine pores and depended strongly on the contrasts in the permeability and capillary pressure this result is consistent with their previous findings and assumptions ashraf and phirani 2019a ashraf et al 2017 li et al 2016 established a multiple fractal model for estimating the permeability of dual porosity media embedded with randomly distributed fractures the validity of the fractal aperture distribution was verified by comparing with the in situ measurement results reported in literature the above studies were interpreted qualitatively or quantitatively in terms of the dynamics of capillary uptake for the si process however the fractured porous media with the matrix and the filled fracture as a typical geologic formation have a multi scale pore system and the understanding of the si and the corresponding mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture is still limited this study focuses on the mass transfer phenomena of the imbibed water between the matrix and the filled fracture during the si process the main objectives of this study were to i investigate the si process in both dual porosity and single porosity media based on the lf nmr technology and ii highlight the mechanism of mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture in a dual porosity medium for this purpose the si experiments were performed for yellow sandstone cores with and without the glass beads filled fracture the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix and the filled fracture was quantitatively distinguished by the lf nmr measurement the influence of the particle size of the glass beads on the rate of matrix imbibition was discussed an analytical model was proposed to analyze the mechanism of enhanced matrix imbibition by the filled fracture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials since yellow sandstone is widespread in nature and is a typical reservoir rock in this study yellow sandstone cores were selected as matrix in dual porosity media for the si experiment the sandstone cores were cylinders with a diameter of about 2 4 cm and a length of about 5 9 cm some of the cores were drilled a hole in the middle to mimic the fracture in the matrix i e sample s in fig 1 b and to further structure a matrix filled fracture system the hole in the core was filled with glass beads and under this condition the core sample are considered as a dual porosity medium e g sample d1 in fig 1c the main component of glass beads is silica which shows no signal in the nmr test therefore the composition and content of glass beads do not affect the experimental results and when used as fracture filler the glass beads are loose enough to be well distinguished from the yellow sandstone in the matrix in this study five different sizes of glass beads with the same mass were uniformly packed into the hole of sample s to ensure consistency of porosity as shown in table 1 the porosity of the matrix in all samples was 12 24 the particle size of the filled glass beads varied significantly between samples d1 d5 while the porosity of the glass bead filled fracture of all samples was almost the same and was about 33 32 although the porosity in the glass bead filled fracture was only nearly three times that in the matrix of the yellow sandstone core the pore structure and connectivity between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix differed significantly due to the different formation patterns therefore the yellow sandstone with glass bead filled fracture could be considered as a matrix filled fracture system of dual porosity media for the si process the porosity of the matrix of all samples was determined based on the lf nmr measurement the porosity of the glass bead filled fracture of all samples was determined based on the dry unit weight of the filled glass beads which measured by the hydrometer method das 2019 in addition ultrapure water was used in all si experiments conducted at a room temperature of 25 c 2 2 experimental device and steps the lf nmr analyzer macromr12 150h i manufactured by the suzhou niumag co ltd china was used for lf nmr measurements of the samples during the si experiments the lf nmr analyzer has a magnetic induction intensity of 0 3 t and a constant magnet temperature of 32 c in addition the pressurized saturator hx ii was used to saturate the samples for the si experiment the mass of the samples was measured with the electronic balance with an accuracy of 10 4 g the oven hn101 2 was used to dry the samples at a temperature of 105 c first the samples were prepared the glass beads were dried at 105 in the oven for 24 h to evaporate the potential water and then weighed on the electronic balance the dry glass beads were packed into the holes reserved for the matrix of the sample s after that the sample was sealed with a nylon screen to avoid disturbing the filled glass beads second the si experiment was performed the prepared sample was placed in the imbibition apparatus the apparatus consists of stainless steel shallow square tray 300 mm 200 mm and a permeable stone both the shallow square tray and the permeable stone provide adequate hydraulic contact between the core bottom and the water in the tray as shown in figs 2 and 3 the prepared sample came into contact with water only at the bottom and was immersed in the water surface to a depth of 1 mm after 0 5 min 1 min 2 min 6 min 25 min 120 min 280 min 460 min and 640 min of imbibition the sandstone core samples were then passed over to lf nmr before lf nmr measurements the bottom of the samples was wiped with a damp cloth to prevent adhering water from interfering with the measurements in addition the samples were quickly wrapped with nmr insensitive transparent films to prevent evaporation of water during the lf nmr measurements after the measurements the sample was dried at 105 c until no water was present in the samples and then saturated in the pressurized saturator at a pressure of 10 mpa for 10 h the lf nmr measurements were performed on the saturated samples to measure the porosity and t2 spectrum 2 3 lf nmr measurement and principle in this study the standard carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used to measure the transverse relaxation time t2 during the lf nmr measurement this cpmg pulse sequence provided 200 data points in one echo acquisition time the number of echoes acquired by each cpmg sequence is 10 000 and the corresponding cpmg parameters are set as follows an echo spacing te of 0 15 ms a waiting time tw of 6000 ms an echo numbers of 2048 and the scanning numbers ns of 16 the nmr signal or magnetization m t from a fluid containing non zero spin state i e 1h nuclei that is bound in a porous medium is the convolution of all contribution volumes related to n pores the signal attenuation is characterized by a different t2 relaxation constant the m t can be described as follows connolly et al 2017 1 m t m 0 1 v 0 i n v i e t t 2 s where v 0 and v i denote the total volume of the sample and the contribution of the ith pore volume respectively m 0 is the equilibrium magnetization and t 2 i is the relaxation rate for the ith pore in this study the lf nmr measurement used the nmr transverse relaxation spectroscopy technique the typical nmr relaxation process includes bulk relaxation t2b surface relaxation t2s and diffusion relaxation t2d xu et al 2020 the t2 is controlled by these three different relaxations and can be expressed as follows 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 d the t2b is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity since the viscosity of water is low 1 t2b is small enough to be ignored xu et al 2020 t2s is the lateral relaxation time caused by surface relaxation and is inversely proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of liquids and the square of the echo spacing te bendel 1990 the 1 t2d is negligible when the te is small since the diffusion of water molecules is very fast consequently t2 is dominated by t2s and the eq 2 can be simplified as chen et al 2021 hun et al 2021 wang et al 2010 3 1 t 2 œÅ 2 s v pore œÅ 2 2 r where œÅ 2 is the surface relaxation ratio and r is the radius of the pore from eq 3 it can be seen that t2 is proportional to the pore radius which means that the larger the pore radius the stronger the nmr signal in fact the t2 distribution reflects the pore size distribution when the sample is saturated therefore in this study the water imbibed into the glass bead filled fracture or the matrix of the yellow sandstone can be easily distinguished during the si process because the distribution of the pore space between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix of the sample is significantly different with the resulting t2 distribution being different this provides a reliable non invasive method to study the mass transfer behavior between the glass bead filled fracture and the matrix of the sample during the si processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of the imbibed water in dual porosity media the t2 spectrum during si processes for sample s and samples d1 d5 is compared in fig 4 it can be seen that the t2 spectrum of sample s see fig 4 a is a unimodal distribution whereas the t2 spectrum of samples d1 d5 see fig 4 b f shows a bimodal distribution this difference between samples s and d1 d5 can be attributed to the different distribution of the pore space it should be mentioned that the t2 relaxation time is proportional to the pore space when the pore is saturated the distribution of the pore space in sample s is determined by the matrix and is concentrated in a relatively narrow range whereas the distribution of the pore space in samples d1 d5 are determined by both the matrix and the glass beads since there is a multi scale pore system between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture in samples d1 d5 the t2 spectrum of samples d1 d5 are bimodal while the t2 spectrum of sample s is unimodal this result also indicates that the samples d1 d5 is not only a dual porosity media but also has two different distributions of pore space between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture furthermore it is found that as the range of the particle size of the glass beads increases from 0 071 to 0 090 mm to 0 500 0 710 mm the peak of t2 spectrum varies from about 100 ms to 800 ms for samples d1 d5 this variation in the peak of the t2 spectrum is caused by the increasing particle size of the glass beads based on the multi scale pore system and the resulting distinct t2 spectrum in samples d1 d5 we can quantitatively distinguish the distribution of the imbibed water from the matrix and glass bead filled fracture here we introduced a t2 cut off method to identify the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix or the glass bead filled fracture to determine the cut off value of the t2 spectrum in the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture the referencing sample s was saturated then the t2 spectrum of the saturated sample s was measured using lf nmr it should be noted that the sample s has the same matrix as samples d1 d5 but the fracture is not filled with the glass beads comparing the saturated t2 spectrum in samples s and d1 d5 in fig 5 we find that the t2 distributions in both samples s and d1 d5 almost overlap when t2 is less than 16 ms since the t2 distribution in sample s only reflects the water distribution in the matrix the overlapping t2 distribution in samples d1 d5 can be derived as a t2 spectrum from the water distribution in the same matrix it is also evident from fig 5 that t2 does not overlap for more than 16 ms and varies with samples d1 d5 this can be attributed to the water distributions in the different glass bead filled fracture in samples d1 d5 it should be mentioned that the integrated area of the t2 spectrum of less than 16 ms is more than 95 of the total area of the t2 spectrum in sample s the t2 spectrum of more than 16 ms occupies the rest 5 of the t2 spectrum area because of the relatively large pore space in sample s thus in this study t2 cutoff value was determined as 16 ms since the rest 5 in the total area of the t2 spectrum area was trivial this means that t2 spectrum at t2 16 ms is contributed by water in the matrix while at t2 16 ms is related to the water in the glass bead filled fracture once the t2 cutoff value was determined it was possible to distinguish the dynamic distribution of the imbibed water from the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture recalling the t2 spectrum in fig 4 the water saturation of the matrix e g the rate of matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 during the si process can be easily determined from fig 6 although the matrix is the same in samples s and d1 d5 the rate of matrix imbibition is inconsistent between the single porosity media and the dual porosity media as can be seen in fig 6 the rate of matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 is much greater than in sample s until the imbibed water saturates the matrix in samples d1 d5 the imbibed water saturates the matrix after 120 min while the matrix in sample s is saturated after 640 min this accelerated rate of the matrix imbibition in samples d1 d5 can be attributed to the presence of the glass bead filled fractures since the filled fractures increase the contact area between the matrix and the water therefore we could confirm that the matrix imbibition in the dual porosity media was enhanced by the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture moreover the water saturation of the matrix in samples d1 d5 is different at the same time indicating that the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture depends on the particle sizes of the glass bead filled in fracture 3 2 inconsistent imbibition rate and the division of imbibition stages to quantitatively analyze the inconsistent rate of matrix imbibition and divide different imbibition stages in the si process there are two assumptions to simplify the problem first it is assumed that the water is imbibed into the matrix in a piston like manner second the pressure gradient in the gas phase is neglected therefore the handy model handy 1960 can be used to describe the imbibition process in the matrix based on the above assumptions 4 q w 2 2 p c k w s w œï a 2 Œº w t where q w is the volume of the imbibed water in the matrix t is the imbibition time Œº w is the viscosity of water p c is the capillary pressure at the wetting front k w is the effective hydraulic conductivity œï is the porosity of the medium and a is the contact area between matrix and water for sample s the contact area a equals to the bottom area of the sandstone core a0 e g a a0 while for samples d1 d5 the contact area a equals to the sum of bottom area a0 and the fracture contact area at e g a a0 at it should be noted that the fracture contact area at increases with time t at the beginning of the si process furthermore considering that the parameters Œº w œï p c s w and k w are constant for samples s and d1 d5 the handy model can be reduced to 5 q w a d t 1 2 k t 1 2 where k is the ratio of matrix imbibition volume q w to square root of imbibition time t 1 2 which can be used as a measure of the imbibition rate and d represents the absorptivity of the sandstone matrix and is a constant for samples s and d1 d5 which can be derived by 6 d 2 p c k w s w œï Œº w according to the handy model form eq 5 it can be inferred that the volume of the imbibed water in the matrix q w should be proportional to the square root of the imbibition time t 1 2 the measured relationship between q w and t 1 2 during the si experiments are shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a the measured q w in the early time stage of the si process generally follows the proportional relationship with t 1 2 which is consistent with the handy model from eq 5 in fig 7 a it was also found that the slope of the fitted line k for sample s was smaller than k for samples d1 d5 indicating that the rate of matrix imbibition was not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but was also sensitive to the particle sizes of the glass beads filled in the fracture from the perspective of mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture the smaller k for sample s can be attributed to the smaller contact area a a0 while the larger k for samples d1 d5 is caused by larger contact area a a0 at where at was dynamically increased due to the rapid imbibition of the filled fracture during the si process based on the relationship between q w and t 1 2 throughout the si process in fig 7 b the characteristics of the measured matrix imbibition can be divided into three stages as follows i early stage stage 1 in this stage the influence of gravity can be neglected and the si process can be characterized by the handy model eq 5 thus q w is linearly correlated with t 1 2 at this stage and the imbibition rate of sample s is smaller than the imbibition rate of samples d1 d5 due to the smaller matrix water contact area a ii middle stage stage 2 in this stage the volume of the imbibed water continues to increase and the influence of gravity becomes more evident under the influence of gravity the imbibition rate gradually decreases and consequently the slope of the q w t 1 2 curve also decreases iii late stage stage 3 in this stage the imbibition rate is close to zero and the volume of the imbibed water hardly increases as the medium gradually becomes saturated with the imbibed water 3 3 influence of particle size of glass bead on the imbibition rate of the matrix since the rate of matrix imbibition is not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but also depends on the particle sizes of the glass bead filled in the fracture a dimensionless imbibition rate ratio k r is introduced to evaluate the influence of the particle sizes of the glass beads on the rate of matrix imbibition the k r is defined by 7 k r k d k s where k d is the overall slope of q w t 1 2 curve in the early stage of the si in the dual porosity media samples d1 d5 and k s is the overall slope of q w t 1 2 curve in the early time stage of the si in the single porosity medium sample s the calculated k r at the early time stage of the si process were listed in table 2 table 2 showed that all calculated k r for samples d1 d5 were greater than 1 0 indicating that on the one hand the presence of a filled fracture significantly enhanced the si process of dual porosity medium on the other hand a clear non monotonic relationship was found between k r and the particle size of the glass beads as shown in table 2 as the particle size of the glass beads increased from 0 071 0 090 mm to 0 500 0 710 mm k r first increased from 2 11 to 2 82 and then decreased to 2 12 this non monotonic dependence of k r on the particle size of the glass beads suggests that a potentially optimum particle size of the glass beads could most effectively enhance the rate of matrix imbibition which was originally limited due to low permeability and porosity 3 4 analytical model for mechanism of enhanced rate of matrix imbibition the si process was analyzed in terms of eq 5 for a dual porosity porous medium for understanding the mechanism of the enhanced rate of matrix imbibition as mentioned above for the case of a dual porosity medium the contact area a in eq 5 consists of two components e g the bottom area a0 and the fracture contact area at during the si process the bottom area a0 is a constant and does not change with time while the fracture contact area at increases with time and is closely correlated with the imbibition height in the fracture in the early time stage of the si process see fig 3 thus considering the filled fracture as a bundle of capillary tubes the si process in the filled facture can be described by the lw law 8 h Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ 4 Œº w t 1 2 t t max h max t t max where h is the imbibition height t is the imbibition time Œª is the equivalent diameter of the capillary tubes œÉ is the surface tension of water Œ∏ is the contact angle for water and glass beads h max is the maximum height of the capillary imbibed water and t max is the time when the height of the capillary imbibed water reaches h max the h max and t max can be calculated by 9 h max 4 œÉ cos Œ∏ Œª œÅ g t max 4 Œº w h max 2 Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ according to previous studies czachor 2006 li et al 2015 when the particle size of the glass beads is between 0 045 and 0 500 mm the contact angle between water and glass beads is between 75 2 and 80 3 e g 0 99985 0 cos Œ∏ 99987 thus in this study the value of cos Œ∏ is set as 0 99986 in the following calculations based on eq 8 the fracture contact area a t can be determined by 10 a t œÄ d 0 h œÄ d 0 Œª œÉ cos Œ∏ 4 Œº w t 1 2 t t max œÄ d 0 h max t t max where d0 is the diameter of the cylindrical fracture considering that is determined by the structure of the fracture m increases with the fracture diameter d0 and the equivalent capillary diameter Œª and does not change with time t eq 10 can be simplified as follows 12 a t m t 1 2 t t max œÄ d 0 h max t t max substituting eqs 11 and 12 into lw law yields 13 q w d a 0 t 1 2 dmt 2 t t max d a 0 œÄ d 0 h max t 1 2 dm t max 2 t t max the proposed eq 13 analytically indicates that if the matrix properties a0 and d are considered as constants the relationship between q w and t 1 2 in a dual porosity porous medium is determined by the structure of the fractures more especially when t t max the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is controlled by m when t t max the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is determined by both hmax and tmax in this study all parameters m hmax and tmax are controlled by the equivalent capillary diameter Œª of the filled glass beads thus the relationship between q w and t 1 2 in a dual porosity medium can be predicted using eq 13 the comparison of the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted q w t 1 2 relationships are shown in fig 8 and the parameters used for the theoretical prediction are listed in table 3 it should be mentioned that the hmax in eq 13 are reduced by a reduction factor of 0 54 to represent the influence of gravity on the maximum capillary imbibition height from fig 8 it can be seen that the slope between q w and t 1 2 is not a constant even for a given dual porosity porous media this change of q w t 1 2 relationship with time can be attributed to the change in the fracture contact area a t when t t max a t increases linearly with t 1 2 while t t max a t remains a constant i e a t œÄ d 0 h max when t t max since q w is linearly correlated with a t t 1 2 it can be concluded that the relationship between q w and t 1 2 is a quadratic relationship when t t max while t t max q w follows a linear function of t 1 2 it can also be found from fig 8 and table 3 that as the equivalent capillary diameter Œª increases from 0 0181 to 0 1361 mm the overall slope kr between q w and t 1 2 initially increases and then decreases with Œª an increasing kr between q w and t 1 2 indicates the increasingly promoting influence of the filled fracture on the matrix imbibition with increasing Œª while a decreasing kr between q w and t 1 2 indicates decreasingly promoting influence of the filled fracture when Œª becomes too large thus it can be inferred that there is an optimum Œª that most strongly enhances the matrix imbibition for a given imbibition time t the partial derivative of q w with respect to Œª is q w Œª œÄ d d 0 t 4 œÉ cos Œ∏ Œº w Œª 1 2 Œª Œª t œÄ d d 0 œÉ c o s Œ∏ t 1 2 œÅ g Œª 7 2 5 Œª t 3 2 4 Œª 3 2 Œª Œª t where 15 Œª t 4 œÉ Œº w cos Œ∏ œÅ 2 g 2 t 1 3 Œª t is the equivalent capillary diameter under which the capillary imbibition height in the fracture reaches its maximum height h max just at time t from eq 14 when Œª Œª t q w Œª is always greater than zero which means that the imbibition volume increases with Œª and when Œª Œª t q w Œª is first larger and then smaller than zero which means that q w first increases with Œª and then decreases combining the two intervals in eq 14 the critical Œª for the specified imbibition time t can be calculated as 5 4 2 3 Œª t 1 16 Œª t this means that when Œª 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume increases with Œª while Œª 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume decreases with Œª when Œª approaches the optimum value of 1 16 Œª t the imbibition volume reaches its maximum value at time t which means that the filled fracture enhances matrix imbibition most significantly at the Œª of 1 16 Œª t according to eq 15 Œª t in the early time stage of the si process i e t 84 s equals to 0 0799 mm thus the optimum equivalent capillary diameter Œª o which has the best promoting influence should be 0 0926 mm from table 3 it can be seen that Œª o 0 0926 is between the Œª of samples d3 and d4 which explains why samples d3 and d4 have a better promoting influence on matrix imbibition than the other samples 4 conclusions in this study the si process was investigated experimentally and theoretically in a dual porosity medium consisting of the matrix and the filled fracture the distribution of the imbibed water in the matrix and the filled fracture during the si experiments was quantitatively distinguished using a lf nmr based cut off method an analytical model was proposed to characterize the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture the main conclusions are as follows 1 lf nmr technology is capable not only of dynamically monitoring the distribution of the imbibed water in both dual porosity and single porosity media but also of quantitatively distinguishing the imbibed water from the matrix and the filled fracture the mass transfer between the matrix and the glass bead filled fracture during the si process was confirmed from the lf nmr measurements 2 the rate of matrix imbibition was greater in the dual porosity media than in the single porosity media the enhanced rate of matrix imbibition was not only influenced by the presence of the filled fractures but also depended on the size of the particles filled in the fracture a clear non monotonic relationship was found between the rate of matrix imbibition and the size of the particles filled in the fracture the rate of matrix imbibition initially increased and then decreased as the size of the particles filled in the fracture increased 3 the proposed model showed the non monotonic dependence of k r on the particle size of the glass bead it was also found that the promoting influence of the filled fractures on the matrix imbibition first increased and then decreased with increasing size of glass beads the promoting influence of the filled fractures on matrix imbibition is closely correlated with the optimal equivalent capillary diameter Œª o the predicted Œª o was equal to 0 0926 mm which is between the Œª of samples d3 and d4 although the proposed analytical model was able to characterize the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture it should be mentioned that the current analytical model was developed without the influence of gravity and at the early stage of the si process where a piston like displacement was assumed future work on the analytical model should take into account the influence of gravity and the complex displacement process during the different stages of the si process credit authorship contribution statement zhi dou

3557,the large scale implementation of water market programs worldwide has increased attention while little research has paid attention to the water quality related incentive coordination in water markets through the case of the water market of the east route of china s south north water transfer project snwtp er this study adopts a differential game perspective to examine the role of coordination mechanisms in water markets critically by drawing on a large number of literature which conceptualizes the incentives of the water market as rooted in market environmentalism this study opens up the view on incentive compatible coordination in water markets by combining the numerical illustration of snwtp er this study finds that the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient keywords water quality incentive coordination water market market environmentalism south north water transfer project 1 introduction with the global population growth and economic development human demand for water resources proliferates making the contradiction between water supply and demand increasingly prominent fang et al 2014 using market mechanisms to manage water efficiently fairly and sustainably has become a feasible solution to alleviate this contradiction delorit and block 2018 ultimately the water market has become a pivotal strategy to address water scarcity rey et al 2019 in many world regions including the united states china australia and chile various water market plans for surface water and groundwater management have been proposed and or implemented in large numbers di et al 2020b leonard et al 2019 the large scale implementation of water market programs worldwide has increased attention while little research has paid attention to the water quality related incentive coordination in water markets more and more studies advocate using water markets to address environmental issues bakker 2014 iftekhar et al 2013 kuwayama and brozoviƒá 2013 for water markets to achieve their intended goals and limit unintended or negative consequences they need to rely on effective intergovernmental coordination garrick et al 2018 however it is generally found that water markets do not function as expected in the real world seidl et al 2020 water markets attempt to employ incentives to align individual behavior with the public goals of achieving reliable water quantity and quality and mitigating water related risks g√≥mez et al 2018 however water markets may face the risk of failure when private incentives conflict with water policy goals for example incentives to improve water efficiency in the australian water market have reduced environmental flows connor and kaczan 2013 only a few studies have specifically discussed incentive compatibility in water markets makridis 2013 rey et al 2019 however most studies did not consider coordinating the incentives to individuals in water markets to guide their behaviors and achieve incentive compatibility in addition current studies on water markets mainly focus on using market tools to optimize water allocation only a few studies have noticed water quality trading in water markets horan and shortle 2011 jamshidi et al 2014 consequently the understanding of how to coordinate water scarcity and water quality in water markets remains extremely limited furthermore criticism of water markets reflects the controversy surrounding market environmentalism in the water industry market environmentalism is a doctrine concerned with the synergy between environmental protection economic growth the market economy and neoliberal governance bernstein 2001 as it aims to achieve positive environmental outcomes by introducing markets and market derived institutions and organizations market environmentalism offers hope for a virtuous blend of economic growth efficiency and environmental protection bakker 2005 however the rapid growth of water market programs over the past few decades has also sparked controversy drawing on widespread criticism of state failures government failures in water management proponents of market environmentalism argue that water markets and private actors outperform governments creating a virtuous feedback loop between economic growth and water conservation bakker 2014 in contrast opponents point to the shortcomings of water markets market failures arguing that private actors especially those driven by profit will fail to protect water quality and may have negative long term impacts on the water environment bailey 2007 therefore providing incentive compatible economic tools in water markets to alleviate water scarcity and improve water quality becomes a crucial indicator for testing the effectiveness of market environmentalism this study constructs a differential game model of water markets that considers water quality to examine and compare the differences of individual behaviors under different contracts china s south north water transfer project snwtp provides an ideal case which connects china s four major river basins six provinces and hundreds of millions of water users barnett et al 2015 affecting almost one third of china s land zhang et al 2009 the case study of snwtp helps to understand in theory and practice how incentive coordination affects individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets the findings demonstrate that the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient empirically speaking by constructing one of the first surveys of the snwtp water market this study adds a limited study of water markets in the chinese context jiang et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 in addition this study also contributes new empirical analysis and evidence to the limited water market studies in the context of inter basin water transfer bhaduri and barbier 2011 p√©rez blanco et al 2020 theoretically speaking this study contributes to reviewing the literature on incentive mechanisms in water markets from the perspective of differential games di et al 2020a di et al 2020b studies on water markets have not followed suit in this regard although the incentives adopted in water markets have received much attention guo et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 there is no study on problematizing the complex relationship between water quality and incentives in water markets this study also applies to the broader literature on building an incentive compatible water market through incentive coordination garrick et al 2013 sheng and webber 2021 and improving water quality horan and shortle 2011 jamshidi et al 2014 finally the analysis of water markets in china s snwtp also contributes ammunition to the current debate on the effectiveness of market environmentalism in the water sector in response to criticisms of market environmentalism bakker 2005 bakker 2014 section 2 introduces

presents the conclusions 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area china s snwtp plans to transfer water from the yangtze river basin to the arid north of china through three routes from the east the middle and the west the first phase of the snwtp project currently in operation can provide 27 8 billion cubic meters of water annually from the yangtze river basin in southern china to the north china plain with a total line length of nearly 2900 km mwr 2002 the snwtp is the largest and most ambitious inter basin water transfer project in human history pohlner 2016 snwtp er mainly transfers water from jiangsu in the lower reaches of the yangtze river to the eastern part of the north china plain shandong peninsula and tianjin see fig 1 the first phase of snwtp er completed in december 2013 is mainly located in jiangsu and shandong chen et al 2013 water has become a tradable commodity in snwtp er two local state owned enterprises responsible for the construction and operation of snwtp in jiangsu and shandong provinces jiangsu water source company jwsc and shandong main canal company smcc were established in march 2005 and december 2004 respectively cco of snwtp 2004b cco of snwtp 2004c jwsc is responsible for constructing snwtp er in jiangsu and supplying water to shandong smcc is responsible for snwtp er s operation in shandong and supplies water to shandong s urban water companies and water users smcc signs a contract with jwsc every year to purchase water cco of snwtp 2004a for example the jwsc sold 674 million cubic meters of water to smcc from october 2020 to september 2021 mwr 2021 however snwtp er faces a severe threat of water pollution snwtp er passes through china s most economically developed yangtze river delta and bohai rim regions the booming manufacturing industry has made the water pollution in this area particularly prominent zhang 2009 in order to improve water quality china regards first controlling pollution then transferring water first environmental protection then using water as the goals of snwtp s water management state council 2014 for this reason at the beginning of snwtp s construction jiangsu adopted a series of pollution control measures to improve water quality according to the snwtp er pollution control plan including the construction of sewage treatment plants and the closure of some polluting enterprises state council 2003 2 2 differential game model of water markets considering water quality snwtp er water market includes jwsc as the water supplier and smcc as the water recipient in the continuous time t 0 jwsc supplies water to smcc at a price of w t and smcc sells water to terminal water users at a price of p t it is assumed that the water user will consider the price p t and quality q t of the water simultaneously when purchasing water jwsc as the water supplier can improve water quality by adopting various pollution control measures which can be measured by its pollution control effort e t in addition water quality is affected by cumulative water pollution that is water pollution accumulates over time therefore water quality is a dynamic process affected by pollution control efforts of the water supplier and previous water quality consequently the water quality q t at the t th time is a differential equation that changes with time 1 q t d q t dt e t Œ¥ q t where Œ¥ 0 represents the water pollution coefficient in the initial state q 0 q 0 0 represents the initial water quality and e 0 e 0 0 represents the initial pollution control effort with the increase in pollution control the water supplier needs to pay more for unit effort thus increasing the marginal water supply cost sheng and webber 2021 according to cvitanic et al 2008 it is assumed that the water supply cost of the water supplier caused by pollution control at the t th time is as follows 2 c t Œº 2 e t 2 where c t represents the water supply cost of the water supplier and Œº 0 represents the cost coefficient of pollution control the pollution control cost c of the water supplier is an increasing function of its effort e t that is dc t dq t 0 it suggests that the pollution control cost rises as the pollution control efforts increase due to the increasing marginal cost d2 c t d q t 2 0 g√ºrtler and g√ºrtler 2014 it is assumed that the unit supply cost of the water supplier is c 0 and the unit sales cost of the water recipient is 0 since the water consumption of water users is negatively correlated with water price and positively correlated with water quality the demand function of water is set as follows 3 d t d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t where d 0 represents the total social demand for water Œ± 0 and Œ≤ 0 represent the price and quality elasticity of water demand respectively since the water price is usually higher than the marginal cost of water supply p t c 0 the water demand at the marginal cost is greater than zero d Œ± c 0 0 3 individual strategies under different water market contracts this section will examine individual behaviors under the current contract the socially optimal contract and the incentive coordination contract the superscripts a b and c represent these three contracts respectively 3 1 current contract since pollution control efforts of the water supplier are a prerequisite for realizing the snwtp er water market under the current contract the water supplier has become the water market leader sheng and webber 2017 the position of leader gives the water supplier the priority to make decisions so that it can prioritize its pollution control effort and water transfer price to maximize profits the water recipient as a follower decides the final water price according to the strategy of the water supplier according to sheng and webber 2021 it is assumed that the information of both parties is symmetrical the assumption that the information of both parties in the water market is symmetrical and sufficient can rarely be satisfied in most cases nguyen et al 2013 however both the water supplier and the water receiver of snwtp er are state owned enterprises and are supervised by the ministry of water resources making information symmetry possible thus the water supplier can predict the follow up decision of the water recipient before making a decision the optimal strategy combination of the two parties is a stackelberg master slave game equilibrium the instantaneous profit functions of the water supplier and recipient at the t th time are as follows 4 œÄ s t w t c 0 d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t Œº 2 e t 2 and 5 œÄ r t p t w t d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t where œÄs t and œÄr t represent the instantaneous profits of the water supplier recipient respectively eq 4 shows that the profit of the water supplier is the revenue of the water supply after excluding the cost of pollution control since the water supplier can predict the follow up decision of the water recipient before making the decision the backward induction proposed by von stackelberg

incentive coordination contract to maximize the social profit and ensure that the profit under this contract is not less than the current contract it suggests that the water supplier negotiates with the water recipient to determine the water transfer price according to water demand consequently the water transfer price is a decreasing function of water demand 13 w t c 0 Œ∑ d t c 0 Œ∑ d Œ± p t Œ≤

pollution control investment to save costs due to owning absolute power to control the decision making behavior of the water supplier and recipient under the socially optimal contract the powerful government can force the water supplier to increase its pollution control efforts to maximize social welfare similarly the social profit under the current contract and the socially optimal contract can also be compared according to eqs 8 and 11 the following equation can be obtained 19 œÄ b œÄ a Œ± Œ¥ 2 Œº 2 Œ∏ Œ¥ d Œ± c 0 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ 2 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ 2 Œ≤ 2 2 Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 4 Œ∏ 2 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥

under the current contract is lower than that under the socially optimal contract œÄb œÄa it suggests that individuals seeking to maximize their profits endangers water quality in the long run and ultimately curbs the water demand of water users therefore the optimal pollution control effort and total profit under the current contract have not reached social optimality there does not exist a powerful government in the real world that can completely control the behavior of the water supplier and recipient therefore the socially optimal contract is only an ideal state that cannot be achieved in reality in order to improve the total social welfare to the optimal state it is necessary to improve the current contract by coordinating the incentives of the water supplier and recipient the goal of the incentive coordination contract is to maximize the total social welfare under the premise that the profits of the water supplier and recipient do not decline only when the profits of the water supplier and recipient under the incentive coordination contract are higher than those under the current contract that is œÄs c œÄs a and œÄr c œÄr a can individuals have the motivation to

examine further the behavior of the water supplier recipient under the incentive coordination contract and the current contract this study collects the water supply and drainage data of jiangsu province in 2017 from the china environmental statistics yearbook and finds that the pollution control cost in jiangsu province is 0 6239 yuan per cubic meter measured by the ratio of sewage treatment investment to sewage discharge thus the cost coefficient of pollution control Œº is set to 0 6239 similarly according to the china environmental statistics yearbook the water pollution coefficient Œ¥ of jiangsu province is 0 1569 measured by the ratio of wastewater discharged to total water resources according to ndrc 2014 the water supply cost in jiangsu province is 0 36 yuan per cubic meter therefore the unit water supply cost c 0 is set to 0 36 since shen and lin 2017 argued that the price elasticity of water demand in china is 0 1257 Œ± is set to 0 1257 in addition the quality elasticity of water demand is also often inelastic suggesting that water demand is still rigid even if water is polluted piper 2003 therefore the quality elasticity of water demand Œ≤ is set to 0 01 finally the total social demand for water d and discount rate Œ∏ are set to 1 and 0 1 by following sheng and webber 2021 respectively table 1 presents the numerical specifications according to table 1 and eqs 8 11 and 16 the equilibrium pollution control efforts and water quality under the three contracts can be obtained see fig 2 according to fig 2 the pollution control effort and water quality under the current contract are lower than those under the socially optimal and incentive coordination contracts the pollution control effort and water quality under the socially optimal and incentive coordination contracts are precisely the same this suggests that the water supplier and recipient can improve the pollution control efforts and water quality under the current contract to achieve social optimality through incentives coordination in addition according to table 1 and eq 19 the value interval of the coordination coefficient can be obtained Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 furthermore the profits of the water supplier and recipient and the social profit under the current contract and the incentive coordination contract can be obtained when Œ∑ takes the extreme value see fig 3 according to fig 3 the profits of the water supplier under the two contracts are the same when Œ∑ 0 9346 however the profit of the water recipient under the incentive coordination contract is higher than that under the current contract the results suggest that the water supplier and recipient can achieve pareto improvement by choosing the incentive coordination contract when the coordination coefficient takes the minimum value the profits of the water recipient under the two contracts are the same when Œ∑ 1 4112 however the profit of the water supplier under the incentive coordination contract is higher than that under the current contract similarly the results demonstrate that the water supplier and recipient can also achieve pareto improvement by choosing the incentive coordination contract when the coordination coefficient takes the maximum value finally regardless of the value of the coordination coefficient the social profit under the incentive coordination contract is always higher than that under the current contract next the impact of changes in the coordination coefficient on individual profits is examined since Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 fig 4 shows the trend of individual profits with the change of coordination coefficient according to fig 4 the profit of the water supplier rises with the increase of the coordination coefficient while the profit of the water recipient decreases however the individual profits under the incentive coordination contract are always not lower than those under the current contract as long as Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 it suggests that even in the absence of a powerful government individuals still have the motivation to participate in incentive coordination to achieve social optimality 4 3 sensitivity analysis to the elasticities this study adopts sensitivity analysis to investigate further the impact of the price and quality elasticities of water demand on pollution control efforts water quality individual and social profits under the incentive coordination contract since Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 Œ∑ is set to 1 in this sensitivity analysis both the price and quality elasticities of water demand affect the water demanded of water users thereby affecting individual profits therefore this study adopts Œ± 0 1257 as the benchmark and changes 50 in turn to examine the effect of the price elasticity of water demand on the equilibrium solution under the incentive coordination contract see fig 5 a similarly this study uses Œ≤ 0 01 as the benchmark and changes 50 in turn to examine the influence of the quality elasticity of water demand on the equilibrium solution see fig 5b according to fig 5a the pollution control effort and water quality decline as the price elasticity of water demand increases in addition the profit of the water recipient and social profit also decline while the profit of the water supplier rises the increase in price elasticity restrains the water demand of water users making the water recipient attempt to reduce the water price to maintain the original water sales volume according to eq 3 and fig 5a it can be obtained that Œ¥d p Œ¥Œ± Œ± Œ¥p Œ≤ Œ¥q 0 it suggests that the reduction in water demand caused by the increase in price elasticity exceeds the increment in water demand caused by the decrease in price ultimately leading to a decline in water demand since w c 0 Œ∑ d the water transfer price w will rise as Œ± increases this together with the drop in water demand and water price has led to a decline in the profit of the water recipient the restraining effect of rising price elasticity on water demand also reduces the expected profit of the water supplier thereby reducing its pollution control effort eventually water quality also declines the decrease in pollution control effort and the increase in the water transfer price have both promoted the increase in the profit of the water supplier according to fig 5b the pollution control effort and water quality rise as the quality elasticity of water demand increases the profit of the water recipient and social profit also rise while the profit of the water supplier declines the increase in quality elasticity reflects the increasing preference of water users for water quality which prompts the water supplier to make pollution control efforts to improve water quality increased quality elasticity increases water prices due to improved water quality curbing water demand however the increase in the preference of water users for water quality also improves the consumption of high quality water according to eq 3 and fig 5b it can be obtained that Œ¥d p Œ¥Œ± Œ≤ Œ¥q q Œ¥ Œ≤ 0 it suggests that it suggests that in water demand caused by the increase in quality elasticity exceeds the reduction in water demand caused by the increase in price ultimately leading to an increase in water demand the increase in quality elasticity leads to a decrease in water transfer price which improves the profit of the water recipient and reduces the profit of the water supplier 5 discussion this study constructs a differential game model of water markets that considers water quality it employs the case of china s snwtp er to describe the dynamic behavior of individuals under different water market contracts in this case incentive coordination has become an application of market environmentalism in water markets aiming to alleviate water scarcity contradictions and improve water quality through incentive coordination between the water supplier and recipient the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously individual and group rationality are the prerequisites for realizing incentive compatibility in water markets wu and whittington 2006 individual rationality implies that individual profit under the incentive coordination contract must be at least equal to the benefit of the unilateral act under the current contract moreover group rationality suggests that the total social welfare under the incentive coordination contract should not be lower than that under the current contract the findings confirm that the individual and social welfare under the incentive coordination contract are higher than those under the current contract and the water quality can also be improved this finding demonstrates that both individual and group rationality can be realized simultaneously under the incentive coordination contract therefore the coordination mechanism has become a technique that enables individuals to internalize the basic principles and logic of various pollution control measures sarmiento et al 2019 which seeks to shape various rationalities and institutions of human behavior soneryd and uggla 2015 with the help of the incentive techniques and practices mobilized by the coordination mechanism individuals have also realized the social benefits of improving water quality and enhancing social welfare in realizing personal benefits in this sense the incentive technique mobilized by the coordination mechanism has the potential to become an incentive compatible economic tool in water markets the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises opponents of market environmentalism argue that it adopts public resources for private interests which may worsen rather than address environmental issues bakker 2014 therefore water which is indispensable for life has become a human right in the discourse of opponents morgan 2004 thereby making state intervention a matter of course as the results demonstrated the prerequisite for achieving social optimality is a powerful government that can completely control individuals however such an omnipotent and powerful government in real water markets is just a utopian illusion due to not being immune to its inherent flaws wang et al 2020 after comparing water markets and related institutions in australia spain and the western united states garrick et al 2018 argued that the success of water markets often relied on powerful governmental coordination institutions while the territorial division of federal states posed severe challenges to cross jurisdictional operations of water markets fortunately the findings show that the incentive coordination contract can also achieve social optimality by mobilizing incentive compatible economic tools without powerful governmental coordination institutions it suggests that the coordination mechanism can not only improve individual benefits but also improve water quality and maximize social welfare therefore this coordination mechanism overcomes the existing water market s inability to optimize water quality and water allocation simultaneously although many aspects of water markets are still owned managed and supervised by the government duarte abad√≠a et al 2021 the coordination mechanism as an application of market environmentalism is still likely to create a virtuous feedback loop between economic growth and environmental protection this means that incentive compatible market environmentalism can also be a feasible solution to environmental crises this market environmentalism can be considered an expression of environmentality in water governance that prescribes a script of actions that specific actors can and should take in water governance nel 2015 the incentive coordination of water markets creates external incentive structures in which individuals understood as self interested rational actors can be motivated to behave appropriately by manipulating incentives fletcher 2010 designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient the findings demonstrate that although the coordination mechanism can achieve social optimality without a powerful government the design of this mechanism is still very challenging as presented the price and quality elasticity of water demand in water markets can affect water quality and personal profit however it is challenging to obtain reliable estimates of price and quality elasticity mainly because elasticity tends to show enormous heterogeneity across regions and sectors bruno and jessoe 2021 moreover the incentive compatible coordination mechanism also depends on the appropriate coordination coefficient the results showed that different coordination coefficients could lead to considerable differences in individual and social profits although it is full of challenges this does not mean that designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism lacks feasibility the differential game model constructed in this study provides an analytical framework for optimizing water market contracts which helps decision makers develop a feasible coordination mechanism therefore through rational and reasonable design individual behaviors can be combined with market mechanisms to encourage individuals to conduct cost benefit analysis to generate the desired behavior lloro bidart 2017 6 conclusion through the case of china s snwtp er this study critically examines the influence of incentive coordination on individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets from the perspective of the differential game in general the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient this study provides a new empirical explanation for the role of incentive coordination in water markets from the perspective of differential games through an in depth case study although more and more literature is critically examining incentives in water markets guo et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 there have been no studies to problematize the water quality effects of incentives so far the new insights in this study on adopting incentive coordination to improve water quality and social welfare may provide new contributions to the literature in this area as this study showed the incentive compatible coordination mechanism in snwtp er reflects the applicability of market environmentalism which may provide new ammunition for the debate in support of market environmentalism this finding echoes critics of market environmentalism who argue that private actors not only fail to protect resources but also negatively impact the environment macneil 2016 moreover this study also considers the impact of price and quality elasticities and coordination coefficients on individual pollution control behaviors and benefits contributing a heuristic investigation to the current study on the relationship between water markets and incentives finally the findings provide some new insights for developing water markets from the perspective of incentive coordination the case of china s snwtp er presented how incentive coordination affects individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets this study invites more case studies from other temporal and spatial contexts to verify the impact of incentive coordination on individual behavior in water markets these case studies may help clarify how incentive coordination as an application of market environmentalism can improve water quality and increase cross scale understanding of the role of incentive coordination in water markets the impact of incentive coordination on individual behavior is often rooted in the local socio economic contexts individual pollution control behaviors and benefits may vary when the scale alters therefore cross scale studies on the role of incentive coordination in water markets can significantly improve the understanding of the applicability of market environmentalism in addressing global environmental issues credit authorship contribution statement jichuan

3557,the large scale implementation of water market programs worldwide has increased attention while little research has paid attention to the water quality related incentive coordination in water markets through the case of the water market of the east route of china s south north water transfer project snwtp er this study adopts a differential game perspective to examine the role of coordination mechanisms in water markets critically by drawing on a large number of literature which conceptualizes the incentives of the water market as rooted in market environmentalism this study opens up the view on incentive compatible coordination in water markets by combining the numerical illustration of snwtp er this study finds that the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient keywords water quality incentive coordination water market market environmentalism south north water transfer project 1 introduction with the global population growth and economic development human demand for water resources proliferates making the contradiction between water supply and demand increasingly prominent fang et al 2014 using market mechanisms to manage water efficiently fairly and sustainably has become a feasible solution to alleviate this contradiction delorit and block 2018 ultimately the water market has become a pivotal strategy to address water scarcity rey et al 2019 in many world regions including the united states china australia and chile various water market plans for surface water and groundwater management have been proposed and or implemented in large numbers di et al 2020b leonard et al 2019 the large scale implementation of water market programs worldwide has increased attention while little research has paid attention to the water quality related incentive coordination in water markets more and more studies advocate using water markets to address environmental issues bakker 2014 iftekhar et al 2013 kuwayama and brozoviƒá 2013 for water markets to achieve their intended goals and limit unintended or negative consequences they need to rely on effective intergovernmental coordination garrick et al 2018 however it is generally found that water markets do not function as expected in the real world seidl et al 2020 water markets attempt to employ incentives to align individual behavior with the public goals of achieving reliable water quantity and quality and mitigating water related risks g√≥mez et al 2018 however water markets may face the risk of failure when private incentives conflict with water policy goals for example incentives to improve water efficiency in the australian water market have reduced environmental flows connor and kaczan 2013 only a few studies have specifically discussed incentive compatibility in water markets makridis 2013 rey et al 2019 however most studies did not consider coordinating the incentives to individuals in water markets to guide their behaviors and achieve incentive compatibility in addition current studies on water markets mainly focus on using market tools to optimize water allocation only a few studies have noticed water quality trading in water markets horan and shortle 2011 jamshidi et al 2014 consequently the understanding of how to coordinate water scarcity and water quality in water markets remains extremely limited furthermore criticism of water markets reflects the controversy surrounding market environmentalism in the water industry market environmentalism is a doctrine concerned with the synergy between environmental protection economic growth the market economy and neoliberal governance bernstein 2001 as it aims to achieve positive environmental outcomes by introducing markets and market derived institutions and organizations market environmentalism offers hope for a virtuous blend of economic growth efficiency and environmental protection bakker 2005 however the rapid growth of water market programs over the past few decades has also sparked controversy drawing on widespread criticism of state failures government failures in water management proponents of market environmentalism argue that water markets and private actors outperform governments creating a virtuous feedback loop between economic growth and water conservation bakker 2014 in contrast opponents point to the shortcomings of water markets market failures arguing that private actors especially those driven by profit will fail to protect water quality and may have negative long term impacts on the water environment bailey 2007 therefore providing incentive compatible economic tools in water markets to alleviate water scarcity and improve water quality becomes a crucial indicator for testing the effectiveness of market environmentalism this study constructs a differential game model of water markets that considers water quality to examine and compare the differences of individual behaviors under different contracts china s south north water transfer project snwtp provides an ideal case which connects china s four major river basins six provinces and hundreds of millions of water users barnett et al 2015 affecting almost one third of china s land zhang et al 2009 the case study of snwtp helps to understand in theory and practice how incentive coordination affects individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets the findings demonstrate that the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient empirically speaking by constructing one of the first surveys of the snwtp water market this study adds a limited study of water markets in the chinese context jiang et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 in addition this study also contributes new empirical analysis and evidence to the limited water market studies in the context of inter basin water transfer bhaduri and barbier 2011 p√©rez blanco et al 2020 theoretically speaking this study contributes to reviewing the literature on incentive mechanisms in water markets from the perspective of differential games di et al 2020a di et al 2020b studies on water markets have not followed suit in this regard although the incentives adopted in water markets have received much attention guo et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 there is no study on problematizing the complex relationship between water quality and incentives in water markets this study also applies to the broader literature on building an incentive compatible water market through incentive coordination garrick et al 2013 sheng and webber 2021 and improving water quality horan and shortle 2011 jamshidi et al 2014 finally the analysis of water markets in china s snwtp also contributes ammunition to the current debate on the effectiveness of market environmentalism in the water sector in response to criticisms of market environmentalism bakker 2005 bakker 2014 section 2 introduces the case of the east route of the snwtp snwtp er and proposes a differential game model of water markets that considers water quality based on this case section 3 describes the dynamic behavior of individuals under the three water market contracts section 4 compares the impact of these contracts on individual pollution control behaviors and benefits section 5 discusses the results and section 6 presents the conclusions 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area china s snwtp plans to transfer water from the yangtze river basin to the arid north of china through three routes from the east the middle and the west the first phase of the snwtp project currently in operation can provide 27 8 billion cubic meters of water annually from the yangtze river basin in southern china to the north china plain with a total line length of nearly 2900 km mwr 2002 the snwtp is the largest and most ambitious inter basin water transfer project in human history pohlner 2016 snwtp er mainly transfers water from jiangsu in the lower reaches of the yangtze river to the eastern part of the north china plain shandong peninsula and tianjin see fig 1 the first phase of snwtp er completed in december 2013 is mainly located in jiangsu and shandong chen et al 2013 water has become a tradable commodity in snwtp er two local state owned enterprises responsible for the construction and operation of snwtp in jiangsu and shandong provinces jiangsu water source company jwsc and shandong main canal company smcc were established in march 2005 and december 2004 respectively cco of snwtp 2004b cco of snwtp 2004c jwsc is responsible for constructing snwtp er in jiangsu and supplying water to shandong smcc is responsible for snwtp er s operation in shandong and supplies water to shandong s urban water companies and water users smcc signs a contract with jwsc every year to purchase water cco of snwtp 2004a for example the jwsc sold 674 million cubic meters of water to smcc from october 2020 to september 2021 mwr 2021 however snwtp er faces a severe threat of water pollution snwtp er passes through china s most economically developed yangtze river delta and bohai rim regions the booming manufacturing industry has made the water pollution in this area particularly prominent zhang 2009 in order to improve water quality china regards first controlling pollution then transferring water first environmental protection then using water as the goals of snwtp s water management state council 2014 for this reason at the beginning of snwtp s construction jiangsu adopted a series of pollution control measures to improve water quality according to the snwtp er pollution control plan including the construction of sewage treatment plants and the closure of some polluting enterprises state council 2003 2 2 differential game model of water markets considering water quality snwtp er water market includes jwsc as the water supplier and smcc as the water recipient in the continuous time t 0 jwsc supplies water to smcc at a price of w t and smcc sells water to terminal water users at a price of p t it is assumed that the water user will consider the price p t and quality q t of the water simultaneously when purchasing water jwsc as the water supplier can improve water quality by adopting various pollution control measures which can be measured by its pollution control effort e t in addition water quality is affected by cumulative water pollution that is water pollution accumulates over time therefore water quality is a dynamic process affected by pollution control efforts of the water supplier and previous water quality consequently the water quality q t at the t th time is a differential equation that changes with time 1 q t d q t dt e t Œ¥ q t where Œ¥ 0 represents the water pollution coefficient in the initial state q 0 q 0 0 represents the initial water quality and e 0 e 0 0 represents the initial pollution control effort with the increase in pollution control the water supplier needs to pay more for unit effort thus increasing the marginal water supply cost sheng and webber 2021 according to cvitanic et al 2008 it is assumed that the water supply cost of the water supplier caused by pollution control at the t th time is as follows 2 c t Œº 2 e t 2 where c t represents the water supply cost of the water supplier and Œº 0 represents the cost coefficient of pollution control the pollution control cost c of the water supplier is an increasing function of its effort e t that is dc t dq t 0 it suggests that the pollution control cost rises as the pollution control efforts increase due to the increasing marginal cost d2 c t d q t 2 0 g√ºrtler and g√ºrtler 2014 it is assumed that the unit supply cost of the water supplier is c 0 and the unit sales cost of the water recipient is 0 since the water consumption of water users is negatively correlated with water price and positively correlated with water quality the demand function of water is set as follows 3 d t d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t where d 0 represents the total social demand for water Œ± 0 and Œ≤ 0 represent the price and quality elasticity of water demand respectively since the water price is usually higher than the marginal cost of water supply p t c 0 the water demand at the marginal cost is greater than zero d Œ± c 0 0 3 individual strategies under different water market contracts this section will examine individual behaviors under the current contract the socially optimal contract and the incentive coordination contract the superscripts a b and c represent these three contracts respectively 3 1 current contract since pollution control efforts of the water supplier are a prerequisite for realizing the snwtp er water market under the current contract the water supplier has become the water market leader sheng and webber 2017 the position of leader gives the water supplier the priority to make decisions so that it can prioritize its pollution control effort and water transfer price to maximize profits the water recipient as a follower decides the final water price according to the strategy of the water supplier according to sheng and webber 2021 it is assumed that the information of both parties is symmetrical the assumption that the information of both parties in the water market is symmetrical and sufficient can rarely be satisfied in most cases nguyen et al 2013 however both the water supplier and the water receiver of snwtp er are state owned enterprises and are supervised by the ministry of water resources making information symmetry possible thus the water supplier can predict the follow up decision of the water recipient before making a decision the optimal strategy combination of the two parties is a stackelberg master slave game equilibrium the instantaneous profit functions of the water supplier and recipient at the t th time are as follows 4 œÄ s t w t c 0 d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t Œº 2 e t 2 and 5 œÄ r t p t w t d Œ± p t Œ≤ q t where œÄs t and œÄr t represent the instantaneous profits of the water supplier recipient respectively eq 4 shows that the profit of the water supplier is the revenue of the water supply after excluding the cost of pollution control since the water supplier can predict the follow up decision of the water recipient before making the decision the backward induction proposed by von stackelberg 1934 can be used to solve the game model according to the backward induction the first order partial derivative of eq 5 is set to zero the following equation can be obtained 6 p t d Œ≤ q t Œ± w t 2 Œ± according to eq 6 p t q t 0 and p t w t 0 the goal of the water supplier is to find the optimal pollution control effort and water transfer price within a continuous time t 0 to maximize the discount

optimal contract it is assumed that a powerful government under the socially optimal contract can maximize the total social welfare by completely controlling the decision making behavior of the water supplier and recipient consequently the instantaneous total profit function of this powerful government is as follows 10 œÄ t d t p t c 0 c t where œÄ t represents the instantaneous total profit the goal of this powerful government under the socially optimal contract is to find the optimal water price and pollution control effort within a continuous time t 0 so as to maximize the present value of

represent the equilibrium water price water demand and social profit under the socially optimal contract 3 3 incentive coordination contract the water supplier and recipient cooperate under the incentive coordination contract to maximize the social profit and ensure that the profit under this contract is not less than the current contract it suggests that the water supplier negotiates with the water recipient to determine the water transfer price according to water demand consequently the water transfer price is a decreasing function of water demand 13 w t c 0 Œ∑ d t c 0 Œ∑ d Œ± p t Œ≤

Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ d Œ± c 0 2 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 2 4 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 2 since 2Œ±Œ¥Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 2 0 4Œ±Œ¥Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 2 0 and d Œ± c 0 0 the optimal pollution control effort under the current contract is lower

pollution control investment to save costs due to owning absolute power to control the decision making behavior of the water supplier and recipient under the socially optimal contract the powerful government can force the water supplier to increase its pollution control efforts to maximize social welfare similarly the social profit under the current contract and the socially optimal contract can also be compared according to eqs 8 and 11 the following equation can be obtained 19 œÄ b œÄ a Œ± Œ¥ 2 Œº 2 Œ∏ Œ¥ d Œ± c 0 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ 2 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥ 2 Œ≤ 2 2 Œ∏ Œ¥ Œ≤ 4 Œ∏ 2 Œ± Œ¥ Œº Œ∏ Œ¥

under the current contract is lower than that under the socially optimal contract œÄb œÄa it suggests that individuals seeking to maximize their profits endangers water quality in the long run and ultimately curbs the water demand of water users therefore the optimal pollution control effort and total profit under the current contract have not reached social optimality there does not exist a powerful government in the real world that can completely control the behavior of the water supplier and recipient therefore the socially optimal contract is only an ideal state that cannot be achieved in reality in order to improve the total social welfare to the optimal state it is necessary to improve the current contract by coordinating the incentives of the water supplier and recipient the goal of the incentive coordination contract is to maximize the total social welfare under the premise that the profits of the water supplier and recipient do not decline only when the profits of the water supplier and recipient under the incentive coordination contract are higher than those under the current contract that is œÄs c œÄs a and œÄr c œÄr a can individuals have the motivation to

examine further the behavior of the water supplier recipient under the incentive coordination contract and the current contract this study collects the water supply and drainage data of jiangsu province in 2017 from the china environmental statistics yearbook and finds that the pollution control cost in jiangsu province is 0 6239 yuan per cubic meter measured by the ratio of sewage treatment investment to sewage discharge thus the cost coefficient of pollution control Œº is set to 0 6239 similarly according to the china environmental statistics yearbook the water pollution coefficient Œ¥ of jiangsu province is 0 1569 measured by the ratio of wastewater discharged to total water resources according to ndrc 2014 the water supply cost in jiangsu province is 0 36 yuan per cubic meter therefore the unit water supply cost c 0 is set to 0 36 since shen and lin 2017 argued that the price elasticity of water demand in china is 0 1257 Œ± is set to 0 1257 in addition the quality elasticity of water demand is also often inelastic suggesting that water demand is still rigid even if water is polluted piper 2003 therefore the quality elasticity of water demand Œ≤ is set to 0 01 finally the total social demand for water d and discount rate Œ∏ are set to 1 and 0 1 by following sheng and webber 2021 respectively table 1 presents the numerical specifications according to table 1 and eqs 8 11 and 16 the equilibrium pollution control efforts and water quality under the three contracts can be obtained see fig 2 according to fig 2 the pollution control effort and water quality

coordination contracts are precisely the same this suggests that the water supplier and recipient can improve the pollution control efforts and water quality under the current contract to achieve social optimality through incentives coordination in addition according to table 1 and eq 19 the value interval of the coordination coefficient can be obtained Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 furthermore the profits of the water supplier and recipient and the social profit under the current contract and the incentive coordination contract can be obtained when Œ∑ takes the extreme value see fig 3 according to fig 3 the profits of the water supplier under the two contracts are the same when Œ∑ 0 9346 however the profit of the water recipient under the incentive coordination contract is higher than that under the current contract the results suggest that the water supplier and recipient can achieve pareto improvement by choosing the incentive coordination contract when the coordination coefficient takes the minimum value the profits of the water recipient under the two contracts are the same when Œ∑ 1 4112 however the profit of the water supplier under the incentive coordination contract is higher than that under the current contract similarly the results demonstrate that the water supplier and recipient can also achieve pareto improvement by choosing the incentive coordination contract when the coordination coefficient takes the maximum value finally regardless of the value of the coordination coefficient the social profit under the incentive coordination contract is always higher than that under the current contract next the impact of changes in the coordination coefficient on individual profits is examined since Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 fig 4 shows the trend of individual profits with the change of coordination coefficient according to fig 4 the profit of the water supplier rises with the increase of the coordination coefficient while the profit of the water recipient decreases however the individual profits under the incentive coordination contract are always not lower than those under the current contract as long as Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 it suggests that even in the absence of a powerful government individuals still have the motivation to participate in incentive coordination to achieve social optimality 4 3 sensitivity analysis to the elasticities this study adopts sensitivity analysis to investigate further the impact of the price and quality elasticities of water demand on pollution control efforts water quality individual and social profits under the incentive coordination contract since Œ∑ 0 9346 1 4112 Œ∑ is set to 1 in this sensitivity analysis both the price and quality elasticities of water demand affect the water demanded of water users thereby affecting individual profits therefore this study adopts Œ± 0 1257 as the benchmark and changes 50 in turn to examine the effect of the price elasticity of water demand on the equilibrium solution under the incentive coordination contract see fig 5 a similarly this study uses Œ≤ 0 01 as the benchmark and changes 50 in turn to examine the influence of the quality elasticity of water demand on the equilibrium solution see fig 5b according to fig 5a the pollution control effort and water quality decline as the price elasticity of water demand increases in addition the profit of the water recipient and social profit also decline while the profit of the water supplier rises the increase in price elasticity restrains the water demand of water users making the water recipient attempt to reduce the water price to maintain the original water sales volume according to eq 3 and fig 5a it can be obtained that Œ¥d p Œ¥Œ± Œ± Œ¥p Œ≤ Œ¥q 0 it suggests that the reduction in water demand caused by the increase in price elasticity exceeds the increment in water demand caused by the decrease in price ultimately leading to a decline in water demand since w c 0 Œ∑ d the water transfer price w will rise as Œ± increases this together with the drop in water demand and water price has led to a decline in the profit of the water recipient the restraining effect of rising price elasticity on water demand also reduces the expected profit of the water supplier thereby reducing its pollution control effort eventually water quality also declines the decrease in pollution control effort and the increase in the water transfer price have both promoted the increase in the profit of the water supplier according to fig 5b the pollution control effort and water quality rise as the quality elasticity of water demand increases the profit of the water recipient and social profit also rise while the profit of the water supplier declines the increase in quality elasticity reflects the increasing preference of water users for water quality which prompts the water supplier to make pollution control efforts to improve water quality increased quality elasticity increases water prices due to improved water quality curbing water demand however the increase in the preference of water users for water quality also improves the consumption of high quality water according to eq 3 and fig 5b it can be obtained that Œ¥d p Œ¥Œ± Œ≤ Œ¥q q Œ¥ Œ≤ 0 it suggests that it suggests that in water demand caused by the increase in quality elasticity exceeds the reduction in water demand caused by the increase in price ultimately leading to an increase in water demand the increase in quality elasticity leads to a decrease in water transfer price which improves the profit of the water recipient and reduces the profit of the water supplier 5 discussion this study constructs a differential game model of water markets that considers water quality it employs the case of china s snwtp er to describe the dynamic behavior of individuals under different water market contracts in this case incentive coordination has become an application of market environmentalism in water markets aiming to alleviate water scarcity contradictions and improve water quality through incentive coordination between the water supplier and recipient the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously individual and group rationality are the prerequisites for realizing incentive compatibility in water markets wu and whittington 2006 individual rationality implies that individual profit under the incentive coordination contract must be at least equal to the benefit of the unilateral act under the current contract moreover group rationality suggests that the total social welfare under the incentive coordination contract should not be lower than that under the current contract the findings confirm that the individual and social welfare under the incentive coordination contract are higher than those under the current contract and the water quality can also be improved this finding demonstrates that both individual and group rationality can be realized simultaneously under the incentive coordination contract therefore the coordination mechanism has become a technique that enables individuals to internalize the basic principles and logic of various pollution control measures sarmiento et al 2019 which seeks to shape various rationalities and institutions of human behavior soneryd and uggla 2015 with the help of the incentive techniques and practices mobilized by the coordination mechanism individuals have also realized the social benefits of improving water quality and enhancing social welfare in realizing personal benefits in this sense the incentive technique mobilized by the coordination mechanism has the potential to become an incentive compatible economic tool in water markets the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises opponents of market environmentalism argue that it adopts public resources for private interests which may worsen rather than address environmental issues bakker 2014 therefore water which is indispensable for life has become a human right in the discourse of opponents morgan 2004 thereby making state intervention a matter of course as the results demonstrated the prerequisite for achieving social optimality is a powerful government that can completely control individuals however such an omnipotent and powerful government in real water markets is just a utopian illusion due to not being immune to its inherent flaws wang et al 2020 after comparing water markets and related institutions in australia spain and the western united states garrick et al 2018 argued that the success of water markets often relied on powerful governmental coordination institutions while the territorial division of federal states posed severe challenges to cross jurisdictional operations of water markets fortunately the findings show that the incentive coordination contract can also achieve social optimality by mobilizing incentive compatible economic tools without powerful governmental coordination institutions it suggests that the coordination mechanism can not only improve individual benefits but also improve water quality and maximize social welfare therefore this coordination mechanism overcomes the existing water market s inability to optimize water quality and water allocation simultaneously although many aspects of water markets are still owned managed and supervised by the government duarte abad√≠a et al 2021 the coordination mechanism as an application of market environmentalism is still likely to create a virtuous feedback loop between economic growth and environmental protection this means that incentive compatible market environmentalism can also be a feasible solution to environmental crises this market environmentalism can be considered an expression of environmentality in water governance that prescribes a script of actions that specific actors can and should take in water governance nel 2015 the incentive coordination of water markets creates external incentive structures in which individuals understood as self interested rational actors can be motivated to behave appropriately by manipulating incentives fletcher 2010 designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient the findings demonstrate that although the coordination mechanism can achieve social optimality without a powerful government the design of this mechanism is still very challenging as presented the price and quality elasticity of water demand in water markets can affect water quality and personal profit however it is challenging to obtain reliable estimates of price and quality elasticity mainly because elasticity tends to show enormous heterogeneity across regions and sectors bruno and jessoe 2021 moreover the incentive compatible coordination mechanism also depends on the appropriate coordination coefficient the results showed that different coordination coefficients could lead to considerable differences in individual and social profits although it is full of challenges this does not mean that designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism lacks feasibility the differential game model constructed in this study provides an analytical framework for optimizing water market contracts which helps decision makers develop a feasible coordination mechanism therefore through rational and reasonable design individual behaviors can be combined with market mechanisms to encourage individuals to conduct cost benefit analysis to generate the desired behavior lloro bidart 2017 6 conclusion through the case of china s snwtp er this study critically examines the influence of incentive coordination on individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets from the perspective of the differential game in general the coordination mechanism can mobilize a series of incentive compatible coordination techniques and practices to achieve the optimal state of individuals and society simultaneously in addition the incentive compatible coordination mechanism overcomes current water markets inability to improve water quality and water allocation simultaneously reflecting that market environmentalism may be a feasible solution to environmental crises finally designing an incentive compatible coordination mechanism in water markets is still challenging the mechanism depends not only on the price and quality elasticity of water demand but also on finding the optimal coordination coefficient this study provides a new empirical explanation for the role of incentive coordination in water markets from the perspective of differential games through an in depth case study although more and more literature is critically examining incentives in water markets guo et al 2020 svensson et al 2021 there have been no studies to problematize the water quality effects of incentives so far the new insights in this study on adopting incentive coordination to improve water quality and social welfare may provide new contributions to the literature in this area as this study showed the incentive compatible coordination mechanism in snwtp er reflects the applicability of market environmentalism which may provide new ammunition for the debate in support of market environmentalism this finding echoes critics of market environmentalism who argue that private actors not only fail to protect resources but also negatively impact the environment macneil 2016 moreover this study also considers the impact of price and quality elasticities and coordination coefficients on individual pollution control behaviors and benefits contributing a heuristic investigation to the current study on the relationship between water markets and incentives finally the findings provide some new insights for developing water markets from the perspective of incentive coordination the case of china s snwtp er presented how incentive coordination affects individual pollution control behavior and optimal decision making in water markets this study invites more case studies from other temporal and spatial contexts to verify the impact of incentive coordination on individual behavior in water markets these case studies may help clarify how incentive coordination as an application of market environmentalism can improve water quality and increase cross scale understanding of the role of incentive coordination in water markets the impact of incentive coordination on individual behavior is often rooted in the local socio economic contexts individual pollution control behaviors and benefits may vary when the scale alters therefore cross scale studies on the role of incentive coordination in water markets can significantly improve the understanding of the applicability of market environmentalism in addressing global environmental issues credit authorship contribution statement jichuan

3558,in this study we have compared heat and solute transport in a discrete fracture using numerical modeling fracture aperture heterogeneity was described using geostatistical properties with fracture aperture means of up to 1000 Œºm variances of 10 000 ¬µm2 and isotropic correlation lengths up to 10 m groundwater flow in the matrix was assumed to be negligible and flow in the fracture was set to values typical for natural groundwater conditions with velocities less than 100 m day and associated hydraulic gradients of less than 0 05 a uniform isotropic thermal conductivity of 2 w m c was set for the matrix based on 50 realizations three dimensional and two dimensional conduction in the matrix and in the fracture respectively play an important role in controlling the development and the shape of the thermal plume under natural flow conditions in contrast solute transport exhibits limited penetration depth in the matrix the results of this research indicate that contrary to solute transport in discrete fracture settings where channeling is sometimes a major contributor to solute migration rates no significant thermal channeling is observed under natural groundwater flow conditions the use of tracer experiments or the monitoring of solute transport in fractured rock will not therefore provide a reliable prediction of the migration of heat in the same setting keywords fractured rock heat transfer solute transport conduction diffusion fracture aperture variability 1 introduction and objectives more than half a century has passed since the recognition of heat as a potential tracer for groundwater flow bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 stallman 1965 suzuki 1960 solute tracers have long been used to assess groundwater flow davis et al 1980 but real applications only started in the first half of the 20th century davis et al 1980 at the beginning of the 21st century heat and solute tracers were applied together in studies allowing for better assessment of the subsurface transport characteristics constantz et al 2005 pruess et al 2002 subsequently researchers utilized heat and solute tracers together for a variety of applications mainly focusing on porous media abrantes et al 2018 anderson 2005 constantz et al 2005 irvine et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 li 2018 ma et al 2012 pruess et al 2002 rau et al 2012 sarris et al 2018 taniguchi and sharma 1990 vandenbohede et al 2009 more recently both tracers were used simultaneously in assessing fractured media cherubini et al 2017 de la bernardie et al 2018 hawkins et al 2017 klepikova et al 2016 kocabas 2005 pastore et al 2015 read et al 2013 with applications including subsurface characterization hydraulic parameter assessment heat storage and transport mechanisms and remediation applications cherubini et al 2017 de la bernardie et al 2018 egan 2018 graf and therrien 2009 hawkins et al 2017 klepikova et al 2016 kocabas 2005 molson et al 2007 pastore et al 2015 pehme et al 2013 read et al 2013 wright and novakowski 2019 de la bernardie et al 2018 proposed that an instantaneous equilibrium between the rock matrix and the fluid in the fracture cannot be assumed primarily because of the very long times of conduction or heat exchange between the matrix and fluid they concluded along with others b√∂dvarsson and tsang 1982 cherubini et al 2017 gringarten et al 1975 kocabas 2005 lauwerier 1955 pastore et al 2015 tang et al 1981 that under the conditions they presented one dimensional 1 d conduction in the matrix is a reasonable assumption in the assessment and that longitudinal conduction does not play a significant role on thermal transport in the fracture similar to what has been proposed for solute transport cherubini et al 2017 and pastore et al 2015 conducted bench scale experiments and concluded that the behavior of heat transport is entirely different compared to mass transport at thermal fracture matrix peclet numbers less than one both studies assumed one dimensional 1 d conduction in the matrix other studies suggest that two dimensional 2 d conduction in the matrix in directions perpendicular and parallel to the fracture must be accounted for bou jaoude et al 2018 kolditz 1995 mart√≠nez et al 2014 yang 2016 bou jaoude et al 2018 in a numerical study noted that the migration of heat is primarily governed by the groundwater velocity in the fracture and the size of the fracture aperture as solute diffuses at a much slower rate it does not diffuse far into the matrix and therefore matrix diffusion of solute during transport can be reasonably approximated to be one dimensional chen 1985 using numerical simulations de la bernardie et al 2018 demonstrated that longitudinal conduction does not play a significant role in thermal transport in the fracture in the plane of the fracture the solute will have to travel around closed areas creating meandering of the solute while a heat tracer will travel through these closed areas through conduction parallel to the fracture orientation consequently conduction in the plane of the fracture will aid in smoothing the shape of the thermal front bou jaoude 2019 bou jaoude et al 2018 there is clearly a need to conduct a robust comparison between heat and solute tracers in a variable aperture discrete fracture setting under natural groundwater conditions where three dimensional 3 d matrix conduction and two dimensional 2 d conduction in the plane of the fracture are considered allowing for a better comparison between the spatial distribution of the thermal and solute plumes both advection in the fracture and conduction in the matrix control heat migration in a discrete fracture abdallah et al 1995 baston and kueper 2009 mart√≠nez et al 2014 conduction dominates the movement of heat transport when the underground system exhibits a very low permeability or when the aperture of the fracture is small bou jaoude et al 2018 saar 2011 dehkordi et al 2015 in a sensitivity assessment on the impact of a vertical closed loop on geothermal heat pump systems established that the increase in groundwater flow mainly above 10 7 m s can substantially reshape and dissipate the thermal plume they demonstrated that the thermal plume keeps growing indicating that accurate assessment of the subsurface properties including thermal conductivity of the matrix is essential flow channeling and fracture roughness may also be the cause of the differences between predictive heat models and field observations as documented by the efficiencies of geothermal systems and temperature breakthrough curves kolditz 1995 kolditz and clauser 1998 heat channeling was identified under high energy performance geothermal systems with high peclet numbers of approximately 10 000 and in some lower groundwater velocity cases with peclet numbers of approximately 200 andrade et al 2004 bagalkot and kumar 2015 chen et al 2018 fox et al 2015 guo et al 2016 klepikova et al 2016 klepikova et al 2014 ma et al 2018 neuville et al 2010a 2010b pandey et al 2017 zhou et al 2007 the channeling effect was also identified in laboratory investigations conducted in fractured rocks bai et al 2017 cherubini et al 2017 he et al 2016 luo et al 2018 zhao 2014 where peclet numbers are approximately one or less heat channeling disappeared this was attributed mainly to the effect of the closure points and conduction in the matrix bou jaoude et al 2018 de la bernardie et al 2018 used a push pull test and demonstrated that under a thermal fracture matrix system with peclet numbers between 2000 and 40 000 and for a fracture apertures ranging between 2 8 and 10 cm the assumption of a parallel plate fracture of homogeneous aperture for modeling both solute and thermal transport is invalidated this is similar to results obtained by klepikova et al 2016 under very similar conditions this unrealistic assumption is mainly due to flow channeling klepikova et al 2016 also concluded that the thermal signature could be characterized by a system of multiple channels that are parametrized by the mean channel density and diameter although channeling was identified in several studies e g bagalkot and kumar 2015 fox et al 2015 guo et al 2016 neuville et al 2010b they did not address the effect of contact points in the aperture fields as their generated apertures lacked them solute transport in discretely fractured media is reasonably understood and has been extensively studied becker and shapiro 2000 berkowitz 2002 bradbury and muldoon 1992 cady et al 1993 chen et al 2017 dorn

and explores flow pathways one of the main inherent complexities of natural discrete fractures is the fracture aperture variability and the difficulties of characterizing such particularly in field settings variable aperture fields can influence flow and transport and may enhance preferential flow paths and channeling abelin et al 1994 chen et al 2017 dou et al 2018 gong and rossen 2017 jeong

al 1970 wu et al 1999 channeling in discrete fractures is a key factor in transport experiments causing tracer transport to be unrepresentative of the mean flow and can impact the breakthrough of tracers in ways that are challenging to analyze brown et al 1998 tsang neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1988 most research studies comparing heat and solute transport and studies on heat transfer alone especially under variable aperture discrete fractured rock settings focuses on high energy and fast flowing systems andrade et al 2004 bagalkot and kumar 2015 chen et al 2018 fox et al 2015 guo et al 2016 klepikova et al 2016 klepikova et al 2014 ma et al 2018 neuville et al 2010a 2010b pandey et al 2017 zhou et al 2007 as stated above solute and heat transport in fractured rock has an inherent complexity stemming from the fracture aperture variability research has not focused on the lower end of the fluid velocity spectrum which corresponds to conditions of natural groundwater flow the objective of this study is to employ a numerical model that fully couples heat and solute transfer in a discrete variable aperture fracture with the surrounding rock matrix to compare and assess the spatial distribution of the solute and thermal fronts we focus on the lower end of the fluid velocity spectrum which is representative of natural groundwater flow conditions with a peclet number generally less than one due to the differences in behavior between solute and heat tracers in the same discrete fracture the comparison assists in identifying heterogeneity in fracture aperture variable fracture aperture fields with specific mean variance correlation lengths and closure points are incorporated into the numerical model systematic and quantitative analysis is conducted to determine the spatial distribution of the thermal and solute front in the fracture comparing the time of development the travel distance the shape of the front and assessing the effect of closed areas on both tracers allows a better understanding of how each tracer migrates through the variable aperture fracture thus revealing characteristics of the fractured aquifer under investigation the results of this investigation can be used to design field experiments to investigate in situ natural fracture heterogeneity 2 model and governing equations hydrogeosphere is the model used to conduct the

variable aperture represents the modeled fractured rock environment the schematic in fig 1 illustrates the conceptual representation of the three dimensional 3 d grid system that is employed in the numerical model an 80 m by 80 m by 60 m block domain is considered in the x y and z directions respectively the domain size is chosen to avoid boundary effects and to enhance computing efficiency at an elevation of 30 m in the z direction a single discrete horizontal variable aperture fracture divides the domain in half in the x z plane at y 0 m and y 80 m a type i hydraulic boundary constant head condition is implemented fig 1 this type i hydraulic boundary generates uniform steady flow in the fracture on all other faces no flow hydraulic boundary conditions are applied the constant parameters and their respective values that are employed in the modeling are presented in table 4 1 a 10 c uniform temperature and zero chloride concentration are set for the initial condition a constant line source extending 1 m into the rock matrix along the z axis on either side of the fracture is incorporated set to a 20 c temperature and 1 mg l solute concentration fig 1 the line source represents an isolated section of a well with an intersecting fracture and is located 25 m from the up stream boundary in our experience the 2 m packer spacing is usually at the smaller end of the practical range of field applications in fractured rock lapcevic et al 2010 given the relatively small increase in temperature from 10 to 20 c changes in fluid and bedrock properties as a function of temperature are considered to be negligible baston and kueper 2009 ma and zheng 2010 simmons 2005 the bedrock matrix has a uniform isotropic thermal conductivity and is assumed to be impervious to the flow of groundwater zero dispersive solute flux zero gradient and zero conductive heat flux are set as boundary conditions for the x y plane at z 0 m and z 60 m for the y z plane at x 0 m and x 80 m and for the x z plane at y 0 and y 80 chloride concentration and temperature values were evaluated at monitoring points located at the top bottom left and right boundaries to assess that reflection boundary effects were never encountered for discretization a constant grid spacing of 0 01 m extending 1 m in the z direction in the vicinity of the fracture is implemented fig 1 a constant grid spacing of 0 1 m extending 2 m in the x and y directions in the vicinity of the heat source is considered fig 1 in the z direction the grid coarsens to 0 5 m with distance away from both the fracture and in the x and y directions the grid then coarsens to 0 4 m in order to ensure accuracy of the solution a sensitivity assessment to grid spacing was carried out the assessment demonstrated that when the grid size was reduced to 0 001 m there was less than 0 1 change in temperature values and chloride concentrations at monitoring points in the fracture and rock matrix 4 selection of additional model parameters in addition to the parameters presented in table 1 additional parameters used in the numerical modeling were selected including parameters used to define the aperture fields hydraulic gradients peclet numbers and the thermal conductivity and dispersivity 4 1 aperture fields table 2 lists the fracture aperture mean variance and correlation lengths utilized to generate the fracture aperture fields they are selected based on statistical parameters obtained from measurements of hydraulic aperture acquired under natural settings from naturally occurring fractures bagalkot and kumar 2015 konzuk and kueper 2004 lapcevic et al 1999 novakowski et al 2006 tang et al 1981 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 the mean fracture aperture considered is 1 000 ¬µm a relatively high value for naturally occurring fractures but which has been used in the modeling of several engineered geothermal systems guo et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 2014 pandey and chaudhuri 2017 additional simulations were also conducted at a mean fracture aperture of 500 ¬µm to highlight the results at lower aperture values the variance of the aperture values selected although not widely studied have been observed to vary between 1 000 and 10 000 Œºm2 lapcevic et al 1999 we have set the variance to 10 000 Œºm2 in this study guo et al 2016 lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 based on field observations the correlation length of the aperture distribution employed in the modeling is set to 10 m lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 by selecting these values we have allowed the model to generate significant channeling effects guo et al 2016 lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 a spatially correlated field generator based on the discrete fourier transform method fgen robin et al 1993 was used to generate 50 random fracture aperture fields based on the fracture aperture mean variance and correlation lengths defined in table 2 the aperture values used throughout this paper are the input mean aperture values but when creating the aperture fields fgen returns an actual mean variance and correlation lengths slightly different than the input mean values heterogeneous isotropic fields were considered in the simulations with spatial correlation lengths equal in the x and y directions heterogeneous isotropic fields were generated for this research as many measurements of aperture distributions display isotropic conditions when minimal shear is present auradou et al 2005 huang et al 2018 konzuk and kueper 2004 the two dimensional aperture fields were generated using an exponential covariance model having a mean aperture set at 1 000 ¬µm and variance set at œÉ2 10 000 Œºm2 to create contact points in the aperture fields aperture values below 20 of the mean aperture value were set to zero yielding a truncated gaussian distribution a fracture aperture field was generated larger than the model domain and then truncated to avoid edge effects in the aperture generation process using the output of the numerical model the cubic law was utilized to calculate the hydraulic aperture for the different realizations aperture fields are not static even under natural conditions many behaviors including chemical mechanical thermal and hydraulic processes cause changes in the aperture fields several models have addressed these processes in fractured media ghassemi and zhou 2011 pandey et al 2017 2015 2014 rawal and ghassemi 2014 salimzadeh et al 2018 salimzadeh and nick 2019 the objective of this study was to compare heat and solute transport in variable aperture fields under natural groundwater flow conditions and not to integrate aperture field changes at this stage 4 2 hydraulic gradients and peclet numbers the maximum expected groundwater velocity for the fracture aperture defined is approximately 100 m day table 2 the associated hydraulic gradient for the fluid velocity of approximately 100 m day is 1 97x10 3 which is representative of measured gradients in naturally occurring fractures bagalkot and kumar 2015 novakowski et al 2006 tang et al 1981 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 solute peclet numbers p es were calculated for fluid velocities of 100 m day and 50 m day when the mean fracture aperture was set at 1 000 ¬µm the p es was approximately 13 3 and 6 6 respectively indicating both an advection and dispersion influenced system thermal fracture matrix peclet p eh numbers were calculated for fluid velocities of 100 m day when the mean fracture aperture was set at 1 000 ¬µm the p eh was approximately 1 18 indicating a mixed conduction convection system for the same mean fracture aperture but with a fluid velocity of 50 m day the p eh is approximately 0 58 indicating a conduction dominated system 4 3 thermal conductivity and thermal dispersivity water saturated thermal conductivity can be bracketed between 0 5 and 10 5 w m k for different rock types and rock forming minerals at shallow subsurface temperature and pressure conditions eppelbaum et al 2014 issler and jessop 2011 shim et al 2010 shim and park 2013 this study employs a thermal conductivity of 2 w m k table 4 1 characteristically earlier modeling studies used thermal conductivities between 2 and 4 w m k baston et al 2010 bou jaoude et al 2018 ghassemi and zhou 2011 graf and therrien 2009 klepikova et al 2016 pehme et al 2013 raymond et al 2011 a thermal conductivity of 2 w m k represents the mineral mica with a specific heat capacity of 880 j kg k and a density of 2855 kg m3 beardsmore and cull 2001 clauser and huenges 1995 horai 1971 horai and simmons 1969 robertson 1988 this research will focus on the lower limit of thermal conductivity and so all the simulations conducted will use 2 w m k as the thermal conductivity of the solid phase Œªs the higher the thermal conductivity the more pronounced the effect of conduction bou jaoude et al 2018 in porous media the significance of thermal dispersivity and its contribution to heat transport has long been disputed in the literature e g anderson 2005 de marsily 1986 rau et al 2014 vandenbohede et al 2009 bear 1972 considered thermal dispersivity to be zero under natural groundwater conditions when the peclet number is less than 0 5 rau et al 2012 concluded from their experiment on coarse sand that thermal dispersivity can be neglected sauty et al 1982 and de marsily 1986 pointed out that actual values based on field studies are rare de marsily 1986 summarized the results from different investigations and noted that thermal dispersivity should be the same if not five times less than solute dispersivity constantz et al 2005 and park et al 2015 concluded that thermal dispersivity should not be neglected even if it is much smaller than the solute dispersivity under natural groundwater conditions vandenbohede et al 2009 concluded from their push pull test that thermal dispersivity is 2 to 7 times smaller than solute dispersivity bou jaoude et al 2018 showed thermal dispersivity has a minimal effect on the propagation of a thermal front and its omission might produce minimal error under conditions similar to used herein i e using realistic flow velocities and aperture values these results are similar to the findings of cheng et al 2001 and in contrast to what is encountered in porous media metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012 saar 2011 similar to the scale of porous media solute dispersivity in fractured settings increases as a function of the fracture length as shown by tracer experiments conducted in discrete fractures under natural groundwater flow conditions guimer√† and carrera 2000 for example longitudinal solute dispersivity was observed to increases from 0 2 to 10 m when increasing the field scale from 3 0 to 45 m bodin et al 2003 gelhar et al 1992 lapcevic et al 1999 assumptions for representative values of fracture thermal dispersivity must be made due to the lack of laboratory and field scale values in this research we adopt a one order of magnitude decrease between solute dispersivity and thermal dispersivity therefore the 0 6 m thermal dispersivity in the longitudinal direction represents one order of magnitude decrease from the solute dispersivity of 6 m assumed for the 55 m distance in the y direction from the source to the edge of the domain table 1 5 results and discussion using the numerical model and varying the parameters according to tables 1 and 2 a total of 100 simulations were conducted in separate realizations of the aperture field the normalized chloride concentrations and temperature values were calculated for the comparison knowing that measurement of small temperature differentials is now possible using fiber optics and thermistors having typical accuracy in the order of 0 001 c pehme et al 2013 read et al 2013 the spatial distributions of the normalized solute and thermal front from a few days up to five years were considered the travel distance was analyzed in relation to time and hydraulic aperture the normalized concentration in monitoring wells is also discussed and the shape of the plumes in the model domain is assessed finally the effect of the closed areas on the distribution of the thermal front is analyzed 5 1 travel distance vs time the spatial extent travel distance of the solute plume at a normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 as it develops with respect to time is illustrated in fig 2 the travel distance is measured in the plane of the fracture from the source to the limit of the spatial extent of the plume in the y direction as illustrated in fig 1 most of the growth of the chloride plume takes place in the first few days after only one day of injection the plume reaches 95 of its maximum extent the chloride plume reaches steady state in the fracture at approximately 42 m after ten days fig 3 illustrates the travel distance of the normalized thermal plume temperature at 0 1 same normalized concentration as the solute plume and 0 01 tenfold less than the solute plume values the normalized thermal plume of 0 1 reaches 8 5 m after three years and ten meters after ten years the plume does not reach steady state and it reaches approximately ¬º the extent of the solute plume over much greater time it is clear that the thermal plume for the same normalized concentration migrates much slower when compared to the solute plume de la bernardie et al 2018 to allow for the thermal plumes and the solute plume to reach the same extent approximately 42 m the normalized temperature had to be decreased tenfold from 0 1 to 0 01 and the elapsed time had to be increased 100 times from ten days to three years the travel distance being over several correlation lengths of the aperture fields was chosen to allow for both plumes to reach similar extents over the simulation time periods even after this increase in time and decrease in the normalized concentration the thermal plume does not reach steady state this increase in time is mainly because of the heat loss from the fracture to the matrix as thermal conduction is much more significant than mass diffusion resulting in the mass loss in the solute case a thermal retardation factor has been proposed to explain the heat loss allowing heat transport to be modeled by simply rescaling the effective velocity in the advection dispersion equation de la bernardie et al 2018 5 2 travel distance vs hydraulic aperture fig 4 a and 4b represent scatter plots of the travel distance of the 50 different realizations of each of the two aperture values investigated for the solute and thermal plumes at normalized concentration temperature values of 0 1 and 0 01 respectively measured after 24 h and three years respectively plotted against the hydraulic aperture the scatter of the hydraulic apertures in fig 4 is around the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm the hydraulic aperture that was back calculated from the output of hydrogeosphere has a slight variation around 1 000 Œºm and 500 Œºm which is mainly attributed to the return values of fgen truncation of the aperture field and the allocation of closure points this variation has no major effect on the results the maximum travel distances of the plumes are measured in the y direction in the plane of the fracture as illustrated in fig 1 fig 4a illustrates that travel distances of the normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 are widely scattered after 24 h of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 30 7 m 13 6 m and 185 7 m2 respectively table 3 there is also no significant change in the distribution between aperture values of 500 ¬µm and 1000 Œºm conversely the travel distances of the normalized thermal temperature values at 0 1 are less scattered even after three years of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 6 9 m 2 6 m and 6 6 m2 respectively table 3 the mean of the travel distance for the 500 ¬µm mean aperture case is approximately 5 2 Œºm while for the 1 000 m case it is 6 9 m the variation in scatter for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm reveals that the distribution of the solute plume is much more influenced by the flow field in the variable aperture fracture than the thermal plume when comparing the same normalized values after three years and for the normalized thermal temperature value of 0 1 the distance of travel is close to one correlation length the short travel distance might not allow for much interaction with the fracture aperture variation this delay in the progress of the thermal plume is attributed to the effect of thermal conduction in the matrix when comparing the 0 1 normalized concentration of chloride at 24 h to the 0 01 normalized temperature after three years of injection both values display a wide scatter fig 4b for the thermal case the average mean standard deviation and variance are 29 3 m 9 8 m and 95 5 m2 respectively the average standard deviation of the chloride migration is higher than that of the thermal migration presented in table 3 when comparing the thermal travel distances the mean for the 500 ¬µm case is approximately 25 8 m while for the 1 000 Œºm case it is approximately 33 m as for chloride it is less pronounced with a mean difference of approximately 5 m looking at these results for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm one would assume that the propagation of the thermal plume under the defined conditions might have been influenced by the variation in the aperture field as with the solute case as there are many reduced aperture zones through which the fluid migrates clearly matrix conduction creates short circuits through the matrix across these zones of reduced aperture fig 5 provides a scatter plot of the normalized vertical travel distance extent in the z direction in the matrix for the solute and thermal plumes at 0 1 and 0 01 plotted against the hydraulic aperture for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm the wide scatter and large penetration depth in the matrix is mainly attributed to the 0 01 normalized thermal plume after three years of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 10 9 m 3 5 m and 12 1 m2 respectively conversely the chloride plume for a normalized concentration of 0 01 and even after three years of injection moves only slightly into the matrix the relatively large penetration depth of heat is attributed to the process of heat conduction through the matrix graf and therrien 2009 read et al 2013 the important penetration depth of heat in the matrix further highlights the importance of matrix conduction in defining the shape of the thermal plume in the fracture when looking at the penetration depth in the thermal case the mean depth for the 500 ¬µm aperture is approximately 7 8 m while for the 1000 ¬µm case it is approximately 14 m table 4 the difference is almost half which shows that the availability of heat in the fracture also plays a role along with matrix conduction for the 1000 ¬µm fractures defined in this study the maximum expected groundwater velocity is approximately 100 m day which is slightly high for an aperture of approximately 500 Œºm with the decrease in velocity and decrease in aperture size the conductivity of the matrix is the dominate parameter and the thermal front will advance as if no fracture is present in the system bou jaoude et al 2018 5 3 effect of conduction in the matrix fig 6 a and 6b illustrate the vertical profile of the normalized concentration of solute at 0 1 and normalized temperature values at 0 01 in two monitoring wells located at 2 m and 10 m downstream from the source location as presented in fig 1 the spatial distribution of the normalized plumes is for 24 h and three years of continuous injection fluid velocity is set at approximately 100 m day with a rock matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k in both cases at 2 m and 10 m in fig 6a and at 2 m in fig 6b the solute plume advances almost 25 more than the thermal plume only at the 10 m monitoring well in fig 6b do both tracers propagate almost the same distance in the fracture it is evident that at that point the solute concentration is low which is mainly attributed to the effect of the variable aperture field whereas the thermal plume does not vary that much however the thermal plume for both wells propagates inside the matrix which is attributed to conduction the solute after three years penetrates less than 1 m vertically into the matrix the results demonstrate that the approximation of one dimensional solute diffusion in the matrix is a reasonable assumption when formulating the solute equation inspection of the temperature profiles at the wells clearly illustrates the two dimensionality of the thermal conduction gradients in the matrix even at natural flow velocities fig 7 illustrates three dimensional 3 d representations of the spatial distribution in the model domain of the normalized 0 1 solute plume concentration and 0 01 thermal plume temperature after three years of continuous injection fluid velocity is set at approximately 100 m day with a rock matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k the model domain is lightly rotated to allow the visual observation of the plane of the fracture in the x y plane fig 7a illustrates that the spatial distribution of the normalized 0 1 chloride plume forms a thin straight channel after three years of injection the plume is meandering around the closed area located in the middle of the flow path the plume is like an elongate pancake barely propagating in the matrix which is mainly attributed to limited solute diffusion fig 7a also illustrates the shape of the normalized thermal plume at 0 01 after three years of injection the thermal plume forms a balloon shape with significant propagation in the matrix because of thermal conduction fig 7b illustrates the spatial distribution of the normalized chloride plume at 0 1 and normalized thermal plume at 0 01 after three years of injection the solute plume forms a thin right meandering channel conversely the thermal plume balloons in shape similar to that shown in fig 7a the ratio of the mass of solute stored in the matrix to that stored in the fracture after three years of injection is approximately two this is contrary to the ratio of thermal energy stored in the matrix to that stored in the fracture which is approximately 1 2x104 or approximately four orders of magnitude higher the spatial distributions in the three dimensional domains illustrate the importance of three dimensional conduction in the matrix in controlling the development of the shape of the thermal plume and the need to accommodate three dimensional conduction in simulations 5 4 effect of closed areas and conduction in the plane of the fracture fig 8 presents three examples illustrating the development of the spatial distribution of the solute and thermal plumes as they advance with time over one day for the solute and five years for heat the figure also illustrates the tortuous fluid flow lines moving around reduced aperture areas within the fracture aperture field to better asses the difference between these two tracers under the conditions defined we compare the normalized concentration of the chloride plume at 0 1 with the normalized thermal temperature value of 0 01 for 24 h and three years respectively fig 8a illustrates the propagation of the plume of the normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 in a channel following the flow lines the plume starts meandering around the closed area located in the middle of the flow path at x and y coordinates 40 m 60 m after one day of injection after one day of continuous injection the solute plume reaches a maximum width of 10 m and an extent of 40 m whereas the spatial distribution of the normalized thermal plume temperature at 0 01 is expanding in an elliptical shape in all directions although dominantly in the general direction of groundwater flow the thermal plume does not preferentially follow the fluid flow channels in the system and propagates in all directions with no clear thermal channeling the maximum width of the thermal plume after three years of continuous injection is 25 m and the extent is 45 m after two years of continuous injection of heat the thermal plume reaches a closed area approximately 8 m in diameter centered around and y coordinates of 42 m 60 m the thermal plume does not only meanders around the closed area but also advances through the closed area because of thermal conduction the thermal front propagates into the closed area in the y direction while the hot fluid at the same time starts enveloping the closed area from either side after two years allowing for conduction into the closed area in the x direction conduction in those two directions results in the propagation of the thermal front almost as fast as the moving fluid allowing for the smoothening of the thermal front and eliminating the effect of flow channeling during its propagation after five years the thermal front passes entirely through the closed area in fig 8b the solute forms after one day an elongate right meandering plume with similar dimensions as the one illustrated in fig 8a the spatial extent of the normalized thermal plume at 0 01 is also similar to that observed in fig 8a with a comparable elliptical shape after three years fig 8b also illustrates the solute plume avoids the closed area approximately 4 m in diameter located at x and y coordinates 47 m 25 m on the right side of the source whereas the thermal plume propagates through it as a result of conduction in the x direction in fig 8c there is a small closed area approximately 2 m in diameter at x and y coordinates of 40 m 75 m that is being enveloped by the solute but never reached by the thermal plume even after five years of injection in fig 8c the normalized 0 01 thermal plume after three years of injection is approximately 40 m wide and 60 m long while the normalized solute plume at 0 1 after one day reaches the limit of the domain and is approximately 20 m wide this illustrates the importance of two dimensional conduction and two dimensional dispersion in the plane of the fracture in controlling the development of the shape of the thermal plume and the solute plume respectively and accommodating these processes in future simulations is recommended moreover these results indicate that contrary to heat transport in discrete fracture settings channeling is sometimes a significant contributor to solute migration rates abelin et al 1994 chen et al 2018 2017 dou et al 2018 gong and rossen 2017 jeong and song 2005 konzuk and kueper 2004 kosakowski et al 2001 lapcevic et al 1999 lee et al 2003 neretnieks 1993 novakowski et al 1985 tsang et al 1988 wu et al 1999 under natural groundwater flow conditions with fluid velocities less than approximately 100 m day no major thermal channeling is observed and the spatial distribution of the thermal front is a deformed ellipse bou jaoude et al 2018 under natural flow conditions defined for this research solute transport is significantly more affected by the variation in the variable fracture aperture field when compared to thermal transport therefore solute transport under natural groundwater conditions can provide a better understanding on the heterogeneous aperture field while thermal transport can provide a mean value of the field similar to what has been observed in porous media irvine et al 2015 this is in contrast to what have been seen in the limited number of field tracer tests that have been done using both heat and solute tracers egan 2018 gerard et al 2018 hawkins et al 2017 read et al 2013a under high thermal fracture matrix peclet number 1 000 where major channeling of both tracers has been observed the tracer test results showed that the two different tracers do not provide the same information on the transport pathways even at the scale of meters and the thermal breakthrough is significantly attenuated because of fracture matrix heat exchange fig 9 illustrates the development of the spatial distribution of the normalized 0 1 solute concentrations and the normalized 0 01 thermal temperatures as they advance with time in the presence of a relatively large closed area the plumes are both overlain on the fracture aperture field and the fluid flow lines the field has a calculated hydraulic aperture of approximately1035 ¬µm fig 9 also illustrates the tortuous fluid flow lines moving around a large closed area centered around x and y coordinates of approximately 45 m 45 m and extending approximately 15 m in length and is three to five meters wide the normalized chloride plume is seen propagating almost in a straight channel slightly meandering to the left avoiding the closed area the normalized thermal plume propagates uniformly and after 200 days it reaches the closed area and continues with no separation or divergence of the plume the thermal plume propagates into the closed area because of thermal conduction in the x and y direction 6 conclusions numerical modeling was used to compare the spatial distribution of a solute and thermal plume in a discrete fracture setting with natural groundwater flow conditions based on the analysis of results the following conclusions can be made assessing the movement of the thermal plume in the plane of the fracture or as a profile in a well does not provide the entire detail on how the plume develops the plume also advances in the matrix along the direction of the fracture because of the thermal conductivity of the rock it is important to include monitoring points in the matrix to better define the thermal plume in contrast the solute plume can be well defined by looking at the concentrations in the fracture because of the limited diffusion in the rock matrix for the time scales considered in this study it is also important to measure the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix in sites under investigation whether it is for shallow energy storage treatment of contaminated sites or deep disposal of waste to allow for a better prediction of the spatial distribution and propagation of the thermal plume the importance of three dimensional and two dimensional conduction in the matrix and in the fracture respectively in controlling the development and the shape of the thermal plume is identified for these natural flow conditions therefore the need to accommodate these processes in future simulations is essential especially when addressing natural groundwater flow conditions while the limited propagation of the solute plume in the matrix allows for defensible one dimensional solute diffusion in the matrix contrary to solute transport in a discrete variable aperture fracture setting where channeling is sometimes a major contributor to solute migration rates no significant thermal channeling is observed in this study when the aperture field has a mean of approximately 1 000 ¬µm a variance of 10 000 Œºm2 and a correlation length of 10 m with a fluid velocity of 100 m day and less and with a matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k the spatial distribution of the thermal front is controlled mainly by conduction in the matrix in a discrete variable aperture fracture setting solute transport is more influenced by variations in the fracture aperture field compared to thermal transport therefore monitoring concentrations in a well network can provide an understanding of the heterogeneous aperture field in a single fracture setting specifically channeling effects while monitoring temperature cannot monitoring temperature will provide a mean value of the aperture field credit authorship contribution statement issam bou

3558,in this study we have compared heat and solute transport in a discrete fracture using numerical modeling fracture aperture heterogeneity was described using geostatistical properties with fracture aperture means of up to 1000 Œºm variances of 10 000 ¬µm2 and isotropic correlation lengths up to 10 m groundwater flow in the matrix was assumed to be negligible and flow in the fracture was set to values typical for natural groundwater conditions with velocities less than 100 m day and associated hydraulic gradients of less than 0 05 a uniform isotropic thermal conductivity of 2 w m c was set for the matrix based on 50 realizations three dimensional and two dimensional conduction in the matrix and in the fracture respectively play an important role in controlling the development and the shape of the thermal plume under natural flow conditions in contrast solute transport exhibits limited penetration depth in the matrix the results of this research indicate that contrary to solute transport in discrete fracture settings where channeling is sometimes a major contributor to solute migration rates no significant thermal channeling is observed under natural groundwater flow conditions the use of tracer experiments or the monitoring of solute transport in fractured rock will not therefore provide a reliable prediction of the migration of heat in the same setting keywords fractured rock heat transfer solute transport conduction diffusion fracture aperture variability 1 introduction and objectives more than half a century has passed since the recognition of heat as a potential tracer for groundwater flow bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 stallman 1965 suzuki 1960 solute tracers have long been used to assess groundwater flow davis et al 1980 but real applications only started in the first half of the 20th century davis et al 1980 at the beginning of the 21st century heat and solute tracers were applied together in studies allowing for better assessment of the subsurface transport characteristics constantz et al 2005 pruess et al 2002 subsequently researchers utilized heat and solute tracers together for a variety of applications mainly focusing on porous media abrantes et al 2018 anderson 2005 constantz et al 2005 irvine et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 li 2018 ma et al 2012 pruess et al 2002 rau et al 2012 sarris et al 2018 taniguchi and sharma 1990 vandenbohede et al 2009 more recently both tracers were used simultaneously in assessing fractured media cherubini et al 2017 de la bernardie et al 2018 hawkins et al 2017 klepikova et al 2016 kocabas 2005 pastore et al 2015 read et al 2013 with applications including subsurface characterization hydraulic parameter assessment heat storage and transport mechanisms and remediation applications cherubini et al 2017 de la bernardie et al 2018 egan 2018 graf and therrien 2009 hawkins et al 2017 klepikova et al 2016 kocabas 2005 molson et al 2007 pastore et al 2015 pehme et al 2013 read et al 2013 wright and novakowski 2019 de la bernardie et al 2018 proposed that an instantaneous equilibrium between the rock matrix and the fluid in the fracture cannot be assumed primarily because of the very long times of conduction or heat exchange between the matrix and fluid they concluded along with others b√∂dvarsson and tsang 1982 cherubini et al 2017 gringarten et al 1975 kocabas 2005 lauwerier 1955 pastore et al 2015 tang et al 1981 that under the conditions they presented one dimensional 1 d conduction in the matrix is a reasonable assumption in the assessment and that longitudinal conduction does not play a significant role on thermal transport in the fracture similar to what has been proposed for solute transport cherubini et al 2017 and pastore et al 2015 conducted bench scale experiments and concluded that the behavior of heat transport is entirely different compared to mass transport at thermal fracture matrix peclet numbers less than one both studies assumed one dimensional 1 d conduction in the matrix other studies suggest that two dimensional 2 d conduction in the matrix in directions perpendicular and parallel to the fracture must be accounted for bou jaoude et al 2018 kolditz 1995 mart√≠nez et al 2014 yang 2016 bou jaoude et al 2018 in a numerical study noted that the migration of heat is primarily governed by the groundwater velocity in the fracture and the size of the fracture aperture as solute diffuses at a much slower rate it does not diffuse far into the matrix and therefore matrix diffusion of solute during transport can be reasonably approximated to be one dimensional chen 1985 using numerical simulations de la bernardie et al 2018 demonstrated that longitudinal conduction does not play a significant role in thermal transport in the fracture in the plane of the fracture the solute will have to travel around closed areas creating meandering of the solute while a heat tracer will travel through these closed areas through conduction parallel to the fracture orientation consequently conduction in the plane of the fracture will aid in smoothing the shape of the thermal front bou jaoude 2019 bou jaoude et al 2018 there is clearly a need to conduct a robust comparison between heat and solute tracers in a variable aperture discrete fracture setting under natural groundwater conditions where three dimensional 3 d matrix conduction and two dimensional 2 d conduction in the plane of the fracture are considered allowing for a better comparison between the spatial distribution of the thermal and solute plumes both advection in the fracture and conduction in the matrix control heat migration in a discrete fracture abdallah et al 1995 baston and kueper 2009 mart√≠nez et al 2014 conduction dominates the movement of heat transport when the underground system exhibits a very low permeability or when the aperture of the fracture is small bou jaoude et al 2018 saar 2011 dehkordi et al 2015 in a sensitivity assessment on the impact of a vertical closed loop on geothermal heat pump systems established that the increase in groundwater flow mainly above 10 7 m s can substantially reshape and dissipate the thermal plume they demonstrated that the thermal plume keeps growing indicating that accurate assessment of the subsurface properties including thermal conductivity of the matrix is essential flow channeling and fracture roughness may also be the cause of the differences between predictive heat models and field observations as documented by the efficiencies of geothermal systems and temperature breakthrough curves kolditz 1995 kolditz and clauser 1998 heat channeling was identified under high energy performance geothermal systems with high peclet numbers of approximately 10 000 and in some lower groundwater velocity cases with peclet numbers of approximately 200 andrade et al 2004 bagalkot and kumar 2015 chen et al 2018 fox et al 2015 guo et al 2016 klepikova et al 2016 klepikova et al 2014 ma et al 2018 neuville et al 2010a 2010b pandey et al 2017 zhou et al 2007 the channeling effect was also identified in laboratory investigations conducted in fractured rocks bai et al 2017 cherubini et al 2017 he et al 2016 luo et al 2018 zhao 2014 where peclet numbers are approximately one or less heat channeling disappeared this was attributed mainly to the effect of the closure points and conduction in the matrix bou jaoude et al 2018 de la bernardie et al 2018 used a push pull test and demonstrated that under a thermal fracture matrix system with peclet numbers between 2000 and 40 000 and for a fracture apertures ranging between 2 8 and 10 cm the assumption of a parallel plate fracture of homogeneous aperture for modeling both solute and thermal transport is invalidated this is similar to results obtained by klepikova et al 2016 under very similar conditions this unrealistic assumption is mainly due to flow channeling klepikova et al 2016 also concluded that the thermal signature could be characterized by a system of multiple channels that are parametrized by the mean channel density and diameter although channeling was identified in several studies e g bagalkot and kumar 2015 fox et al 2015 guo et al 2016 neuville et al 2010b they did not address the effect of contact points in the aperture fields as their generated apertures lacked them solute transport in discretely fractured media is reasonably understood and has been extensively studied becker and shapiro 2000 berkowitz 2002 bradbury and muldoon 1992 cady et al 1993 chen et al 2017 dorn

and explores flow pathways one of the main inherent complexities of natural discrete fractures is the fracture aperture variability and the difficulties of characterizing such particularly in field settings variable aperture fields can influence flow and transport and may enhance preferential flow paths and channeling abelin et al 1994 chen et al 2017 dou et al 2018 gong and rossen 2017 jeong

al 1970 wu et al 1999 channeling in discrete fractures is a key factor in transport experiments causing tracer transport to be unrepresentative of the mean flow and can impact the breakthrough of tracers in ways that are challenging to analyze brown et al 1998 tsang neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1988 most research studies comparing heat and solute transport and studies on heat transfer alone especially under variable aperture discrete fractured rock settings focuses on high energy and fast flowing systems andrade et al 2004 bagalkot and kumar 2015 chen et al 2018 fox et al 2015 guo et al

complexity stemming from the fracture aperture variability research has not focused on the lower end of the fluid velocity spectrum which corresponds to conditions of natural groundwater flow the objective of this study is to employ a numerical model that fully couples heat and solute transfer in a discrete variable aperture fracture with the surrounding rock matrix to compare and assess the spatial distribution of the solute and thermal fronts we focus on the lower end of the fluid velocity spectrum which is representative of natural groundwater flow conditions with a peclet number generally less than one due to the differences in behavior between solute and heat tracers in the same discrete fracture the comparison assists in identifying heterogeneity in fracture aperture variable fracture aperture fields with specific mean variance correlation lengths and closure points are incorporated into the numerical model systematic and quantitative analysis is conducted to determine the spatial distribution of the thermal and solute front in the fracture comparing the time of development the travel distance the shape of the front and assessing the effect of closed areas on both tracers allows a better understanding of how each tracer migrates through the variable aperture fracture thus revealing characteristics of the fractured aquifer under investigation the results of this investigation can be used to design field experiments to investigate in situ natural fracture heterogeneity 2 model and governing equations hydrogeosphere is the model used to conduct the simulations for this study therrien et al 2010 model capability success in previous applications and ease of use made hydrogeosphere a reasonable choice for this numerical investigation hydrogeosphere is a three dimensional control volume finite element model that is capable of simulating coupled flow mass transport and thermodynamic transport processes in three dimensional 3 d porous and fractured

galerkin finite element approach to solve the heat and solute transport equations and a control volume method to discretize the groundwater flow equations therrien et al 2010 in this investigation the rock matrix is considered impermeable to fluid flow and the solute is transported via diffusion and the heat via conduction in the matrix this study was conducted under steady flow assuming uniform

variable aperture represents the modeled fractured rock environment the schematic in fig 1 illustrates the conceptual representation of the three dimensional 3 d grid system that is employed in the numerical model an 80 m by 80 m by 60 m block domain is considered in the x y and z directions respectively the domain size is chosen to avoid boundary effects and to enhance computing efficiency at an elevation of 30 m in the z direction a single discrete horizontal variable aperture fracture divides the domain in half in the x z plane at y 0 m and y 80 m a type i hydraulic boundary constant head condition is implemented fig 1 this type i hydraulic boundary generates uniform steady flow in the fracture on all other faces no flow hydraulic boundary conditions are applied the constant parameters and their respective values that are employed in the modeling are presented in table 4 1 a 10 c uniform temperature and zero chloride concentration are set for the initial condition a constant line source extending 1 m into the rock matrix along the z axis on either side of the fracture is incorporated set to a 20 c temperature and 1 mg l solute concentration fig 1 the line source represents an isolated section of a well with an intersecting fracture and is located 25 m from the up stream boundary in our experience the 2 m packer spacing is usually at the smaller end of the practical range of field applications in fractured rock lapcevic et al 2010 given the relatively small increase in temperature from 10 to 20 c changes in fluid and bedrock properties as a function of temperature are considered to be negligible baston and kueper 2009 ma and zheng 2010 simmons 2005 the bedrock matrix has a uniform isotropic thermal conductivity and is assumed to be impervious to the flow of groundwater zero dispersive solute flux zero gradient and zero conductive heat flux are set as boundary conditions for the x y plane at z 0 m and z 60 m for the y z plane at x 0 m and x 80 m and for the x z plane at y 0 and y 80 chloride concentration and temperature values were evaluated at monitoring points located at the top bottom left and right boundaries to assess that reflection boundary effects were never encountered for discretization a constant grid spacing of 0 01 m extending 1 m in the z direction in the vicinity of the fracture is implemented fig 1 a constant grid spacing of 0 1 m extending 2 m in the x and y directions in the vicinity of the heat source is considered fig 1 in the z direction the grid coarsens to 0 5 m with distance away from both the fracture and in the x and y directions the grid then coarsens to 0 4 m in order to ensure accuracy of the solution a sensitivity assessment to grid spacing was carried out the assessment demonstrated that when the grid size was reduced to 0 001 m there was less than 0 1 change in temperature values and chloride concentrations at monitoring points in the fracture and rock matrix 4 selection of additional

aperture fields they are selected based on statistical parameters obtained from measurements of hydraulic aperture acquired under natural settings from naturally occurring fractures bagalkot and kumar 2015 konzuk and kueper 2004 lapcevic et al 1999 novakowski et al 2006 tang et al 1981 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 the mean fracture aperture considered is 1 000 ¬µm a relatively high value for naturally occurring fractures but which has been used in the modeling of several engineered geothermal systems guo et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 2014 pandey and chaudhuri 2017 additional simulations were also conducted at a mean fracture aperture of 500 ¬µm to highlight the results at lower aperture values the variance of the aperture values selected although not widely studied have been observed to vary between 1 000 and 10 000 Œºm2 lapcevic et al 1999 we have set the variance to 10 000 Œºm2 in this study guo et al 2016 lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 based on field observations the correlation length of the aperture distribution employed in the modeling is set to 10 m lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 by selecting these values we have allowed the model to generate significant channeling effects guo et al 2016 lapcevic et al 1999 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 a spatially correlated field generator based on the discrete fourier transform method fgen robin et al 1993 was used to generate 50 random fracture aperture fields based on the fracture aperture mean variance and correlation lengths defined in table 2 the aperture values used throughout this paper are the input mean aperture values but when creating the aperture fields fgen returns an actual mean variance and correlation lengths slightly different than the input mean values heterogeneous isotropic fields were considered in the simulations with spatial correlation lengths equal in the x and y directions heterogeneous isotropic fields were generated for this research as many measurements of aperture distributions display isotropic conditions when minimal shear is present auradou et al 2005 huang et al 2018 konzuk and kueper 2004 the two dimensional aperture fields were generated using an exponential covariance model having a mean aperture set at 1 000 ¬µm and variance set at œÉ2 10 000 Œºm2 to create contact points in the aperture fields aperture values below 20 of the mean aperture value were set to zero yielding a truncated gaussian distribution a fracture aperture field was generated larger than the model domain and then truncated to avoid edge effects in the aperture generation process using the output of the numerical model the cubic law was utilized to calculate the hydraulic aperture for the different realizations aperture fields are not static even under natural conditions many behaviors including chemical mechanical thermal and hydraulic processes cause changes in the aperture fields several models have addressed these processes in fractured media ghassemi and zhou 2011 pandey et al 2017 2015 2014 rawal and ghassemi 2014 salimzadeh et al 2018 salimzadeh and nick 2019 the objective of this study was to compare heat and solute transport in variable aperture fields under natural groundwater flow conditions and not to integrate aperture field changes at this stage 4 2 hydraulic gradients and peclet numbers the maximum expected groundwater velocity for the fracture aperture defined is approximately 100 m day table 2 the associated hydraulic gradient for the fluid velocity of approximately 100 m day is 1 97x10 3 which is representative of measured gradients in naturally occurring fractures bagalkot and kumar 2015 novakowski et al 2006 tang et al 1981 west et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 solute peclet numbers p es were calculated for fluid velocities of 100 m day and 50 m day when the mean fracture aperture was set at 1 000 ¬µm the p es was approximately 13 3 and 6 6 respectively indicating both an advection and dispersion influenced system thermal fracture matrix peclet p eh numbers were calculated for fluid velocities of 100 m day when the mean fracture aperture was set at 1 000 ¬µm the p eh was approximately 1 18 indicating a mixed conduction convection system for the same mean fracture aperture but with a fluid velocity of 50 m day the p eh is approximately 0 58 indicating a conduction dominated system 4 3 thermal conductivity and thermal dispersivity water saturated thermal conductivity can be bracketed between 0 5 and 10 5 w m k for different rock types and rock forming minerals at shallow subsurface temperature and pressure conditions eppelbaum et al 2014 issler and jessop 2011 shim et al 2010 shim and park 2013 this study employs a thermal conductivity of 2 w m k table 4 1 characteristically earlier modeling studies used thermal conductivities between 2 and 4 w m k baston et al 2010 bou jaoude et al 2018 ghassemi and zhou 2011 graf and therrien 2009 klepikova et al 2016 pehme et al 2013 raymond et al 2011 a thermal conductivity of 2 w m k represents the mineral mica with a specific heat capacity of 880 j kg k and a density of 2855 kg m3 beardsmore and cull 2001 clauser and huenges 1995 horai 1971 horai and simmons 1969 robertson 1988 this research will focus on the lower limit of thermal conductivity and so all the simulations conducted will use 2 w m k as the thermal conductivity of the solid phase Œªs the higher the thermal conductivity the more pronounced the effect of conduction bou jaoude et al 2018 in porous media the significance of thermal dispersivity and its contribution to heat transport has long been disputed in the literature e g anderson 2005 de marsily 1986 rau et al 2014 vandenbohede et al 2009 bear 1972 considered thermal dispersivity to be zero under natural groundwater conditions when the peclet number is less than 0 5 rau et al 2012 concluded from their experiment on coarse sand that thermal dispersivity can be neglected sauty et al 1982 and de marsily 1986 pointed out that actual values based on field studies are rare de marsily 1986 summarized the results from different investigations and noted that thermal dispersivity should be the same if not five times less than solute dispersivity constantz et al 2005 and park et al 2015 concluded that thermal dispersivity should not be neglected even if it is much smaller than the solute dispersivity under natural groundwater conditions vandenbohede et al 2009 concluded from their push pull test that thermal dispersivity is 2 to 7 times smaller than solute dispersivity bou jaoude et al 2018 showed thermal dispersivity has a minimal effect on the propagation of a thermal front and its omission might produce minimal error under conditions similar to used herein i e using realistic flow velocities and aperture values these results are similar to the findings of cheng et al 2001 and in contrast to what is encountered in porous media metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012 saar 2011 similar to the scale of porous media solute dispersivity in fractured settings increases as a function of the fracture length as shown by tracer experiments conducted in discrete fractures under natural groundwater flow conditions guimer√† and carrera 2000 for example longitudinal solute dispersivity was observed to increases from 0 2 to 10 m when increasing the field scale from 3 0 to 45 m bodin et al 2003 gelhar et al 1992 lapcevic et al 1999 assumptions for representative values of fracture thermal dispersivity must be made due to the lack of laboratory and field scale values in this research we adopt a one order of magnitude decrease between solute dispersivity and thermal dispersivity therefore the 0 6 m thermal dispersivity in the longitudinal direction represents one order of magnitude decrease from the solute dispersivity of 6 m assumed for the 55 m distance in the y direction from the source to the edge of the domain table 1 5 results and discussion using the numerical model and varying the parameters according to tables 1 and 2 a total of 100 simulations were conducted in separate realizations of the aperture field the normalized chloride concentrations and temperature values were calculated for the comparison knowing that measurement of small temperature differentials is now possible using fiber optics and thermistors having typical accuracy in the order of 0 001 c pehme et al 2013 read et al 2013 the spatial distributions of the normalized solute and thermal front from a few days up to five years were considered the travel distance was analyzed in relation to time and hydraulic aperture the normalized concentration in monitoring wells is also discussed and the shape of the plumes in the model domain is assessed finally the effect of the closed areas on the distribution of the thermal front is analyzed 5 1 travel distance vs time the spatial extent travel distance of the solute plume at a normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 as it develops with respect to time is illustrated in fig 2 the travel distance is measured in the plane of the fracture from the source to the limit of the spatial extent of the plume in the y direction as illustrated in fig 1 most of the growth of the chloride plume takes place in the first few days after only one day of injection the plume reaches 95 of its maximum extent the chloride plume reaches steady state in the fracture at approximately 42 m after ten days fig 3 illustrates the travel distance of the normalized thermal plume temperature at 0 1 same normalized concentration as the solute plume and 0 01 tenfold less than the solute plume values the normalized thermal plume of 0 1 reaches 8 5 m after three years and ten meters after ten years the plume does not reach steady state and it reaches approximately ¬º the extent of the solute plume over much greater time it is clear that the thermal plume for the same normalized concentration migrates much slower when compared to the solute plume de la bernardie et al 2018 to allow for the thermal plumes and the solute plume to reach the same extent approximately 42 m the normalized temperature had to be decreased tenfold from 0 1 to 0 01 and the elapsed time had to be increased 100 times from ten days to three years the travel distance being over several correlation lengths of the aperture fields was chosen to allow for both plumes to reach similar extents over the simulation time periods even after this increase in time and decrease in the normalized concentration the thermal plume does not reach steady state this increase in time is mainly because of the heat loss from the fracture to the matrix as thermal conduction is much more significant than mass diffusion resulting in the mass loss in the solute case a thermal retardation factor has been proposed to explain the heat loss allowing heat transport to be modeled by simply rescaling the effective velocity in the advection dispersion equation de la bernardie et al 2018 5 2 travel distance vs hydraulic aperture fig 4 a and 4b represent scatter plots of the travel distance of the 50 different realizations of each of the two aperture values investigated for the solute and thermal plumes at normalized concentration temperature values of 0 1 and 0 01 respectively measured after 24 h and three years respectively plotted against the hydraulic aperture the scatter of the hydraulic apertures in fig 4 is around the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm the hydraulic aperture that was back calculated from the output of hydrogeosphere has a slight variation around 1 000 Œºm and 500 Œºm which is mainly attributed to the return values of fgen truncation of the aperture field and the allocation of closure points this variation has no major effect on the results the maximum travel distances of the plumes are measured in the y direction in the plane of the fracture as illustrated in fig 1 fig 4a illustrates that travel distances of the normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 are widely scattered after 24 h of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 30 7 m 13 6 m and 185 7 m2 respectively table 3 there is also no significant change in the distribution between aperture values of 500 ¬µm and 1000 Œºm conversely the travel distances of the normalized thermal temperature values at 0 1 are less scattered even after three years of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 6 9 m 2 6 m and 6 6 m2 respectively table 3 the mean of the travel distance for the 500 ¬µm mean aperture case is approximately 5 2 Œºm while for the 1 000 m case it is 6 9 m the variation in scatter for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm reveals that the distribution of the solute plume is much more influenced by the flow field in the variable aperture fracture than the thermal plume when comparing the same normalized values after three years and for the normalized thermal temperature value of 0 1 the distance of travel is close to one correlation length the short travel distance might not allow for much interaction with the fracture aperture variation this delay in the progress of the thermal plume is attributed to the effect of thermal conduction in the matrix when comparing the 0 1 normalized concentration of chloride at 24 h to the 0 01 normalized temperature after three years of injection both values display a wide scatter fig 4b for the thermal case the average mean standard deviation and variance are 29 3 m 9 8 m and 95 5 m2 respectively the average standard deviation of the chloride migration is higher than that of the thermal migration presented in table 3 when comparing the thermal travel distances the mean for the 500 ¬µm case is approximately 25 8 m while for the 1 000 Œºm case it is approximately 33 m as for chloride it is less pronounced with a mean difference of approximately 5 m looking at these results for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm one would assume that the propagation of the thermal plume under the defined conditions might have been influenced by the variation in the aperture field as with the solute case as there are many reduced aperture zones through which the fluid migrates clearly matrix conduction creates short circuits through the matrix across these zones of reduced aperture fig 5 provides a scatter plot of the normalized vertical travel distance extent in the z direction in the matrix for the solute and thermal plumes at 0 1 and 0 01 plotted against the hydraulic aperture for the two mean aperture values of 1 000 ¬µm and 500 Œºm the wide scatter and large penetration depth in the matrix is mainly attributed to the 0 01 normalized thermal plume after three years of injection with an average mean standard deviation and variance of 10 9 m 3 5 m and 12 1 m2 respectively conversely the chloride plume for a normalized concentration of 0 01 and even after three years of injection moves only slightly into the matrix the relatively large penetration depth of heat is attributed to the process of heat conduction through the matrix graf and therrien 2009 read et al 2013 the important penetration depth of heat in the matrix further highlights the importance of matrix conduction in defining the shape of the thermal plume in the fracture when looking at the penetration depth in the thermal case the mean depth for the 500 ¬µm aperture is approximately 7 8 m while for the 1000 ¬µm case it is approximately 14 m table 4 the difference is almost half which shows that the availability of heat in the fracture also plays a role along with matrix conduction for the 1000 ¬µm fractures defined in this study the maximum expected groundwater velocity is approximately 100 m day which is slightly high for an aperture of approximately 500 Œºm with the decrease in velocity and decrease in aperture size the conductivity of the matrix is the dominate parameter and the thermal front will advance as if no fracture is present in the system bou jaoude et al 2018 5 3 effect of conduction in the matrix fig 6 a and 6b illustrate the vertical profile of the normalized concentration of solute at 0 1 and normalized temperature values at 0 01 in two monitoring wells located at 2 m and 10 m downstream from the source location as presented in fig 1 the spatial distribution of the normalized plumes is for 24 h and three years of continuous injection fluid velocity is set at approximately 100 m day with a rock matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k in both cases at 2 m and 10 m in fig 6a and at 2 m in fig 6b the solute plume advances almost 25 more than the thermal plume only at the 10 m monitoring well in fig 6b do both tracers propagate almost the same distance in the fracture it is evident that at that point the solute concentration is low which is mainly attributed to the effect of the variable aperture field whereas the thermal plume does not vary that much however the thermal plume for both wells propagates inside the matrix which is attributed to conduction the solute after three years penetrates less than 1 m vertically into the matrix the results demonstrate that the approximation of one dimensional solute diffusion in the matrix is a reasonable assumption when formulating the solute equation inspection of the temperature profiles at the wells clearly illustrates the two dimensionality of the thermal conduction gradients in the matrix even at natural flow velocities fig 7 illustrates three dimensional 3 d representations of the spatial distribution in the model domain of the normalized 0 1 solute plume concentration and 0 01 thermal plume temperature after three years of continuous injection fluid velocity is set at approximately 100 m day with a rock matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k the model domain is lightly rotated to allow the visual observation of the plane of the fracture in the x y plane fig 7a illustrates that the spatial distribution of the normalized 0 1 chloride plume forms a thin straight channel after three years of injection the plume is meandering around the closed area located in the middle of the flow path the plume is like an elongate pancake barely propagating in the matrix which is mainly attributed to limited solute diffusion fig 7a also illustrates the shape of the normalized thermal plume at 0 01 after three years of injection the thermal plume forms a balloon shape with significant propagation in the matrix because of thermal conduction fig 7b illustrates the spatial distribution of the normalized chloride plume at 0 1 and normalized thermal plume at 0 01 after three years of injection the solute plume forms a thin right meandering channel conversely the thermal plume balloons in shape similar to that shown in fig 7a the ratio of the mass of solute stored in the matrix to that stored in the fracture after three years of injection is approximately two this is contrary to the ratio of thermal energy stored in the matrix to that stored in the fracture which is approximately 1 2x104 or approximately four orders of magnitude higher the spatial distributions in the three dimensional domains illustrate the importance of three dimensional conduction in the matrix in controlling the development of the shape of the thermal plume and the need to accommodate three dimensional conduction in simulations 5 4 effect of closed areas and conduction in the plane of the fracture fig 8 presents three examples illustrating the development of the spatial distribution of the solute and thermal plumes as they advance with time over one day for the solute and five years for heat the figure also illustrates the tortuous fluid flow lines moving around reduced aperture areas within the fracture aperture field to better asses the difference between these two tracers under the conditions defined we compare the normalized concentration of the chloride plume at 0 1 with the normalized thermal temperature value of 0 01 for 24 h and three years respectively fig 8a illustrates the propagation of the plume of the normalized chloride concentration of 0 1 in a channel following the flow lines the plume starts meandering around the closed area located in the middle of the flow path at x and y coordinates 40 m 60 m after one day of injection after one day of continuous injection the solute plume reaches a maximum width of 10 m and an extent of 40 m whereas the spatial distribution of the normalized thermal plume temperature at 0 01 is expanding in an elliptical shape in all directions although dominantly in the general direction of groundwater flow the thermal plume does not preferentially follow the fluid flow channels in the system and propagates in all directions with no clear thermal channeling the maximum width of the thermal plume after three years of continuous injection is 25 m and the extent is 45 m after two years of continuous injection of heat the thermal plume reaches a closed area approximately 8 m in diameter centered around and y coordinates of 42 m 60 m the thermal plume does not only meanders around the closed area but also advances through the closed area because of thermal conduction the thermal front propagates into the closed area in the y direction while the hot fluid at the same time starts enveloping the closed area from either side after two years allowing for conduction into the closed area in the x direction conduction in those two directions results in the propagation of the thermal front almost as fast as the moving fluid allowing for the smoothening of the thermal front and eliminating the effect of flow channeling during its propagation after five years the thermal front passes entirely through the closed area in fig 8b the solute forms after one day an elongate right meandering plume with similar dimensions as the one illustrated in fig 8a the spatial extent of the normalized thermal plume at 0 01 is also similar to that observed in fig 8a with a comparable elliptical shape after three years fig 8b also illustrates the solute plume avoids the closed area approximately 4 m in diameter located at x and y coordinates 47 m 25 m on the right side of the source whereas the thermal plume propagates through it as a result of conduction in the x direction in fig 8c there is a small closed area approximately 2 m in diameter at x and y coordinates of 40 m 75 m that is being enveloped by the solute but never reached by the thermal plume even after five years of injection in fig 8c the normalized 0 01 thermal plume after three years of injection is approximately 40 m wide and 60 m long while the normalized solute plume at 0 1 after one day reaches the limit of the domain and is approximately 20 m wide this illustrates the importance of two dimensional conduction and two dimensional dispersion in the plane of the fracture in controlling the development of the shape of the thermal plume and the solute plume respectively and accommodating these processes in future simulations is recommended moreover these results indicate that contrary to heat transport in discrete fracture settings channeling is sometimes a significant contributor to solute migration rates abelin et al 1994 chen et al 2018 2017 dou et al 2018 gong and rossen 2017 jeong and song 2005 konzuk and kueper 2004 kosakowski et al 2001 lapcevic et al 1999 lee et al 2003 neretnieks 1993 novakowski et al 1985 tsang et al 1988 wu et al 1999 under natural groundwater flow conditions with fluid velocities less than approximately 100 m day no major thermal channeling is observed and the spatial distribution of the thermal front is a deformed ellipse bou jaoude et al 2018 under natural flow conditions defined for this research solute transport is significantly more affected by the variation in the variable fracture aperture field when compared to thermal transport therefore solute transport under natural groundwater conditions can provide a better understanding on the heterogeneous aperture field while thermal transport can provide a mean value of the field similar to what has been observed in porous media irvine et al 2015 this is in contrast to what have been seen in the limited number of field tracer tests that have been done using both heat and solute tracers egan 2018 gerard et al 2018 hawkins et al 2017 read et al 2013a under high thermal fracture matrix peclet number 1 000 where major channeling of both tracers has been observed the tracer test results showed that the two different tracers do not provide the same information on the transport pathways even at the scale of meters and the thermal breakthrough is significantly attenuated because of fracture matrix heat exchange fig 9 illustrates the development of the spatial distribution of the normalized 0 1 solute concentrations and the normalized 0 01 thermal temperatures as they advance with time in the presence of a relatively large closed area the plumes are both overlain on the fracture aperture field and the fluid flow lines the field has a calculated hydraulic aperture of approximately1035 ¬µm fig 9 also illustrates the tortuous fluid flow lines moving around a large closed area centered around x and y coordinates of approximately 45 m 45 m and extending approximately 15 m in length and is three to five meters wide the normalized chloride plume is seen propagating almost in a straight channel slightly meandering to the left avoiding the closed area the normalized thermal plume propagates uniformly and after 200 days it reaches the closed area and continues with no separation or divergence of the plume the thermal plume propagates into the closed area because of thermal conduction in the x and y direction 6 conclusions numerical modeling was used to compare the spatial distribution of a solute and thermal plume in a discrete fracture setting with natural groundwater flow conditions based on the analysis of results the following conclusions can be made assessing the movement of the thermal plume in the plane of the fracture or as a profile in a well does not provide the entire detail on how the plume develops the plume also advances in the matrix along the direction of the fracture because of the thermal conductivity of the rock it is important to include monitoring points in the matrix to better define the thermal plume in contrast the solute plume can be well defined by looking at the concentrations in the fracture because of the limited diffusion in the rock matrix for the time scales considered in this study it is also important to measure the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix in sites under investigation whether it is for shallow energy storage treatment of contaminated sites or deep disposal of waste to allow for a better prediction of the spatial distribution and propagation of the thermal plume the importance of three dimensional and two dimensional conduction in the matrix and in the fracture respectively in controlling the development and the shape of the thermal plume is identified for these natural flow conditions therefore the need to accommodate these processes in future simulations is essential especially when addressing natural groundwater flow conditions while the limited propagation of the solute plume in the matrix allows for defensible one dimensional solute diffusion in the matrix contrary to solute transport in a discrete variable aperture fracture setting where channeling is sometimes a major contributor to solute migration rates no significant thermal channeling is observed in this study when the aperture field has a mean of approximately 1 000 ¬µm a variance of 10 000 Œºm2 and a correlation length of 10 m with a fluid velocity of 100 m day and less and with a matrix thermal conductivity of 2 w m k the spatial distribution of the thermal front is controlled mainly by conduction in the matrix in a discrete variable aperture fracture setting solute transport is more influenced by variations in the fracture aperture field compared to thermal transport therefore monitoring concentrations in a well network can provide an understanding of the heterogeneous aperture field in a single fracture setting specifically channeling effects while monitoring temperature cannot monitoring temperature will provide a mean value of the aperture field credit authorship contribution statement issam bou

3559,a major problem associated with sealing native soils with impervious surfaces in urban areas is reduced groundwater recharge this in turn reduces stream baseflows which has serious implications for freshwater ecosystems to address this problem the use of stormwater infiltration systems is becoming increasingly common worldwide there is however substantial uncertainty on the fate of infiltrated stormwater and its interactions with downslope vegetation this study aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream a model using mike she was constructed calibrated and validated based on a real infiltration system which features extensive vegetation between the site of stormwater infiltration and the stream we then used the calibrated model to predict the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream in the absence of vegetation we also predicted the impact of infiltrated stormwater on the evapotranspiration downslope of the system the results showed that the performance of the model was satisfactory and the model captured the overall groundwater dynamic very well the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream increased by about 17 percent in the absence of vegetation the model also predicted that evapotranspiration would be 13 percent lower in the warmer months if stormwater was not infiltrated upslope the results suggest that the choice of location of infiltration systems should consider the potential of vegetation to intercept infiltrated water and impact on achievement of the design objectives which in this case included restoring baseflow where increasing the baseflows is not a priority the increased evapotranspiration afforded by stormwater infiltration could provide important microclimate benefits keywords stormwater infiltration evapotranspiration modelling urban baseflow 1 introduction urbanization alters the hydrologic regime of catchments the replacement of native soil with impervious surfaces such as roofs and roads leads to increased surface runoff volumes fletcher et al 2013 countered by reduced evapotranspiration and infiltration arnold and gibbons 1996 this leads to a decrease in groundwater recharge and subsequently stream baseflow hardison et al 2009 leopold 1968 rose and peters 2001 stream baseflow is a key driver of freshwater ecosystems bunn and arthington 2002 and its alteration has been implicated in reduced ecological condition in a number of studies menci√≥ and mas pla 2010 rolls et al 2012 while in some urban areas rising groundwater tables have been reported due to anthropogenic factors e g leaking water mains howard and israfilov 2002 lerner 2002 a significant and more universal impact of impervious surfaces is reduced groundwater recharge this explains why various modelling studies e g ke√üler et al 2012 shuster and rhea 2013 have concluded that groundwater recharge is reduced due to urbanization erickson and stefan 2009 developed three models to investigate the change of groundwater recharge in a watershed in minnesota under urban development they predicted that groundwater recharge will decline as urbanization increases to address the problem of reduced stream baseflows in urban areas the use of stormwater infiltration systems is becoming increasingly common worldwide walsh et al 2012 a range of different infiltration based measures exist e g rain gardens infiltration trenches etc and are commonly used as part of sustainable stormwater management approaches e g water sensitive urban design wsud and low impact development lid fletcher et al 2013 these measures capture stormwater runoff from upstream urban areas and infiltrate a portion of inflows into local soils by recharging groundwater it is thought that downstream baseflows are increased bonneau et al 2018a the few empirical studies which have investigated baseflow responses to the use of infiltration based measures have observed both positive effects bhaskar et al 2016 and no effect fanelli et al 2017 an important shortcoming of these catchment scale studies is that they reveal limited information on the fate of infiltrated stormwater in fact bonneau et al 2018b highlighted that the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains highly uncertain and is a topic requiring further research while the physical properties of the hillslope likely play the dominant role on the fate of infiltrated stormwater interactions with 1 underground urban infrastructure as well as 2 downslope vegetation could be critically important the former relates to the highly permeable material covering underground pipes which can cause preferential flow paths this phenomenon also termed the urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 can potentially intercept up to 95 percent of infiltrated stormwater poozan et al 2020 depending on the layout of the underground pipes intercepted water could still find its way to the receiving water as baseflow or it may flow so rapidly to streams that it contributes to event flows in much the same way as subsurface stormflow does in many natural catchments in contrast water interacting with downslope vegetation could be lost from the system entirely it can be hypothesized that a range of factors influence plant water use downstream of infiltration based measures e g the depth of roots water availability and soil and hydrogeological conditions for example in the study of a small rain garden in melbourne australia designed for infiltration hamel et al 2011 found that the adjacent shallow rooted vegetation grass consumed water at rates similar to those of control plots this finding was attributed to relatively wet climatic conditions along with very low permeability of underlying soils which meant that soil moisture levels remained high throughout the study period irrespective of location it can be hypothesized that under different site conditions e g presence of deep rooted vegetation soil water stress the said study could have observed greater plant water loss associated with rain garden infiltration the testing of such hypotheses is possible using hydrological models for example locatelli et al 2017 assessed the effects of stormwater infiltration on groundwater levels and the water balance and the performance of soakaways in areas with shallow groundwater their findings showed that stormwater infiltration led to a rise in groundwater recharge due to an increase in infiltration volume and a reduction of evapotranspiration a shortcoming of the previous studies is that they have not used a model representing vegetation unsaturated zone fluxes and groundwater flow together this presents a significant knowledge gap to investigate the role of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream a hydrological model is needed with the capability to simulate groundwater flow unsaturated zone flow and evapotranspiration to address this knowledge gap we used mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 which is a hydrological model simulating surface water unsaturated zone and groundwater flow together with evaporation and transpiration this study employed mike she to model hydrological processes downstream of a large infiltration basin this study aims to predict the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater we aimed to build on previous modelling studies through direct prediction of plant water loss using a calibrated mike she model we base the modelling on a real life infiltration basin which has been the subject of several empirical studies we specifically aim to answer the following questions 1 how much infiltrated stormwater is consumed by downslope vegetation 2 how much increase can be expected in the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream in the absence of vegetation 3 to what degree is evapotranspiration enhanced in the presence of infiltrated stormwater 2 materials and methods we aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on the fate of water and groundwater flow downslope of a stormwater infiltration basin to do this we used mike she to model the major processes in the hydrologic cycle including interception evapotranspiration overland flow vadose zone and saturated zone the model was constructed based on a well monitored infiltration basin described below 2 1 study area the infiltration basin hereafter the basin used in this study is in a peri urban area in the east of melbourne australia fig 1 the basin has a surface area of 1800 m2 and receives water from 5 ha of impervious area it features a vegetated filter which is made up of loamy sand 300 mm coarser sandy transition layers 200 mm and scoria 500 mm the native soil that underlies the basin and across the study site is a heavy clay bonneau et al 2018b there is an underdrain at the base of the filter which is connected to a compound outlet structure via an elevated pipe such a design promotes seepage from the basin to the surrounding subsurface and also improves the water quality treatment performance of the system a grated lid on the outlet structure collects untreated overflows from the basin water from the outlet is conveyed to a nearby receiving water 80 m away via conventional stormwater pipes the vegetation on the hillslope between the basin and receiving water is a sclerophyll forest dominated by deep rooted vegetation such as eucalyptus obliqua bedrock depth is estimated to be between 5 and 10 m based on bores drilled at and near the site bonneau et al 2018b and is assumed to be parallel to the surface topography with a 0 06 m m 1 south north gradient from the basin to the stream the basin was the subject of an intensive field based monitoring effort over 4 years bonneau et al 2018b bonneau et al 2018b installed a series of shallow monitoring bores to understand groundwater dynamics and the fate of infiltrated stormwater downstream of the basin our study used the data obtained from two bores located in the basin termed here filter mid and near the stream downslope 72 to define the boundary conditions in the hydrological model another three bores located between the basin and stream downslope 17 downslope 30 and downslope 48 were used to calibrate and validate the model fig 1 we then used the calibrated and validated model to investigate various scenarios to understand the fate of infiltrated stormwater under different conditions 2 2 model description mike she is a physically based modelling system that either uses richards equation gravity flow or a two

lowest proportion of total evapotranspiration in the study site 2 3 model setup a 1 m grid resolution digital elevation model dem was used to define the surface topography it was also used to generate the bedrock boundary which was assumed to be 10 m deep and parallel to the surface topography the model domain was 82 m 84 m and cells size is 0 5 m leading to 27 552 computational points per layer based on the soil information of the site a regolith depth of 10 m was assumed and discretized into layers which are 0 2 m thick for 0 1 m depth then 1 m thick to bedrock for the upslope and downslope boundaries time varying fixed head boundary conditions were applied in the whole saturated zone the upstream time varying fixed head boundary coincided with and represented the infiltration basin the under drain which permits the filtered water to enter the stormwater network has been implicitly considered in the model as groundwater heads were used to specify the upslope boundary condition and underdrain controls the heads the water from underdrain was excluded from bonneau et al 2018b study as the underdrain is connected to stormwater network the said study also explains the installation of monitoring bores and calibration of loggers fig 1 the boundary conditions on either side of the hillslope and at the bedrock were no flow boundaries the bedrock has a very low conductivity compared to overlaying material based on the soil distribution soil particles behroozi et al 2020 the atmospheric inputs into the model are precipitation measured at the basin and reference evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith smith et al 1998 method using the data obtained from the queensland government silo spatially interpolated database http www longpaddock qld gov au silo the model outputs included actual evapotranspiration and its components as well as the inflow of stormwater from the infiltration basin into the groundwater table and outflow from the downslope boundary the data set was divided into two parts for calibration 1 july 2015 30 jun 2018 and validation 1 july 2018 30 jun 2019 the model was run for two years before the beginning of the calibration as the warm up period to make sure that the results are not affected by initial conditions for the warm up period we used the hydrosight model peterson and western 2018 which is a statistical toolbox to generate a quantitative understanding and hydrographs from groundwater observational data to simulate groundwater level for the downslope boundary condition from 1 july 2013 to 30 jun 2015 using precipitation and reference evapotranspiration time series data using the hydrosight model provided the opportunity of more fully using available observation data for calibration and validation purposes observational data were available for the upslope boundary condition for the warm up period we used the hydrosight model to generate head boundary time series for the warm up period because of the relative short data series available and hence the desire to use all observation data for calibration and validation calibration of hydrosight showed that it is able to reproduce groundwater level variations at the downslope boundary condition well fig 8 in supplementary material as observed heads at the downstream boundary were available during the calibration and validation periods we only used hydrosight to simulate the groundwater levels for the warm up period two warm up scenarios were applied to ensure that the initial condition did not affect the simulation the initial depth of groundwater was set 0 5 m from the surface for the first scenario and the second scenario had the initial groundwater table at 2 m depth from the surface after two years of simulation checking the water level and subsurface storage indicated that the results are almost identical suggesting the simulation was not affected by the initial condition after the warm up period for the calibrations the two year warm up period was run followed by the calibration period at daily time scale the short gaps in the data for bore downslope 72 as downslope boundary condition when the bore dried was filled by linear interpolation the preliminary values for parameters used in the saturated zone e g saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from bonneau et al 2018b and soil particle size distributions behroozi et al 2020 were used to generate the soil moisture retention curve using usda rosetta soil classes schaap et al 2001 table 1 provides the van genuchten parameters van genuchten 1980 for soil water characteristic curves used the vegetation parameters were set to suggested values from kristensen and jensen 1975 for the forest area and were calibrated to select the most sensitive parameters for the calibration purpose we performed a sensitivity analysis 1 july 2015 30 jun 2018 table 2 shows the list of parameters used in the sensitivity analysis in which each parameter was changed by 20 of their initial values while the other parameters remain unchanged evapotranspiration parameters along with the hydraulic conductivity were included through sensitivity analysis because this study aimed to model the interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater moving towards the stream in addition 20 change in the values of the parameters of their initial values was chosen as it is commonly used in the literature e g azarnivand et al 2020 fa√∫ndez urbina et al 2020 moustadraf et al 2008 for each parameter the range of change in evapotranspiration and outflow from the downslope boundary were calculated the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that hydraulic conductivity was the most sensitive parameter followed by aroot and c3 while it was sensitive the hydraulic conductivity remained was held constant during the calibration at a value that reproduced the seepage from the infiltration basin this value of hydraulic conductivity is a physically based value estimated by bonneau et al 2018b this was because the inflow from the upslope boundary was known through observations from the basin bonneau et al 2018b by fixing the hydraulic conductivity this water input could be kept approximately constant we used two different data sets for the calibration 1 observed groundwater level in the bores located between the basin and stream and 2 tree water use the sap flow data could not be used directly to estimate tree water use as it measures sap flow velocity which must then be scaled up to the individual plant and then to the forest stand thus we estimated stand level transpiration using the relation proposed by gharun et al 2013 from a eucalyptus forest after first comparing that relationship with the sap flow time series the relation between tree water use and vapour pressure deficit is expressed below gharun et al 2013 8 e c 0 37 l n v p d 1 09 where vpd is vapour pressure deficit kpa and e c is canopy transpiration mm day fig 2 shows the relation between transpiration calculated by eq 8 and sap flux data measured downslope of the basin at the studied site for a specific period more information on sap flux measurement is available in western et al 2021 fig 2 indicates that sap flux data is linearly proportional to predictions of transpiration from eq 8 therefore we used eq 8 to estimate transpiration in the calibration period and included this in the calibration objective to improve transpiration simulation in the model root zone depth was assumed to be 1500 mm in the model on the basis of gharun et al 2013 as a high proportion of eucalyptus tree roots exist in the top layer of soil falkiner et al 2006 in the calibration phase we set parameter boundaries for aroot that generate a high proportion of the root mass being close to the ground surface in the top 20 cm five parameters lai c1 c2 c3 c int and aroot were selected for the automated calibration we used shuffled complex evolution duan et al 1993 which has been widely employed for the automated calibration of hydrological models e g li et al 2019 madsen 2003 to fit the selected parameters the objective function was the summation of the root mean square error rmse of groundwater depth m in bore downslope 17 downslope 30 downslope 48 and transpiration mm in the location of bore downslope 30 through the calibration the formulation of rmse for each individual time series is as follows 9 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n we used several other performance criteria to further evaluate model performance during the calibration and validation period including the willmott index of agreement ioa willmott 1981 and mean absolute error mae the formulation of ioa and mae are 10 ioa 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 11 mae i 1 n o i s i n where o s and o are observed simulated and the average of observed data respectively and n is the number of observations these three metrics rmse ioa and mae were chosen because each of those provides distinct information to evaluate the model performance the rmse is of interest when large errors are particularly undesirable while the mae measures the errors when all differences are weighted equally in the average the index of agreement is able to detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances however it is excessively sensitive to extreme values because of the use of squared differences the agreement value can vary from 0 to 1 where 1 means the perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement 2 4 scenarios to assess the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater we calculated the inflow from the upslope boundary and outflow from the downslope boundary using the calibrated model in the presence and absence of vegetation for the scenario with no vegetation the leaf area index was set at zero which represented bare land with no transpiration downslope of the basin to capture the role of vegetation we used the ratio of outflow from downslope boundary condition divided by the inflow of infiltrated stormwater which recharges groundwater table this represents the proportion of infiltrated stormwater recharging the baseflow downslope finally we compared the time series of this metric to evaluate the impact of vegetation on the amount of stormwater reaching the stream baseflow we also investigated the role of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration to do that we ran the model with a no flow boundary condition at the upslope boundary which previously represented the infiltrated stormwater from the basin we used a no flow boundary condition in this scenario as monitoring bores located upslope of the infiltration basin were dry during the simulation period suggesting little if any lateral flow from upslope we then predicted evapotranspiration in this condition and compared it with the amount of evapotranspiration in the presence of the infiltration basin 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the results of calibration and validation for depth to groundwater in the bores located between the basin and stream are reported in table 3 and fig 3 there was good agreement between simulated and observed groundwater depths in bores downslope 17 downslope 30 and downslope 48 fig 3 with the model able to capture the groundwater dynamics reasonably well in addition the values of rmse for depth to groundwater were similar to or better than other studies e g kidmose et al 2015 locatelli et al 2017 the results indicated that the model was able to simulate groundwater depth at bore downslope 30 better than the other two bores the transpiration results through calibration and validation are shown in table 3 fig 4 shows that transpiration is the most important component of evapotranspiration and both show a strong seasonal behaviour the modelled transpiration follows the fluctuations of sapflux data reasonably albeit with a higher relative amplitude of seasonal variation and perhaps an earlier summer peak although the sapflux data is somewhat limited in the length of observations nevertheless the model performance on predicting the transpiration is satisfactory the values of parameters after calibration are listed in table 4 as explained in section 2 3 five parameters were included in the automated calibration while the hydraulic conductivity was set manually so that the inflow at the upslope boundary matched the measured volume of infiltrated stormwater we used several performance criteria to evaluate the model table 3 the results showed that the model produces a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated data and therefore suitable to investigate the scenarios in addition the results indicate that the model captured the overall dynamics well and thus could be used to reliably answer our research questions those are addressed in section 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 water balance and evapotranspiration components there were two sources of water entering the model the first source was the inflow from the upslope boundary which represents the amount of infiltrated stormwater the results showed that an average of approximately 357 m3month 1 infiltrated stormwater entered the modelling domain from the basin this was achieved through the manual calibration by altering the saturated hydraulic conductivity until inflow from the upslope boundary was approximately the observed volume of infiltrated stormwater bonneau et al 2018b fig 9 in supplementary material the final value then remained unchanged through the automated calibration the second source was precipitation which was measured in the studied site to calculate water balance components rainfall was multiplied by the plan area of the model domain indicating that an average of 442 m3month 1 of precipitation entered the model stormwater infiltration added an additional 80 of water on top of precipitation evapotranspiration and outflow from the downslope boundary condition were the two outputs of water from the model average evapotranspiration was 480 m3month 1 evapotranspiration showed a seasonal fluctuation outflow from the downslope boundary of the model was an average of about 319 m3month 1 this suggests that evapotranspiration was greater than the downstream outflow and greater than the precipitation therefore it can be concluded that some proportion of stormwater infiltration was consumed or intercepted by the trees downslope of the basin we used the model to estimate the various components of evapotranspiration transpiration evaporation and canopy evaporation our goal was to capture the importance of transpiration downslope by calculating the proportion of transpiration in evapotranspiration transpiration which was around 72 percent of total evapotranspiration made the highest contribution to evapotranspiration followed by interception loss which was about 24 percent of total evapotranspiration as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows a time series of vapour pressure deficit and modelled transpiration during the simulation period which indicates that the modelled transpiration time series approximately follows the fluctuations of vapour pressure deficit vpd time series although the annual peak is slightly earlier than for vpd and interception loss shows similar behaviour to precipitation 3 3 the impact of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater we used the model to investigate the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater fig 6 shows that the outflow from the downslope boundary increased when there was no vegetation downslope this is due in part to reduced zero transpiration another source of difference relates to greater precipitation reaching the ground surface as there is no interception loss and hence greater infiltration which also contributes to the increased downstream outflow it can also be seen that the seasonality of evapotranspiration affected the proportion of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream there is a tendency for higher outflows in spring sep nov and lower outflows in autumn mar jun from the downslope boundary although it is quite variable from month to month 3 4 the role of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration infiltrated stormwater may alter the amount of actual evapotranspiration downslope of infiltration basins we investigated this impact by comparing simulations with and without upstream inflow from the infiltration basin in the absence of infiltrated stormwater the average evapotranspiration decreased by 13 percent this was mostly in the warmer months after the annual peak in evapotranspiration fig 7 evapotranspiration decreased significantly during summer 2016 and 2019 while this decrease was moderate during summer 2017 and 2018 the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration was almost zero in winters during the period of study removing infiltration from the model leads to differences in evapotranspiration that occur due to longer periods of lower soil moisture availability which reduces transpiration fig 7 shows that the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration at downslope 48 ds48 is smaller than at downslope 17 ds17 this is because a large portion of the infiltrated stormwater is consumed by the trees located upslope of the bore downslope 48 4 discussion 4 1 interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater the results showed that there is a clear interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater in the simulations the amount of evapotranspiration was 480 m3month 1 and 420 m3month 1 in presence and absence of infiltration basin respectively 13 decrease in evapotranspiration in the absence of the basin therefore it can be concluded that 60 m3month 1 infiltrated stormwater is consumed by vegetation downslope these results show a clear interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater while hamel et al 2011 reported that water consumed by shallow rooted vegetation is not increased in the presence of a small rain garden in melbourne australia this may be because hamel et al 2011 investigated shallow rooted vegetation in wet climatic conditions where there was high soil water availability while we simulated this interaction in the presence of deep rooted vegetation along with climatic conditions where pet significantly exceeded rainfall however the interplay of factors like slope hydraulic conductivity the depth of roots and climate data influences the interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater this may change the flow patterns of infiltrated stormwater and affect the impact of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater in addition the modelling results indicated that the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream increases 17 when there is no vegetation downslope of the infiltration basin 319 m3month 1 and 375 m3month 1 in presence and absence of vegetation respectively the modelling results also indicated that evapotranspiration is enhanced in presence of infiltrated stormwater evapotranspiration decreased 13 on average over the simulation period 1 july 2015 30 june 2019 when there was no infiltration basin upslope the trees consumed infiltrated stormwater during the summer and autumn months when water availability is reduced in the absence of the infiltration basin the water availability decreases and trees can consume less water evapotranspiration remained unchanged during the colder months as soil water availability was not limiting the tree water use fig 7 shows that the amount of evapotranspiration is higher in locations closer to the basin the spatial variation in evapotranspiration is characterized by decreasing rates as you move from the basin to the stream this corresponds with the spatial variation in depth to groundwater which increases with distance downslope of the basin indicating that smaller depth to groundwater increases transpiration of infiltrated stormwater at this site the stream is incised and trees near the stream may not intercept the groundwater if the aim of tree planting in association with infiltration is to increase evapotranspiration targeting areas with shallow groundwater is likely to maximize transpiration of infiltrated water where this occurs will depend on the hydrogeological properties of the slope and may be either near the basin where groundwater is generally deep e g due to incised streams or near the stream if groundwater is forced to the surface to discharge into the local stream thus some site specific hydrogeological information is likely important for robust design 4 2 implications this modelling study found that the vegetation downslope of infiltration based measures can play a substantial role on the fate of infiltrated stormwater this has important implications for the design of stormwater infiltration strategies if a goal is to restore lost urban baseflows to maximize the amount of infiltrated stormwater which reaches the stream it is preferable to locate the basins close to the waterway to avoid water loss through evapotranspiration or in locations with limited deep rooted vegetation along flow paths between the infiltration basin and stream this sort of idea has been proposed by the cooperative research centre for water sensitive cities in melbourne australia https watersensitivecities org au wp content uploads 2017 02 officer case study v1 pdf in the form of riparian infiltration sponges infiltrated stormwater can increase the water availability in the root zone grey et al 2018 and increase tree growth mullaney et al 2015 it also increases evapotranspiration these effects lead to a wide range of economic social and environmental benefits such as reducing urban temperature zhou and shepherd 2010 and improving air quality tallis et al 2011 in addition the infiltrated stormwater from the basin may provide a better opportunity for tree growth compared with waterlogged conditions observed in tree pits without underdrains ngan 2012 or with the presence of an underdrain coupled with the high hydraulic conductivity of the biofiltration media payne et al 2014 these benefits may be important outcomes from a stormwater infiltration strategy this depends in part on the other supplies of water to trees such as precipitation in situations where trees already have sufficient access to enough water in urban landscapes for example from sufficiently high precipitation transpiration may not be increased by redirecting stormwater thom et al 2020 conversely if the water is limited around the root zone trees may consume extra water supplied by infiltrated stormwater moreover deep rooted vegetation may enhance stormwater infiltration in areas where infiltration is limited by shallow groundwater levels 4 3 modelling in this study model simulations of the evapotranspiration components are consistent with other studies the dominant component of evapotranspiration was transpiration at around 71 percent of actual evapotranspiration similar behaviour has also been reported by other studies e g mitchell et al 2010 furthermore evapotranspiration decreased nearly 13 percent where there is no infiltrated stormwater mostly in the warmer months the seasonality of evapotranspiration and transpiration was noticeable which is largely a response to seasonality in potential evapotranspiration but is also modulated by soil moisture in the surrounding soil to some extent the results indicated that the interception loss was around 24 percent of precipitation which is consistent with the 15 to 30 range suggested by baker and attiwill 1987 and mitchell et al 2010 in forested areas the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in table 2 indicate that with the change of parameters and site conditions the results also potentially are altered the change of evapotranspiration parameters slightly changes the outflow from the model while altering the hydraulic conductivity changes the results substantially if the hydraulic conductivity of soil increases more infiltrated stormwater reaches the stream and subsequently the impact of evapotranspiration on infiltrated stormwater decreases 4 4 limitations uncertainty around input data also is one of the areas of concern in this study leaf area index was one of the sources of uncertainty lai was estimated through calibration rather than measurement the estimated value of 4 2 falls well within the typical range reported by studies conducted in victoria australia gharun et al 2013 nolan et al 2014 in addition lack of bedrock topography data led to an assumed depth to bedrock which might have affected the results we assumed that bedrock is 10 m deep and set the hydraulic conductivity so that the simulated infiltrated stormwater entering from upslope boundary matched the amount of infiltrated stormwater observed at the basin this ensure the correct volume of water was entering the model from the infiltration basin which we felt would improve reliability to examine the uncertainty around this assumption we ran the model when depth to bedrock was halved 5 m and hydraulic conductivity doubled this was done to keep transmissivity constant through this analysis the result showed that evapotranspiration decreases 2 in this sensitivity analysis this shows that the impact of bedrock depth uncertainty on evapotranspiration is small the most critical disadvantage of mike she is that the unsaturated flow is assumed to be vertical this assumption leads to a reduction of computational burden and works for most applications however it may bring some limitations in situations where lateral flow occurs within the root zone such as on steep hill slopes jaber and shukla 2012 and may have affected the results however modelling shallow groundwater is challenging and other studies e g azarnivand et al 2020 dean et al 2016 using models such as cathy have shown that that model also displayed similar behaviour in terms of reduced performance for simulation the depth to groundwater where the groundwater table is near to the ground 5 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater from the basin to the stream to do this we used a modelling approach employing mike she we calibrated the model against the groundwater levels downslope of an infiltration basin where groundwater levels in a bore network have been monitored for four years we then used the calibrated model to 1 predict the increase in the amount infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream baseflow in absence of downslope vegetation and 2 predict the amount of infiltrated stormwater consumed by downslope vegetation and the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration downslope of the basin to achieve the first goal we investigated a scenario using the calibrated model with no vegetation downslope of the basin the results of this scenario showed that the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream baseflow increase by 17 in the absence of vegetation there was a slight variation in increase between the warmer and colder months but the difference was not substantial we also investigated a scenario to estimate the change in evapotranspiration when there was no basin or infiltrated stormwater there was a decrease of 13 in evapotranspiration mostly in the warmer months when there was no infiltration basin this suggests that infiltrated stormwater could provide a range of microclimate benefits such as urban cooling the results also suggested that to recharge the stream baseflow it is best to implement infiltration systems where there is no deep rooted vegetation between the basin and receiving stream declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

3559,a major problem associated with sealing native soils with impervious surfaces in urban areas is reduced groundwater recharge this in turn reduces stream baseflows which has serious implications for freshwater ecosystems to address this problem the use of stormwater infiltration systems is becoming increasingly common worldwide there is however substantial uncertainty on the fate of infiltrated stormwater and its interactions with downslope vegetation this study aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream a model using mike she was constructed calibrated and validated based on a real infiltration system which features extensive vegetation between the site of stormwater infiltration and the stream we then used the calibrated model to predict the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream in the absence of vegetation we also predicted the impact of infiltrated stormwater on the evapotranspiration downslope of the system the results showed that the performance of the model was satisfactory and the model captured the overall groundwater dynamic very well the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream increased by about 17 percent in the absence of vegetation the model also predicted that evapotranspiration would be 13 percent lower in the warmer months if stormwater was not infiltrated upslope the results suggest that the choice of location of infiltration systems should consider the potential of vegetation to intercept infiltrated water and impact on achievement of the design objectives which in this case included restoring baseflow where increasing the baseflows is not a priority the increased evapotranspiration afforded by stormwater infiltration could provide important microclimate benefits keywords stormwater infiltration evapotranspiration modelling urban baseflow 1 introduction urbanization alters the hydrologic regime of catchments the replacement of native soil with impervious surfaces such as roofs and roads leads to increased surface runoff volumes fletcher et al 2013 countered by reduced evapotranspiration and infiltration arnold and gibbons 1996 this leads to a decrease in groundwater recharge and subsequently stream baseflow hardison et al 2009 leopold 1968 rose and peters 2001 stream baseflow is a key driver of freshwater ecosystems bunn and arthington 2002 and its alteration has been implicated in reduced ecological condition in a number of studies menci√≥ and mas pla 2010 rolls et al 2012 while in some urban areas rising groundwater tables have been reported due to anthropogenic factors e g leaking water mains howard and israfilov 2002 lerner 2002 a significant and more universal impact of impervious surfaces is reduced groundwater recharge this explains why various modelling studies e g ke√üler et al 2012 shuster and rhea 2013 have concluded that groundwater recharge is reduced due to urbanization erickson and stefan 2009 developed three models to investigate the change of groundwater recharge in a watershed in minnesota under urban development they predicted that groundwater recharge will decline as urbanization increases to address the problem of reduced stream baseflows in urban areas the use of stormwater infiltration systems is becoming increasingly common worldwide walsh et al 2012 a range of different infiltration based measures exist e g rain gardens infiltration trenches etc and are commonly used as part of sustainable stormwater management approaches e g water sensitive urban design wsud and low impact development lid fletcher et al 2013 these measures capture stormwater runoff from upstream urban areas and infiltrate a portion of inflows into local soils by recharging groundwater it is thought that downstream baseflows are increased bonneau et al 2018a the few empirical studies which have investigated baseflow responses to the use of infiltration based measures have observed both positive effects bhaskar et al 2016 and no effect fanelli et al 2017 an important shortcoming of these catchment scale studies is that they reveal limited information on the fate of infiltrated stormwater in fact bonneau et al 2018b highlighted that the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains highly uncertain and is a topic requiring further research while the physical properties of the hillslope likely play the dominant role on the fate of infiltrated stormwater interactions with 1 underground urban infrastructure as well as 2 downslope vegetation could be critically important the former relates to the highly permeable material covering underground pipes which can cause preferential flow paths this phenomenon also termed the urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 can potentially intercept up to 95 percent of infiltrated stormwater poozan et al 2020 depending on the layout of the underground pipes intercepted water could still find its way to the receiving water as baseflow or it may flow so rapidly to streams that it contributes to event flows in much the same way as subsurface stormflow does in many natural catchments in contrast water interacting with downslope vegetation could be lost from the system entirely it can be hypothesized that a range of factors influence plant water use downstream of infiltration based measures e g the depth of roots water availability and soil and hydrogeological conditions for example in the study of a small rain garden in melbourne australia designed for infiltration hamel et al 2011 found that the adjacent shallow rooted vegetation grass consumed water at rates similar to those of control plots this finding was attributed to relatively wet climatic conditions along with very low permeability of underlying soils which meant that soil moisture levels remained high throughout the study period irrespective of location it can be hypothesized that under different site conditions e g presence of deep rooted vegetation soil water stress the said study could have observed greater plant water loss associated with rain garden infiltration the testing of such hypotheses is possible using hydrological models for example locatelli et al 2017 assessed the effects of stormwater infiltration on groundwater levels and the water balance and the performance of soakaways in areas with shallow groundwater their findings showed that stormwater infiltration led to a rise in groundwater recharge due to an increase in infiltration volume and a reduction of evapotranspiration a shortcoming of the previous studies is that they have not used a model representing vegetation unsaturated zone fluxes and groundwater flow together this presents a significant knowledge gap to investigate the role of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream a hydrological model is needed with the capability to simulate groundwater flow unsaturated zone flow and evapotranspiration to address this knowledge gap we used mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 which is a hydrological model simulating surface water unsaturated zone and groundwater flow together with evaporation and transpiration this study employed mike she to model hydrological processes downstream of a large infiltration basin this study aims to predict the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater we aimed to build on previous modelling studies through direct prediction of plant water loss using a calibrated mike she model we base the modelling on a real life infiltration basin which has been the subject of several empirical studies we specifically aim to answer the following questions 1 how much infiltrated stormwater is consumed by downslope vegetation 2 how much increase can be expected in the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream in the absence of vegetation 3 to what degree is evapotranspiration enhanced in the presence of infiltrated stormwater 2 materials and methods we aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on the fate of water and groundwater flow downslope of a stormwater infiltration basin to do this we used mike she to model the major processes in the hydrologic cycle including interception evapotranspiration overland flow vadose zone and saturated zone the model was constructed based on a well monitored infiltration basin described below 2 1 study area the infiltration basin hereafter the basin used in this study is in a peri urban area in the east of melbourne australia fig 1 the basin has a surface area of 1800 m2 and receives water from 5 ha of impervious area it features a vegetated filter which is made up of loamy sand 300 mm coarser sandy transition layers 200 mm and scoria 500 mm the native soil that underlies the basin and across the study site is a heavy clay bonneau et al 2018b there is an underdrain at the base of the filter which is connected to a compound outlet structure via an elevated pipe such a design promotes seepage from the basin to the surrounding subsurface and also improves the water quality treatment performance of the system a grated lid on the outlet structure collects untreated overflows from the basin water from the outlet is conveyed to a nearby receiving water 80 m away via conventional stormwater pipes the vegetation on the hillslope between the basin and receiving water is a sclerophyll forest dominated by deep rooted vegetation such as eucalyptus obliqua bedrock depth is estimated to be between 5 and 10 m based on bores drilled at and near the site bonneau et al 2018b and is assumed to be parallel to the surface topography with a 0 06 m m 1 south north gradient from the basin to the stream the basin was the subject of an intensive field based monitoring effort over 4 years bonneau et al 2018b bonneau et al 2018b installed a series of shallow monitoring bores to understand groundwater dynamics and the fate of infiltrated stormwater downstream of the basin our study used the data obtained from two bores located in the basin termed here filter mid and near the stream downslope 72 to define the boundary conditions in the hydrological model another three bores located between the basin and stream downslope 17 downslope 30 and downslope 48 were used to calibrate and validate the model fig 1 we then used the calibrated and validated model to investigate various scenarios to understand the fate of infiltrated stormwater under different conditions 2 2 model description mike she is a physically based modelling system that either uses richards equation gravity flow or a two

lowest proportion of total evapotranspiration in the study site 2 3 model setup a 1 m grid resolution digital elevation model dem was used to define the surface topography it was also used to generate the bedrock boundary which was assumed to be 10 m deep and parallel to the surface topography the model domain was 82 m 84 m and cells size is 0 5 m leading to 27 552 computational points per layer based on the soil information of the site a regolith depth of 10 m was assumed and discretized into layers which are 0 2 m thick for 0 1 m depth then 1 m thick to bedrock for the upslope and downslope boundaries time varying fixed head boundary conditions were applied in the whole saturated zone the upstream time varying fixed head boundary coincided with and represented the infiltration basin the under drain which permits the filtered water to enter the stormwater network has been implicitly considered in the model as groundwater heads were used to specify the upslope boundary condition and underdrain controls the heads the water from underdrain was excluded from bonneau et al 2018b study as the underdrain is connected to stormwater network the said study also explains the installation of monitoring bores and calibration of loggers fig 1 the boundary conditions on either side of the hillslope and at the bedrock were no flow boundaries the bedrock has a very low conductivity compared to overlaying material based on the soil distribution soil particles behroozi et al 2020 the atmospheric inputs into the model are precipitation measured at the basin and reference evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith smith et al 1998 method using the data obtained from the queensland government silo spatially interpolated database http www longpaddock qld gov au silo the model outputs included actual evapotranspiration and its components as well as the inflow of stormwater from the infiltration basin into the groundwater table and outflow from the downslope boundary the data set was divided into two parts for calibration 1 july 2015 30 jun 2018 and validation 1 july 2018 30 jun 2019 the model was run for two years before the beginning of the calibration as the warm up period to make sure that the results are not affected by initial conditions for the warm up period we used the hydrosight model peterson and western 2018 which is a statistical toolbox to generate a quantitative understanding and hydrographs from groundwater observational data to simulate groundwater level for the downslope boundary condition from 1 july 2013 to 30 jun 2015 using precipitation and reference evapotranspiration time series data using the hydrosight model provided the opportunity of more fully using available observation data for calibration and validation purposes observational data were available for the upslope boundary condition for the warm up period we used the hydrosight model to generate head boundary time series for the warm up period because of the relative short data series available and hence the desire to use all observation data for calibration and validation calibration of hydrosight showed that it is able to reproduce groundwater level variations at the downslope boundary condition well fig 8 in supplementary material as observed heads at the downstream boundary were available during the calibration and validation periods we only used hydrosight to simulate the groundwater levels for the warm up period two warm up scenarios were applied to ensure that the initial condition did not affect the simulation the initial depth of groundwater was set 0 5 m from the surface for the first scenario and the second scenario had the initial groundwater table at 2 m depth from the surface after two years of simulation checking the water level and subsurface storage indicated that the results are almost identical suggesting the simulation was not affected by the initial condition after the warm up period for the calibrations the two year warm up period was run followed by the calibration period at daily time scale the short gaps in the data for bore downslope 72 as downslope boundary condition when the bore dried was filled by linear interpolation the preliminary values for parameters used in the saturated zone e g saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from bonneau et al 2018b and soil particle size distributions behroozi et al 2020 were used to generate the soil moisture retention curve using usda rosetta soil classes schaap et al 2001 table 1 provides the van genuchten parameters van genuchten 1980 for soil water characteristic curves used the vegetation parameters were set to suggested values from kristensen and jensen 1975 for the forest area and were calibrated to select the most sensitive parameters for the calibration purpose we performed a sensitivity analysis 1 july 2015 30 jun 2018 table 2 shows the list of parameters used in the sensitivity analysis in which each parameter was changed by 20 of their initial values while the other parameters remain unchanged evapotranspiration parameters along with the hydraulic conductivity were included through sensitivity analysis because this study aimed to model the interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater moving towards the stream in addition 20 change in the values of the parameters of their initial values was chosen as it is commonly used in the literature e g azarnivand et al 2020 fa√∫ndez urbina et al 2020 moustadraf et al 2008 for each parameter the range of change in evapotranspiration and outflow from the downslope boundary were calculated the results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that hydraulic conductivity was the most sensitive parameter followed by aroot and c3 while it was sensitive the hydraulic conductivity remained was held constant during the calibration at a value that reproduced the seepage from the infiltration basin this value of hydraulic conductivity is a physically based value estimated by bonneau et al 2018b this was because the inflow from the upslope boundary was known through observations from the basin bonneau et al 2018b by fixing the hydraulic conductivity this water input could be kept approximately constant we used two different data sets for the calibration 1 observed groundwater level in the bores located between the basin and stream and 2 tree water use the sap flow data could not be used directly to estimate tree water use as it measures sap flow velocity which must then be scaled up to the individual plant and then to the forest stand thus we estimated stand level transpiration using the relation proposed by gharun et al 2013 from a eucalyptus forest after first comparing that relationship with the sap flow time series the relation between tree water use and vapour pressure deficit is expressed below gharun et al 2013 8 e c 0 37 l n v p d 1 09 where vpd is vapour pressure deficit kpa and e c is canopy transpiration mm day fig 2 shows the relation between transpiration calculated by eq 8 and sap flux data measured downslope of the basin at the studied site for a specific period more information on sap flux measurement is available in western et al 2021 fig 2 indicates that sap flux data is linearly proportional to predictions of transpiration from eq 8 therefore we used eq 8 to estimate transpiration in the calibration period and included this in the calibration objective to improve transpiration simulation in the model root zone depth was assumed to be 1500 mm in the model on the basis of gharun et al 2013 as a high proportion of eucalyptus tree roots exist in the top layer of soil falkiner et al 2006 in the calibration phase we set parameter boundaries for aroot that generate a high proportion of the root mass being close to the ground surface in the top 20 cm five parameters lai c1 c2 c3 c int and aroot were selected for the automated calibration we used shuffled complex evolution duan et al 1993 which has been widely employed for the automated calibration of hydrological models e g li et al 2019 madsen 2003 to fit the selected parameters the objective function was the summation of the root mean square error rmse of groundwater depth m in bore downslope 17 downslope 30 downslope 48 and transpiration mm in the location of bore downslope 30 through the calibration the formulation of rmse for each individual time series is as follows 9 rmse i 1 n o i s i 2 n we used several other performance criteria to further evaluate model performance during the calibration and validation period including the willmott index of agreement ioa willmott 1981 and mean absolute error mae the formulation of ioa and mae are 10 ioa 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 11 mae i 1 n o i s i n where o s and o are observed simulated and the average of observed data respectively and n is the number of observations these three metrics rmse ioa and mae were chosen because each of those provides distinct information to evaluate the model performance the rmse is of interest when large errors are particularly undesirable while the mae measures the errors when all differences are weighted equally in the average the index of agreement is able to detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances however it is excessively sensitive to extreme values because of the use of squared differences the agreement value can vary from 0 to 1 where 1 means the perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement 2 4 scenarios to assess the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater we calculated the inflow from the upslope boundary and outflow from the downslope boundary using the calibrated model in the presence and absence of vegetation for the scenario with no vegetation the leaf area index was set at zero which represented bare land with no transpiration downslope of the basin to capture the role of vegetation we used the ratio of outflow from downslope boundary condition divided by the inflow of infiltrated stormwater which recharges groundwater table this represents the proportion of infiltrated stormwater recharging the baseflow downslope finally we compared the time series of this metric to evaluate the impact of vegetation on the amount of stormwater reaching the stream baseflow we also investigated the role of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration to do that we ran the model with a no flow boundary condition at the upslope boundary which previously represented the infiltrated stormwater from the basin we used a no flow boundary condition in this scenario as monitoring bores located upslope of the infiltration basin were dry during the simulation period suggesting little if any lateral flow from upslope we then predicted evapotranspiration in this condition and compared it with the amount of evapotranspiration in the presence of the infiltration basin 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the results of calibration and validation for depth to groundwater in the bores located between the basin and stream are reported in table 3 and fig 3 there was good agreement between simulated and observed groundwater depths in bores downslope 17 downslope 30 and downslope 48 fig 3 with the model able to capture the groundwater dynamics reasonably well in addition the values of rmse for depth to groundwater were similar to or better than other studies e g kidmose et al 2015 locatelli et al 2017 the results indicated that the model was able to simulate groundwater depth at bore downslope 30 better than the other two bores the transpiration results through calibration and validation are shown in table 3 fig 4 shows that transpiration is the most important component of evapotranspiration and both show a strong seasonal behaviour the modelled transpiration follows the fluctuations of sapflux data reasonably albeit with a higher relative amplitude of seasonal variation and perhaps an earlier summer peak although the sapflux data is somewhat limited in the length of observations nevertheless the model performance on predicting the transpiration is satisfactory the values of parameters after calibration are listed in table 4 as explained in section 2 3 five parameters were included in the automated calibration while the hydraulic conductivity was set manually so that the inflow at the upslope boundary matched the measured volume of infiltrated stormwater we used several performance criteria to evaluate the model table 3 the results showed that the model produces a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated data and therefore suitable to investigate the scenarios in addition the results indicate that the model captured the overall dynamics well and thus could be used to reliably answer our research questions those are addressed in section 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 water balance and evapotranspiration components there were two sources of water entering the model the first source was the inflow from the upslope boundary which represents the amount of infiltrated stormwater the results showed that an average of approximately 357 m3month 1 infiltrated stormwater entered the modelling domain from the basin this was achieved through the manual calibration by altering the saturated hydraulic conductivity until inflow from the upslope boundary was approximately the observed volume of infiltrated stormwater bonneau et al 2018b fig 9 in supplementary material the final value then remained unchanged through the automated calibration the second source was precipitation which was measured in the studied site to calculate water balance components rainfall was multiplied by the plan area of the model domain indicating that an average of 442 m3month 1 of precipitation entered the model stormwater infiltration added an additional 80 of water on top of precipitation evapotranspiration and outflow from the downslope boundary condition were the two outputs of water from the model average evapotranspiration was 480 m3month 1 evapotranspiration showed a seasonal fluctuation outflow from the downslope boundary of the model was an average of about 319 m3month 1 this suggests that evapotranspiration was greater than the downstream outflow and greater than the precipitation therefore it can be concluded that some proportion of stormwater infiltration was consumed or intercepted by the trees downslope of the basin we used the model to estimate the various components of evapotranspiration transpiration evaporation and canopy evaporation our goal was to capture the importance of transpiration downslope by calculating the proportion of transpiration in evapotranspiration transpiration which was around 72 percent of total evapotranspiration made the highest contribution to evapotranspiration followed by interception loss which was about 24 percent of total evapotranspiration as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows a time series of vapour pressure deficit and modelled transpiration during the simulation period which indicates that the modelled transpiration time series approximately follows the fluctuations of vapour pressure deficit vpd time series although the annual peak is slightly earlier than for vpd and interception loss shows similar behaviour to precipitation 3 3 the impact of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater we used the model to investigate the role of vegetation on the fate of infiltrated stormwater fig 6 shows that the outflow from the downslope boundary increased when there was no vegetation downslope this is due in part to reduced zero transpiration another source of difference relates to greater precipitation reaching the ground surface as there is no interception loss and hence greater infiltration which also contributes to the increased downstream outflow it can also be seen that the seasonality of evapotranspiration affected the proportion of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream there is a tendency for higher outflows in spring sep nov and lower outflows in autumn mar jun from the downslope boundary although it is quite variable from month to month 3 4 the role of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration infiltrated stormwater may alter the amount of actual evapotranspiration downslope of infiltration basins we investigated this impact by comparing simulations with and without upstream inflow from the infiltration basin in the absence of infiltrated stormwater the average evapotranspiration decreased by 13 percent this was mostly in the warmer months after the annual peak in evapotranspiration fig 7 evapotranspiration decreased significantly during summer 2016 and 2019 while this decrease was moderate during summer 2017 and 2018 the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration was almost zero in winters during the period of study removing infiltration from the model leads to differences in evapotranspiration that occur due to longer periods of lower soil moisture availability which reduces transpiration fig 7 shows that the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration at downslope 48 ds48 is smaller than at downslope 17 ds17 this is because a large portion of the infiltrated stormwater is consumed by the trees located upslope of the bore downslope 48 4 discussion 4 1 interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater the results showed that there is a clear interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater in the simulations the amount of evapotranspiration was 480 m3month 1 and 420 m3month 1 in presence and absence of infiltration basin respectively 13 decrease in evapotranspiration in the absence of the basin therefore it can be concluded that 60 m3month 1 infiltrated stormwater is consumed by vegetation downslope these results show a clear interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater while hamel et al 2011 reported that water consumed by shallow rooted vegetation is not increased in the presence of a small rain garden in melbourne australia this may be because hamel et al 2011 investigated shallow rooted vegetation in wet climatic conditions where there was high soil water availability while we simulated this interaction in the presence of deep rooted vegetation along with climatic conditions where pet significantly exceeded rainfall however the interplay of factors like slope hydraulic conductivity the depth of roots and climate data influences the interaction between vegetation and infiltrated stormwater this may change the flow patterns of infiltrated stormwater and affect the impact of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater in addition the modelling results indicated that the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream increases 17 when there is no vegetation downslope of the infiltration basin 319 m3month 1 and 375 m3month 1 in presence and absence of vegetation respectively the modelling results also indicated that evapotranspiration is enhanced in presence of infiltrated stormwater evapotranspiration decreased 13 on average over the simulation period 1 july 2015 30 june 2019 when there was no infiltration basin upslope the trees consumed infiltrated stormwater during the summer and autumn months when water availability is reduced in the absence of the infiltration basin the water availability decreases and trees can consume less water evapotranspiration remained unchanged during the colder months as soil water availability was not limiting the tree water use fig 7 shows that the amount of evapotranspiration is higher in locations closer to the basin the spatial variation in evapotranspiration is characterized by decreasing rates as you move from the basin to the stream this corresponds with the spatial variation in depth to groundwater which increases with distance downslope of the basin indicating that smaller depth to groundwater increases transpiration of infiltrated stormwater at this site the stream is incised and trees near the stream may not intercept the groundwater if the aim of tree planting in association with infiltration is to increase evapotranspiration targeting areas with shallow groundwater is likely to maximize transpiration of infiltrated water where this occurs will depend on the hydrogeological properties of the slope and may be either near the basin where groundwater is generally deep e g due to incised streams or near the stream if groundwater is forced to the surface to discharge into the local stream thus some site specific hydrogeological information is likely important for robust design 4 2 implications this modelling study found that the vegetation downslope of infiltration based measures can play a substantial role on the fate of infiltrated stormwater this has important implications for the design of stormwater infiltration strategies if a goal is to restore lost urban baseflows to maximize the amount of infiltrated stormwater which reaches the stream it is preferable to locate the basins close to the waterway to avoid water loss through evapotranspiration or in locations with limited deep rooted vegetation along flow paths between the infiltration basin and stream this sort of idea has been proposed by the cooperative research centre for water sensitive cities in melbourne australia https watersensitivecities org au wp content uploads 2017 02 officer case study v1 pdf in the form of riparian infiltration sponges infiltrated stormwater can increase the water availability in the root zone grey et al 2018 and increase tree growth mullaney et al 2015 it also increases evapotranspiration these effects lead to a wide range of economic social and environmental benefits such as reducing urban temperature zhou and shepherd 2010 and improving air quality tallis et al 2011 in addition the infiltrated stormwater from the basin may provide a better opportunity for tree growth compared with waterlogged conditions observed in tree pits without underdrains ngan 2012 or with the presence of an underdrain coupled with the high hydraulic conductivity of the biofiltration media payne et al 2014 these benefits may be important outcomes from a stormwater infiltration strategy this depends in part on the other supplies of water to trees such as precipitation in situations where trees already have sufficient access to enough water in urban landscapes for example from sufficiently high precipitation transpiration may not be increased by redirecting stormwater thom et al 2020 conversely if the water is limited around the root zone trees may consume extra water supplied by infiltrated stormwater moreover deep rooted vegetation may enhance stormwater infiltration in areas where infiltration is limited by shallow groundwater levels 4 3 modelling in this study model simulations of the evapotranspiration components are consistent with other studies the dominant component of evapotranspiration was transpiration at around 71 percent of actual evapotranspiration similar behaviour has also been reported by other studies e g mitchell et al 2010 furthermore evapotranspiration decreased nearly 13 percent where there is no infiltrated stormwater mostly in the warmer months the seasonality of evapotranspiration and transpiration was noticeable which is largely a response to seasonality in potential evapotranspiration but is also modulated by soil moisture in the surrounding soil to some extent the results indicated that the interception loss was around 24 percent of precipitation which is consistent with the 15 to 30 range suggested by baker and attiwill 1987 and mitchell et al 2010 in forested areas the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in table 2 indicate that with the change of parameters and site conditions the results also potentially are altered the change of evapotranspiration parameters slightly changes the outflow from the model while altering the hydraulic conductivity changes the results substantially if the hydraulic conductivity of soil increases more infiltrated stormwater reaches the stream and subsequently the impact of evapotranspiration on infiltrated stormwater decreases 4 4 limitations uncertainty around input data also is one of the areas of concern in this study leaf area index was one of the sources of uncertainty lai was estimated through calibration rather than measurement the estimated value of 4 2 falls well within the typical range reported by studies conducted in victoria australia gharun et al 2013 nolan et al 2014 in addition lack of bedrock topography data led to an assumed depth to bedrock which might have affected the results we assumed that bedrock is 10 m deep and set the hydraulic conductivity so that the simulated infiltrated stormwater entering from upslope boundary matched the amount of infiltrated stormwater observed at the basin this ensure the correct volume of water was entering the model from the infiltration basin which we felt would improve reliability to examine the uncertainty around this assumption we ran the model when depth to bedrock was halved 5 m and hydraulic conductivity doubled this was done to keep transmissivity constant through this analysis the result showed that evapotranspiration decreases 2 in this sensitivity analysis this shows that the impact of bedrock depth uncertainty on evapotranspiration is small the most critical disadvantage of mike she is that the unsaturated flow is assumed to be vertical this assumption leads to a reduction of computational burden and works for most applications however it may bring some limitations in situations where lateral flow occurs within the root zone such as on steep hill slopes jaber and shukla 2012 and may have affected the results however modelling shallow groundwater is challenging and other studies e g azarnivand et al 2020 dean et al 2016 using models such as cathy have shown that that model also displayed similar behaviour in terms of reduced performance for simulation the depth to groundwater where the groundwater table is near to the ground 5 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the role of vegetation on infiltrated stormwater from the basin to the stream to do this we used a modelling approach employing mike she we calibrated the model against the groundwater levels downslope of an infiltration basin where groundwater levels in a bore network have been monitored for four years we then used the calibrated model to 1 predict the increase in the amount infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream baseflow in absence of downslope vegetation and 2 predict the amount of infiltrated stormwater consumed by downslope vegetation and the impact of infiltrated stormwater on evapotranspiration downslope of the basin to achieve the first goal we investigated a scenario using the calibrated model with no vegetation downslope of the basin the results of this scenario showed that the amount of infiltrated stormwater reaching the stream baseflow increase by 17 in the absence of vegetation there was a slight variation in increase between the warmer and colder months but the difference was not substantial we also investigated a scenario to estimate the change in evapotranspiration when there was no basin or infiltrated stormwater there was a decrease of 13 in evapotranspiration mostly in the warmer months when there was no infiltration basin this suggests that infiltrated stormwater could provide a range of microclimate benefits such as urban cooling the results also suggested that to recharge the stream baseflow it is best to implement infiltration
