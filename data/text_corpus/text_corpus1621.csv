8105,study region andes central chile 32ºs 36ºs lakes study focus mountain lakes play a key role in the terrestrial freshwater reservoir both for storage of snow melt and precipitation although lakes are sensitive to climate variability the effect of global warming on water availability remains uncertain semiarid regions are especially sensitive to relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation as these have disproportionately large impacts on lake hydrologic budgets here we mapped 12 lakes from the andes of central chile 32º 36ºs using landsat mission and sentinel 2 satellites images from 1984 to 2020 and compared these results with the available climate data precipitation temperature and evaporation new hydrological insights for the region this approach provides a high resolution temporal and spatial analysis for changes in lake surface over the last 36 years our results indicate that the number of lakes and respective surface area decrease latitudinally from south to north across central chile which is consistent the present day rainfall gradient over the study period lake surface areas decreased significantly between 7 and 25 during the so called megadrought 2010 2020 as lakes continue to dry up the implications for freshwater availability are of considerable societal and environmental importance our results can assist with water management decisions and improve our understanding of future water availability across the region keywords megadrought lakes andes of central chile freshwater availability ndwi 1 introduction climate change has intensified the earth s hydrologic cycle which has negative consequences on freshwater availability frederick and major 1997 abbaspour et al 2012 prein and pendergrass 2019 effects include reduced water resource availability intensified floods and prolonged droughts garreaud et al 2017 prein and pendergrass 2019 muñoz et al 2020 depending on duration and intensity droughts can lead to substantial decreases in soil moisture e g zhao and dai 2015 lakes e g barría et al 2021 rivers e g udall and overpeck 2017 and groundwater e g van dijk et al 2013 with important social impacts garreaud et al 2017 barría et al 2021 for example in the mediterranean region water availability is expected to decrease between 9 and 17 if temperatures increase to 1 5 and 2ºc respectively schleussner et al 2016 water is essential for life and the maintenance of ecosystems and improving our knowledge regarding how water reservoirs are impacted by ongoing climate change is crucial for water management decisions as well as mitigation lakes are important reservoirs of global freshwater and can reduce the impact of droughts through water retention during wet periods wanders et al 2015 however lakes have experienced significant changes over the last few decades due to the synergic effects of climate change and human pressures gao 2015 venegas quiñones et al 2020 fuentealba et al 2020 many questions arise regarding water mass balance for example although many mountain lakes are currently increasing due to glacier mass loss owing to rising temperatures shugar et al 2020 fuso 2021 their permanence is uncertain as glaciers will eventually disappear in the next decades in addition the lack of lake surveys and monitoring particularly in remote areas e g the andes of central chile creates additional challenges for assessing how global change effects freshwater availability and forecasting gao 2015 this lack of knowledge regarding these lakes is compounded not only by climate change but also by the lack of management and mitigation measures under current climate scenarios precisely several lakes in low lying basins of central chile aculeo and matanzas dried up very recently in the last decade because of decreasing rainfall and inefficient water use fuentealba et al 2020 venegas quiñones et al 2020 barría et al 2021 to address these issues regarding remote lakes in the andes of central chile satellite image analyses can provide useful tools the advantage of this technique is the possibility of addressing wide spatial gradients e g from global to local scales and across different geographies spanning several decades at a low cost without instrumental records shugar et al 2020 satellite image analysis has been used to estimate changes in physical and biological properties on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems crisman et al 2014 arsen et al 2014 yao et al 2019 numerous studies based on satellite images have established the changes in lake water dynamics

trends in the water bodies however data availability of interannual and seasonal variations of lakes is very limited gao 2015 landsat satellite images allow mapping water surface bodies throughout the normalized difference water index ndwi this index was developed by mcfeeters 1996 to delineate lake boundaries using reflective near infrared radiation and visible green light özelkan 2020 although the spatial resolution can oscillate between 15 and 30 m only since the 1990 s can the highest resolutions be achieved martínez mena 2017 özelkan 2020 thus a tradeoff exists between increased resolution versus temporal coverage and it is often preferable to work with a lower resolution of 30 m across a longer time series decreased resolution however means that only larger lakes can be properly analyzed regarding changes in the lake surface area here we present an interannual reconstruction of lake surface areas using landsat satellite images landsat 5 7 8 and sentinel 2 to determine the effect of climate change on high andean lakes freshwater availability from central chile 32ºs 36ºs over the last 36 years our goals were to establish how these lake surfaces varied between 1984 and 2020 and to compare these changes with the available climate data precipitation temperature and evaporation to assess different causes for these variations for this we used the ndwi to map surface water of 12 lakes which were chosen for their size surface 0 5 km2 2 study site the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs fig 1 are characterized by a mediterranean climate with cold wet winters and hot dry summers sarricolea et al 2017 shaw et al 2021 annual precipitation in the 1984 2020 period 1984 2020 increases southwards from 256 mm 32ºs to 790 mm 36ºs data accessed through

07 2021 during the last decade 2010 2020 the region between 32ºs and 37ºs has experienced a so called megadrought observed by an increase of up to 0 8 c in mean annual air temperature and a reduction of up to 40 in annual precipitation garreaud et al 2017 serrano notivoli et al 2021 shaw et al 2021 this episode seems to anticipate future conditions in this region and meanwhile projections do not show any significant recovery in the following decades muñoz et al 2020 moreover a significant part of this so called megadrought shows anthropological attributions boisier et al 2016 twelve lakes were chosen from the andes of central chile for this study table 1 fig 1 these have a surface greater than 0 5 km2 and are located at elevations from 1600 m a s l dial to 3000 m a s l chepical chepical lake 3043 m a s l is a high andean oligotrophic endorheic cold monomictic freshwater lake dammed in 1885 martel cea et al 2016 its effluent is the alicahue river that is in the upper basin of

l maule shows lower lake levels during the middle holocene 8 0 6 0 ka bp coeval with a warm dry phase described for much of southern south america frugone álvarez et al 2020 3 methodology we first surveyed all available lakes in the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs using a public database available from the dirección general de aguas dga ministry of public works republic of chile data accessed through http www dga cl estudiospublicaciones mapoteca inventarios catastro de lagos zip last modified on 5th september 2019 we then selected 12 lakes that had a surface area higher than 0 5 km2 this minimum surface area is key to achieve a more precise representation of the lakes for each year which needs to take into account that minimum pixel size from landsat satellite images is 30 m table 2 the satellite image data used in this study were downloaded using google earth engine gee a public data catalog with a multi petabyte curated collection of geospatial datasets gorelick et al 2017 the bulk of the catalog is made up of earth observing remote sensing imagery including the entire landsat archive as well as the sentinel 2 archive a total of 36 landsat images covered the 12 selected lakes for the period 1984 2020 table 2 were analyzed all images were taken during the dry season january to march to improve image quality in the absence of cloud cover all landsat and sentinel images were processed using google earth engine which delivers geometrically radiometrically and atmospherically corrected images the normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters 1996 was used to obtain the surface from selected lakes the index has the advantage of eliminating the presence of soil and terrestrial vegetation features present in the images yang et al 2015 the index calculates the difference between two image bands and applies a threshold to segment the results into two categories water and non water features to identify the lakes and is expressed as follows 1 ndwi green nir green nir the green band maximizes the reflectance of the water body while the nir band the near infrared minimizes the rest of the vegetation and soil cover yang et al 2017 the ndwi was calculated in google earth engine gee and reclassified in arcmap 10 3 using an index of 0 1 water and 1 0 other covers the climate dataset was obtained from the terraclimate repository hosted by the university of idaho s northwest knowledge network abatzoglou et al 2018 supplementary table 1 and include annual precipitation amount mean annual temperature and evapotranspiration pet this climate dataset is updated periodically as additional years become available and we considered data from 1984 to 2020 the climatic data analyzed here were extracted based on the information available that was as close as possible to the studied lakes changes in lake surfaces were analyzed using descriptive statistics mean max min and standard deviation we compare two periods from years 1984 2009 and years 2010 2020 the megadrought and applied the non parametric wilcoxon mann whitney test to see if the differences are statistically significant neuhäuser 2011 we calculate the trends of the three considered climate variables annual precipitation annual mean temperature and annual evaporation from 1984 to 2020 using the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1962 we also estimate a 5 year moving average for the climatic variables thus for example the hydrologic year of 1988 corresponds to the average of precipitation of 1987 1988 finally the climate variables were correlated with changes in lake surfaces between 1984 and 2020 4 results 4 1 regional lake distribution between 32ºs 36ºs a total of 215 lakes were surveyed in our study region and their size and number exhibit a conspicuous latitudinal gradient with an overall increase from north to south fig 2 thirty two lakes occur in the northern sector 32 33ºs and become more numerous further souths with 89 lakes at c 35ºs fig 2 a lake surfaces span between 0 005 km2 and 46 70 km2 and the largest of these is laguna del maule 36ºs most lakes n 203 have a surface area lower than 0 5 km2 fig 2 b and these add up to a total of 16 68 km2 of water surface lakes located at 32ºs and 36ºs displayed a mean surface area of 0 09 km2 0 4 and 0 1 respectively between 34ºs and 35ºs lake areas exhibit an average of 0 07 km2 0

a total of 79 3 km2 table 1 4 2 variations in lake surface area from 1984 to 2020 lake surfaces show important variations across the temporal window analyzed fig 3 chepical lake mean 0 44 km2 0 08

areas occurred in the 1980 s except for l mollera mean 0 57 km2 0 08 and l caracol mean 0 63 km2 0 16 with the lower surface areas recorded in 1995 0 41 km2 and 1999 0 29 km2 respectively dial exhibits the lowest variations during the entire period analyzed mean of 6 53 km2 0 15 oscillating from 6 87 km2 0 17 in 1994 6 36 km2 0 11 in 2013 a comparison of lake surface areas during the two considered periods 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 are summarized in table 3 the results reveal an important and significant p value 0 05 decrease during the last decade 2010 2020 especially in aguas calientes that vary from about 0 60 km2 0 16 during the 1984 2009 period to 0 45 km2 0 13 during the 2010 2020 period equivalent to 25 48 of surface loss cari launa decreased from 2 50 km2 0 17 to 1 93 km2 0 23 with a surface loss of 23 01 yeso and caracol oscillated from 0 44 km2 0 05 and 0 67 km2 0 15 respectively during the first period compared to 0 34 km2 0 05 and 0 53 km2 0 15 during the second period with a total surface reduction of 21 89 and 20 97 respectively chepical embalse el yeso laguna del inca and mollera lakes varied from 0 47 km2 0 07 8 17 km2 0 05 1 59 km2 0 14 and 0 59 km2 0 08 to 0 37 km2 0 07 6 86 km2 1 09 1 35 km2 0 14 and 0 51 km2 0 04 respectively this shows a loss of total lacustrine surface area in percentages of 20 97 19 92 14 84 13 19 respectively table 3 for the study period lakes with smaller decreases were laguna del maule 9 95 teno 6 96 and laguna negra 5 27 in contrast dial was the only lake with no clear trend with a slight decrease of 0 019 table 2 the total loss of lake surface area for the andes of central chile was c 8 73 km2 during the last 36 years with most of this loss occurring in the last 10 years among these laguna del maule was the lake that lost the most surface area 5 21 km2 although percentage wise this was not very high 4 3 climate variability from 1984 to 2020 in the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs climate data for the andes of central chile exhibits important variations during the analyzed period annual precipitation from 1984 to 2020 are based on hydrological years e g may 1983 april 1984 fig 4 a the general trend of annual rainfall estimated by the mann kendall test indicated a significant decreasing trend table 4 oscillating from 5 8 mm yr to 7 2 mm yr for all lakes except for embalse el yeso laguna del inca and laguna negra thus increased interannual variability and the presence of very wet years are observed mainly during the period of 1984 2009 with the lakes dial mean 841 210 9 mm laguna del maule 643 171 2 mm and caracol 716 205 7 mm recording the highest amounts of annual rainfall since 2010 annual rainfall has dropped noticeably at all lakes for example in the period 1984 2009 chepical lake recorded an average annual rainfall of 280 mm 161 5 and laguna del inca showed 375 2 mm 182 1 and these averages dropped to 194 83 0 and 259 0 mm 84 1 from 2010 to 2020 respectively this represents a deficit of c 31 for each lake likewise from 1984 to 2009 embalse el yeso and laguna negra recorded an average annual rainfall of 444 7 mm 190 4 and 447 0 mm 199 0 respectively which then dropped to 320 0 107 1 mm and 324 1 108 5 from 2010 to 2020 representing a deficit of 28 and 27 respectively in similar fashion mollera mean1984 2009 642 5 184 3 mm mean2010 2020 490 4 134 1 mm cari

deficit in the 2010 2020 period around 25 teno and yeso 24 mollera cari launa caracol laguna del maule and aguas calientes and 23 dial although a coincidence between precipitation and the surface areas of the studied lakes could be expected this does not have statistical support to explore the relationship between both variables we compared a 5 year moving average of annual precipitation with the lake surfaces as a result fig 5 shows a positive and significant correlation with a clear lag in lake response to rainfall input this lag is of at least two or three years from the start of dry year to the eventual decline in surface lake area figs 3 and 4 a for example since 2017 laguna del inca embalse el yeso yeso teno aguas calientes and cari launa lakes displayed a lower amount of annual precipitation fig 4 a matching the lowest lake surface observed in 2020 supplementary table 1 the annual evaporation amount recorded during the study period fig 4 b exhibits a slight and non significative positive trend table 3 supplementary figure 1 however when comparing the 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 periods there was an increasing trend of about 100 mm per year in the lakes embalse el yeso mollera chepical teno and laguna del inca thus in the 1984 2009 period embalse el yeso oscillated around to 777 2 96 mm yr mollera about of 741 0 104 mm yr and chepical lakes in a mean of 685 61 107 mm yr those lakes increased the annual evaporation during the 2010 2020 period to a mean of 877 2 139 1 mm yr 843 3 65 9 mm yr and 777 5 134 3 mm yr respectively laguna del inca and teno also increase from a mean of 513 0 77 0 mm yr and 770 0 69 0 mm yr in 1984 2009 period to a mean of 607 2 64 mm yr and 854 0 134 3 mm yr respectively during the 2010 2020 period although l dial mean 933 144 0 mm yr and l negra mean 809 0 95 mm yr increase in the 2010 2020 period to a mean of 1040 1 24 8 mm yr and 886 2 100 9 mm respectively this trend is not significant table 3 in addition the rest of the lakes increased in annual evaporation this did not exceed 65 mm yr thus caracol mean 868 1 68 mm yr laguna del maule 925 0 94 mm yr cari launa mean 752 1 71 0 mm yr and aguas calientes mean 787 1 77 0 mm yr in 2010 2020 period increased to 933 0 110 3 mm yr 984 0 100 2 mm yr 778 6 86 0 and 743 0 103 0 mm yr respectively which is equivalent to an increase of 65 0 mm yr 59 0 mm yr 27 0 and 44 2 mm yr respectively l yeso was the only lake where evaporation did not show important variations and fluctuated from about 853 88 mm yr in 1984 2009 854 4 150 5 mm yr in 2009 2020 annual mean temperature fig 4 c shows a sustained and significant increase since 2010 for all lakes p value 0 05 table 4 this trend was estimated by the mann kendall test and the sen s slope q indicating increases between 0 18 and 0 27 c decade table 4 as with precipitation we estimated a 5 year moving average of annual mean temperature and compared these to the surface areas of the lakes from the study site for 1984 2020 significant negative correlations exist between both these variables for almost all the lakes studied fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 climate and regional lake distribution between 32 and 36ºs the distribution of the andes lakes from central chile both in number and size seemingly follows a latitudinal gradient fig 2 in fact as rainfall increases toward the south the lakes increase in number and size hence the reduction of water supply and increase of temperatures observed fig 4 a in the study site may have a strong impact on the surfaces of these lakes however this change was not analyzed here in detail and will eventually be necessary to know the state of these lakes for this reason ndwi applied to high resolution images 15 m needs to be assessed in terms of overall performance in achieving adequate results from small surfaces özelkan 2020 globally the combined effect of climate variability and human pressures are consistently drying up lakes in semiarid and arid regions for example lake urmia in iran alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 and lake baiyangdian in china lu et al 2013 at lower elevations in central chile small lakes have been drying out over the last decade e g aculeo barría et al 2021 and matanzas lakes fuentealba et al 2020 therefore the lakes from the andes of central chile can be expected to at least decrease in lake level these lakes add up to a total of 16 68 km2 of water surface fig 2 b and their reduction can lead to serious social problems in this sense the maintenance of agricultural and livestock activities development in its watersheds or even water supply security to high density populated areas such as in the santiago metropolitan region can be at risk this maintains lake levels although this increases pressure on groundwater resources for example a major reduction in groundwater about 300 during the so called megadrought has been reported for the petorca basin which no longer has any surface expressions of the watertable in the lower valleys muñoz et al 2020 therefore the reduction of water supply together with the development of human activities can generate a serious hydric scarcity barría et al 2021 moreover the reduction of the number of lakes between 35ºs and 36ºs could be related to a large drop in average elevation of the andes as latitude increases since snow and rainfall distribution depend on elevation lower elevations imply lower water supply hence a lower number of lakes 5 2 climate variability as a possible cause of decreasing in lakes surfaces the lakes with a surface greater than 0 5 km2 analyzed here displayed a general trend to reducing its area during the 1984 2020 period fig 3 the changes in the lake surfaces area exhibit one of three major patterns a humpbacked i e chepical caracol teno aguas calientes with an initial increase up until the 2000s followed by a major decrease a linear decrease with a slight increase in the 2000s followed by a decrease i e cari launa embalse el yeso laguna del inca laguna del maule mollera yeso and an overall increase i e dial lake nine of the twelve lakes included laguna del inca 32ºs laguna negra 33ºs embalse el yeso 33ºs yeso 34ºs teno 35ºs aguas calientes 35ºs cari launa 36ºs and laguna del maule 36ºs showed a smaller surface area in the 2010s decade fig 3 when comparing the changes that occurred during the two periods 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 the surface area reduction from the second period was at least 6 table 3 this means a total loss of 8 73 km2 of water surface the lakes located from 34ºs to 35ºs and from 2100 m a s l to 2700 m a s l were those that experienced the greatest drop tables 1 and 3 although this trend does not appear to have a latitudinal gradient the loss of surfaces is in agreement with recent climate trends the correlation of the changes in lake surface with a 5 year moving average of annual precipitation fig 5 is positive and significant which seems to show a lag in the lake response to precipitation input furthermore we detected a lag of at least two or three years with a low amount of precipitation before the surface lake decreases figs 3 and 4 a thus the decreasing amount of precipitation fig 4 a affects the water supply to the lake but its response is not immediate and follows a 3 year lag approximately this lag is consistent with the report for lake aculeo 33º 50 s 70º 54 w 350 m a s l which indicates the time of residence of water from precipitation in the lake was of about 2 2 years barría et al 2021 the lakes located north of 34ºs recorded the highest surface values between 1985 and 1987 except for chepical which was in 1994 while the lakes located at the southward of 34ºs registered their highest surfaces in different years between 1987 and 2008 in contrast years with a high amount of annual precipitation were 1998 and 2006 for practically the entire study region fig 4 a lake dial is unique in that shows only a slight decrease 0 02 in surface area during the 2010 2020 period the most likely explanation may be related to feeding regimes that do not respond on interannual timescales to either increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation such as those that are maintained by large groundwater reservoirs fully understanding the reasons for why l dial fails responds to recent climate variability will require a water budget analysis to unravel this unique behavior which is beyond the scope of this present study the variability of annual evaporation amount recorded fig 4 b in the study site during the temporal window seems to not influence the lakes surface changes table 2 and fig 3 the low increase in evaporation amount does not exceed 100 mm yr when the two periods 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 are compared regarding annual mean temperature fig 4 c an important increase occurred for the period 2010 2020 of about 0 7 ºc with respect to the 1984 2009 period this increase is consistent with the results reported by shaw et al 2021 indicating that temperature has experienced a warming trend of up to 0 8 c per year during the period 2010 2020 for central andes 32ºs to 35ºs probably because of temperature dynamics the lakes suffer an important drop in their surface areas we used a 5 year moving average of annual mean temperature which correlated negatively and significantly with the areas from the lakes during the temporal window analyzed here fig 6 5 3 influence of the recent megadrought on decreasing trends in lake surface area the lakes show a clear drop in surface area during the period of 2010 2020 compared to the 1984 2009 period used here as baseline fig 3 and table 2 this drop occurs across the entire study site and is largely associated with a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperatures these results are consistent with decreased snow covered areas that feed andean lakes during the summer shaw et al 2021 together with an increase of mass glacier loss observed in recent decades e g shaw et al 2021 fariás barahona et al 2020 these could be all part of the effect of the so called megadrought of central chile observed since 2010 garreaud et al 2017 2020 this can be further accentuated as temperatures increase and coupled with less precipitation rainfall and snowfall and the earlier onset of spring melting of winter snow kim et al 2009 garreaud et al 2020 suggested that only a partial recovery of the region s precipitation is expected during the coming decades which implies that the lakes from andes central chile will continue to decline this period is well known for being one of the most intense regional droughts in the last centuries serrano notivoli et al 2021 furthermore even with some wet years the lag detected here i e 3 years of lag in the response of lakes to increase its areas could make any eventual recovery difficult our results point to many other areas of inquiry that need to be further assessed for example we have not included the different sources of water inputs to the lakes such as fluxes from tributaries changes in snow vs liquid precipitation and groundwater inputs these factors could exercise important controls on any changes in the level of the lakes although very little public information exists regarding groundwater availability for each of our study lakes the scientific literature available for northern and central chile suggests an important reduction in aquifers possibly due to the impact of reduced lake surface areas because of rainfall deficits and groundwater compensation taucare 2020 in addition increasing withdrawals from lakes due to anthropogenic activities for agriculture mining and drinking water combines with hydroclimate stress leading to overexploitation of groundwater resources muñoz et al 2020 garreaud et al 2017 this poses challenges to water managers that must be considered barría et al 2021 moreover the recent megadrought could be only one of the drivers leading to lakes surface area reduction changes in the water demand have not been considered in this study and could explain a significant part of the water extraction from these andean catchments despite the clear effect of this warm and dry period human intervention on each of these lakes need to be analyzed separately land use and land cover changes were identified as one of the main drivers of the hydrological response of lacustrine ecosystems song et al 2018 fuentealba et al 2020 considering that the above mentioned changes vary depending on elevation and social requirements these affect lakes differently martínez retureta et al 2020 a more detailed approach needs to be undertaken to analyze the different effects of human interventions on each lake to establish the full extent of impact from the so called megadrought in this area and how these can change in the future benavidez silva et al 2021 galleguillos et al 2021 6 conclusion the use of satellite imagery and the ndwi index are useful tools to evaluate interannual changes in lake surface areas and afford a reliable and quick way to compare these changes to available climate data almost all the lakes located in the andes of central chile analyzed here displayed a general trend towards diminishing surface areas during the 2010 2020 period these declines coincide with major regional climate trends including decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures temperature shows a significant increasing trend at all the lakes of the andes in central chile during 2010 2020 unlike temperature evaporation and precipitation trends were not significant for most lakes decreasing precipitation however occurs coevally with increasing evaporation therefore these variables show behaviors consistent with regional climatic variability over the last decades the changes reported here pose serious challenges for water managers and local to regional stakeholders since good management of this resource is necessary to face climate change and the severe and ongoing water crisis in central chile these results can assist with management of this resource and improve our understanding of future water availability in the region this research addresses the changes in the water input to the lakes through to the changes in the annual precipitation amount in each study site however to improve our knowledge of the dynamics of these lakes other variables should be incorporated for example surface and groundwater fluxes future research should also consider incorporating lake bathymetries to further estimate how much water volume has been lost during the recent and ongoing megadrought funding this work was supported by grant anid fb210006 and ace210006 anid millennium nucleus upwell ncn19 153 fondecyt 1191568

8105,study region andes central chile 32ºs 36ºs lakes study focus mountain lakes play a key role in the terrestrial freshwater reservoir both for storage of snow melt and precipitation although lakes are sensitive to climate variability the effect of global warming on water availability remains uncertain semiarid regions are especially sensitive to relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation as these have disproportionately large impacts on lake hydrologic budgets here we mapped 12 lakes from the andes of central chile 32º 36ºs using landsat mission and sentinel 2 satellites images from 1984 to 2020 and compared these results with the available climate data precipitation temperature and evaporation new hydrological insights for the region this approach provides a high resolution temporal and spatial analysis for changes in lake surface over the last 36 years our results indicate that the number of lakes and respective surface area decrease latitudinally from south to north across central chile which is consistent the present day rainfall gradient over the study period lake surface areas decreased significantly between 7 and 25 during the so called megadrought 2010 2020 as lakes continue to dry up the implications for freshwater availability are of considerable societal and environmental importance our results can assist with water management decisions and

al 2021 for example in the mediterranean region water availability is expected to decrease between 9 and 17 if temperatures increase to 1 5 and 2ºc respectively schleussner et al 2016 water is essential for life and the maintenance of ecosystems and improving our knowledge regarding how water reservoirs are impacted by ongoing climate change is crucial for water management decisions as well as mitigation lakes are important reservoirs of global freshwater and can reduce the impact of droughts through water retention during wet periods wanders et al 2015 however lakes have experienced significant changes over the last few decades due to the synergic effects of climate change and human pressures gao 2015 venegas quiñones et al 2020 fuentealba et al 2020 many questions arise regarding water mass balance for example although many mountain lakes are currently increasing due to glacier mass loss owing to rising temperatures shugar et al 2020 fuso 2021 their permanence is uncertain as glaciers will eventually disappear in the next decades in addition the lack of lake surveys and monitoring particularly in remote areas e g the andes of central chile creates additional challenges for assessing how global change effects freshwater availability and forecasting gao 2015 this lack of knowledge regarding these lakes is compounded not only by climate change but also by the lack of management and mitigation measures under current climate scenarios precisely several lakes in low lying basins of central chile aculeo and matanzas dried up very recently in the last decade because of decreasing rainfall and inefficient water use fuentealba et al 2020 venegas quiñones et al 2020 barría et al 2021 to address these issues regarding remote lakes in the andes of

trends in the water bodies however data availability of interannual and seasonal variations of lakes is very limited gao 2015 landsat satellite images allow mapping water surface bodies throughout the normalized difference water index ndwi this index was developed by mcfeeters 1996 to delineate lake boundaries using reflective near infrared radiation and visible green light özelkan 2020 although the spatial resolution can oscillate between 15 and 30 m only since the 1990 s can the highest resolutions be achieved martínez mena 2017 özelkan 2020 thus a tradeoff exists between increased resolution versus temporal coverage and it is often preferable to work with a lower resolution of 30 m across a longer time series decreased resolution however means that only larger lakes can be properly analyzed regarding changes in the lake surface area here we present an interannual reconstruction of lake surface areas using landsat satellite images landsat 5 7 8 and sentinel 2 to determine the effect of climate change on high andean lakes freshwater availability from central chile 32ºs 36ºs over the last 36 years our goals were to establish how these lake surfaces varied between 1984 and 2020 and to compare these changes with the available climate data precipitation temperature and evaporation to assess different causes for these variations for this we used the ndwi to map surface water of 12 lakes which were chosen for their size surface 0 5 km2 2 study site the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs fig 1 are characterized by a mediterranean climate with cold wet winters and hot dry summers sarricolea et al 2017 shaw et al 2021 annual precipitation in the 1984 2020 period 1984 2020 increases southwards from 256 mm 32ºs to 790 mm 36ºs data accessed through

07 2021 during the last decade 2010 2020 the region between 32ºs and 37ºs has experienced a so called megadrought observed by an increase of up to 0 8 c in mean annual air temperature and a reduction of up to 40 in annual precipitation garreaud et al 2017 serrano notivoli et al 2021 shaw et al 2021 this episode seems to anticipate future conditions in this region and meanwhile projections do not show any significant recovery in the following decades muñoz et al 2020 moreover a significant part of this so called megadrought shows anthropological attributions boisier et al 2016 twelve lakes

surveyed all available lakes in the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs using a public database available from the dirección general de aguas dga ministry of public works republic of chile data accessed through http www dga cl estudiospublicaciones mapoteca inventarios catastro de lagos zip last modified on 5th september 2019 we then selected 12 lakes that had a surface area higher than 0 5 km2 this minimum surface area is key to achieve a more precise representation of the lakes for each year which needs to take into account that minimum pixel size from landsat satellite images is 30 m table 2 the satellite image data used in this study were downloaded using google earth engine gee a public data catalog with a multi petabyte curated collection of geospatial datasets gorelick et al 2017 the bulk of the catalog is made up of earth observing remote sensing imagery including the entire landsat archive as well as the sentinel 2 archive a total of 36 landsat images covered the 12 selected lakes for the period 1984 2020 table 2 were analyzed all images were taken during the dry season january to march to improve image quality in the absence of cloud cover all landsat and sentinel images were processed using google earth engine which delivers geometrically radiometrically and atmospherically corrected images the normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters 1996 was used to obtain the surface from selected lakes the index has the advantage of eliminating the presence of soil and terrestrial vegetation features present in the images yang et al 2015 the index calculates the difference between two image bands and applies a threshold to segment the results into two categories water and non water features to identify the lakes and is expressed as follows 1 ndwi green nir green nir the green band maximizes the reflectance of the water body while the nir band the near infrared minimizes the rest of the vegetation and soil cover yang et al 2017 the ndwi was calculated in google earth engine gee and reclassified in arcmap 10 3 using an index of 0 1 water and 1 0 other covers the climate dataset was obtained from the terraclimate repository hosted by the university of idaho s northwest knowledge network abatzoglou et al 2018 supplementary table 1 and include annual precipitation amount mean annual temperature and evapotranspiration pet this climate dataset is updated periodically as additional years become available and we considered data from 1984 to 2020 the climatic data analyzed here were extracted based on the information available that was as close as possible to the studied lakes changes in lake surfaces were analyzed using descriptive statistics mean max min and standard deviation we compare two periods from years 1984 2009 and years 2010 2020 the megadrought and applied the non parametric wilcoxon mann whitney test to see if the differences are statistically significant neuhäuser 2011 we calculate the trends of the three considered climate variables annual precipitation annual mean temperature and annual evaporation from 1984 to 2020 using the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1962 we also estimate a 5 year moving average for the climatic variables thus for example the hydrologic year of 1988 corresponds to the average of precipitation of 1987 1988 finally the climate variables were correlated with changes in lake surfaces between 1984 and 2020 4 results 4 1 regional lake distribution between 32ºs 36ºs a total of 215 lakes were surveyed in our study region and their size and number exhibit a

for the study period lakes with smaller decreases were laguna del maule 9 95 teno 6 96 and laguna negra 5 27 in contrast dial was the only lake with no clear trend with a slight decrease of 0 019 table 2 the total loss of lake surface area for the andes of central chile was c 8 73 km2 during the last 36 years with most of this loss occurring in the last 10 years among these laguna del maule was the lake that lost the most surface area 5 21 km2 although percentage wise this was not very high 4 3 climate variability from 1984 to 2020 in the andes of central chile 32ºs 36ºs climate data for the andes of central chile exhibits important variations during the analyzed period annual precipitation from 1984 to 2020 are based on hydrological years e g may 1983 april 1984 fig 4 a the general trend of annual rainfall estimated by the mann kendall test indicated a significant decreasing trend table 4 oscillating from 5 8 mm yr to 7 2 mm yr for all lakes except for embalse el yeso laguna del inca and laguna negra thus increased interannual variability and the presence of very wet years are observed mainly during the period of 1984 2009 with the lakes dial mean 841 210 9 mm laguna del maule 643 171 2 mm and caracol 716 205 7 mm recording the highest amounts of annual rainfall since 2010 annual rainfall has dropped noticeably at all lakes for example in the period 1984 2009 chepical lake recorded an average annual rainfall of 280 mm 161 5 and laguna del inca showed 375 2 mm 182 1 and these averages dropped to 194 83 0 and 259 0 mm 84 1 from 2010 to 2020 respectively this represents a deficit of c 31 for each lake likewise from 1984 to 2009 embalse el yeso and laguna negra recorded an average annual rainfall of 444 7 mm 190 4 and 447 0 mm 199 0 respectively which then dropped to 320 0 107 1 mm and 324 1 108 5 from 2010 to 2020 representing a deficit of 28 and 27 respectively in similar fashion mollera mean1984 2009 642 5 184 3 mm mean2010 2020 490 4 134 1 mm cari

deficit in the 2010 2020 period around 25 teno and yeso 24 mollera cari launa caracol laguna del maule and aguas calientes and 23 dial although a coincidence between precipitation and the surface areas of the studied lakes could be expected this does not have statistical support to explore the relationship between both variables we compared a 5 year moving average of annual precipitation with the lake surfaces as a result fig 5 shows a positive and significant correlation with a clear lag in lake response to rainfall input this lag is of at least two or three years from the start of dry year to the eventual decline in surface lake area figs 3 and 4 a for example since 2017 laguna del inca embalse el yeso yeso teno aguas calientes and cari launa lakes displayed a lower amount of annual precipitation fig 4 a matching the lowest lake surface observed in 2020 supplementary table 1 the annual evaporation amount recorded during the study period fig 4 b exhibits a slight and non significative positive trend table 3 supplementary figure 1 however when comparing the 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 periods there was an increasing trend of about 100 mm per year in the lakes embalse el yeso mollera chepical teno and laguna del inca thus in the 1984 2009 period embalse el yeso oscillated around to 777 2 96 mm yr mollera about of 741 0 104 mm yr and chepical lakes in a mean of 685 61 107 mm yr those lakes increased the annual evaporation during the 2010 2020 period to a mean of 877 2 139 1 mm yr 843 3 65 9 mm yr and 777 5 134 3 mm yr respectively laguna del inca and teno also increase from a mean of 513 0 77 0 mm yr and 770 0 69 0 mm yr in 1984 2009 period to a mean of 607 2 64 mm yr and 854 0 134 3 mm yr respectively during the 2010 2020 period although l dial mean 933

of the lakes increased in annual evaporation this did not exceed 65 mm yr thus caracol mean 868 1 68 mm yr laguna del maule 925 0 94 mm yr cari launa mean 752 1 71 0 mm yr and aguas calientes mean 787 1 77 0 mm yr in 2010 2020 period increased to 933 0 110 3 mm yr 984 0 100 2 mm yr 778 6 86 0 and 743 0 103 0 mm yr respectively which is equivalent to an increase of 65 0 mm yr 59 0 mm yr 27 0 and 44 2 mm yr respectively l yeso was the only lake where evaporation did not show important variations and fluctuated from about 853 88 mm yr in 1984 2009 854 4 150 5 mm yr in 2009 2020 annual mean temperature fig 4 c shows a sustained and significant increase since 2010 for all lakes p value 0 05 table 4 this trend was estimated by the mann kendall test and the sen s slope q indicating increases between 0 18 and 0 27 c decade table 4 as with precipitation we estimated a 5 year moving average of annual mean temperature and compared these to the surface areas of the lakes from the study site for 1984 2020 significant negative correlations exist between both these variables for almost all the lakes studied fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 climate and regional lake distribution between 32 and 36ºs the distribution of the andes lakes from central chile both in number and size seemingly follows a latitudinal gradient fig 2 in fact as rainfall increases toward the south the lakes increase in number and size hence the reduction of water supply and increase of temperatures observed fig 4 a in the study site may have a strong impact on the surfaces of these lakes however this change was not analyzed here in detail and will eventually be necessary to know the state of these lakes for this reason ndwi applied to high resolution images 15 m needs to be assessed in terms of overall performance in achieving adequate results from small surfaces özelkan 2020 globally the combined effect of climate variability and human pressures are consistently drying up lakes in semiarid and arid regions for example lake urmia in iran alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 and lake baiyangdian in china lu et al 2013 at lower elevations in central chile small lakes have been drying out over the last decade e g aculeo barría et al 2021 and matanzas lakes fuentealba et al 2020 therefore the lakes from the andes of central chile can be expected to at least decrease in lake level these lakes add up to a total of 16 68 km2 of water surface fig 2 b and their reduction can lead to serious social problems in this sense the maintenance of agricultural and livestock activities development in its watersheds or even water supply security to high density populated areas such as in the santiago metropolitan region can be at risk this maintains lake levels although this increases pressure on groundwater resources for example a major reduction in groundwater about 300 during the so called megadrought has been reported for the petorca basin which no longer has any surface expressions of the watertable in the lower valleys muñoz et al 2020 therefore the reduction of water supply together with the development of human activities can generate a serious hydric scarcity barría et al 2021 moreover the reduction of the number of lakes between 35ºs and 36ºs could be related to a large drop in average elevation of the andes as latitude increases since snow and rainfall distribution depend on elevation lower elevations imply lower water supply hence a lower number of lakes 5 2 climate variability as a possible cause of decreasing in lakes surfaces the lakes with a surface greater than 0 5 km2 analyzed here displayed a general trend to reducing its area during the 1984 2020 period fig 3 the changes in the lake surfaces area exhibit one of three major patterns a humpbacked i e chepical caracol teno aguas calientes with an initial increase up until the 2000s followed by a major decrease a linear decrease with a slight increase in the 2000s followed by a decrease i e cari launa embalse el yeso laguna del inca laguna del maule mollera yeso and an overall increase i e dial lake nine of the twelve lakes included laguna del inca 32ºs laguna negra 33ºs embalse el yeso 33ºs yeso 34ºs teno 35ºs aguas calientes 35ºs cari launa 36ºs and laguna del maule 36ºs showed a smaller surface area in the 2010s decade fig 3 when comparing the changes that occurred during the two periods 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 the surface area reduction from the second period was at least 6 table 3 this means a total loss of 8 73 km2 of water surface the lakes located from 34ºs to 35ºs and from 2100 m a s l to 2700 m a s l were those that experienced the greatest drop tables 1 and 3 although this trend does not appear to have a latitudinal gradient the loss of surfaces is in agreement with recent climate trends the correlation of the changes in lake surface with a 5 year moving average of annual precipitation fig 5 is positive and significant which seems to show a lag in the lake response to precipitation input furthermore we detected a lag of at least two or three years with a low amount of precipitation before the surface lake decreases figs 3 and 4 a thus the decreasing amount of precipitation fig 4 a affects the water supply to the lake but its response is not immediate and follows a 3 year lag approximately this lag is consistent with the report for lake aculeo 33º 50 s 70º 54 w 350 m a s l which indicates the time of residence of water from precipitation in the lake was of about 2 2 years barría et al 2021 the lakes located north of 34ºs recorded the highest surface values between 1985 and 1987 except for chepical which was in 1994 while the lakes located at the southward of 34ºs registered their highest surfaces in different years between 1987 and 2008 in contrast years with a high amount of annual precipitation were 1998 and 2006 for practically the entire study region fig 4 a lake dial is unique in that shows only a slight decrease 0 02 in surface area during the 2010 2020 period the most likely explanation may be related to feeding regimes that do not respond on interannual timescales to either increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation such as those that are maintained by large groundwater reservoirs fully understanding the reasons for why l dial fails responds to recent climate variability will require a water budget analysis to unravel this unique behavior which is beyond the scope of this present study the variability of annual evaporation amount recorded fig 4 b in the study site during the temporal window seems to not influence the lakes surface changes table 2 and fig 3 the low increase in evaporation amount does not exceed 100 mm yr when the two periods 1984 2009 and 2010 2020 are compared regarding annual mean temperature fig 4 c an important increase occurred for the period 2010 2020 of about 0 7 ºc with respect to the 1984 2009 period this increase is consistent with the results reported by shaw et al 2021 indicating that temperature has experienced a warming trend of up to 0 8 c per year during the period 2010 2020 for central andes 32ºs to 35ºs probably because of temperature dynamics the lakes suffer an important drop in their surface areas we used a 5 year moving average of annual mean temperature which correlated negatively and significantly with the areas from the lakes during the temporal window analyzed here fig 6 5 3 influence of the recent megadrought on decreasing trends in lake surface area the lakes show a clear drop in surface area during the period of 2010 2020 compared to the 1984 2009 period used here as baseline fig 3 and table 2 this drop occurs across the entire study site and is largely associated with a reduction in precipitation and an increase in temperatures these results are consistent with decreased snow covered areas that feed andean lakes during the summer shaw et al 2021 together with an increase of mass glacier loss observed in recent decades e g shaw et al 2021 fariás barahona et al 2020 these could be all part of the effect of the so called megadrought of central chile observed since 2010 garreaud et al 2017 2020 this can be further accentuated as temperatures increase and coupled with less precipitation rainfall and snowfall and the earlier onset of spring melting of winter snow kim et al 2009 garreaud et al 2020 suggested that only a partial recovery of the region s precipitation is expected during the coming decades which implies that the lakes from andes central chile will continue to decline this period is well known for being one of the most intense regional droughts in the last centuries serrano notivoli et al 2021 furthermore even with some wet years the lag detected here i e 3 years of lag in the response of lakes to increase its areas could make any eventual recovery difficult our results point to many other areas of inquiry that need to be further assessed for example we have not included the different sources of water inputs to the lakes such as fluxes from tributaries changes in snow vs liquid precipitation and groundwater inputs these factors could exercise important controls on any changes in the level of the lakes although very little public information exists regarding groundwater availability for each of our study lakes the scientific literature available for northern and central chile suggests an important reduction in aquifers possibly due to the impact of reduced lake surface areas because of rainfall deficits and groundwater compensation taucare 2020 in addition increasing withdrawals from lakes due to anthropogenic activities for agriculture mining and drinking water combines with hydroclimate stress leading to overexploitation of groundwater resources muñoz et al 2020 garreaud et al 2017 this poses challenges to water managers that must be considered barría et al 2021 moreover the recent megadrought could be only one of the drivers leading to lakes surface area reduction changes in the water demand have not been considered in this study and could explain a significant part of the water extraction from these andean catchments despite the clear effect of this warm and dry period human intervention on each of these lakes need to be analyzed separately land use and land cover changes were identified as one of the main drivers of the hydrological response of lacustrine ecosystems song et al 2018 fuentealba et al 2020 considering that the above mentioned changes vary depending on elevation and social requirements these affect lakes differently martínez retureta et al 2020 a more detailed approach needs to be undertaken to analyze the different effects of human interventions on each lake to establish the full extent of impact from the so called megadrought in this area and how these can change in the future benavidez silva et al 2021 galleguillos et al 2021 6 conclusion the use of satellite imagery and the ndwi index are useful tools to evaluate interannual changes in lake surface areas and afford a reliable and quick way to compare these changes to available climate data almost all the lakes located in the andes of central chile analyzed here displayed a general trend towards diminishing surface areas during the 2010 2020 period these declines coincide with major regional climate trends including decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures temperature shows a significant increasing trend at all the lakes of the andes in central chile during 2010 2020 unlike temperature evaporation and precipitation trends were not significant for most lakes decreasing precipitation however occurs coevally with increasing evaporation therefore these variables show behaviors consistent with regional climatic variability over the last decades the changes reported here pose serious challenges for water managers and local to regional stakeholders since good management of this resource is necessary to face climate change and the severe and ongoing water crisis in central chile these results can assist with management of this resource and improve our understanding of future water availability in the region this research addresses the changes in the water input to the lakes through to the changes in the annual precipitation amount in each study site however to improve our knowledge of the dynamics of these lakes other variables should be incorporated for example surface and groundwater fluxes future research should also consider incorporating lake bathymetries to further estimate how much water volume has been lost during the recent and ongoing megadrought funding this work was supported by grant anid fb210006 and ace210006 anid millennium nucleus upwell ncn19 153 fondecyt 1191568

8106,study region the north china plain ncp is an important agricultural social and economic center in china significant statistical independence of the hydrological components in ncp exists due to the high variations of natural conditions and human activities both in the horizontal and vertical directions study focus it is critical to understand the features of terrestrial water storage tws changes in ncp gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission provides valuable measurements for tws in this study the grace rl05 mascon data during 2002 2017 in ncp are analyzed via independent component analysis ica and multi source data to improve the understanding of underlying physical or human made processes of the regional tws change new hydrological insights for the region the relatively independent hydrological components in ncp with grace measurements are successfully derived which characterize annual variation surface water storage sws change and the shallow and deep groundwater storage sgws and dgws changes respectively based on them it is found that sgws decreases faster before 2009 and then reduces slower and keeps stable while dgws decreases faster after 2009 especially after 2012 further investigation shows that the anthropogenic influences significantly enhance the vertical heterogeneity of water storage changes based on their exploitations of different hydrological components in which the south to north water diversion of china changes the water use mode in ncp especially for the reduction of the sgws exploitation keywords independent component analysis north china plain gravity recovery and climate experiment time series analysis signal decomposition terrestrial water storage 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is an important region in china with many agricultural social and economic activities foster et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 and a complex hydrogeological environment huang et al 2015 under the increasing pressure from natural conditions and human activities tang et al 2013 ncp is facing severe water scarcity wang et al 2020 severe groundwater storage loss and land subsidence occur due to the long term groundwater overexploitation in ncp zhang et al 2009 besides some water diversion projects like the south to north water diversion snwd are producing highly uneven regional effects on water resources in ncp rogers et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 e g the diverted water can be utilized and groundwater has been recharged in the subregions along the water transfer line recently precipitation at ncp has been declining which has increased the level of water scarcity zhao et al 2019 terrestrial water storage tws is an important index to characterize regional water resources the features of tws changes are complicated by issues mentioned earlier and are necessary to be assessed launched in march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission has been used to detect tws variations worldwide huang et al 2015 rodell et al 2007 previous studies have widely used the grace data to analyze water resource characteristics in ncp and found the effects of human activities as well as the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of tws feng et al 2013 2018 gong et al 2018 huang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 as the middle route of snwd along danjinagkou reservior to ncp operated in december 2014 a few researchers began to study the effect of the middle route of snwd on the tws changes in ncp via grace data long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021 however grace measured mass signals are affected by many global or local geophysical processes such as the hydrological cycle and earthquake moreover the grace data provide integrated tws change in surface water storage sws biomass snow mass soil moisture storage sms and groundwater storage gws the disaggregation of grace tws anomalies into different hydrological component e g gws changes will be inevitably affected by the errors in these water balance term estimates boergens et al 2014 han and cao 2018 the separation of the grace observed mass changes based on their statistical properties may be a useful alternative method boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 as a common feature extraction method principal component analysis pca lorenz 1956 linearly extracts underlying uncorrelated low dimensional ones to represent high dimensional inputs via minimizing the variance of residuals however the derived specific signals via pca may have multiple features especially in the first principle component pc hindering the linking of pcs to natural source signals hsiao et al 2017 instead of transforming uncorrelated components independent component analysis ica comon 1994 which is another linear transformation method and initially developed for blind source separation uses higher than second order statistical indicators to derive statistically independent components ics while in pca statistical independence may not be satisfied among pcs when nonlinear relationships exist hsiao et al 2017 ica tends to be more appropriate to separate source signals of hydrological data boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 forootan 2014 hsiao et al 2017 many previous studies have used ica to analyze the grace data on global and regional scales most of them study on the denoising of tws forootan et al 2020 frappart et al 2010 2011 guo et al 2014 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b or finding the relationship between the ics and hydrometeorological elements on the relatively large scale agutu et al 2019 boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 forootan et al 2018 few studies focus on its application in ncp 140 000 km2 to investigate the characteristics of tws changes compared with multi source data to our knowledge only shu et al 2018 applied pca to study the spatiotemporal features of gws in ncp the natural conditions e g vadose zone and aquifer heterogeneity topography and human activities e g land use water use exert non uniform stress on hydrological processes in this region rogers et al 2020 sakura et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 therefore the sub components of tws in ncp have relatively strong statistical independence and non gaussianity cai et al 2021 due to the independent physical processes forootan 2014 hyvärinen et al 2001 which satisfies the mathematical assumptions of ica additionally because the earlier and shorter grace data series in the previous studies may impede the pattern derivation of the source signals the longer period i e 2002 2017 of the multi source data is selected in this study the mascon mass concentration solutions of grace save et al 2016 are used for their relatively good performance of regional mass change studies scanlon et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 besides although previous studies demonstrate that pca cannot perform well as ica for blind signal separation it can be a common preprocessing technique of ica for multidimensional data e g grace data to reduce its dimension hyvärinen et al 2001 in this way we can often reduce noise and prevent overlearning since the omitted dimensions are assumed as white noise or low and unimportant signal fluctuations in the grace derived tws ferreira et al 2020 hyvärinen et al 2001 therefore pca is used in this study as a first step before implementing ica the primary purpose of the current study is to reveal the latent relatively independent hydrological components in ncp via ica to better understand the tws changes in ncp and its implications to regional water resources management which is not implemented in the previous studies to this end the data from multiple sources like the satellite models and in situ measurements are collected to identify the signals then further analysis and discussion on the derived hydrological components are conducted in the following we first describe the methods in section 2 the study area and data are shown in sections 3 and 4 then we exhibit the test results in section 5 and make a discussion in section 6 our major conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 methods 2 1 principal component analysis introduced by pearson 1901 pca can linearly decompose the data matrix x e n e is the number of observations in each site while n is the number of observation sites into some uncorrelated time series i e pcs and the corresponding spatial weights through singular value decomposition which can be shown as 1 x p v t where v n n is the weight matrix with the normalized columns i e vv t i and p includes the pcs that can be further shown as 2 x ud v t where u e n contains normalized pcs i e uu t i and d is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements d ii λ i where i min e n which are ranked in decreasing order hence the variance of each pc can be described by the corresponding value of λ to determine the significance of each pc and the number of the first pcs to approximate the data jolliffe 2002 the eigenvalue spectrum λ is calculated based on the λ values as 3 λ ii λ i i λ i 2 2 independent component analysis as a feature extraction method ica has a powerful ability to find unknown latent variables to linearly represent the observed multidimensional data hyvärinen et al 2001 these latent variables i e ics are generally difficult to be observed and assumed to be non gaussian and mutually independent which is consistent with the properties of most physical components in nature forootan 2014 specifically the observed data matrix x can be expressed as 4 x sa where the original explanatory signal matrix s e p is formed of p sources during e epochs the link between x and s is described by the mixing matrix i e weight matrix a p n and each ic e 1 column of s has its weight vector a 1 n row of a the ics can be obtained by calculating the inverse of the mixing matrix a i e w n p the process can be shown as 5 s xw the object of ica is to make ic estimates as independent non gaussian and simple as possible via estimating a or w we implement this step by minimizing the mutual information of the s estimate hyvärinen and oja 2000 the details of the computational formula for the mutual information can refer to hyvärinen and oja 2000 although ica is useful to reveal the latent independent signals for a complex system it should be noted that the ica method has some ambiguities or indeterminacies hyvärinen et al 2001 first the amplitudes of ics cannot be determined which also leaves the ambiguity of the sign and may make the ics and their corresponding observations negatively correlated in this case a negative unit coefficient is used for the specific ic to correct its sign second the order of the ics may be different in each running nevertheless it has limited effects on the identification of the ics 2 3 the implementation details the methodology flow diagram in fig 1 exhibits the data processing procedure before applying the algorithms we normalize the grace data to avoid the effects of the widely varied data on the model s ability hyvärinen et al 2001 zhang et al 2018 when implementing these algorithms the grace data at the objective locations for a time epoch are reshaped in a vector and the vectors for all time epochs form the spatiotemporal matrix x in this study we first derive pcs from x using pca then the ics are obtained based on the several selected pcs via ica the number of ics is determined via pca the derived ics and multi source data are then linearly interpolated resampled and filtered via the moving average method to make the identification 2 4 evaluation metric for identifying the ics we apply cross correlation corr to measure the relationships between the ics and multi source data corr is widely used in the hydrology discipline e g krishan et al 2014 which can be defined by 6 corr i 1 n i c i ic s i s i 1 n i c i ic 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where n denotes the number of epochs of collected data ic i denotes the ith epoch of one ic s n 1 denotes one kind of explanatory variable e g sms derived from noah used to identify the ics means the average value the uncertainty of the ics in the repeated trials can be measured by the ensemble spread sp reichle and koster 2003 7 sp 1 n 1 r 1 i 1 n j 1 r i c i j ic i 2 where r denotes the number of realizations 3 study area ncp is a well known plain in eastern asia covering an area of 140 000 km2 fig 2 a previous studies have found the highly vertical variation of water storage in ncp for example sakura et al 2003 reported that there is one unconfined aquifer with a depth of 40 60 m and three confined aquifers with different depths i e 120 170 m 250 350 m and 400 600 m in ncp zhang et al 2009 defined four main geological layers vertically according to water utilization and hydrogeological conditions the shallower two layers which are unconfined and semi confined aquifers with the depths of 10 50 m and 210 m respectively are used for ecological services and irrigation activities the deeper two layers are confined aquifers with depths of 310 m and 310 m the third aquifer is often used for domestic and industrial purposes besides many water diversions in ncp like the recent snwd also tend to affect the distribution of tws components zhang et al 2021 4 data material 4 1 terrestrial water storage anomalies from grace in this study the rl05 grace monthly solutions based on mascon functions are used they are developed with a 0 5 resolution by the university of texas at austin s center for space research csr which is similar to the solutions via the jet propulsion laboratory jpl usa save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 compared with jpl mascon data constrained based on grace data and the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas data csr solutions only use grace data liu et al 2020a save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 containing more native features of grace data that can be used as inputs for ica the tws anomalies represented in terms of equivalent water thickness are used the study period is between april 2002 and june 2017 with e 163 epochs while the study area includes n 86 0 5 grid cells in ncp since we study the long term pattern of tws changes in the basin scale level scale factors are not used scanlon et al 2016 4 2 other multi source explanatory data 4 2 1 climate data we obtain global land surface temperature and precipitation from the climate prediction center cpc i e the global daily temperature version 1 0 i e maximum and minimum temperature and unified gauge based analysis of precipitation chen et al 2008 both have a spatial resolution of 0 5 and the products during 2002 2017 are used to analyze temporal patterns of grace derived tws time series 4 2 2 land surface model outputs the gldas hydrological models e g noah simulate many land surface states like soil moisture runoff accumulated snow water energy flux rodell et al 2005 several studies long et al 2014 yang et al 2013 have reported that noah monthly simulations relate well with grace derived tws therefore gldas 2 1 noah v3 3 model output monthly with a spatial resolution of 1 from january 2002 and december 2017 is used in this study besides daily products from catchment land surface models clsm v2 2 are used to derive shallow groundwater storage sgws it does not consider the anthropogenic influence and only includes the shallow aquifers with a depth around 5 8 m hu et al 2021 li et al 2019 at 0 25 resolution from feb 1 2003 to dec 31 2017 4 2 3 surface water storage from haihe river water conservancy commission ministry of water resource of the people s republic of china hwcc and mwr 2016 the surface water storage during 2004 2016 of the major reservoirs in or near ncp are collected and interpolated as in zhao et al 2019 hwcc sws the newest results from watergap global hydrology model wghm version 2 2d are also applied to derive sws wghm sws which has closed water balance and improved human water use simulations capabilities li et al 2020 müller et al 2020 4 2 4 in situ groundwater level observations we collect the monthly in situ groundwater level observations gls during 2005 2015 from the groundwater level yearbook compiled by the institute of china geological environment monitoring china institute of geo environmental monitoring cigem 2015 in the study area 267 monitoring wells are used including 103 wells in the unconfined aquifers and 164 wells in the confined aquifers fig 2 a 4 2 5 land cover products from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci defourny et al 2014 the globally annual land cover maps v2 0 7 with 38 land cover types and a 300 m spatial resolution from 2002 to 2015 are obtained due to the relatively small change of land cover especially for the cropland fig 2 c we only show the product in 2015 for this study fig 2 b land cover types with small areas such as water or bare land were omitted 5 results the data matrix 163 86 of grace derived tws is first normalized and then analyzed via pca the derived results are shown in table 1 which are similar to shu et al 2018 the variance of the first pc is considerably larger than the rest of the pcs indicating several independent signals included the variance of the 5th pc is less than 0 01 the first four pcs which include around 98 of the variance in grace derived tws and are well extracted from the rest residuals are selected for the following analysis via ica results of the ics and corresponding weight vectors of the grace derived tws can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively we smooth the series via a three month moving average to suppress high frequency components the sign of temporal ics has been adjusted according to the corresponding mixing matrix for example the adjusted sign of an ic is negative if the large absolute elements in the corresponding weight vector a are negative since we believe that the hydrological components are the localizations of the grace derived tws therefore the main trends of the hydrological components and tws are assumed to be consistent concerning the temporal ics it is evident that ic2 fig 3 b represents the annual variations the annual peak of ic2 corresponds to the annual rainy season while ic1 fig 3 a ic3 fig 3 c ic4 fig 3 d represent the residual changes of different components respectively fig 4 b shows that the values of weight vector of ic2 a2 are evenly distributed throughout ncp except for the coastal plain at the margin of the bohai sea which is reasonable since there is a relatively small area of cropland with small effects by agricultural activities e g irrigation besides the annual variations affected by the monsoon climate are homogeneous in most parts of ncp while the coastal area has a unique local climate feature as for the others the large absolute values of a1 fig 4 a a3 fig 4 c and a4 fig 4 d are clustered in the east central north and south parts of ncp respectively the multi source data are used to identify these features in the following sections the ordering of the identified ics is fixed for clarity 5 1 the identification of the fourth independent component ic4 the spatial average values of soil moisture storage at the depths of 0 2 m in ncp from gldas noah noah sms are used to identify the ics it is straightforward to find that ic4 best fits noah sms fig 3 d besides the large absolute values of the weight vector a4 fig 4 d locate mainly at the south of ncp where a large area of cropland exists fig 2 b and the irrigation water is primarily extracted in the shallow aquifers zhang et al 2009 as part of the shallow subsurface water resource there is a good connection between sms and sgws thus the simulated sms from gldas can reflect the patterns of sgws to some extent besides the sgws from clsm clsm sgws also has similar variations and a higher corr with ic4 although clsm sgws has a more significantly decreasing trend during 2014 2017 without consideration of the effects of snwd the comparison between ic4 and the different components of sms derived from noah fig s1 and fig s2 in the supplementary material shows that ic4 has a higher corr with deeper sms derived from noah especially for the sms at the deepest 4th layer 4th sms which has a closer connection with clsm sgws compared with shallower sms to further verify the identification the in situ gl measurements in ncp are divided into two parts based on whether observation wells are located in phreatic or confined aquifers as in previous studies feng et al 2013 hu et al 2016 shen et al 2015 we first calculate the gl anomalies glas by subtracting the gl mean values for each monitoring wells during 2005 2015 then we take the average of the glas to estimate the change of gls over the study area the derived phreatic site averaged gla pgla and confined site average gla cgla are expected to connect features of sgws and deep gws dgws respectively fig 5 a shows that pgla decreases before 2009 and then becomes relatively stable which is similar to the temporal pattern of ic4 based on the above analyses we believe that ic4 mainly characterizes sgws in ncp 5 2 the identification of the third independent component ic3 potential evapotranspiration et is derived via the hargreaves equation with the maximum and minimum daily land surface temperature of cpc and the calibrated parameters in hu et al 2011 then the daily precipitation p of cpc and the derived et are resampled into monthly data and averaged over 12 month moving windows to identify ics which are shown in fig 6 besides a drought index spei the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index that considers combining effects of p and et is also shown along with ic3 short and medium time scales of spei are mainly related to variations of soil water content river discharge and reservoir storage therefore a time scale of six months is selected for spei it is easy to find that the pattern affected by the combined function of p and et fig 6 is close to ic3 for example ic3 decreases during 2014 when it is a visible drought period with relatively small p large et and the continuous negative spei values while ic3 increases first and then remains at a peak due to storage constraints during 2012 2013 when it is an apparent wet period with relatively large p low et and the continuous positive spei values considering that sws is more susceptible to meteorological conditions than the other components of tws it indicates that ic3 represents the temporal pattern of sws change the sws data collected from hwcc hwcc sws and wghm wghm sws are compared with the ic3 fig 3 c their good fits further demonstrate that ic3 is related to sws however there is inconsistency during 2004 2005 when ic3 increases with relatively stable p and large et while hwcc sws remains low as for ic4 representing sgws fig 3 d a significant drop occurred at the start of 2004 then ic3 has a considerable increase a possible conjecture is that the rise in ic3 representing sws during the drought period may be recharged from the excessive pumping in sgws ic4 which is not calculated in hwcc sws by the relevant statistical bureau but detected by grace sws only accounts for a small portion of tws in ncp feng et al 2013 the extracted water is transferred from the subsurface reservoir to the surface land e g irrigation resulting in a significant increase in sws thus changing the gravity observation signal wghm sws considering human activities also shows an increasing trend at the same period as ic3 besides the large absolute values of the weight vector a3 fig 4 c distribute mainly in the north of ncp e g beijing tianjin where there are many reservoirs and water diversions as well as strict policies for using groundwater e g suppression of agricultural water use long et al 2020 therefore there is more local utilization of sws than in other subregions according to these analyses ic3 is believed to represent sws 5 3 the identification of the first independent component ic1 many authors e g bonsor et al 2018 use grace derived tws and other hydrological model outputs like sms and sws to trace changes in regional scale target variables e g gws based on the water balance method gws in ncp is generally and simply calculated from grace and gldas noah data grace noah gws frappart and ramillien 2018 as 8 gws tws sms snws cws where tws is derived from the grace data sms snws i e snow water equivalent and cws i e plant canopy surface water are derived from the noah model for the convenience of calculations the spatial resolution of grace data is resampled onto 1 and the temporal resolution of grace data is made consistent to one month e g two data points within a month are averaged the data in the missing months are derived via linear interpolation based on a similar principle dgws can be derived from grace and clsm data grace clsm dgws as 9 dgws tws rzsm snws cws sgws where rzsm i e root zone soil moisture snws cws and sgws are derived from clsm as tws in the model outputs some details about different descriptions of hydrological components e g sms and rzsm in the noah and clsm model can refer to supplementary material and rui and beaudoing 2020 there are two periods with significantly different change patterns in the derived gwss grace noah gws and grace clsm gws see fig 3 a the derived gwss during the first period from 2002 to 2009 are relatively stationary however during the second period from 2010 to 2017 their decrease is more obvious and has larger amplitudes these features are most related to ic1 among the ics besides their short term variations also fit ic1 best although there is significant inconsistency before 2004 landerer et al 2020 reported that the first two years of grace data experienced higher errors which affects the results of ica and mainly causes the considerable inconsistency the large absolute values of the weight vector a1 fig 4 a are distributed mainly in the east central part of ncp like the central plain where primary deeper groundwater pumping occurs huang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 considering that ic2 represents sgws and the ics obtained by ica are as independent as possible ic1 tends to represent the deep gws dgws it further demonstrates that grace clsm dgws has a higher corr with ic4 than grace noah gws the more stable trend of grace clsm dgws during 2014 2017 may result from the overestimation of the decreasing trend of clsm sgws since clsm does not consider the effects of snwd also described in section 5 1 besides based on the discussions in the supplementary material the 4th sms might share some common components with clsm sgws therefore grace noah gws tends to have more characteristics of dgws however we should also note that the overestimation of the decreasing trend during 2014 2017 via grace noah gws exists since the water storage at deeper depths i e over 2 m is not considered in the noah sms furthermore cgla fig 5 b significantly shows two different depletion rates between 2002 and 2009 and 2009 2017 especially after 2012 also the amplitudes of cgla increased substantially after 2009 characterizing an essential recharge source to dgws pgla remains stable fig 5 a water balance analysis indicates that the discharge source of cgla e g the pumping may contribute to its decreasing trend similar patterns also exist in ic1 and ic4 which further support our conclusion that ic1 represents dgws 6 discussion 6 1 discussion on the independent components for further investigation some quantitative analyses are made we first calculate the corrs for the 3 month moving average versions of the ics and hydrological components derived by the multi source data e g noah sms wghm sws and clsm sgws some periods with wrong or low quality data based on the above analysis e g ic1 during 2002 2003 are excluded the corr values shown in fig 3 and fig 5 do not exceed the nominal significance level 0 05 while the most significant corr values between each multi source data and the ics are consistent with our identification for showing the uncertainty of ica approach we conduct five repeated ica runnings with different initial values of w we first obtain the corresponding ics and sign via analyzing the corrs between different ics then the corresponding ics in the five repeated implementations are used to calculate the sps the average ics of the five realizations are used to make a cross correlation analysis the results table 2 show that the ics have strong statistical independence and good stability the ways human activities consume water resources and their changes under the effects of the eastern and middle routes of snwd have been detected from the changes of the derived hydrological components to some extent based on fig 6 there are two distinct drought periods i e 2004 2005 2014 in which the change patterns between ics which represent sws sgws and dgws respectively are not similar in the first period ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreased first while ic3 sws fig 3 c increased then ic1 dgws fig 3 a decreased we believe that the overexploitation of sgws increased sws see section 5 2 then the less sgws caused the net recharge to dgws decrease leading to the subsequent decrease of dgws in the second period i e 2014 2015 the drought climate condition immediately resulted in the decrease of ic3 sws fig 3 c then ic1 dgws fig 3 a and ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreased in turn compared with the first period the second drought event did not force people to exploit sgws it is reasonable since snwd became operational i e december 2013 for the eastern route and december 2014 for the middle route long et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 snwd supplies water resources for the drought and changes the water use ratio of sws to gws to some extent long et al 2020 found that the mean gl records indicate gws recovery during 2015 2019 in beijing since the middle route of snwd operated and zhang et al 2020 2021 found that sgws in ncp began to recover during 2015 2018 which is shown in ic4 sgws fig 3 d however we should note that ic1 dgws fig 3 a has a significant downward trend during 2012 2017 long et al 2020 reported the conjunctive use of sws and gws as a new water use mode in beijing which is shown in the changing patterns of ics ic3 and ic1 sws and dgws fig 3 c and fig 3 a first decrease in turn during 2014 2015 though recovering immediately ic1 dgws fig 3 a over 2015 2017 still shows a decreasing trend then ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreases due to the decrease of the water amount in the adjacent hydrological components i e sws and dgws but it remains stable over 2015 2017 the changing patterns between the ics show the utilization of sws and dgws besides zhao et al 2019 found inconsistent subsidence rates before and after 2013 in ncp derived by gps indicating different exploitation rates between sgws and dgws moreover the hydrological components derived by the hydrological model and land surface model e g wghm sws and clsm sgws without considering the effects of snwd resulted in bad fits with the ics during 2014 2017 which also demonstrates the change of the water use mode 6 2 uncertainties and limitations although sws sgws and dgws have distinct definitions and are relatively independent gao 2008 yang et al 2020 there are some connections between sws sgws and dgws which means that the separation of them from tws does not perfectly satisfy the assumption of the ica approach i e the ics must be statistically independent some high frequency components still exist in the ics and some seasonal features are shown in ic1 ic3 and ic4 due to some hardware or technical problems inherently e g an age related battery issue the inconsistency of data quality of grace in different subsystems and periods may result in some uncertainties landerer et al 2020 in the comparisons between ics and other multi source explanatory data some inconsistencies originate from a number of factors such as the uncertainty of hydrological model outputs e g the noah model neither includes all water reservoirs rivers feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 nor considers human activities the imperfect match of the hydrological components derived from the multi source data and ics e g noah sms and sgws the different temporal and spatial scales of data e g hwcc sws and wghm sws problems of omission and double counting in different statistical data e g hwcc sws the seasonal variation and residual signals in the derived hydrological components and some issues in some in situ gl data e g data gaps offsets abnormal jumps outliers the spatial heterogeneity of specific yield and storativity the factors mentioned above bring difficulties for the identification based on single source data however we believe that the identifications are robust after multi source validation 7 conclusions in this paper we use ica to analyze the grace data to understand the features of tws changes in ncp we first identify the different temporal features i e ics of grace data using multi source data then the identified ics are further analyzed last the uncertainties in this study are discussed our work leads to the following major conclusions 1 it is feasible to use the ica method to analyze the grace data in ncp 140 000 km2 based on it different hydrological components i e sws sgws and dgws in ncp are successfully detected 2 the temporal features of sgws and dgws are significantly different during 2002 2017 sgws decreases faster before 2009 then decreases slower and remains stable thereafter dgws decreases faster after 2009 especially after 2012 during the study period 3 the anthropogenic influences e g water use modes policies diversion projects largely strengthen the vertical heterogeneity of tws component changes snwd has alleviated the over exploitation of shallow groundwater to some extent our studies extend the application of the ica technique to ncp further demonstrating the regional heterogeneity of water resource changes in ncp these findings might inspire us to improve regional grace data reconstruction more abundant data e g data from grace follow on and reconstructed grace type data forootan et al 2020 li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and improved icas hyvärinen et al 2019 richard et al 2020 are expected to better reveal spatiotemporal characteristics of tws in ncp for regional water resources management e g reducing

8106,study region the north china plain ncp is an important agricultural social and economic center in china significant statistical independence of the hydrological components in ncp exists due to the high variations of natural conditions and human activities both in the horizontal and vertical directions study focus it is critical to understand the features of terrestrial water storage tws changes in ncp gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission provides valuable measurements for tws in this study the grace rl05 mascon data during 2002 2017 in ncp are analyzed via independent component analysis ica and multi source data to improve the understanding of underlying physical or human made processes of the regional tws change new hydrological insights for the region the relatively independent hydrological components in ncp with grace measurements are successfully derived which characterize annual variation surface water storage sws change and the shallow and deep groundwater storage sgws and dgws changes respectively based on them it is found that sgws decreases faster before 2009 and then reduces slower and keeps stable while dgws decreases faster after 2009 especially after 2012 further investigation shows that the anthropogenic influences significantly enhance the vertical heterogeneity of water storage changes based on their exploitations of different hydrological components in which the south to north water diversion of china changes the water use mode in ncp especially for the reduction of the sgws exploitation keywords independent component analysis north china plain gravity recovery and climate experiment time series analysis signal decomposition terrestrial water storage 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is an important region in china with many agricultural social and economic activities foster et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 and a complex hydrogeological environment huang et al 2015 under the increasing pressure from natural conditions and human activities tang et al 2013 ncp is facing severe water scarcity wang et al 2020 severe groundwater storage loss and land subsidence occur due to the long term groundwater overexploitation in ncp zhang et al 2009 besides some water diversion projects like the south to north water diversion snwd are producing highly uneven regional effects on water resources in ncp rogers et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 e g the diverted water can be utilized and groundwater has been recharged in the subregions along the water transfer line recently precipitation at ncp has been declining which has increased the level of water scarcity zhao et al 2019 terrestrial water storage tws is an important index to characterize regional water resources the features of tws changes are complicated by issues mentioned earlier and are necessary to be assessed launched in march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission has been used to detect tws variations worldwide huang et al 2015 rodell et al 2007 previous studies have widely used the grace data to analyze water resource characteristics in ncp and found the effects of human activities as well as the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of tws feng et al 2013 2018 gong et al 2018 huang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 as the middle route of snwd along danjinagkou reservior to ncp operated in december 2014 a few researchers began to study the effect of the middle route of snwd on the tws changes in ncp via grace data long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2021 however grace measured mass signals are affected by many global or local geophysical processes such as the hydrological cycle and earthquake moreover the grace data provide integrated tws change in surface water storage sws biomass snow mass soil moisture storage sms and groundwater storage gws the disaggregation of grace tws anomalies into different hydrological component e g gws changes will be inevitably affected by the errors in these water balance term estimates boergens et al 2014 han and cao 2018 the separation of the grace observed mass changes based on their statistical properties may be a useful alternative method boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 as a common feature extraction method principal component analysis pca lorenz 1956 linearly extracts underlying uncorrelated low dimensional ones to represent high dimensional inputs via minimizing the variance of residuals however the derived specific signals via pca may have multiple features especially in the first principle component pc hindering the linking of pcs to natural source signals hsiao et al 2017 instead of transforming uncorrelated components independent component analysis ica comon 1994 which is another linear transformation method and initially developed for blind source separation uses higher than second order statistical indicators to derive statistically independent components ics while in pca statistical independence may not be satisfied among pcs when nonlinear relationships exist hsiao et al 2017 ica tends to be more appropriate to separate source signals of hydrological data boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 forootan 2014 hsiao et al 2017 many previous studies have used ica to analyze the grace data on global and regional scales most of them study on the denoising of tws forootan et al 2020 frappart et al 2010 2011 guo et al 2014 li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b or finding the relationship between the ics and hydrometeorological elements on the relatively large scale agutu et al 2019 boergens et al 2014 forootan and kusche 2012 forootan et al 2018 few studies focus on its application in ncp 140 000 km2 to investigate the characteristics of tws changes compared with multi source data to our knowledge only shu et al 2018 applied pca to study the spatiotemporal features of gws in ncp the natural conditions e g vadose zone and aquifer heterogeneity topography and human activities e g land use water use exert non uniform stress on hydrological processes in this region rogers et al 2020 sakura et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 therefore the sub components of tws in ncp have relatively strong statistical independence and non gaussianity cai et al 2021 due to the independent physical processes forootan 2014 hyvärinen et al 2001 which satisfies the mathematical assumptions of ica additionally because the earlier and shorter grace data series in the previous studies may impede the pattern derivation of the source signals the longer period i e 2002 2017 of the multi source data is selected in this study the mascon mass concentration solutions of grace save et al 2016 are used for their relatively good performance of regional mass change studies scanlon et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 besides although previous studies demonstrate that pca cannot perform well as ica for blind signal separation it can be a common preprocessing technique of ica for multidimensional data e g grace data to reduce its dimension hyvärinen et al 2001 in this way we can often reduce noise and prevent overlearning since the omitted dimensions are assumed as white noise or low and unimportant signal fluctuations in the grace derived tws ferreira et al 2020 hyvärinen et al 2001 therefore pca is used in this study as a first step before implementing ica the primary purpose of the current study is to reveal the latent relatively independent hydrological components in ncp via ica to better understand the tws changes in ncp and its implications to regional water resources management which is not implemented in the previous studies to this end the data from multiple sources like the satellite models and in situ measurements are collected to identify the signals then further analysis and discussion on the derived hydrological components are conducted in the following we first describe the methods in section 2 the study area and data are shown in sections 3 and 4 then we exhibit the test results in section 5 and make a discussion in section 6 our major conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 methods 2 1 principal component analysis introduced by pearson 1901 pca can linearly decompose the data matrix x e n e is the number of observations in each site while n is the number of observation sites into some uncorrelated time series i e pcs and the corresponding spatial weights through singular value decomposition which can be shown as 1 x p v t where v n n is the weight matrix with the normalized columns i e vv t i and p includes the pcs that can be further shown as 2 x ud v t where u e n contains normalized pcs i e uu t i and d is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements d ii λ i where i min e n which are ranked in decreasing order hence the variance of each pc can be described by the corresponding value of λ to determine the significance of each pc and the number of the first pcs to approximate the data jolliffe 2002 the eigenvalue spectrum λ is calculated based on the λ values as 3 λ ii λ i i λ i 2 2 independent component analysis as a feature extraction method ica has a powerful ability to find unknown latent variables to linearly represent the observed multidimensional data hyvärinen et al 2001 these latent variables i e ics are generally difficult to be observed and assumed to be non gaussian and mutually independent which is consistent with the properties of most physical components in nature forootan 2014 specifically the observed data matrix x can be expressed as 4 x sa where the original explanatory signal matrix s e p is formed of p sources during e epochs the link between x and s is described by the mixing matrix i e weight matrix a p n and each ic e 1 column of s has its weight vector a 1 n row of a the ics can be obtained by calculating the inverse of the mixing matrix a i e w n p the process can be shown as 5 s xw the object of ica is to make ic estimates as independent non gaussian and simple as possible via estimating a or w we implement this step by minimizing the mutual information of the s estimate hyvärinen and oja 2000 the details of the computational formula for the mutual information can refer to hyvärinen and oja 2000 although ica is useful to reveal the latent independent signals for a complex system it should be noted that the ica method has some ambiguities or indeterminacies hyvärinen et al 2001 first the amplitudes of ics cannot be determined which also leaves the ambiguity of the sign and may make the ics and their corresponding observations negatively correlated in this case a negative unit coefficient is used for the specific ic to correct its sign second the order of the ics may be different in each running nevertheless it has limited effects on the identification of the ics 2 3 the implementation details the methodology flow diagram in fig 1 exhibits the data processing procedure before applying the algorithms we normalize the grace data to avoid the effects of the widely varied data on the model s ability hyvärinen et al 2001 zhang et al 2018 when implementing these algorithms the grace data at the objective locations for a time epoch are reshaped in a vector and the vectors for all time epochs form the spatiotemporal matrix x in this study we first derive pcs from x using pca then the ics are obtained based on the several selected pcs via ica the number of ics is determined via pca the derived ics and multi source data are then linearly interpolated resampled and filtered via the moving average method to make the identification 2 4 evaluation metric for identifying the ics we apply cross correlation corr to measure the relationships between the ics and multi source data corr is widely used in the hydrology discipline e g krishan et al 2014 which can be defined by 6 corr i 1 n i c i ic s i s i 1 n i c i ic 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where n denotes the number of epochs of collected data ic i denotes the ith epoch of one ic s n 1 denotes one kind of explanatory variable e g sms derived from noah used to identify the ics means the average value the uncertainty of the ics in the repeated trials can be measured by the ensemble spread sp reichle and koster 2003 7 sp 1 n 1 r 1 i 1 n j 1 r i c i j ic i 2 where r denotes the number of realizations 3 study area ncp is a well known plain in eastern asia covering an area of 140 000 km2 fig 2 a previous studies have found the highly vertical variation of water storage in ncp for example sakura et al 2003 reported that there is one unconfined aquifer with a depth of 40 60 m and three confined aquifers with different depths i e 120 170 m 250 350 m and 400 600 m in ncp zhang et al 2009 defined four main geological layers vertically according to water utilization and hydrogeological conditions the shallower two layers which are unconfined and semi confined aquifers with the depths of 10 50 m and 210 m respectively are used for ecological services and irrigation activities the deeper two layers are confined aquifers with depths of 310 m and 310 m the third aquifer is often used for domestic and industrial purposes besides many water diversions in ncp like the recent snwd also tend to affect the distribution of tws components zhang et al 2021 4 data material 4 1 terrestrial water storage anomalies from grace in this study the rl05 grace monthly solutions based on mascon functions are used they are developed with a 0 5 resolution by the university of texas at austin s center for space research csr which is similar to the solutions via the jet propulsion laboratory jpl usa save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 compared with jpl mascon data constrained based on grace data and the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas data csr solutions only use grace data liu et al 2020a save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 containing more native features of grace data that can be used as inputs for ica the tws anomalies represented in terms of equivalent water thickness are used the study period is between april 2002 and june 2017 with e 163 epochs while the study area includes n 86 0 5 grid cells in ncp since we study the long term pattern of tws changes in the basin scale level scale factors are not used scanlon et al 2016 4 2 other multi source explanatory data 4 2 1 climate data we obtain global land surface temperature and precipitation from the climate prediction center cpc i e the global daily temperature version 1 0 i e maximum and minimum temperature and unified gauge based analysis of precipitation chen et al 2008 both have a spatial resolution of 0 5 and the products during 2002 2017 are used to analyze temporal patterns of grace derived tws time series 4 2 2 land surface model outputs the gldas hydrological models e g noah simulate many land surface states like soil moisture runoff accumulated snow water energy flux rodell et al 2005 several studies long et al 2014 yang et al 2013 have reported that noah monthly simulations relate well with grace derived tws therefore gldas 2 1 noah v3 3 model output monthly with a spatial resolution of 1 from january 2002 and december 2017 is used in this study besides daily products from catchment land surface models clsm v2 2 are used to derive shallow groundwater storage sgws it does not consider the anthropogenic influence and only includes the shallow aquifers with a depth around 5 8 m hu et al 2021 li et al 2019 at 0 25 resolution from feb 1 2003 to dec 31 2017 4 2 3 surface water storage from haihe river water conservancy commission ministry of water resource of the people s republic of china hwcc and mwr 2016 the surface water storage during 2004 2016 of the major reservoirs in or near ncp are collected and interpolated as in zhao et al 2019 hwcc sws the newest results from watergap global hydrology model wghm version 2 2d are also applied to derive sws wghm sws which has closed water balance and improved human water use simulations capabilities li et al 2020 müller et al 2020 4 2 4 in situ groundwater level observations we collect the monthly in situ groundwater level observations gls during 2005 2015 from the groundwater level yearbook compiled by the institute of china geological environment monitoring china institute of geo environmental monitoring cigem 2015 in the study area 267 monitoring wells are used including 103 wells in the unconfined aquifers and 164 wells in the confined aquifers fig 2 a 4 2 5 land cover products from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci defourny et al 2014 the globally annual land cover maps v2 0 7 with 38 land cover types and a 300 m spatial resolution from 2002 to 2015 are obtained due to the relatively small change of land cover especially for the cropland fig 2 c we only show the product in 2015 for this study fig 2 b land cover types with small areas such as water or bare land were omitted 5 results the data matrix 163 86 of grace derived tws is first normalized and then analyzed via pca the derived results are shown in table 1 which are similar to shu et al 2018 the variance of the first pc is considerably larger than the rest of the pcs indicating several independent signals included the variance of the 5th pc is less than 0 01 the first four pcs which include around 98 of the variance in grace derived tws and are well extracted from the rest residuals are selected for the following analysis via ica results of the ics and corresponding weight vectors of the grace derived tws can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively we smooth the series via a three month moving average to suppress high frequency components the sign of temporal ics has been adjusted according to the corresponding mixing matrix for example the adjusted sign of an ic is negative if the large absolute elements in the corresponding weight vector a are negative since we believe that the hydrological components are the localizations of the grace derived tws therefore the main trends of the hydrological components and tws are assumed to be consistent concerning the temporal ics it is evident that ic2 fig 3 b represents the annual variations the annual peak of ic2 corresponds to the annual rainy season while ic1 fig 3 a ic3 fig 3 c ic4 fig 3 d represent the residual changes of different components respectively fig 4 b shows that the values of weight vector of ic2 a2 are evenly distributed throughout ncp except for the coastal plain at the margin of the bohai sea which is reasonable since there is a relatively small area of cropland with small effects by agricultural activities e g irrigation besides the annual variations affected by the monsoon climate are homogeneous in most parts of ncp while the coastal area has a unique local climate feature as for the others the large absolute values of a1 fig 4 a a3 fig 4 c and a4 fig 4 d are clustered in the east central north and south parts of ncp respectively the multi source data are used to identify these features in the following sections the ordering of the identified ics is fixed for clarity 5 1 the identification of the fourth independent component ic4 the spatial average values of soil moisture storage at the depths of 0 2 m in ncp from gldas noah noah sms are used to identify the ics it is straightforward to find that ic4 best fits noah sms fig 3 d besides the large absolute values of the weight vector a4 fig 4 d locate mainly at the south of ncp where a large area of cropland exists fig 2 b and the irrigation water is primarily extracted in the shallow aquifers zhang et al 2009 as part of the shallow subsurface water resource there is a good connection between sms and sgws thus the simulated sms from gldas can reflect the patterns of sgws to some extent besides the sgws from clsm clsm sgws also has similar variations and a higher corr with ic4 although clsm sgws has a more significantly decreasing trend during 2014 2017 without consideration of the effects of snwd the comparison between ic4 and the different components of sms derived from noah fig s1 and fig s2 in the supplementary material shows that ic4 has a higher corr with deeper sms derived from noah especially for the sms at the deepest 4th layer 4th sms which has a closer connection with clsm sgws compared with shallower sms to further verify the identification the in situ gl measurements in ncp are divided into two parts based on whether observation wells are located in phreatic or confined aquifers as in previous studies feng et al 2013 hu et al 2016 shen et al 2015 we first calculate the gl anomalies glas by subtracting the gl mean values for each monitoring wells during 2005 2015 then we take the average of the glas to estimate the change of gls over the study area the derived phreatic site averaged gla pgla and confined site average gla cgla are expected to connect features of sgws and deep gws dgws respectively fig 5 a shows that pgla decreases before 2009 and then becomes relatively stable which is similar to the temporal pattern of ic4 based on the above analyses we believe that ic4 mainly characterizes sgws in ncp 5 2 the identification of the third independent component ic3 potential evapotranspiration et is derived via the hargreaves equation with the maximum and minimum daily land surface temperature of cpc and the calibrated parameters in hu et al 2011 then the daily precipitation p of cpc and the derived et are resampled into monthly data and averaged over 12 month moving windows to identify ics which are shown in fig 6 besides a drought index spei the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index that considers combining effects of p and et is also shown along with ic3 short and medium time scales of spei are mainly related to variations of soil water content river discharge and reservoir storage therefore a time scale of six months is selected for spei it is easy to find that the pattern affected by the combined function of p and et fig 6 is close to ic3 for example ic3 decreases during 2014 when it is a visible drought period with relatively small p large et and the continuous negative spei values while ic3 increases first and then remains at a peak due to storage constraints during 2012 2013 when it is an apparent wet period with relatively large p low et and the continuous positive spei values considering that sws is more susceptible to meteorological conditions than the other components of tws it indicates that ic3 represents the temporal pattern of sws change the sws data collected from hwcc hwcc sws and wghm wghm sws are compared with the ic3 fig 3 c their good fits further demonstrate that ic3 is related to sws however there is inconsistency during 2004 2005 when ic3 increases with relatively stable p and large et while hwcc sws remains low as for ic4 representing sgws fig 3 d a significant drop occurred at the start of 2004 then ic3 has a considerable increase a possible conjecture is that the rise in ic3 representing sws during the drought period may be recharged from the excessive pumping in sgws ic4 which is not calculated in hwcc sws by the relevant statistical bureau but detected by grace sws only accounts for a small portion of tws in ncp feng et al 2013 the extracted water is transferred from the subsurface reservoir to the surface land e g irrigation resulting in a significant increase in sws thus changing the gravity observation signal wghm sws considering human activities also shows an increasing trend at the same period as ic3 besides the large absolute values of the weight vector a3 fig 4 c distribute mainly in the north of ncp e g beijing tianjin where there are many reservoirs and water diversions as well as strict policies for using groundwater e g suppression of agricultural water use long et al 2020 therefore there is more local utilization of sws than in other subregions according to these analyses ic3 is believed to represent sws 5 3 the identification of the first independent component ic1 many authors e g bonsor et al 2018 use grace derived tws and other hydrological model outputs like sms and sws to trace changes in regional scale target variables e g gws based on the water balance method gws in ncp is generally and simply calculated from grace and gldas noah data grace noah gws frappart and ramillien 2018 as 8 gws tws sms snws cws where tws is derived from the grace data sms snws i e snow water equivalent and cws i e plant canopy surface water are derived from the noah model for the convenience of calculations the spatial resolution of grace data is resampled onto 1 and the temporal resolution of grace data is made consistent to one month e g two data points within a month are averaged the data in the missing months are derived via linear interpolation based on a similar principle dgws can be derived from grace and clsm data grace clsm dgws as 9 dgws tws rzsm snws cws sgws where rzsm i e root zone soil moisture snws cws and sgws are derived from clsm as tws in the model outputs some details about different descriptions of hydrological components e g sms and rzsm in the noah and clsm model can refer to supplementary material and rui and beaudoing 2020 there are two periods with significantly different change patterns in the derived gwss grace noah gws and grace clsm gws see fig 3 a the derived gwss during the first period from 2002 to 2009 are relatively stationary however during the second period from 2010 to 2017 their decrease is more obvious and has larger amplitudes these features are most related to ic1 among the ics besides their short term variations also fit ic1 best although there is significant inconsistency before 2004 landerer et al 2020 reported that the first two years of grace data experienced higher errors which affects the results of ica and mainly causes the considerable inconsistency the large absolute values of the weight vector a1 fig 4 a are distributed mainly in the east central part of ncp like the central plain where primary deeper groundwater pumping occurs huang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 considering that ic2 represents sgws and the ics obtained by ica are as independent as possible ic1 tends to represent the deep gws dgws it further demonstrates that grace clsm dgws has a higher corr with ic4 than grace noah gws the more stable trend of grace clsm dgws during 2014 2017 may result from the overestimation of the decreasing trend of clsm sgws since clsm does not consider the effects of snwd also described in section 5 1 besides based on the discussions in the supplementary material the 4th sms might share some common components with clsm sgws therefore grace noah gws tends to have more characteristics of dgws however we should also note that the overestimation of the decreasing trend during 2014 2017 via grace noah gws exists since the water storage at deeper depths i e over 2 m is not considered in the noah sms furthermore cgla fig 5 b significantly shows two different depletion rates between 2002 and 2009 and 2009 2017 especially after 2012 also the amplitudes of cgla increased substantially after 2009 characterizing an essential recharge source to dgws pgla remains stable fig 5 a water balance analysis indicates that the discharge source of cgla e g the pumping may contribute to its decreasing trend similar patterns also exist in ic1 and ic4 which further support our conclusion that ic1 represents dgws 6 discussion 6 1 discussion on the independent components for further investigation some quantitative analyses are made we first calculate the corrs for the 3 month moving average versions of the ics and hydrological components derived by the multi source data e g noah sms wghm sws and clsm sgws some periods with wrong or low quality data based on the above analysis e g ic1 during 2002 2003 are excluded the corr values shown in fig 3 and fig 5 do not exceed the nominal significance level 0 05 while the most significant corr values between each multi source data and the ics are consistent with our identification for showing the uncertainty of ica approach we conduct five repeated ica runnings with different initial values of w we first obtain the corresponding ics and sign via analyzing the corrs between different ics then the corresponding ics in the five repeated implementations are used to calculate the sps the average ics of the five realizations are used to make a cross correlation analysis the results table 2 show that the ics have strong statistical independence and good stability the ways human activities consume water resources and their changes under the effects of the eastern and middle routes of snwd have been detected from the changes of the derived hydrological components to some extent based on fig 6 there are two distinct drought periods i e 2004 2005 2014 in which the change patterns between ics which represent sws sgws and dgws respectively are not similar in the first period ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreased first while ic3 sws fig 3 c increased then ic1 dgws fig 3 a decreased we believe that the overexploitation of sgws increased sws see section 5 2 then the less sgws caused the net recharge to dgws decrease leading to the subsequent decrease of dgws in the second period i e 2014 2015 the drought climate condition immediately resulted in the decrease of ic3 sws fig 3 c then ic1 dgws fig 3 a and ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreased in turn compared with the first period the second drought event did not force people to exploit sgws it is reasonable since snwd became operational i e december 2013 for the eastern route and december 2014 for the middle route long et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 snwd supplies water resources for the drought and changes the water use ratio of sws to gws to some extent long et al 2020 found that the mean gl records indicate gws recovery during 2015 2019 in beijing since the middle route of snwd operated and zhang et al 2020 2021 found that sgws in ncp began to recover during 2015 2018 which is shown in ic4 sgws fig 3 d however we should note that ic1 dgws fig 3 a has a significant downward trend during 2012 2017 long et al 2020 reported the conjunctive use of sws and gws as a new water use mode in beijing which is shown in the changing patterns of ics ic3 and ic1 sws and dgws fig 3 c and fig 3 a first decrease in turn during 2014 2015 though recovering immediately ic1 dgws fig 3 a over 2015 2017 still shows a decreasing trend then ic4 sgws fig 3 d decreases due to the decrease of the water amount in the adjacent hydrological components i e sws and dgws but it remains stable over 2015 2017 the changing patterns between the ics show the utilization of sws and dgws besides zhao et al 2019 found inconsistent subsidence rates before and after 2013 in ncp derived by gps indicating different exploitation rates between sgws and dgws moreover the hydrological components derived by the hydrological model and land surface model e g wghm sws and clsm sgws without considering the effects of snwd resulted in bad fits with the ics during 2014 2017 which also demonstrates the change of the water use mode 6 2 uncertainties and limitations although sws sgws and dgws have distinct definitions and are relatively independent gao 2008 yang et al 2020 there are some connections between sws sgws and dgws which means that the separation of them from tws does not perfectly satisfy the assumption of the ica approach i e the ics must be statistically independent some high frequency components still exist in the ics and some seasonal features are shown in ic1 ic3 and ic4 due to some hardware or technical problems inherently e g an age related battery issue the inconsistency of data quality of grace in different subsystems and periods may result in some uncertainties landerer et al 2020 in the comparisons between ics and other multi source explanatory data some inconsistencies originate from a number of factors such as the uncertainty of hydrological model outputs e g the noah model neither includes all water reservoirs rivers feng et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 nor considers human activities the imperfect match of the hydrological components derived from the multi source data and ics e g noah sms and sgws the different temporal and spatial scales of data e g hwcc sws and wghm sws problems of omission and double counting in different statistical data e g hwcc sws the seasonal variation and residual signals in the derived hydrological components and some issues in some in situ gl data e g data gaps offsets abnormal jumps outliers the spatial heterogeneity of specific yield and storativity the factors mentioned above bring difficulties for the identification based on single source data however we believe that the identifications are robust after multi source validation 7 conclusions in this paper we use ica to analyze the grace data to understand the features of tws changes in ncp we first identify the different temporal features i e ics of grace data using multi source data then the identified ics are further analyzed last the uncertainties in this study are discussed our work leads to the following major conclusions 1 it is feasible to use the ica method to analyze the grace data in ncp 140 000 km2 based on it different hydrological components i e sws sgws and dgws in ncp are successfully detected 2 the temporal features of sgws and dgws are significantly different during 2002 2017 sgws decreases faster before 2009 then decreases slower and remains stable thereafter dgws decreases faster after 2009 especially after 2012 during the study period 3 the anthropogenic influences e g water use modes policies diversion projects largely strengthen the vertical heterogeneity of tws component changes snwd has alleviated the over exploitation of shallow groundwater to some extent our studies extend the application of the ica technique to ncp further demonstrating the regional heterogeneity of water resource changes in ncp these findings might inspire us to improve regional grace data reconstruction more abundant data e g data from grace follow on and reconstructed grace type data forootan et al 2020 li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 and improved icas hyvärinen et al 2019 richard et al 2020 are expected to better reveal spatiotemporal characteristics of tws in ncp for regional water resources management e g reducing

international concern here we quantify enrichment of eight metals be cd cr cu ni pb v zn in aquatic biota relative to sediment based pre industrial baselines via analysis of biofilm sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers deployed during summers of 2017 and 2018 in 40 lakes widespread flooding in the southern portion of the delta in spring 2018 allows for assessment of metal enrichment by athabasca river floodwaters new hydrological insights river floodwaters are not implicated as a pathway of metal enrichment to biofilm sediment mixtures in pad lakes from upstream sources manova tests revealed no significant difference in residual concentrations of all eight metals in lakes that did not flood versus lakes that flooded during one or both study years also no enrichment was detected for concentrations of biologically inert metals be cr pb and those related to oil sands development ni v enrichment of cd cu and zn at non flooded lakes however suggests uptake of biologically active metals complicates comparisons of organic rich biofilm sediment mixtures to sediment derived baselines for these metals results demonstrate that this novel approach could be

park action plan 1 introduction northern freshwater ecosystems provide invaluable natural resources and hold cultural and societal significance but are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities dudgeon et al 2006 schindler 2010 schindler and smol 2006 to safeguard these ecosystems evidence based management decisions need to be guided by monitoring data capable of quantifying the extent of degradation roach and walker 2017 ability to conduct informed monitoring for contaminants of concern however is often hindered by a lack of knowledge of pre disturbance concentrations and natural variation because data collection tends to be initiated after onset of anthropogenic disturbance blais et al 2015 long term datasets that extend to pre disturbance periods are critical to identify the influence of anthropogenic activities versus natural processes on the environment lindenmayer and likens 2009 2010 especially when located downstream of natural sources of substances of concern wiklund et al 2014 it is therefore advantageous but infrequent to design monitoring programs that incorporate information about pre disturbance concentrations to allow for rapid real time determination of the degree of degradation one such at risk system is the peace athabasca delta pad located in northeastern alberta canada as the world s largest inland freshwater boreal delta the hundreds of productive shallow lakes in the pad provide critical habitat to biota and support traditional lifestyles of local indigenous communities timoney 2013 these ecosystem services merited the pad s designation as a ramsar wetland of international importance and contributed to wood buffalo national park s wbnp recognition as a unesco world heritage site which contains 80 of the pad however ongoing expansion of mining in the alberta oil sands region aosr has long generated concerns that contaminants are being released into the athabasca river and delivered downstream to the pad where they have potential to degrade water quality of rivers and lakes dowdeswell et al 2010 schindler 2010 timoney and lee 2009 the urgent need for better monitoring practices in the pad has been emphasized in a petition by the mikisew cree first nation in 2014 to enlist wbnp as world heritage in danger mcfn mikisew cree first nation 2014 recommendations by the unesco world heritage committee whc iucn 2017 and priorities within the wood buffalo national park action plan wood buffalo national park wbnp 2019 an approach that has been proposed for effective monitoring of oil sands pollution is paleolimnological investigation of sediment cores from lakes to establish the range of natural variability of substances of concern prior to industrialization dowdeswell et al 2010 wrona and di cenzo 2011 this approach has been implemented in the pad and the results have served to develop knowledge of the natural variability of metal concentrations in pre 1920 lake sediment kay et al 2020 wiklund et al 2012 2014 sediment deposited before 1920 pre date the earliest paleolimnological evidence of atmospheric deposition of pollutants from industrial emissions which was followed by a decline in atmospheric deposition after 1970 as industrial practices improved wiklund et al 2012 these baselines enabled evaluation of contamination of lakes by atmospheric and fluvial pathways using contemporary concentrations of metals of concern in surface sediment of lakes across the pad which demonstrated no substantial enrichment above the pre 1920 baselines owca et al 2020 their study analyzed 1 cm thick surface sediment samples collected in 2017 which captured recent time periods of sediment deposition that are variable among lakes 2 5 years also included was analysis of exclusively flood supplied surface sediment samples collected in 2018 from lakes that had received river floodwaters two months prior however because such flood events are episodic and of varying magnitude development and testing of additional real time monitoring approaches of metal concentrations in lakes are warranted among the plethora of complementary approaches for monitoring contaminants artificial substrate samplers which accrue a mixture of biofilm consisting of communities of periphytic algae fungi and microbes and entrapped suspended sediments jowett and biggs 1997 szlauer łukaszewska 2007 wu 2017 may provide some advantages they offer careful control of biofilm sediment accrual time and circumvent potential difficulties associated with locating and collecting appropriate natural substrates macdonald et al 2012 wiklund et al 2010 because of these advantages artificial substrate samplers have been tested and used for monitoring water quality biggs 1989 including metals content holding et al 2003 namba et al 2020 pederson and vaultonburg 1996 ramelow et al 1987 1992 tang et al 2014 for several metals of concern concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers have been shown to correspond well with concentrations in sediment from the same locations holding et al 2003 ramelow et al 1987 1992 this suggests there is potential to combine use of artificial substrate samplers with measurements of pre industrial metal concentrations in sediment cores to evaluate for evidence of enrichment relative to natural conditions which to our knowledge is a novel approach here we use concentrations of metals in pre industrial pre 1920 lake sediment and in biofilm sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers during the open water seasons of 2017 and 2018 to quantify enrichment of metals of concern at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad given the novelty of the approach we first test the assumption that concentrations of metals in biofilm sediment mixtures and lake surface sediment follow the same relation with the geochemical normalizer aluminum using a subset of lakes that received floodwaters in 2018 this is important because it would then suggest that estimates of enrichment derived from analysis of biofilm sediment mixtures relative to pre 1920 sediment baselines is a reasonable approach and not reflective of differences in analytical substrates to assess the role of river floodwaters on potential metal enrichment of biofilm sediment mixtures our study spans two years which includes numerous lakes inundated by the large ice jam flood event in spring 2018 remmer et al 2020a most of the flooding in spring of 2018 occurred in the southern athabasca sector of the delta which provides opportunity to evaluate the extent of contamination in athabasca river water and sediment by upstream oil sands development the suite of metals selected for this study follow

in northeastern alberta canada the 6000 km2 pad contains hundreds of shallow lakes fig 1 the pad is composed of two hydrologically distinct sectors the northern peace sector and the southern athabasca sector lakes in the relic delta of the northern peace sector experience limited river connectivity wolfe et al 2007 episodic ice jam events on the peace river during the spring freshet are required to generate widespread flooding peters et al 2006 in contrast lakes in the relic and active delta portions of the southern athabasca sector experience a spectrum of limited intermittent or continuous surface connection with the northward flowing athabasca river and its distributaries remmer et al 2020b wolfe et al 2007 previous research has documented the extent of ice jam and open water flooding with respect to the study lakes in the pad during 2017 and 2018 remmer et al 2020a 2020b fig 1 ice jam flooding was more widespread in the athabasca sector in spring 2018 than in spring 2017 compared to spring ice jam flooding a smaller number of lakes in the athabasca sector also received open water flooding in summer 2017 and summer and fall 2018 in the peace sector no lakes were flooded in 2017 limited ice jam flooding occurred in spring 2018 and one lake pad 54 also received open water flooding in summer and fall 2018 2 2 fieldwork artificial substrate samplers were deployed from the pontoon of a helicopter into 25 lakes in the athabasca sector and 24 lakes in the peace sector on may 22 24 2017 and retrieved on september 12 14 2017 fig 1 samplers were deployed again the following year on may 21 23 2018 and retrieved from 20 lakes in the athabasca sector and 22 lakes in the peace sector on september 15 17 2018 fig 1 samplers were retrieved from the same lake in both years for 15 lakes in the athabasca sector and 16 lakes in the peace sector samplers consisted of 52 5 cm by 18 cm high density polypropylene shields attached by rope on one end to a wooden float covered in styrofoam to maintain buoyancy and to a rock on the other end to remain anchored to the lake bottom fig 2 rope lengths were sufficient to ensure that samplers were suspended vertically at approximately 10 15 cm deep in the water column polypropylene shields act as an inert substrate that accrue a periphytic biofilm of algae microbes and other biota to which suspended particles may adhere via passive transport a previous study of lakes in the pad has shown that differences in algal community composition between artificial substrate samplers and macrophytes were comparable to differences between macrophyte species providing confidence that samplers accrue representative algal communities wiklund et al 2010 upon retrieval of the samplers shields were placed individually into plastic ziploc bags frozen and transported to university of waterloo where they remained frozen until processed for analysis ice jam flooding in the peace and athabasca sectors in spring 2018 provided opportunity to acquire recently deposited river supplied flood sediment from 6 flooded lakes in the athabasca sector pad 19 pad 22 pad 30 pad 31 pad 33 and pad 36 and 7 flooded lakes in the peace sector pad 15 pad 50 pad 54 pad 58 pad 64 m17 and m18 in july 2018 owca et al 2020 these surface sediment flood layer samples captured a similar timeframe of metals accumulation as biofilm sediment mixtures collected in 2018 and therefore were used to directly compare metal aluminum relations for these two substrate types 2 3 laboratory analyses all processing was performed on the shields after they were removed from the freezer and thawed the biofilm sediment mixtures were removed from the shields by scraping and rinsing with a recorded volume of deionized water the final volume of contents biofilm sediment mixture plus rinse water was also recorded before further subsampling for loss on ignition loi analysis 20 ml were pipetted into a glass scintillation vial for metals analysis the remaining contents were added to a plastic cup and frozen until further processing loi was performed to measure the dry mass and organic matter content om of biofilm sediment samples following standard methods heiri et al 2001 for each lake the 20 ml loi subsample was added to a pre weighed porcelain crucible the crucibles were then dried in an oven at 90 c for 18 h to determine the dry sample mass the crucibles were combusted in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h cooled and reweighed to determine om relative to dry mass for determination of metal concentrations periphyton subsamples were freeze dried weighed and analyzed by als environmental vancouver bc following epa method 200 3 6020a united states environmental protection agency us epa 1998 this is a hotblock digestion with hno3 and hcl in combination with h2o2 which provides a conservative estimate of bioavailable metals in organic tissue these methods are similar to the analysis of metal concentrations used to establish pre industrial baselines from lake sediment cores kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 uncertainties are 231 8 mg kg for al 0 022 mg kg for be 0 013 mg kg for cd 0 356 mg kg

handling and analysis pre industrial baselines were established in previous studies from concentrations of metals in river supplied sediment deposited before 1920 at two flood prone lakes in the peace sector n 65 sediment samples owca et al 2020 and at eight flood prone lakes in the athabasca sector n 122 sediment samples kay et al 2020 fig 1 for our study we added concentrations of metals in sediment from riverbank exposures at sites situated along the lower peace 3 sites n 33 samples and athabasca 2 sites n 37 samples for all metals except n 26 for be n 29 for cd and n 34 for cr rivers to these pre 1920 baselines fig 1 the riverbank samples were collected at locations sampled by hugenholtz et al 2009 and from strata older than 1920 based on their chronological data pre 1920 baselines are represented as linear relations with 95 prediction intervals pi between concentrations of the metals of interest be cd cr cu ni pb v zn and al normalization to al accounts for variations in sediment metal concentrations associated with energy conditions and grain size covelli and fontolan 1997 forstner and müller 1981 kersten and smedes 2002 loring 1991 and has been widely used in the region aosr and pad cooke et al 2017 kay et al 2020 klemt et al 2020 owca et al 2020 owca et al 2020 determined that al is the generally superior normalizing agent for the metals of interest in both sectors of the pad and that the slopes of all metal al relations differ between sectors therefore separate linear relations for each metal were used for each sector as a first step of data exploration we tested the assumption that metal concentrations in both the biofilm sediment mixtures and lake surface sediment follow the same relationship with the geochemical normalizer al for this exploration we used measurements of metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures and the flood layer of river supplied surface sediment collected in 2018 at 13 lakes in the pad the biofilm sediment mixture collected from pad 33 was below the detection limit for ni concentration so it was excluded from the analysis of ni for each of the 8 metals of interest an analysis of covariance ancova was performed to test if slopes and y intercepts of the metal al regression lines differed between biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment ancova models were defined by each metal concentration as the dependent variable al concentration as the independent variable substrate type biofilm sediment mixture or surface sediment as the factor and the interaction between al concentration and substrate type ancova tests were performed using r version 3 5 3 and function aov r core team 2020 we then compared concentrations of metals measured in sediment biofilm mixtures obtained in 2017 and 2018 to the pre 1920 baselines using a series of cross plots with al as the independent variable and each metal of interest as the dependent variable this step was performed on samples from all biofilm sediment mixtures that were retrieved during either study year and cross plots are presented separately for 2017 n 49 and 2018 n 42 and by sector the subset of lakes where artificial substrate samplers were retrieved in both study years n 31 provided opportunity for paired samples comparisons to elucidate the influence of river flooding on concentrations of metals in the biofilm sediment mixtures these lakes were assigned to a flood category based on the number of years out of the two study years that the lakes received spring ice jam and or open water river floodwaters lakes were placed in the 0 category if they did not receive river floodwaters in either year athabasca sector n 6 peace sector n 11 in the 1 category if they received river floodwaters in 2018 but not in 2017 athabasca sector n 5 peace sector n 5 or in the 2 category if they received river floodwaters in both years athabasca sector n 4 peace sector n 0 no lakes received river floodwaters in 2017 but not 2018 designation of the flood category for each lake followed remmer et al 2020b we assessed enrichment of metals in biofilm sediment mixtures for the paired samples analysis of flood influence using residual concentrations the residual concentrations were calculated as the difference between the measured concentration of the metal in the biofilm sediment mixtures and the mean pre 1920 concentration of the metal determined from the baseline linear metal al relation at the measured concentration of al in the biofilm sediment mixtures for a given metal x this calculation is expressed as r e s i d u a l x m e a s u r e d x m e a n p r e 1920 x a t m e a s u r e d a l to evaluate if residual concentrations exceeded the range of variability before 1920 we calculated an enrichment threshold for each metal in each sector as the upper 95 prediction interval pi for residual concentrations at an al concentration of 1000 mg kg which closely approximates the median al concentration of all biofilm samples obtained in this study use of residual concentrations to quantify enrichment is consistent with studies by wiklund et al 2014 and macdonald et al 2016 and expresses enrichment in units of concentration of the metal of interest enrichment factors have also been used to quantify enrichment of metals in lake and river sediment in the pad and lower athabasca river cooke et al 2017 kay et al 2020 klemt et al 2020 owca et al 2020 wiklund et al 2014 but were inapplicable across the full range of concentration in our study because baseline concentrations were less well constrained at the low range of al concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures for some metals and resulted in some illogical efs i e values below zero using two series of boxplots and statistical tests distributions of residual metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures were grouped to compare among the lake flood categories and study years in the athabasca sector and in the peace sector when the upper whisker of the boxplots for the residual metal concentrations in a flood category exceeded the enrichment threshold this was considered enriched above the expected range of pre 1920 variability we used multivariate analysis of variance manova tests to determine if the residual concentrations of the suite of all 8 metals differed significantly for the above two comparisons the use of a single test to assess for differences in residual concentrations of the suite of all 8 metals achieves the pre determined type 1 error rate which is not readily achieved by multiple tests on each metal individually we ran two different repeated measures two way manova tests one on samples from lakes in the athabasca sector and one on samples from lakes in the peace sector these tests allowed us to determine differences in residual metal concentrations between the study years within subject factor among the flood categories between subject factor and the interaction of these two factors manova tests were performed using r version 3 5 3 r core team 2020 and function multrm in the manova rm package friedrich et al 2020 we report the manova type statistic mats because it does not assume multivariate normality covariance homogeneity and singularity of covariance matrices friedrich and pauly 2018 friedrich et al 2017 2019 we also report p values based on re sampling approaches parametric bootstrap with 9999 iterations which are robust for small sample sizes friedrich and pauly 2018 friedrich et al 2017 2019 for all tests alpha was set to 0 05 3 results 3 1 comparisons of metal al relations in biofilm sediment mixtures versus surface sediment collected from flooded lakes in 2018 comparisons of metal al relations in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to surface sediment collected from flooded lakes in 2018 show no significant interaction term for ancova models for all 8 metals fig 3 table 1 this indicates that the slopes of the regressions between concentrations of each metal and al do not differ between biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment due to non significant interaction terms a new set of eight ancova models were defined without an interaction term results show a significant and positive relation between al and each of the 8 metals but no significant effect of substrate type for 6 of 8 metals cd cr cu ni v zn fig 3 table 2 this indicates no significant difference in intercepts between the regression lines of biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment for these 6 metals and that the normalized metal concentrations can be readily compared between the substrate types although surface sediment has a higher intercept for be and pb than biofilm sediment mixtures we proceed to include them in the analyses below but consider their interpretation less well constrained fig 3 table 2 3 2 assessment of metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to pre 1920 baselines the dataset used to establish pre 1920 baseline linear relations between the 8 metals of interest be cd cr cu ni pb v zn and al was derived from previous studies kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 plus coarser grained riverbank sediment deposited before 1920 that captured al concentrations comparable to the low values in the biofilm sediment mixtures fig 4 statistically significant at alpha 0 05 positive linear relationships between all metals in both sectors and al enabled development of al normalized baselines table 3 high r2 values of the linear regressions support the inclusion of both lake sediments and riverbank sediments to develop the pre 1920 baselines slopes between concentrations of all metals except cr and concentrations of al are higher in lakes in the peace sector than in the athabasca sector we note that al normalized baselines for cd and cu in the athabasca sector were not possible with former datasets that did not include the riverbank sediment samples kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 the organic content of biofilm sediment mixtures varied among lakes figs 5 and 6 this is consistent with observation of different textures and amounts of homogenous material ranging in colour from brown to bright green accrued on the shields fig 2 nonetheless most metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures that accrued on artificial substrate samplers in 2017 and 2018 are captured within the pre 1920 baseline metal concentrations for the peace and athabasca sectors figs 5 and 6 in 2017 concentrations of be cr ni pb and v are primarily along the baseline linear relations with al concentration in both sectors although concentrations of cr ni and v in the peace sector and be in the athabasca sector more closely follow the lower 95 pi fig 5 in contrast concentrations of cd cu and zn are well above the upper 95 pi for several om rich 60 om biofilm sediment mixtures at the low end of the al concentration range and this is more apparent in the peace sector than the athabasca sector the relations between metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures and pre 1920 baselines are similar for samples obtained in 2018 fig 6 concentrations of metals are within pre 1920 baselines for both sectors apart from some om rich exceptions for cd cu and zn in contrast to 2017 a small number of biofilm sediment mixtures in 2018 also have concentrations of cr ni and pb that exceed the upper 95 pis overall metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures from both sectors in 2017 and 2018 follow similar al normalized concentrations as the pre 1920 baselines the exceptional cases include primarily concentrations of cd cu and zn in biofilms with high om content and low al concentration which are above the upper 95 pi these results indicate that the sediment derived baselines permit calculation of residual metal concentrations as the difference between the metal concentration in the biofilm and the baseline linear relation and comparison to enrichment thresholds i e the upper 95 pi to quantify and interpret the extent of enrichment above the range of natural variability 3 3 assessment of residual concentrations of metals for enrichment for lakes from which biofilm sediment mixtures were collected in both study years concentrations of metals in the mixtures were converted to residual concentrations relative to baseline concentrations and are displayed as a series of boxplots in figs 7 and 8 for lakes in the athabasca and peace sectors respectively lakes are categorized by flood category 0 not flooded in 2017 nor in 2018 1 flooded in 2018 only 2 flooded in both 2017 and 2018 and measurements are colour coded by study year dark 2017 light 2018 generating 6 groups for each of 8 metals and a total of 48 groups in the athabasca sector and 4 groups for each of 8 metals for a total of 32 groups in the peace sector there were fewer groups for the peace sector because none of the lakes received floodwaters in both years we assess for enrichment of each metal above the range of natural variability by comparison of the upper whisker of the boxplot for each group against the enrichment thresholds for each metal the upper whiskers of residual metal concentrations are below the enrichment thresholds for most groups indicating concentrations in the biofilm sediment mixtures are within the range of natural variation that existed before 1920 figs 7 and 8 table 4 in the athabasca sector there are six exceptions to this general pattern among the 48 groups 1 enrichment of cr above the threshold is observed for flood category 2 lakes in 2018 2 4 enrichment of cu above the threshold is observed for all three flood categories in 2017 5 enrichment of ni above the threshold is observed for flood category 2 lakes in 2018 and 6 enrichment of zn above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 lakes in 2017 fig 7 in the peace sector there are nine exceptions to this general pattern among the 32 groups 1 2 enrichment of cd above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 and flood category 1 lakes in 2017 3 6 enrichment of cu above the threshold is observed for lakes in flood categories 0 and 1 in 2017 and in 2018 7 enrichment of ni above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 lakes in 2018 and 8 9 enrichment of zn above the threshold is observed for lakes in flood categories 0 and 1 in 2017 fig 8 the combined total of these 15 exceptions in both sectors identifies that most occurrences of enrichment 11 of 15 are associated with measurements of cd cu ni and zn at lakes that did not flood two of the remaining occurrences of enrichment 2 of 15 are for cu at lakes that received floodwaters in 2017 at flood category 2 lakes in the athabasca sector and in 2018 at flood category 1 lakes in the peace sector but enrichment of cu occurred at all flood categories in 2017 in the athabasca sector and at all flood categories in 2018 in the peace sector the last two occurrences 2 of 15 are for cr and ni in 2018 at flood category 2 lakes in the athabasca sector that received floodwaters that year however these flood category 2 lakes do not exhibit enrichment of cr and ni in 2017 when they also flooded nor do flood category 1 lakes that flooded in 2018 thus there is no consistent association between enrichment of any metal and lakes that received floodwaters from the athabasca or peace rivers 3 4 statistical tests of residual concentrations of metals among flood categories and between study years within each sector repeated measures two way manova tests were conducted on the subset of 31 lakes where artificial substrate samplers were retrieved in both study years to provide a paired comparison by lake of residual metal concentrations among flood categories two tests were run to assess if residual concentrations of the suite of 8 metals differs among 1 the 6 groups in the athabasca sector 2 years x 3 flood categories 0 1 2 and 2 the 4 groups in the peace sector 2 years x 2 flood categories 0 1 the interaction terms athabasca mats 12 268 p 0 553 d f 2 12 14 peace mats 9 246 p 0 298 d f 2 3 15 were not significant table 5 thus the interaction term was removed from the model and each factor was tested individually residual concentrations of the 8 metals did not differ significantly among the flood categories in either sector athabasca p 0 124 peace p 0 167 suggesting occurrence of flooding in one or both study years does not alter concentrations relative to non flooded lakes table 5 consistent with this result the pooled boxplots for both study years illustrate broad overlap of interquartile ranges for most metals in all flood categories for both sectors i e first 8 panels of figs 7 and 8 the manova tests also determined that residual concentrations of all 8 metals do not differ significantly between 2017 and 2018 in the athabasca sector p 0 171 table 5 but differ significantly between 2017 and 2018 in the peace sector p 0 007 table 5 a non significant inter annual difference in the athabasca sector is depicted by differences in residual concentrations 2018 residual 2017 residual which have interquartile ranges that intersect zero for all metals last panel of fig 9 in contrast a significant inter annual difference in the peace sector is depicted by interquartile ranges of differences in residual concentrations that are substantially below zero for zn and marginally below zero for v last panel of fig 10 thus residual concentrations of metals remained relatively unchanged from 2017 to 2018 except for zn and to a lesser extent v in the peace sector which decreased from 2017 when there was no lake flooding to 2018 when a few lakes received floodwaters that spring 4 discussion biofilm sediment mixtures have long been explored as monitors for metal pollution pederson and vaultonburg 1996 ramelow et al 1987 1992 and here we demonstrate a novel application of these media with reference to baseline metal concentrations measured in pre industrial pre 1920 lake sediments comparison of the two media is supported by statistically equivalent relations between al and 6 metals of concern cd cr cu ni v zn in biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediments that capture similar timeframes of metal accumulation statistically higher normalized concentrations of be and pb in surface sediment compared to biofilm sediment mixtures weakens ability to detect enrichment of these metals in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to the sediment derived pre 1920 baselines however the low concentrations and tight linear clustering of be and pb relative to al in the biofilm sediment mixtures are unlikely to reflect enrichment figs 5 and 6 analysis of biofilm sediment mixtures accrued in lakes of the pad shows no evidence to support that river floodwaters are a pathway of contemporary metal enrichment above the baseline concentrations this finding aligns with results from previous studies based on analyses of lake sediment cores and surface sediments of lakes and rivers in the pad kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 wiklund et al 2014 the few occurrences of metal enrichment above the range of pre 1920 variability 15 80 groups are primarily associated with lakes that did not receive floodwaters 11 15 occurrences furthermore the occurrences of metal enrichment are about two fold more common in the peace sector 9 32 groups or 28 1 than the athabasca sector 6 48 groups or 12 5 despite that the athabasca river not the peace river traverses through a region of oil sands surface mining our assessment of enrichment is contingent on well defined enrichment thresholds strong baseline linear relationships demonstrated by adjusted r squared values greater than 0 85 for all baselines except cr and ni in the athabasca sector indicate that the natural range of variability is well characterized due to minimal flare in 95 pis even at low al concentrations the al concentration selected for enrichment threshold calculations was of no consequence on assessment of enrichment for example the same groups of lakes were designated as enriched when an al concentration of 5000 mg kg versus 1000 mg kg was used to calculate enrichment thresholds furthermore a group of lakes was designated as enriched even if only one lake in the group excluding outliers had a residual metal concentration greater than the enrichment threshold these features lend confidence to the sensitivity of our calculated enrichment thresholds and approach for assessing enrichment the study design was able to discern the role of river floodwaters on metal enrichment because it incorporated measurements from a year with minimal flooding 2017 and a year with a spring ice jam flood event that inundated many lakes in the athabasca sector 2018 remmer et al 2020a this provided opportunity to compare inter annual differences in residual concentrations of metals at lakes that did not flood in either year negative control lakes that flooded in 2018 but not 2017 treatment and lakes that flooded in both years positive control statistical outcomes namely non significant interaction terms between the two factors study year and flood category indicate the inter annual differences in residual metal concentrations are similar among the control groups and the treatment groups statistical test outcomes also demonstrate that residual metal concentrations do not differ significantly among lakes that flooded in none one or both of the study years as illustrated by the substantial overlap of values in flooded versus non flooded lakes i e flood category 0 vs flood category 2 fig 9 flood category 0 vs flood category 1 in 2018 fig 8 and values in lakes that flooded in 2018 with previous measurements in 2017 when they were not flooded i e 2017 vs 2018 in flood category 1 figs 7 and 8 an additional strength of the study design was inclusion of some spring flooded lakes that also flooded in summer of 2017 and 2018 so supply of metals via summer river flow was captured in this study more than one occurrence of enrichment is discernable only for metals cd cu and zn and primarily in non flooded lakes where the artificial substrate samplers accrued organic rich biofilm sediment mixtures thus enrichment of these metals is not caused by river floodwaters as is also demonstrated by equivalent metal al relations among the biofilm sediment mixture and surface sediment datasets for spring flooded lakes in 2018 fig 3 and the pre 1920 baselines fig 6 and more likely reflects active intracellular uptake by periphytic biota in the absence of flooding in support of this inference it is known that photosynthetic organisms concentrate cu and zn within organelles to a greater degree than all other metals measured in this study blaby haas and merchant 2012 epstein 1965 rodriguez and ho 2018 evidence from other studies have shown biofilm sediment mixtures accumulate cu and zn to a greater degree than sediment kumari and maiti 2020 ramelow et al 1992 photosynthetic organisms transport non essential cd using non specific divalent metal transporters which results in cd uptake during biomass accrual blaby haas and merchant 2012 rodriguez and ho 2018 hill et al 2000 owca et al 2020 demonstrated that surface sediments collected from the same lakes in the same years did not exhibit enrichment in cd cu and zn hence active biological uptake by periphytic biota appears to complicate comparisons of these three metals between organic rich biofilm sediment mixtures accrued in non flooded lakes and baselines constructed using sediment deposited in flood prone lakes however accumulation of cu zn and cd in biota at the base of aquatic food webs is an important finding to inform potential risks to ecosystem health fortunately for cd and zn these results do not compromise ability to assess metal enrichment in biofilm sediment mixtures in flooded lakes biofilm sediment mixtures are a viable approach for real time monitoring of enrichment of metals in flooded lakes be cd cr ni pb v zn and non flooded lakes be cr ni pb v of the pad given the alignment of their metal al concentrations with pre 1920 baselines comparison to sediment derived pre industrial baselines is a novel application of biofilm sediment mixtures and provides critical context for assessment of pollution in a landscape where substances of concern are supplied by natural processes as well as potentially by industrial releases to the environment ability to inform about enrichment in biota at the base of aquatic food webs and to control the duration of biofilm accrual by setting the time of deployment and retrieval of the artificial substrate samplers complements assessments based on systematic analysis of surficial sediment from lakes with inherent variation and uncertainty of their sediment accumulation rates owca et al 2020 this research directly addresses a recommendation for strategic environmental assessment included in the wbnp action plan by providing information about metals supplied by river floodwaters after they flow through a heavily industrialized area wood buffalo national park wbnp 2019 and provides a monitoring framework to consider for future implementation across lakes of the pad to optimize a monitoring program for lakes in the pad we recommend deploying artificial substrate samplers at the beginning of the ice free season i e mid may to capture potential effects of spring ice jam floods dual sampling of surface sediment and biofilm sediment mixtures is ideal for reliable monitoring of both biologically active cd cu zn and biologically inert be cr ni pb v metals preference for monitoring may be given to flood prone lakes in the athabasca sector as they are most vulnerable to potential pollution from upstream oil sands mining however we recommend that monitoring also include non flooded lakes in the athabasca sector and flooded and non flooded lakes in the peace sector which are unlikely to be affected by aosr oil sands mining to serve as informative benchmarks for determination of metal enrichment by oil sands mining and processing activities the approach developed here may be adapted for implementation at other lake rich and floodplain landscapes but will require firm understanding of baseline metal concentrations against which metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures can be compared among the many options for characterizing baseline concentrations we advocate for analysis of metal concentrations in samples from cores of lake sediment deposited prior to possible pollution by anthropogenic activities of concern 5 conclusions this research explored roles of river flooding on enrichment of metals of concern at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad assessment of contemporary metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures in lakes of the pad relative to pre industrial pre 1920 concentrations of metals in lake sediment demonstrate no substantial enrichment of oil sands derived metal concentrations supplied by athabasca river floodwaters the absence of marked metal enrichment in flooded lakes as well as the lack of difference in enrichment among lakes of different flood status provide evidence that oil sands industrial metal pollution is not detectable at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad results presented here demonstrate that biofilm sediment mixtures are useful media for monitoring contemporary concentrations of metals and complement a proposed monitoring framework relying on contemporary concentrations of metals in surface sediment in the pad owca et al 2020 linking timing of flooding with timing of metals accumulation is a distinct advantage of artificial substrate samplers but is contingent on routine isotope monitoring of lake hydrological conditions as was performed throughout the study years of this research remmer et al 2020b alternately oxygen isotope composition of aquatic cellulose synthesized by periphytic algae present in biofilm sediment mixtures may also be used to track lake water balance and hydrological processes during the period of accrual savage et al 2021 this possibility along with other possible metrics indicative of ecological integrity that can be gleaned from biofilm sediment mixtures e g algal community composition

enrichment by athabasca river floodwaters new hydrological insights river floodwaters are not implicated as a pathway of metal enrichment to biofilm sediment mixtures in pad lakes from upstream

extent of degradation roach and walker 2017 ability to conduct informed monitoring for contaminants of concern however is often hindered by a lack of knowledge of pre disturbance concentrations and natural variation because data collection tends to be initiated after onset of anthropogenic disturbance blais et al 2015 long term datasets that extend to pre disturbance periods are critical to identify the influence of anthropogenic activities versus natural processes on the environment lindenmayer and likens 2009 2010 especially when located downstream of natural sources of substances of concern wiklund et al 2014 it is therefore advantageous but infrequent to design monitoring programs that incorporate information about pre disturbance concentrations to allow for rapid real time determination of the degree of degradation one such at risk system is the peace athabasca delta pad located in northeastern alberta canada as the world s largest inland freshwater boreal delta the hundreds of productive shallow lakes in the pad provide critical habitat to biota and support traditional lifestyles of local indigenous communities timoney 2013 these ecosystem services merited the pad s designation as a ramsar wetland of international importance and contributed to wood buffalo national park s wbnp recognition as a unesco world heritage site which contains 80 of the pad however ongoing expansion of mining in the alberta oil sands region aosr has long generated concerns that contaminants are being released into the athabasca river and delivered downstream to the pad where they have potential to degrade water quality of rivers and lakes dowdeswell et al 2010 schindler 2010 timoney and lee 2009 the urgent need for better monitoring practices in the pad has been

whc iucn 2017 and priorities within the wood buffalo national park action plan wood buffalo national park wbnp 2019 an approach that has been proposed for effective monitoring of oil sands pollution is paleolimnological investigation of sediment cores from lakes to establish the range of natural variability of substances of concern prior to industrialization dowdeswell et al 2010 wrona and di cenzo 2011 this approach has been implemented in the pad and the results have served to develop knowledge of the natural variability of metal concentrations in pre 1920 lake sediment kay et al 2020 wiklund et al 2012 2014 sediment deposited before 1920 pre date the earliest paleolimnological evidence of atmospheric deposition of pollutants from industrial emissions which was followed by a decline in atmospheric deposition after 1970 as industrial practices improved wiklund et al 2012 these baselines enabled evaluation of contamination of lakes by atmospheric and fluvial pathways using contemporary concentrations of metals of concern in surface sediment of lakes across the pad which demonstrated no substantial enrichment above the pre 1920 baselines owca et al 2020 their study analyzed 1 cm thick surface sediment samples collected in 2017 which captured recent time periods of sediment deposition that are variable among lakes 2 5 years also included was analysis of exclusively flood supplied surface sediment samples collected in 2018 from lakes that had received river floodwaters two months prior however because such flood events are episodic and of varying magnitude development and testing of additional real time monitoring approaches of metal concentrations in lakes are warranted among the plethora of complementary approaches for monitoring contaminants artificial substrate samplers which accrue a mixture of biofilm consisting of communities of periphytic algae fungi and microbes and entrapped suspended sediments jowett and biggs 1997 szlauer łukaszewska 2007 wu 2017 may provide some advantages they offer careful control of biofilm sediment accrual time and circumvent potential difficulties associated with locating and collecting appropriate natural substrates macdonald et al 2012 wiklund et al 2010 because of these advantages artificial substrate samplers have been tested and used for monitoring water quality biggs 1989 including metals content holding et al 2003 namba et al 2020 pederson and vaultonburg 1996 ramelow et al 1987 1992 tang et al 2014 for several metals of concern concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers have been shown to correspond well with concentrations in sediment from the same locations holding et al 2003 ramelow et al 1987 1992 this suggests there is potential to combine use of artificial substrate samplers with measurements of pre industrial metal concentrations in sediment cores to evaluate for evidence of enrichment relative to natural conditions which to our knowledge is a novel approach here we use concentrations of metals in pre industrial pre 1920 lake sediment and in biofilm sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers during the open water seasons of 2017 and 2018 to quantify enrichment of metals of concern at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad given the novelty of the approach we first test the assumption that concentrations of metals in biofilm sediment mixtures and lake surface sediment follow the same relation with the geochemical normalizer aluminum using a subset of lakes that received floodwaters in 2018 this is important because it would then suggest that estimates of enrichment derived from analysis of biofilm sediment mixtures relative to pre 1920 sediment baselines is a reasonable approach and not reflective of differences in analytical substrates to assess the role of river floodwaters on potential metal enrichment of biofilm sediment mixtures our study spans two years which includes numerous lakes inundated by the large ice jam flood event in spring 2018 remmer et al 2020a most of the flooding in spring of 2018 occurred in the southern athabasca sector of the delta which provides opportunity to evaluate the extent of contamination in athabasca river water and sediment by upstream oil sands development the suite of metals selected for this study follow

in northeastern alberta canada the 6000 km2 pad contains hundreds of shallow lakes fig 1 the pad is composed of two hydrologically distinct sectors the northern peace sector and the southern athabasca sector lakes in the relic delta of the northern peace sector experience limited river connectivity wolfe et al 2007 episodic ice jam events on the peace river during the spring freshet are required to generate widespread flooding peters et al 2006 in contrast lakes in the relic and active delta portions of the southern athabasca sector experience a spectrum of limited intermittent or continuous surface connection with the northward flowing athabasca river and its distributaries remmer et al 2020b wolfe et al 2007 previous research has documented the extent of ice jam and open water flooding with respect to the study lakes in the pad during 2017 and 2018 remmer et al 2020a 2020b fig 1 ice jam flooding was more widespread in the athabasca sector in spring 2018 than in spring 2017 compared to spring ice jam flooding a smaller number of lakes in the athabasca sector also received open water flooding in summer 2017 and summer and fall 2018 in the peace sector no lakes were flooded in 2017 limited ice jam flooding occurred in spring 2018 and one lake pad 54 also received open water flooding in summer and fall 2018 2 2 fieldwork artificial substrate samplers were deployed from the pontoon of a helicopter into 25 lakes in the athabasca sector and 24 lakes in the peace sector on may 22 24 2017 and retrieved on september 12 14 2017 fig 1 samplers were deployed again the following year on may 21 23 2018 and retrieved from 20 lakes in the athabasca sector and 22 lakes in the peace sector on september 15 17 2018 fig 1 samplers were retrieved from the same lake in both years for 15 lakes in the athabasca sector and 16 lakes in the peace sector samplers consisted of 52 5 cm by 18 cm high density polypropylene shields attached by rope on one end to a wooden float covered in styrofoam to maintain buoyancy and to a rock on the other end to remain anchored to the lake bottom fig 2 rope lengths were sufficient to ensure that samplers were suspended vertically at approximately 10 15 cm deep in the water column polypropylene shields act as an inert substrate that accrue a periphytic biofilm of algae microbes and other biota to which suspended particles may adhere via passive transport a previous study of lakes in the pad has shown that differences in algal community composition between artificial substrate samplers and macrophytes were comparable to differences between macrophyte species providing confidence that samplers accrue representative algal communities wiklund et al 2010 upon retrieval of the samplers shields were placed individually into plastic ziploc bags frozen and transported to university of waterloo where they remained frozen until processed for analysis ice jam flooding in the peace and athabasca sectors in spring 2018

peace sector pad 15 pad 50 pad 54 pad 58 pad 64 m17 and m18 in july 2018 owca et al 2020 these surface sediment flood layer samples captured a similar timeframe of metals accumulation as biofilm sediment mixtures collected in 2018 and therefore were used to directly compare metal aluminum relations for these two substrate types 2 3 laboratory analyses all processing was performed on the shields after they were removed from the freezer and thawed the biofilm sediment mixtures were removed from the shields by scraping and rinsing with a recorded volume of deionized water the final volume of contents biofilm sediment mixture plus rinse water was also recorded before further subsampling for loss on ignition loi analysis 20 ml were pipetted into a glass scintillation vial for metals analysis the remaining contents were added to a plastic cup and frozen until further processing loi was performed to measure the dry mass and organic matter content om of biofilm sediment samples following standard methods heiri et al 2001 for each lake the 20 ml loi subsample was added to a pre weighed porcelain crucible the crucibles were then dried in an oven at 90 c for 18 h to determine the dry sample mass the crucibles were combusted in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 2 h cooled and reweighed to determine om relative to dry mass for determination of metal concentrations periphyton subsamples were freeze dried weighed and analyzed by als environmental vancouver bc following epa method 200 3 6020a united states environmental protection agency us epa 1998 this is a hotblock digestion with hno3 and hcl in combination with h2o2 which provides a conservative estimate of bioavailable metals in organic tissue these methods are similar to the analysis of metal

baselines are represented as linear relations with 95 prediction intervals pi between concentrations of the metals of interest be cd cr cu ni pb v zn and al normalization to al accounts for variations

region aosr and pad cooke et al 2017 kay et al 2020 klemt et al 2020 owca et al 2020 owca et al 2020 determined that al is the generally superior normalizing agent for the metals of interest in both sectors of the pad and that the slopes of all metal al relations differ between sectors therefore separate linear relations for each metal were used for each sector as a first step of data exploration we tested the assumption that metal concentrations in both the biofilm sediment mixtures and lake surface sediment follow the same relationship with the geochemical normalizer al for this exploration we used measurements of metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures and the flood layer of river supplied surface sediment collected in 2018 at 13 lakes in the pad the biofilm sediment mixture collected from pad 33 was below the detection limit for ni concentration so it was excluded from the analysis of ni for each of the 8 metals of interest an analysis of covariance ancova was performed to test if slopes and y intercepts of the metal al regression lines differed between biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment ancova models were defined by each metal concentration as the dependent variable al concentration as the independent variable substrate type biofilm sediment mixture or surface sediment as the factor and the interaction between al concentration and substrate type ancova tests were performed using r version 3 5 3 and function aov r core team 2020 we then compared concentrations of metals measured in sediment biofilm mixtures obtained in 2017 and 2018 to the pre 1920 baselines using a series of cross plots with al as the independent variable and each metal of interest as the dependent variable this step was performed on samples from all biofilm sediment mixtures that were retrieved during either study year and cross plots are presented separately for 2017 n 49 and 2018 n 42 and by sector the subset of lakes where artificial substrate samplers were retrieved in both study years n 31 provided opportunity for paired samples comparisons to elucidate the influence of river flooding on concentrations of metals in the biofilm sediment mixtures these lakes were assigned to a flood category based on the number of years out of the two study years that the lakes received spring ice jam and or open water river floodwaters lakes were placed in the 0 category if they did not receive river floodwaters in either year athabasca sector n 6 peace sector n 11 in the 1 category if they received river floodwaters in 2018 but not in 2017 athabasca sector n 5 peace sector n 5 or in the 2 category if they received river floodwaters in both years athabasca sector n 4 peace sector n 0 no lakes received river floodwaters in 2017 but not 2018 designation of the flood category for each lake followed remmer et al 2020b we assessed enrichment of metals in biofilm sediment mixtures for the paired samples analysis of flood influence using residual concentrations the residual concentrations were calculated as the difference between the measured concentration of the metal in the biofilm sediment mixtures and the mean pre 1920 concentration of the metal determined from the baseline linear metal al relation at the measured concentration of al in the biofilm sediment mixtures for a given metal x this calculation is expressed as r e s i d u a l x m e a s u r e d x m e a n p r e 1920 x a t m e a s u r e d a l to evaluate if residual concentrations exceeded the range of variability before 1920 we calculated an enrichment threshold for each metal in each sector as the upper 95 prediction interval pi for residual concentrations at an al concentration of 1000 mg kg which closely approximates the median al concentration of all biofilm samples obtained in this study use of residual concentrations to quantify enrichment is consistent with studies by wiklund et al 2014 and macdonald et al 2016 and expresses enrichment in units of concentration of the metal of interest enrichment factors have also been used to quantify enrichment of metals in lake and river sediment in the pad and lower athabasca river cooke et al 2017 kay et al 2020 klemt et al 2020 owca et al 2020 wiklund et al 2014 but were inapplicable across the full range of concentration in our study because baseline concentrations were less well constrained at the low range of al concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures for some metals and resulted in some illogical efs i e values below zero using two series of boxplots and statistical tests distributions of residual metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures were grouped to compare among the lake flood categories and study years in the athabasca sector and in the peace sector when the upper whisker of the boxplots for the residual metal concentrations in a flood category exceeded the enrichment threshold this was considered enriched above the expected range of pre 1920 variability we used multivariate analysis of variance manova tests to determine if the residual concentrations of the suite of all 8 metals differed significantly for the above two comparisons the use of a single test to assess for differences in residual concentrations of the suite of all 8 metals achieves the pre determined type 1 error rate which is not readily achieved by multiple tests on each metal individually we ran two different repeated measures two way manova tests one on samples from lakes in the athabasca sector and one on samples from lakes in the peace sector these tests allowed us to determine differences in residual metal concentrations between the study years within subject factor among the flood categories between subject factor and the interaction of these two factors manova tests were performed using r version 3 5 3 r core team 2020 and function multrm in the manova rm package friedrich et al 2020 we report the manova type statistic mats because it does not assume multivariate normality covariance homogeneity and singularity of covariance matrices friedrich and pauly 2018 friedrich et al 2017 2019 we also report p values based on re sampling approaches parametric bootstrap with 9999 iterations which are robust for small sample sizes friedrich and pauly 2018 friedrich et al 2017 2019 for all tests alpha was set to 0 05 3 results 3 1 comparisons of metal al relations in biofilm sediment mixtures versus surface sediment collected from flooded lakes in 2018 comparisons of metal al relations in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to surface sediment collected from flooded lakes in 2018 show no significant interaction term for ancova models for all 8 metals fig 3 table 1 this indicates that the slopes of the regressions between concentrations of each metal and al do not differ between biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment due to non significant interaction terms a new set of eight ancova models were defined without an interaction term results show a significant and positive relation between al and each of the 8 metals but no significant effect of substrate type for 6 of 8 metals cd cr cu ni v zn fig 3 table 2 this indicates no significant difference in intercepts between the regression lines of biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediment for these 6 metals and that the normalized metal concentrations can be readily compared between the substrate types although surface sediment has a higher intercept for be and pb than biofilm sediment mixtures we proceed to include them in the analyses below but consider their interpretation less well constrained fig 3 table 2 3 2 assessment of metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to pre 1920 baselines the dataset used to establish pre 1920 baseline linear relations between the 8 metals of interest be cd cr cu ni pb v zn and al was derived from previous studies kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 plus coarser grained riverbank sediment deposited before 1920 that captured al concentrations comparable to the low values in the biofilm sediment mixtures fig 4 statistically significant at alpha 0 05 positive linear relationships between all metals in both sectors and al enabled development of al normalized baselines table 3 high r2 values of the linear regressions support the inclusion of both lake sediments and riverbank sediments to develop the pre 1920 baselines slopes between concentrations of all metals except cr and concentrations of al are higher in lakes in the peace sector than in the athabasca sector we note that al normalized baselines for cd and cu in the athabasca sector were not possible with former datasets that did not include the riverbank sediment samples kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 the organic content of biofilm sediment mixtures varied among lakes figs 5 and 6 this is consistent with observation of different textures and amounts of homogenous material ranging in colour from brown to bright green accrued on the shields fig 2 nonetheless most metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures that accrued on artificial substrate samplers in 2017 and 2018 are captured within the pre 1920 baseline metal concentrations for the peace and athabasca sectors figs 5 and 6 in 2017 concentrations of be cr ni pb and v are primarily along the baseline linear relations with al concentration in both sectors although concentrations of cr ni and v in the peace sector and be in the athabasca sector more closely follow the lower 95 pi fig 5 in contrast concentrations of cd cu and zn are well above the upper 95 pi for several om rich 60 om biofilm sediment mixtures at the low end of the al concentration range and this is more apparent in the peace sector than the athabasca sector the relations between metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures and pre 1920 baselines are similar for samples obtained in 2018 fig 6 concentrations of metals are within pre 1920 baselines for both sectors apart from some om rich exceptions for cd cu and zn in contrast to 2017 a small number of biofilm sediment mixtures in 2018 also have concentrations of cr ni and pb that exceed the upper 95 pis overall metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures from both sectors in 2017 and 2018 follow similar al normalized concentrations as the pre 1920 baselines the exceptional cases include primarily concentrations of cd cu and zn in biofilms with high om content and low al concentration which are above the upper 95 pi these results indicate that the sediment derived baselines permit calculation of residual metal concentrations as the difference between the metal concentration in the biofilm and the baseline linear relation and comparison to enrichment thresholds i e the upper 95 pi to quantify and interpret the extent of enrichment above the range of natural variability 3 3 assessment of residual concentrations of metals for enrichment for lakes from which biofilm sediment mixtures were collected in both study years concentrations of metals in the mixtures were converted to residual concentrations relative to baseline concentrations and are displayed as a series of boxplots in figs 7 and 8 for lakes in the athabasca and peace sectors respectively lakes are categorized by flood category 0 not flooded in 2017 nor in 2018 1 flooded in 2018 only 2 flooded in both 2017 and 2018 and measurements are colour coded by study year dark 2017 light 2018 generating 6 groups for each of 8 metals and a total of 48 groups in the athabasca sector and 4 groups for each of 8 metals for a total of 32 groups in the peace sector there were fewer groups for the peace sector because none of the lakes received floodwaters in both years we assess for enrichment of each metal above the range of natural variability by comparison of the upper whisker of the boxplot for each group against the enrichment thresholds for each metal the upper whiskers of residual metal concentrations are below the enrichment thresholds for most groups indicating concentrations in the biofilm sediment mixtures are within the range of natural variation that existed before 1920 figs 7 and 8 table 4 in the athabasca sector there are six exceptions to this general pattern among the 48 groups 1 enrichment of cr above the threshold is observed for flood category 2 lakes in 2018 2 4 enrichment of cu above the threshold is observed for all three flood categories in 2017 5 enrichment of ni above the threshold is observed for flood category 2 lakes in 2018 and 6 enrichment of zn above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 lakes in 2017 fig 7 in the peace sector there are nine exceptions to this general pattern among the 32 groups 1 2 enrichment of cd above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 and flood category 1 lakes in 2017 3 6 enrichment of cu above the threshold is observed for lakes in flood categories 0 and 1 in 2017 and in 2018 7 enrichment of ni above the threshold is observed for flood category 0 lakes in 2018 and 8 9 enrichment of zn above the threshold is observed for lakes in flood categories 0 and 1 in 2017 fig 8 the combined total of these 15 exceptions in both sectors identifies that most occurrences of enrichment 11 of 15 are associated with measurements of cd cu ni and zn at lakes that did not flood two of the remaining occurrences of enrichment 2 of 15 are for cu at lakes that received floodwaters in 2017 at flood category 2 lakes in the athabasca sector and in 2018 at flood category 1 lakes in the peace sector but enrichment of cu occurred at all flood categories in 2017 in the athabasca sector and at all flood categories in 2018 in the peace sector the last two occurrences 2 of 15 are for cr and ni in 2018 at flood category 2 lakes in the athabasca sector that received floodwaters that year however these flood category 2 lakes do not exhibit enrichment of cr and ni in 2017 when they also flooded nor do flood category 1 lakes that flooded in 2018 thus there is no consistent association between enrichment of any metal and lakes that received floodwaters from the athabasca or peace rivers 3 4 statistical tests of residual concentrations of metals among flood categories and between study years within each sector repeated measures two way manova tests were conducted on the subset of 31 lakes where artificial substrate samplers were retrieved in both study years to provide a paired comparison by lake of residual metal concentrations among flood categories two tests were run to assess if residual concentrations of the suite of 8 metals differs among 1 the 6 groups in the athabasca sector 2 years x 3 flood categories 0 1 2 and 2 the 4 groups in the peace sector 2 years x 2 flood categories 0 1 the interaction terms athabasca mats 12 268 p 0 553 d f 2 12 14 peace mats 9 246 p 0 298 d f 2 3 15 were not significant table 5 thus the interaction term was removed from the model and each factor was tested individually residual concentrations of the 8 metals did not differ significantly among the flood categories in either sector athabasca p 0 124 peace p 0 167 suggesting occurrence of flooding in one or both study years does not alter concentrations relative to non flooded lakes table 5 consistent with this result the pooled boxplots for both study years illustrate broad overlap of interquartile ranges for most metals in all flood categories for both sectors i e first 8 panels of figs 7 and 8 the manova tests also determined that residual concentrations of all 8 metals do not differ significantly between 2017 and 2018 in the athabasca sector p 0 171 table 5 but differ significantly between 2017 and 2018 in the peace sector p 0 007 table 5 a non significant inter annual difference in the athabasca sector is depicted by differences in residual concentrations 2018 residual 2017 residual which have interquartile ranges that intersect zero for all metals last panel of fig 9 in contrast a significant inter annual difference in the peace sector is depicted by interquartile ranges of differences in residual concentrations that are substantially below zero for zn and marginally below zero for v last panel of fig 10 thus residual concentrations of metals remained relatively unchanged from 2017 to 2018 except for zn and to a lesser extent v in the peace sector which decreased from 2017 when there was no lake flooding to 2018 when a few lakes received floodwaters that spring 4 discussion biofilm sediment mixtures have long been explored as monitors for metal pollution pederson and vaultonburg 1996 ramelow et al 1987 1992 and here we demonstrate a novel application of these media with reference to baseline metal concentrations measured in pre industrial pre 1920 lake sediments comparison of the two media is supported by statistically equivalent relations between al and 6 metals of concern cd cr cu ni v zn in biofilm sediment mixtures and surface sediments that capture similar timeframes of metal accumulation statistically higher normalized concentrations of be and pb in surface sediment compared to biofilm sediment mixtures weakens ability to detect enrichment of these metals in biofilm sediment mixtures relative to the sediment derived pre 1920 baselines however the low concentrations and tight linear clustering of be and pb relative to al in the biofilm sediment mixtures are unlikely to reflect enrichment figs 5 and 6 analysis of biofilm sediment mixtures accrued in lakes of the pad shows no evidence to support that river floodwaters are a pathway of contemporary metal enrichment above the baseline concentrations this finding aligns with results from previous studies based on analyses of lake sediment cores and surface sediments of lakes and rivers in the pad kay et al 2020 owca et al 2020 wiklund et al 2014 the few occurrences of metal enrichment above the range of pre 1920 variability 15 80 groups are primarily associated with lakes that did not receive floodwaters 11 15 occurrences furthermore the occurrences of metal enrichment are about two fold more common in the peace sector 9 32 groups or 28 1 than the athabasca sector 6 48 groups or 12 5 despite that the athabasca river not the peace river traverses through a region of oil sands surface mining our assessment of enrichment is contingent on well defined enrichment thresholds strong baseline linear relationships demonstrated by adjusted r squared values greater than 0 85 for all baselines except cr and ni in the athabasca sector indicate that the natural range of variability is well characterized due to minimal flare in 95 pis even at low al concentrations the al concentration selected for enrichment threshold calculations was of no consequence on assessment of enrichment for example the same groups of lakes were designated as enriched when an al concentration of 5000 mg kg versus 1000 mg kg was used to calculate enrichment thresholds furthermore a group of lakes was designated as enriched even if only one lake in the group excluding outliers had a residual metal concentration greater than the enrichment threshold these features lend confidence to the sensitivity of our calculated enrichment thresholds and approach for assessing enrichment the study design was able to discern the role of river floodwaters on metal enrichment because it incorporated measurements from a year with minimal flooding 2017 and a year with a spring ice jam flood event that inundated many lakes in the athabasca sector 2018 remmer et al 2020a this provided opportunity to compare inter annual differences in residual concentrations of metals at lakes that did not flood in either year negative control lakes that flooded in 2018 but not 2017 treatment and lakes that flooded in both years positive control statistical outcomes namely non significant interaction terms between the two factors study year and flood category indicate the inter annual differences in residual metal concentrations are similar among the control groups and the treatment groups statistical test outcomes also demonstrate that residual metal concentrations do not differ significantly among lakes that flooded in none one or both of the study years as illustrated by the substantial overlap of values in flooded versus non flooded lakes i e flood category 0 vs flood category 2 fig 9 flood category 0 vs flood category 1 in 2018 fig 8 and values in lakes that flooded in 2018 with previous measurements in 2017 when they were not flooded i e 2017 vs 2018 in flood category 1 figs 7 and 8 an additional strength of the study design was inclusion of some spring flooded lakes that also flooded in summer of 2017 and 2018 so supply of metals via summer river flow was captured in this study more than one occurrence of enrichment is discernable only for metals cd cu and zn and primarily in non flooded lakes where the artificial substrate samplers accrued organic rich biofilm sediment mixtures thus enrichment of these metals is not caused by river floodwaters as is also demonstrated by equivalent metal al relations among the biofilm sediment mixture and surface sediment datasets for spring flooded lakes in 2018 fig 3 and the pre 1920 baselines fig 6 and more likely reflects active intracellular uptake by periphytic biota in the absence of flooding in support of this inference it is known that photosynthetic organisms concentrate cu and zn within organelles to a greater degree than all other metals measured in this study blaby haas and merchant 2012 epstein 1965 rodriguez and ho 2018 evidence from other studies have shown biofilm sediment mixtures accumulate cu and zn to a greater degree than sediment kumari and maiti 2020 ramelow et al 1992 photosynthetic organisms transport non essential cd using non specific divalent metal transporters which results in cd uptake during biomass accrual blaby haas and merchant 2012 rodriguez and ho 2018 hill et al 2000 owca et al 2020 demonstrated that surface sediments collected from the same lakes in the same years did not exhibit enrichment in cd cu and zn hence active biological uptake by periphytic biota appears to complicate comparisons of these three metals between organic rich biofilm sediment mixtures accrued in non flooded lakes and baselines constructed using sediment deposited in flood prone lakes however accumulation of cu zn and cd in biota at the base of aquatic food webs is an important finding to inform potential risks to ecosystem health fortunately for cd and zn these results do not compromise ability to assess metal enrichment in biofilm sediment mixtures in flooded lakes biofilm sediment mixtures are a viable approach for real time monitoring of enrichment of metals in flooded lakes be cd cr ni pb v zn and non flooded lakes be cr ni pb v of the pad given the alignment of their metal al concentrations with pre 1920 baselines comparison to sediment derived pre industrial baselines is a novel application of biofilm sediment mixtures and provides critical context for assessment of pollution in a landscape where substances of concern are supplied by natural processes as well as potentially by industrial releases to the environment ability to inform about enrichment in biota at the base of aquatic food webs and to control the duration of biofilm accrual by setting the time of deployment and retrieval of the artificial substrate samplers complements assessments based on systematic analysis of surficial sediment from lakes with inherent variation and uncertainty of their sediment accumulation rates owca et al 2020 this research directly addresses a recommendation for strategic environmental assessment included in the wbnp action plan by providing information about metals supplied by river floodwaters after they flow through a heavily industrialized area wood buffalo national park wbnp 2019 and provides a monitoring framework to consider for future implementation across lakes of the pad to optimize a monitoring program for lakes in the pad we recommend deploying artificial substrate samplers at the beginning of the ice free season i e mid may to capture potential effects of spring ice jam floods dual sampling of surface sediment and biofilm sediment mixtures is ideal for reliable monitoring of both biologically active cd cu zn and biologically inert be cr ni pb v metals preference for monitoring may be given to flood prone lakes in the athabasca sector as they are most vulnerable to potential pollution from upstream oil sands mining however we recommend that monitoring also include non flooded lakes in the athabasca sector and flooded and non flooded lakes in the peace sector which are unlikely to be affected by aosr oil sands mining to serve as informative benchmarks for determination of metal enrichment by oil sands mining and processing activities the approach developed here may be adapted for implementation at other lake rich and floodplain landscapes but will require firm understanding of baseline metal concentrations against which metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures can be compared among the many options for characterizing baseline concentrations we advocate for analysis of metal concentrations in samples from cores of lake sediment deposited prior to possible pollution by anthropogenic activities of concern 5 conclusions this research explored roles of river flooding on enrichment of metals of concern at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad assessment of contemporary metal concentrations in biofilm sediment mixtures in lakes of the pad relative to pre industrial pre 1920 concentrations of metals in lake sediment demonstrate no substantial enrichment of oil sands derived metal concentrations supplied by athabasca river floodwaters the absence of marked metal enrichment in flooded lakes as well as the lack of difference in enrichment among lakes of different flood status provide evidence that oil sands industrial metal pollution is not detectable at the base of food webs in lakes of the pad results presented here demonstrate that biofilm sediment mixtures are useful media for monitoring contemporary concentrations of metals and complement a proposed monitoring framework relying on contemporary concentrations of metals in surface sediment in the pad owca et al 2020 linking timing of flooding with timing of metals accumulation is a distinct advantage of artificial substrate samplers but is contingent on routine isotope monitoring of lake hydrological conditions as was performed throughout the study years of this research remmer et al 2020b alternately oxygen isotope composition of aquatic cellulose synthesized by periphytic algae present in biofilm sediment mixtures may also be used to track lake water balance and hydrological processes during the period of accrual savage et al 2021 this possibility along with other possible metrics indicative of ecological integrity that can be gleaned from biofilm sediment mixtures e g algal community composition biomarkers related to metal stress deformed diatom cells lavoie et al 2012 macdonald et al 2012 millie et al 1993 may provide additional opportunities for long term aquatic ecosystem monitoring credit

8108,study region iran study focus gridded precipitation products are of great interest for hydrological applications the inhomogeneous geography and uneven spatial distribution of rain gauges in iran make it difficult to estimate valuable interpolated precipitation with daily or monthly resolutions therefore we evaluated the performance of two empirical and four geostatistical interpolation methods new hydrological insights for the region atmospheric circulation pattern cp classification was used to understand precipitation behavior and to improve interpolation based on 500 hpa geopotential fields six cps were identified in order to explain large scale precipitation behavior variograms were normed and clustered to reduce the computational effort of the geostatistical methods leave one out cross validation shows that the geostatistical methods outperform the empirical ones and the differences among the geostatistical methods are small the difference among all the methodologies decreased substantially for spatial aggregation to coarser resolutions in contrast temporal aggregation reduced the difference to a much lower extent a large dataset consisting of 1561 locations with daily observations was used for this study comparison with the gpcc daily dataset shows that the data used for interpolation has a larger influence than the choice of the interpolation

and some other required data are available at https doi org 10 17605 osf io t7ywf 1 introduction precipitation is highly variable in space and time traditionally it is measured by rain gauges unfortunately the density of these gauges is usually very low berndt and haberlandt 2018 and the uncertainty of the estimated precipitation at ungauged locations is high beguería et al 2016 ghaemi et al 2017 remote sensing offers different possibilities for quantifying precipitation occurrences kidd and levizzani 2011 kidd and huffman 2011 the indirect measurements however require calibration based on traditional observations huffman et al 2010 moazami et al 2016 haese et al 2017 gilewski and nawalany 2018 for many hydrological and meteorological applications precipitation is needed on a regular spatial grid gridded precipitation data at a fine scale can be used as an input for hydrological and water management models or help develop downscaling procedures that rely on precipitation

spatial scales shen and xiong 2016 prein and gobiet 2017 herrera et al 2019 these products are subsequently used as ground truth for satellite based precipitation estimates however the comparisons between gridded precipitation products and terrestrial stations are investigated on the basis of a low amount of rain gauges katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 moazami et al 2013 alijanian et al 2017 darand et al 2017 javari 2017b 2017a hosseini moghari et al 2018 darand and khandu 2020 fallah et al 2020 an increase of the number of observations is likely to improve the accuracy of the results the gridded interpolation products are highly uncertain for different time periods and locations due to low density and irregular distribution of observation networks prein and gobiet 2017 tarek et al 2021 but the uncertainty of gridded precipitation is seldom considered explicitly and is usually associated with available point observation density only prein and gobiet 2017 herrera et al 2019 however in fact uncertainty also strongly depends on the specific spatial structure of rainfall on a given day or in a given month cristiano et al 2017 dry areas usually have low uncertainties while regions with intense rainfall are associated with high local spatial uncertainty o and foelsche 2019 overall small investigation areas low number of terrestrial rain gauges uneven spatio temporal uncertainty and lack of fine scale gridded data products may lead to wrong decisions when used by planners therefore various gridded precipitation products were developed to address some of the aforementioned drawbacks using iran s densest available rain gauge network in this research we would also like to answer the following research questions i which is the best possible interpolation method to be used for this large dataset in iran for this purpose a leave one out cross validation is used ii how different are the results of the different interpolation methods depending on spatial and temporal aggregations iii can interpolation be improved by considering additional information such as topography long term climatology or atmospheric circulation patterns iv do the methods provide a reasonable uncertainty estimate the study area is iran a country with a reasonably good network of precipitation gauges however deserts and highlands have led to a non uniform distribution of rain gauges throughout the country the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the investigation area and the available data are described the third section discusses the atmospheric circulation patterns over and around the study area the fourth section describes the interpolation methods applied in this study sections five and six describe the interpolation results and variogram assessments and compares the different methods with respect to their quality and uncertainty quantification the paper ends with a discussion of the results and final conclusions 2 investigation area and data 2 1 investigation area iran is a vast country with an area of 1648 195 km2 located in west asia and in the middle east the country is bordered by turkmenistan the caspian sea the largest endorheic lake in the world azerbaijan and armenia to the north turkey and iraq to the west and pakistan and afghanistan to the east also the persian gulf and the gulf of oman cover the entire southern border of iran in terms of topography the elevation ranges from 28 m at the caspian sea to 5610 m on the mount damavand alborz and zagros the two main mountain ranges extend from northwest to northeast and from northwest to southeast of iran respectively two large deserts cover the center and east of iran namely the dasht e kavir and dasht e lut due to the country s location in the subtropical high pressure belt of the northern hemisphere and wide topographical ranges it has multiple climates fig 1 shows the köppen geiger climate classification map over iran beck et al 2018 it divides the climate of iran into five environmental zones consisting of arid desert bw 54 semi arid bs 33 humid with mild winters c 4 6 humid with severe winters d 8 2 and polar and tundra e 0 2 coverage therefore most parts of the country are categorized as arid and semi arid climates the mean annual precipitation is less than 250 mm and ranges from almost no rain in the desert to more than 1800 mm in the zagros and the southwestern shore of the caspian sea only 8 of the country s area receives more than 500 mm year tabari and talaee 2011 different climate regions need to be treated differently in the form of separate clusters for gridded precipitation interpolation garcia et al 2008 teegavarapu 2014 2 2 data the ministry of energy moe and the iranian meteorological organization irimo provided the precipitation data having more than 4360 and 433 observations stations respectively we checked the data in terms of gaps missing data and metadata this resulted in 1561 usable stations with daily precipitation finally the daily and monthly precipitation time series from 2003 to 2010 were considered for the 1561 measurement gauges over iran fig 2 the station density averages at about 1 per 1000 km2 3 circulation patterns the amount of precipitation at a given location among many other variables is influenced by the large scale circulation in the atmosphere the atmospheric pressure maps forming typical circulation patterns cps can be classified the amount of precipitation that may fall is then linked to the cps through the moisture content of the relevant air masses in the past pressure maps in their various forms have been used to study the cps responsible for large scale weather in different parts of the world bárdossy et al 2002 huth et al 2008 houssos et al 2008 bárdossy 2010 hoy et al 2013 pringle et al 2014 schlef et al 2019 ibebuchi 2021 to investigate the dependence of rain in iran based on air pressure in our case 500 hpa geopotential heights cp classification based on fuzzy logic was performed using the algorithm described in bárdossy et al 1995 it requires gridded daily air pressure or an equivalent variable at regions of interest for each cp a rule is defined assigning typical pressure anomalies to distinct locations in the region of interest the cp whose fuzzy rule has the highest degree of fulfillment for a given day is assigned to that day the simulated annealing optimization scheme kirkpatrick et al 1983 cerny 1985 is used to find the fuzzy rules that explain either dry or wet conditions by assigning fuzzy numbers to grid points and then evaluating the resulting score each cp is then the average of the pressures for all time steps which were assigned to it in a 2d grid form note that the rules are defined on the pressure fields and do not use precipitation for the classification in this study the classification objective function was based on neighborhood wetness the wetness of a neighborhood a region of interest is defined as the portion of stations in that neighborhood having precipitation above a certain threshold such an approach is more robust than using observed precipitation values to construct the fuzzy rules which have been observed to result in a bumpy objective function and an overfit here we used the gridded geopotential heights from the ncep dataset with a spatial resolution of 2 5 by 2 5 and a temporal resolution of 24 h for the entire time period of this study a pressure level of 500 hpa among others was chosen as it produced the best results interested readers are referred to kalnay et al 1996 for more information regarding the ncep dataset the rules were defined on a grid surrounding the study area the chosen longitude range was from 20 to 90 east and from 0 to 65 north for the latitudes this produced a grid of 27 columns by 29 rows an objective function based on the wetness of neighborhoods was chosen to produce a local maximum for the case when any or multiple neighborhoods experienced unusually wet or dry weather at a given time step the pressure anomaly maps corresponding to the cps along with their mean precipitation are shown in fig 3 a total of six were identified the cps are ordered so that cp0 is the driest and cp5 is the wettest fig 4 shows the annual cycle of relative frequencies of each cp for each day of the year for the driest cp0 we see that the frequency peaks around august summer while the wettest cp5 drops around the same time cp5 s frequency peaks in the winter months december and january regions of high continuous red lines and low dashed blue lines drive the wind upon which depends the precipitation the behavior of cps is further demonstrated by selecting a station randomly and plotting its empirical distribution functions of precipitation corresponding to each cp fig 5a these show that moving toward the wetter cps the probability of no rain drops significantly and the probability of exceedance of a given daily amount increases note that only the wetness of some selected neighborhoods was used for deriving the cps one further comparison showing empirical distribution functions of randomly chosen stations in the study area for cp5 fig 5b shows that depending on location the probability of wet weather varies substantially in space and thus precipitation cannot be considered to be stationary 4 interpolation methods in order to estimate precipitation at unknown locations six different interpolation methods were considered namely nearest neighbor nn inverse distance weighting id ordinary kriging ok external drift kriging edk quantile kriging qk and space time kriging stk the first two are simple deterministic approaches while the other four are geostatistical 4 1 nearest neighbour nn the simplest method to interpolate precipitation is to assign the value of the nearest neighbouring observation station and to take its observation as an interpolated value 1 z x t z x i x t where x i x min i d x x i d x x i being the euclidean distance between the points x and x i thus x i x is the closest observation point to the grid point x z x i t is the precipitation value at the point x i at time step t while z x t is the interpolated value at grid point x and time step t this interpolation method is very simple but has the disadvantage that the resulting maps are discontinuous the interpolation is performed for a high resolution grid for the coarser resolution the values on the fine grid are averaged that intersect a coarser cell 4 2 inverse distance id the inverse distance method uses a linear estimation for the value at the unsampled location x 2 z x t i 1 n λ i z x i t here the weights λ i are inversely proportional to the distance from the observation point to the target point 3 λ i 1 d x i x q j 1 n 1 d x j x q only the closest n stations are used the number n can be selected so that the estimation becomes stable increasing to n 1 does not have a significant influence note that the weights are the same for each individual time step or temporal aggregation we used an exponent of q 1 which results in weights that are linearly related to distance the optimum value of the exponent could be determined by cross validation in our case values different from 1 changed the performance very little thus we used q 1 similar to nn the interpolation is performed for a high resolution grid and then averaged appropriately for coarser resolutions 4 3 ordinary kriging ok ordinary kriging is a geostatistical method frequently used for spatial interpolation formally the unknown value at a location or the mean over an area v and time t is estimated as in eq 2 where the coefficients λ i t can be different for each time step t and are derived from the so called kriging equations 4 j 1 n λ j t γ t x i x j μ γ t v i 1 n j 1 n λ j t 1 here γ t v 1 v v γ t y d y v is the point area volume over which the interpolation value is required y is a point in v and μ is the lagrange multiplier the weights λ minimize the estimation variance under the assumption of a second order stationarity of each z x i t for each fixed t the value at the interpolation location z x t is computed as a linear combination as in eq 2 the variogram γ t h has to be calculated and fitted for each time step t the linear equation system 4 has to be solved for each grid point x and each time step t the weights depend on the location of the points and the variogram the weights can differ from one time step to other it should be pointed out that kriging has advantages over the empirical methods such as the screening effect but the inherent assumption that cross variance of the variable at distinct locations depends only on the distance becomes a problem when dealing with non stationary variables such as precipitation even the mean precipitation over long time periods months or years is very different in space a weaker assumption of local stationarity is more appropriate thus the estimation is reduced to observations in the neighborhood of the target location this results in the contribution of nearby surrounding points to the interpolation only as compared to taking points that are very far additionally that have little to do with the location in question the method is computationally expensive compared to nn and id as variograms have to be assessed for each time step and the kriging equations have to be solved subsequently for each time step and location 4 4 external drift kriging edk one way to cope with the problem of spatial non stationarity is to assume that there is a deterministic drift in precipitation dependent on some external variable such as the elevation and or the geographical coordinates we assume that this drift is h x and that the expected precipitation is a linear function of h but the coefficients of the drift are unknown this leads to an additional equation in the kriging eq 4 system 5 j 1 n λ j t h x i h x in order to solve the equations a second lagrange multiplier μ 2 is introduced this method also requires estimating variograms for each time step t for further details about external drift kriging consult ahmed and de marsily 1987 4 5 quantile kriging qk the idea of quantile kriging lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 is to use the time series statistics of the observation points instead of using precipitation z x t a new variable is introduced 6 u x t φ 1 f x z x t here f x z is the distribution function of precipitation at location x 7 f x z z x t i z x t i z t 1 where t is the number of time steps considered φ is the distribution function of the univariate standard normal distribution formally eq 6 transforms for all sites x the distribution of precipitation to the same common distribution in this case to standard normal note that this transformation is applied for each station in time and not in space as is usually done in gaussian anamorphosis the distribution of the values on a given day in space is not necessarily gaussian in order to use this method the distribution of precipitation at the unsampled gridpoint is necessary this can be done by using different geostatistical methods a method for interpolating distribution functions for short aggregation times is presented in mosthaf and bárdossy 2017 another possibility is to interpolate the quantiles corresponding to selected non percentiles or interpolating percentiles for selected precipitation amounts yet another method of estimating distribution functions corresponding to arbitrary locations is to use functional kriging giraldo et al 2011 this new variable can be considered as spatially stationary and its expected value is for each x e u x t 0 instead of interpolating z u is interpolated using ok the variogram is also calculated for u subsequently the estimated u x t has to be transformed back to precipitation due to non linearity of the transformation 6 the uncertainty of estimating u has to be taken into account using the following relationship 8 z x t f x 1 u x t y σ x u ϕ y d y here σ x u is the kriging standard deviation interpolating u for the location x mosthaf and bárdossy 2017 qk is more complex than the other geostatistical procedures considered in this paper but it offers many advantages the climatological conditions of the target location are taken into account through the local distribution functions the uncertainty of the estimation at time t reflects the precipitation behaviour of that particular time step regions with homogeneous precipitation amounts have low uncertainty while areas where precipitation changes in space have high uncertainty precipitation observations outside the interpolation period can also be taken into account for example the distribution functions for abandoned stations can improve the estimation 4 6 space time kriging stk another possibility for interpolating daily precipitation is to take the values of the previous and the subsequent days also into account in heuvelink and griffith 2010 a complex model for space time interpolation was developed the covariance structure in this case is 9 c h δ t c s h c t δ t c s t h 2 α δ t 2 this method can profit from the temporal continuity of precipitation which is unfortunately very weak at the daily scale 5 application 5 1 variogram assessment the kriging procedures require fitted theoretical variogram functions the kriging weights are then calculated using the equation system eq 4 variograms have to be assessed for each time step t the large number of zeros especially for the daily resolution may distort the variogram thus instead of using all observations for the variogram calculation for each time step t zeros far from wet locations were not considered formally the set of precipitation observation points considered for the variogram calculation x t is defined as 10 x t x min y z y t 0 d z x t z y t d l i m where d lim is the limit for the distance if this limit is selected such that it is also used for the limit of the neighborhood selection for the interpolation then for gridpoints with a distance larger than d lim the interpolation will always give a zero estimate independent of the variogram as all observations used were equal to zero the variogram is thus calculated using points which influence the results the reduction of points depends on the number of wet stations and on their locations and varies from one time step to the other many of the experimental variograms are very similar in their range and relative nugget this fact can be used to reduce the computational demand of the interpolation by grouping similar variograms and using the linearity of the kriging system the kriging weights remain the same for variograms γ h and cγ h for any positive number c this property can be used to simplify the calculations and can be done by using only a few different variograms which differ only by a constant factor for this purpose we used the following procedure 1 empirical variograms were calculated for each day or month t using the selected observations 2 these variograms were normed by dividing their values by the variance of the data considered 3 these normed variograms were then clustered using different criteria 4 theoretical variograms were fitted to the clusters means and used subsequently for kriging the theoretical variograms used for this study were of the form 11 γ h c 0 c 1 γ s h where γ s h is either the exponential or spherical variogram the variogram clustering was performed in three different ways 1 variograms for the same calendar month were grouped forming 12 different clusters 2 variograms corresponding to the same circulation pattern were grouped together forming 6 clusters 3 the distance between the normed variograms corresponding to different days was defined as the euclidean distance between the empirical variograms values corresponding to distances below 200 km using this distance a k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 was performed 6 clusters were identified in this case note that this clustering was not done on similar precipitation amounts but instead on their derived similar spatial variability k means clustering based on normed variograms leads to reasonably homogeneous clusters the variograms are on average more than two times closer to their cluster center then to the second best cluster using calendar months or circulation pattern the focus is not on the variability but more on the amount of precipitation thus the groups are less homogeneous from the viewpoint of the variogram shape however this fact does not have a great influence on the final results as is shown in the next section for the monthly precipitations as monthly circulation patterns were not defined and the sample was relatively small only 4 clusters were defined using the k means clustering method selected normed variograms for the variogram based clusters and the variograms of the two wettest cps are shown in fig 6 concerning space time variability the temporal correlation of the observed precipitation was calculated this value is 0 19 for stk the temporal anisotropy factor α in eq 9 was selected such that the corresponding correlation matches the observed correlation the factors c s and c t were not considered in order to avoid problems with the positive semidefinite conditions of the covariance function variogram the variograms of the monthly data have higher ranges and lower nugget c 0 values than the daily ones this is due to the reduction of the random error when aggregating daily data to monthly for the daily data in one of the clusters the spatial variogram showed no spatial dependence a pure nugget effect was found however this applies to a very small number of cases 52 days 1 8 of the 8 year period the advantage of using clusters of variograms is that ok and edk weights need to be calculated for each cluster only once as the weights are the same for any γ h and cγ h for any c 0 in contrast for qk the variograms of the transformed variable u were calculated and clustered in the same way as it was done for precipitation amounts clustering only slightly effects the interpolation results as the kriging weights are quite robust to small changes of the variogram bardossy 1988 5 2 numerical realization of the interpolation very large numbers of interpolations are required 1 6 million pixels for nearly 3000 time steps in total 4 8 billion interpolations for each method this means that the use of commercial software for kriging is not suitable due to the large computational demand in order to cope with the corresponding computational challenge a specific code was developed each interpolation procedure was carried out for a selected grid point first for all time steps these results were assigned to their geographical locations before producing the images the interpolation algorithm can be summarized as follows 1 select a target grid point for which the interpolation has to be carried out 2 select the neighbouring n stations of the grid point from all available observation locations these will be used for the interpolation and should reflect the assumption of local stationarity 3 for each cluster a selected normalized variogram is considered for calculation in the kriging matrix and the right hand side vector of the kriging equations 4 for each time step a find the variogram cluster corresponding to the given day b remove all lines and columns of the kriging matrix and the right hand side of the equations calculated in step 3 for stations that have a missing value for the selected time step c solve the trimmed linear equation system to obtain the weights d calculate the estimated value for the selected time step and grid point in case there are no missing values or if an infilling algorithm for example bárdossy and pegram 2014 is used first one can further speed up the algorithm by replacing step 5 2 with 5 solve linear equations for each variogram cluster please see bárdossy and pegram 2014 6 for each time step a find the appropriate variogram cluster b apply weights to the observations to calculate the estimate the advantage of this approach is that the time consuming search for neighbours and the calculation of the kriging matrices are done only as many times as the number of the defined clusters furthermore as the estimation is done for each grid cell independently the algorithm can be parallelized by splitting up the set of grid points and processing them on different cpus at the same time the reduction in time complexity is significant more than an order of magnitude given that for each point the semi variogram matrix is inverted only the cluster number of times rather than the number of time steps the most time consuming part while kriging 5 3 uncertainty assessment due to the sparse observation data and the high spatial variability of precipitation the interpolated fields have uncertainty the quantification of the uncertainty is important for all applications it cannot be quantified for the empirical methods in contrast the geostatistical interpolation methods offer means to calculate uncertainty in the form of an estimation variance borges et al 2016 abbasnezhadi et al 2019 liu et al 2020 the uncertainty depends on the variance of the given day or month on the variogram cluster of the day and the spatial aggregation kilibarda et al 2014 formally for a target grid point or a grid block v the estimation variance can be calculated as 12 σ 2 v t v a r z v t z v t j 1 n i 1 n λ j t λ i γ t x i x j 2 i 1 n λ i γ t x i v γ t v v where 13 γ t v v 1 v 2 v v γ t x y d x d y the uncertainty of quantile kriging qk is substantially different from that of ordinary kriging ok as the procedure is not linear the uncertainty cannot be calculated directly as was done using 13 instead in order to provide uncertainty estimates on different spatial scales a simulation approach can be adopted for this purpose for each time step n conditional realizations are simulated and the corresponding statistics can be calculated 6 results the five interpolation methods described above were applied for the 8 year observation period 2003 2010 for a 1 km x 1 km regular grid over iran using daily and monthly temporal resolutions for external drift kriging edk four different drift variables i the topographical elevation ii the geographical coordinates iii the interpolated long term mean precipitation iv the mean precipitation corresponding to each circulation pattern were used while elevation and geographical coordinates do not have a significant correlation with daily precipitation these variables were used as the external drift is only considered in the neighborhood of the target location for selected regions such as in the zagros mountains the correlation between precipitation and elevation is significant and can improve interpolation finally 9 different estimators were considered the estimated data were subsequently aggregated to six different spatial resolutions of 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 degree regular grids this was done to investigate the difference between the interpolation methods at different spatial scales upsampling to coarser resolutions is recommended instead of reinterpolating at the center of a coarser cell because it takes many samples from within the cell to give a mean value rather than taking the value at the center which may not be representative furthermore it is better than block kriging as a lot of extra computations such as estimating the mean variogram value over a cell are avoided as an example figs 7 and 8 show the interpolated daily precipitation on december 9 2004 and december 17 2006 using four of the six different interpolation methods at six different spatial resolutions while the maps differ for high resolutions for coarser resolutions of 1 and 2 5 the maps become very similar showing that the choice of interpolation method only plays an important role for small scale details fig 9 shows different interpolation results for selected months due to a stationary system in january 2008 extreme heavy rainfall took place in the southeast of iran which is in contrast about the same as the long term annual precipitation in this area for example the monthly total precipitation was recorded equal to 160 mm which is eight times more than the long term monthly precipitation at iranshahr a station in this region azirani et al 2016 for example please see fig 10 for a selected year at point scale these figures demonstrate the high spatial variability of precipitation at different time scales in order to compare the interpolation results the correlation between the results was calculated for different spatial resolutions the time series for each pixel was correlated and the mean correlation over all pixels determined temporal correlation in addition for each day the corresponding pixels were correlated spatial correlations table 1 shows the results for selected methods for comparison with available products the gpcc results at the same resolution were also included note that the temporal correlations are higher than the spatial ones this can be explained by the fact that the cps are common for each day that are mostly wet or mostly dry at the same time the gpcc results differ the most from the other methods this is most likely due to the different stations considered the differences between the results of the methods decrease with decreasing resolution while at the 0 1 o resolution the spatial correlations vary between 0 67 and 0 96 at the 2 5 o resolution the spatial correlations are much higher all above 0 947 table 1 this implies that for coarse resolutions the choice of the interpolation method does not matter much 6 1 cross validation results all the used interpolation methods lead to different precipitation estimates therefore it is important to compare not only the results but also to assess the quality of the interpolated fields for this purpose a leave one out cross validation was performed all individual precipitation measurements were removed and estimated using the remaining data this was done both for daily and monthly temporal resolutions the cross validation results for the daily and monthly data are listed in tables 2 and 3 first the results calculated on all data are shown then the results comparing the time series and those comparing the spatial patterns are shown for daily precipitation table 2 shows that ok with variograms calculated for the cps perform slightly better than ok with variograms clustered directly with the exception of nn all the methods perform similarly ok using cp defined variograms performs the best of all measures followed by edk with cp defined variograms and long term precipitation mean as external drift the relatively poor performance of stk is most likely due to the facts that the temporal correlation of the subsequent days is very small 0 2 and that stk cannot profit from different station configurations at different times when it comes to monthly results table 3 shows that external drift kriging edk location is superior to the other methods but the differences among the methods are not large note that for the monthly data cps could not be used due to the fact that they are usually defined on a daily scale the results show that nearest neighbor nn is a very poor estimator the other five methods perform nearly equally well at the daily resolution for the monthly resolution nn and id are worse than the three geostatistical interpolation methods on the daily time scale the temporal correlations are much higher than the spatial ones which are quite poor all below 0 5 the reason for the good temporal behavior is partly the seasonality of precipitation and partly the dependence caused by the same cp on the monthly scale all measures are better the spatial performance becomes nearly as good as the temporal monthly precipitation is much more regular than the daily 6 2 combined interpolation the different interpolators have different errors some work well for example in mountainous regions others near the coast the interpolation errors are partly structured in space therefore it is reasonable to test if combinations of the interpolators perform better than the individual ones a simple combination is to take the mean of pairs of interpolators in most cases these simple combinations perform better than the original ones table 4 shows the cross validation results for four pairs ok with variogram clustering or cp variograms combined with edk with long term mean as external drift or cp dependent mean as external drift these combinations are all better than the best single interpolator the differences are not big but due to the very large sample size 4 4 million they are significant 6 3 uncertainty uncertainty of gridded data is of great importance for various applications for example for the calibration of satellite based precipitation this error should be taken into account similarly for rainfall runoff modelling the model performance depends highly on the input precipitation quality this aspect is seldom explicitly considered and most gridded products do not have a quantitative quality estimate one way of expressing uncertainty is to compare the results of the different estimation methods where the difference between the method is high there the uncertainty is likely to be high fig 11 shows difference maps at different resolutions in mm from top to bottom the resolution goes from fine to coarse for the fine resolution the difference is high in comparison to a coarse resolution ok has mostly higher precipitation estimates than id and edk in the deserts and low elevation regions where the uncertainty is high in kriging methods while ok and qk have the lowest difference due to the nature of qk for geostatistical methods estimation variance can be calculated explicitly on the basis of the underlying hypotheses the estimated standard deviation for ok and edk is calculated for different spatial resolutions with the different variogram clusters using eq 12 as the variance according to 12 is linear with respect to the variogram and it depends only on the location of the observation points the uncertainty corresponding to a selected time step t can be calculated by multiplying the kriged standard deviation map corresponding to the cluster representative variogram with the sill equal to 1 multiplied by the standard deviation of the precipitation of that time step fig 12 shows the estimated standard deviation map for two different variogram clusters note that the uncertainty is only dependent on the location of the observation points the uncertainty decreases with the increasing spatial block size cross validation results show that for some locations the number of days where the error is below the kriging standard deviation is above 95 while for others lower than 50 thus this error measure is not appropriate in contrast the uncertainty of qk is specific to the given day or month whereas other uncertainty assessments do not consider this aspect and provide general uncertainty measures days with high precipitation have high uncertainty where the precipitation is falling as it would be expected fig 13 shows the estimated standard deviation for two selected days calculated using 100 quantile simulations taken at random note that the estimation error decreases with increasing grid size but that the structure of the errors is different from one day to the other depending on where intense precipitation is falling this is a more understandable representation of uncertainty the differences between the maps obtained from the different estimation methods reflect the spatial distribution of the corresponding precipitation and are thus an indicator of the uncertainty the maps of the standard deviation of the estimation shown in fig 13 and those of the differences of the estimation methods in fig 11 show a similar pattern indicating that the uncertainty estimation of qk is plausible on the other hand the uncertainty of ok for the corresponding cluster in fig 12 is completely different and seems not to be related to the selected day aggregation of the data in space and time reduces the difference between the interpolation methods as an example fig 14 shows the relative differences compared to the mean between the results of ok and edk for a selected day month and year on three spatial resolutions point 1 and 2 5 degree blocks one can see that the difference decreases much stronger in space than in time 7 summary and conclusions in this paper six different interpolation methods were applied to provide high resolution gridded daily and monthly precipitation datasets for iran in order to reflect the climatological influences a daily circulation pattern classification was developed and used the interpolation methods were compared using leave one out cross validation the nearest neighbour technique turns out to be the poorest interpolation method the other methods show a very similar performance inverse distance weighting performs nearly as well as the geostatistical methods on a daily time scale but deteriorates at a monthly scale the consideration of cps for the variogram calculations and for the external drift improves the interpolation slightly experimental variograms can be normed and subsequently clustered clustering can be done using the month of the year cps or by clustering the spatial variability through the consideration of a distance between the normed variograms this makes a simplification of the geostatistical interpolation possible and reduces the difference between their computational complexity to a level comparable to that of the empirical interpolations the interpolation results do not differ too much for the different methods of variogram calculations however the cp based ones perform the best the gridded data corresponding to different interpolation methods differ depending on the observations mainly near the boundaries between very wet and low intensity or dry areas the difference decreases substantially with decreasing spatial resolution for example at a 2 5 degree square resolution the results of the different methods do not differ substantially for coarse resolutions one could use the simplest and quickest interpolation method due to the moderate size of the observation network compared to the large area of iran interpolations are highly uncertain the results indicate that the interpolation cannot reliably reproduce the spatial pattern of precipitation on a daily scale but is reasonably good on the monthly time scale a comparison with gpcc shows that the major source of differences is the set of observations used not the interpolation method the uncertainty of the interpolation results can be calculated explicitly by geostatistical methods while for ok and edk the uncertainty maps depend only on the variogram and the location of the observations the uncertainty of qk reflects the specific spatial distribution of the day or month our conclusion is that qk requires much more computational effort than other kriging approaches but provides realistic uncertainty maps which reflect both the station density and the actual variability of precipitation credit authorship

8108,study region iran study focus gridded precipitation products are of great interest for hydrological applications the inhomogeneous geography and uneven spatial distribution of rain gauges in iran make it difficult to estimate valuable interpolated precipitation with daily or monthly resolutions therefore we evaluated the performance of two empirical and four geostatistical interpolation methods new hydrological insights for the region atmospheric circulation pattern cp classification was used to understand precipitation behavior and to improve interpolation based on 500 hpa geopotential fields six cps were identified in order to explain large scale precipitation behavior variograms were normed and clustered to reduce the computational effort of the geostatistical methods leave one out cross validation shows that the geostatistical methods outperform the empirical ones and the differences among the geostatistical methods are small the difference among all the methodologies decreased substantially for spatial aggregation to coarser resolutions in contrast temporal aggregation reduced the difference to a much lower extent a large dataset consisting of 1561 locations with daily observations was used for this study comparison with the gpcc daily dataset shows that the data used for interpolation has a larger influence than the choice of the interpolation

gridded interpolation products are highly uncertain for different time periods and locations due to low density and irregular distribution of observation networks prein and gobiet 2017 tarek et al 2021 but the uncertainty of gridded precipitation is seldom considered explicitly and is usually associated with available point observation density only prein and gobiet 2017 herrera et al 2019

regions with intense rainfall are associated with high local spatial uncertainty o and foelsche 2019 overall small investigation areas low number of terrestrial rain gauges uneven spatio temporal

aforementioned drawbacks using iran s densest available rain gauge network in this research we would also like to answer the following research questions i which is the best possible interpolation method to be used for this large dataset in iran for this purpose a leave one out cross validation is used ii how different are the results of the different interpolation methods depending on spatial and temporal aggregations iii can interpolation be improved by considering additional information such as topography long term climatology or atmospheric circulation patterns iv do the methods provide a reasonable uncertainty estimate the study area is iran a country with a reasonably good network of precipitation gauges however deserts and highlands have led to a non uniform distribution of rain gauges throughout the country the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the investigation area and the available data are described the third section discusses the atmospheric circulation patterns over and around the study area the fourth section describes the interpolation methods applied in this study sections five and six describe the interpolation results and variogram assessments and compares the different methods with respect to their quality and uncertainty quantification the paper ends with a discussion of the results and final conclusions 2 investigation area and data 2 1 investigation area iran is a vast country with an area of 1648 195 km2 located in west asia and in the middle east the country is bordered by turkmenistan the caspian sea the largest endorheic lake in the world azerbaijan and armenia to the north turkey and iraq to the west and pakistan and afghanistan to the east also the persian gulf and the gulf of oman cover the entire southern border of iran in terms of topography the elevation ranges from 28 m at the caspian sea to 5610 m on the mount damavand alborz and zagros the two main mountain ranges extend from northwest to northeast and from northwest to southeast of iran respectively two large deserts cover the center and east of iran namely the dasht e kavir and dasht e lut due to the country s location in the subtropical high pressure belt of the northern hemisphere and wide topographical ranges it has multiple climates fig 1 shows the köppen geiger climate classification map over iran beck et al 2018 it divides the climate of iran into five environmental zones consisting of arid desert bw 54 semi arid bs 33 humid with mild winters c 4 6 humid with severe winters d 8 2 and polar and tundra e 0 2 coverage therefore most parts of the country are categorized as arid and semi arid climates the mean annual precipitation is less than 250 mm and ranges from almost no rain in the desert to more than 1800 mm in the zagros and the southwestern shore of the caspian sea only 8 of the country s area receives more than 500 mm year tabari and talaee 2011 different climate regions need to be treated differently in the form of separate clusters for gridded precipitation interpolation garcia et al 2008 teegavarapu 2014 2 2 data the ministry of energy moe and the iranian meteorological organization irimo provided the precipitation data having more than 4360 and 433 observations stations respectively we checked the data in terms of gaps missing data and metadata this resulted in 1561 usable stations with daily precipitation finally the daily and monthly precipitation time series from 2003 to 2010 were considered for the 1561 measurement gauges over iran fig 2 the station density averages at about 1 per 1000 km2 3 circulation patterns the amount of precipitation at a given location among many other variables is influenced by the large scale circulation in the atmosphere the atmospheric pressure maps forming typical circulation patterns cps can be classified the amount of precipitation that may fall is then linked to the cps through the moisture content of the relevant air masses in the past pressure maps in their various forms have been used to study the cps responsible for large scale weather in different parts of the world bárdossy et al 2002 huth et al 2008 houssos et al 2008 bárdossy 2010 hoy et al 2013 pringle et al 2014 schlef et al 2019 ibebuchi 2021 to investigate the dependence of rain in iran based on air pressure in our case 500 hpa geopotential heights cp classification based on fuzzy logic was performed using the algorithm described in bárdossy et al 1995 it requires gridded daily air pressure or an equivalent variable at regions of interest for each cp a rule is defined assigning typical pressure anomalies to distinct locations in the region of interest the cp whose fuzzy rule has the highest degree of fulfillment for a given day is assigned to that day the simulated annealing optimization scheme kirkpatrick et al 1983 cerny 1985 is used to find the fuzzy rules that explain either dry or wet conditions by assigning fuzzy numbers to grid points and then evaluating the resulting score each cp is then the average of the pressures for all time steps which were assigned to it in a 2d grid form note that the rules are defined on the pressure fields and do not use precipitation for the classification in this study the classification objective function was based on neighborhood wetness the wetness of a neighborhood a region of interest is defined as the portion of stations in that neighborhood having precipitation above a certain threshold such an approach is more robust than using observed precipitation values to construct the fuzzy rules which have been observed to result in a bumpy objective function and an overfit here we used the gridded geopotential heights from the ncep dataset with a spatial resolution of 2 5 by 2 5 and a temporal resolution of 24 h for the entire time period of this study a pressure level of 500 hpa among others was chosen as it produced the best results interested readers are referred to kalnay et al 1996 for more information regarding the ncep dataset the rules were defined on a grid surrounding the study area the chosen longitude range was from 20 to 90 east and from 0 to 65 north for the latitudes this produced a grid of 27 columns by 29 rows an objective function based on the wetness of neighborhoods was chosen to produce a local maximum for the case when any or multiple neighborhoods experienced unusually wet or dry weather at a given time step the pressure anomaly maps corresponding to the cps along with their mean precipitation are shown in fig 3 a total of six were identified the cps are ordered so that cp0 is the driest and cp5 is the wettest fig 4 shows the annual cycle of relative frequencies of each cp for each day of the year for the driest cp0 we see that the frequency peaks around august summer while the wettest cp5 drops around the same time cp5 s frequency peaks in the winter months december and january regions of high continuous red lines and low dashed blue lines drive the wind upon which depends the precipitation the behavior of cps is further demonstrated by selecting a station randomly and plotting its empirical distribution functions of precipitation corresponding to each cp fig 5a these show that moving toward the wetter cps the probability of no rain drops significantly and the probability of exceedance of a given daily amount increases note that only the wetness of some selected neighborhoods was used for deriving the cps one further comparison showing empirical distribution functions of randomly chosen stations in the study area for cp5 fig 5b shows that depending on location the probability of wet weather varies substantially in space and thus precipitation cannot be considered to be stationary 4 interpolation methods in order to estimate precipitation at unknown locations six different interpolation methods were considered namely nearest neighbor nn inverse distance weighting id ordinary kriging ok external drift kriging edk quantile kriging qk and space time kriging stk the first two are simple deterministic approaches while the other four are geostatistical 4 1 nearest neighbour nn the simplest method to interpolate precipitation is to assign the value of the nearest neighbouring observation station and to take its observation as an interpolated value 1 z x t z x i x t where x i x min i d x x i d x x i being the euclidean distance between the points x and x i thus x i x is the closest observation point to the grid point x z x i t is the precipitation value at the point x i at time step t while z x t is the interpolated value at grid point x and time step t this interpolation method is very simple but has the disadvantage that the resulting maps are discontinuous the interpolation is performed for a high resolution grid for the coarser resolution the values on the fine grid are averaged that intersect a coarser cell 4 2 inverse distance id the inverse distance method uses a linear estimation for the value at the unsampled location x 2 z x t i 1 n λ i z x i t here the weights λ i are inversely proportional to the distance from the observation point to the target point 3 λ i 1 d x i x q j 1 n 1 d x j x q only the closest n stations are used the number n can be selected so that the estimation becomes stable increasing to n 1 does not have a significant influence note that the weights are the same for each individual time step or temporal aggregation we used an exponent of q 1 which results in weights that are linearly related to distance the optimum value of the exponent could be determined by cross validation in our case values different from 1 changed the performance very little thus we used q 1 similar to nn the interpolation is performed for a high resolution grid and then averaged appropriately for coarser resolutions 4 3 ordinary kriging ok ordinary kriging is a geostatistical method frequently used for spatial interpolation formally the unknown value at a location or the mean over an area v and time t is estimated as in eq 2 where the coefficients λ i t can be different for each time step t and are derived from the so called kriging equations 4 j 1 n λ j t γ t x i x j μ γ t v i 1 n j 1 n λ j t 1 here γ t v 1 v v γ t y d y v is the point area volume over which the interpolation value is required y is a point in v and μ is the lagrange multiplier the weights λ minimize the estimation variance under the assumption of a second order stationarity of each z x i t for each fixed t the value at the interpolation location z x t is computed as a linear combination as in eq 2 the variogram γ t h has to be calculated and fitted for each time step t the linear equation system 4 has to be solved for each grid point x and each time step t the weights depend on the location of the points and the variogram the weights can differ from one time step to other it should be pointed out that kriging has advantages over the empirical methods such as the screening effect but the inherent assumption that cross variance of the variable at distinct locations depends only on the distance becomes a problem when dealing with non stationary variables such as precipitation even the mean precipitation over long time periods months or years is very different in space a weaker assumption of local stationarity is more appropriate thus the estimation is reduced to observations in the neighborhood of the target location this results in the contribution of nearby surrounding points to the interpolation only as compared to taking points that are very far additionally that have little to do with the location in question the method is computationally expensive compared to nn and id as variograms have to be assessed for each time step and the kriging equations have to be solved subsequently for each time step and location 4 4 external drift kriging edk one way to cope with the problem of spatial non stationarity is to assume that there is a deterministic drift in precipitation dependent on some external variable such as the elevation and or the geographical coordinates we assume that this drift is h x and that the expected precipitation is a linear function of h but the coefficients of the drift are unknown this leads to an additional equation in the kriging eq 4 system 5 j 1 n λ j t h x i h x in order to solve the equations a second lagrange multiplier μ 2 is introduced this method also requires estimating variograms for each time step t for further details about external drift kriging consult ahmed and de marsily 1987 4 5 quantile kriging qk the idea of quantile kriging lebrenz and bárdossy 2019 is to use the time series statistics of the observation points instead of using precipitation z x t a new variable is introduced 6 u x t φ 1 f x z x t here f x z is the distribution function of precipitation at location x 7 f x z z x t i z x t i z t 1 where t is the number of time steps considered φ is the distribution function of the univariate standard normal distribution formally eq 6 transforms for all sites x the distribution of precipitation to the same common distribution in this case to standard normal note that this transformation is applied for each station in time and not in space as is usually done in gaussian anamorphosis the distribution of the values on a given day in space is not necessarily gaussian in order to use this method the distribution of precipitation at the unsampled gridpoint is necessary this can be done by using different geostatistical methods a method for interpolating distribution functions for short aggregation times is presented in mosthaf and bárdossy 2017 another possibility is to interpolate the quantiles corresponding to selected non percentiles or interpolating percentiles for selected precipitation amounts yet another method of estimating distribution functions corresponding to arbitrary locations is to use functional kriging giraldo et al 2011 this new variable can be considered as spatially stationary and its expected value is for each x e u x t 0 instead of interpolating z u is interpolated using ok the variogram is also calculated for u subsequently the estimated u x t has to be transformed back to precipitation due to non linearity of the transformation 6 the uncertainty of estimating u has to be taken into account using the following relationship 8 z x t f x 1 u x t y σ x u ϕ y d y here σ x u is the kriging standard deviation interpolating u for the location x mosthaf and bárdossy 2017 qk is more complex than the other geostatistical procedures considered in this paper but it offers many advantages the climatological conditions of the target location are taken into account through the local distribution functions the uncertainty of the estimation at time t reflects the precipitation behaviour of that particular time step regions with homogeneous precipitation amounts have low uncertainty while areas where precipitation changes in space have high uncertainty precipitation observations outside the interpolation period can also be taken into account for example the distribution functions for abandoned stations can improve the estimation 4 6 space time kriging stk another possibility for interpolating daily precipitation is to take the values of the previous and the subsequent days also into account in heuvelink and griffith 2010 a complex model for space time interpolation was developed the covariance structure in this case is 9 c h δ t c s h c t δ t c s t h 2 α δ t 2 this method can profit from the temporal continuity of precipitation which is unfortunately very weak at the daily scale 5 application 5 1 variogram assessment the kriging procedures require fitted theoretical variogram functions the kriging weights are then calculated using the equation system eq 4 variograms have to be assessed for each time step t the large number of zeros especially for the daily resolution may distort the variogram thus instead of using all observations for the variogram calculation for each time step t zeros far from wet locations were not considered formally the set of precipitation observation points considered for the variogram calculation x t is defined as 10 x t x min y z y t 0 d z x t z y t d l i m where d lim is the limit for the distance if this limit is selected such that it is also used for the limit of the neighborhood selection for the interpolation then for gridpoints with a distance larger than d lim the interpolation will always give a zero estimate independent of the variogram as all observations used were equal to zero the variogram is thus calculated using points which influence the results the reduction of points depends on the number of wet stations and on their locations and varies from one time step to the other many of the experimental variograms are very similar in their range and relative nugget this fact can be used to reduce the computational demand of the interpolation by grouping similar variograms and using the linearity of the kriging system the kriging weights remain the same for variograms γ h and cγ h for any positive number c this property can be used to simplify the calculations and can be done by using only a few different variograms which differ only by a constant factor for this purpose we used the following procedure 1 empirical variograms were calculated for each day or month t using the selected observations 2 these variograms were normed by dividing their values by the variance of the data considered 3 these normed variograms were then clustered using different criteria 4 theoretical variograms were fitted to the clusters means and used subsequently for kriging the theoretical variograms used for this study were of the form 11 γ h c 0 c 1 γ s h where γ s h is either the exponential or spherical variogram the variogram clustering was performed in three different ways 1 variograms for the same calendar month were grouped forming 12 different clusters 2 variograms corresponding to the same circulation pattern were grouped together forming 6 clusters 3 the distance between the normed variograms corresponding to different days was defined as the euclidean distance between the empirical variograms values corresponding to distances below 200 km using this distance a k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 was performed 6 clusters were identified in this case note that this clustering was not done on similar precipitation amounts but instead on their derived similar spatial variability k means clustering based on normed variograms leads to reasonably homogeneous clusters the variograms are on average more than two times closer to their cluster center then to the second best cluster using calendar months or circulation pattern the focus is not on the variability but more on the amount of precipitation thus the groups are less homogeneous from the viewpoint of the variogram shape however this fact does not have a great influence on the final results as is shown in the next section for the monthly precipitations as monthly circulation patterns were not defined and the sample was relatively small only 4 clusters were defined using the k means clustering method selected normed variograms for the variogram based clusters and the variograms of the two wettest cps are shown in fig 6 concerning space time variability the temporal correlation of the observed precipitation was calculated this value is 0 19 for stk the temporal anisotropy factor α in eq 9 was selected such that the corresponding correlation matches the observed correlation the factors c s and c t were not considered in order to avoid problems with the positive semidefinite conditions of the covariance function variogram the variograms of the monthly data have higher ranges and lower nugget c 0 values than the daily ones this is due to the reduction of the random error when aggregating daily data to monthly for the daily data in one of the clusters the spatial variogram showed no spatial dependence a pure nugget effect was found however this applies to a very small number of cases 52 days 1 8 of the 8 year period the advantage of using clusters of variograms is that ok and edk weights need to be calculated for each cluster only once as the weights are the same for any γ h and cγ h for any c 0 in contrast for qk the variograms of the transformed variable u were calculated and clustered in the same way as it was done for precipitation amounts clustering only slightly effects the interpolation results as the kriging weights are quite robust to small changes of the variogram bardossy 1988 5 2 numerical realization of the interpolation very large numbers of interpolations are required 1 6 million pixels for nearly 3000 time steps in total 4 8 billion interpolations for each method this means that the use of commercial software for kriging is not suitable due to the large computational demand in order to cope with the corresponding computational challenge a specific code was developed each interpolation procedure was carried out for a selected grid point first for all time steps these results were assigned to their geographical locations before producing the images the interpolation algorithm can be summarized as follows 1 select a target grid point for which the interpolation has to be carried out 2 select the neighbouring n stations of the grid point from all available observation locations these will be used for the interpolation and should reflect the assumption of local stationarity 3 for each cluster a selected normalized variogram is considered for calculation in the kriging matrix and the right hand side vector of the kriging equations 4 for each time step a find the variogram cluster corresponding to the given day b remove all lines and columns of the kriging matrix and the right hand side of the equations calculated in step 3 for stations that have a missing value for the selected time step c solve the trimmed linear equation system to obtain the weights d calculate the estimated value for the selected time step and grid point in case there are no missing values or if an infilling algorithm for example bárdossy and pegram 2014 is used first one can further speed up the algorithm by replacing step 5 2 with 5 solve linear equations for each variogram cluster please see bárdossy and pegram 2014 6 for each time step a find the appropriate variogram cluster b apply weights to the observations to calculate the estimate the advantage of this approach is that the time consuming search for neighbours and the calculation of the kriging matrices are done only as many times as the number of the defined clusters furthermore as the estimation is done for each grid cell independently the algorithm can be parallelized by splitting up the set of grid points and processing them on different cpus at the same time the reduction in time complexity is significant more than an order of magnitude given that for each point the semi variogram matrix is inverted only the cluster number of times rather than the number of time steps the most time consuming part while kriging 5 3 uncertainty assessment due to the sparse observation data and the high spatial variability of precipitation the interpolated fields have uncertainty the quantification of the uncertainty is important for all applications it cannot be quantified for the empirical methods in contrast the geostatistical interpolation methods offer means to calculate uncertainty in the form of an estimation variance borges et al 2016 abbasnezhadi et al 2019 liu et al 2020 the uncertainty depends on the variance of the given day or month on the variogram cluster of the day and the spatial aggregation kilibarda et al 2014 formally for a target grid point or a grid block v the estimation variance can be calculated as 12 σ 2 v t v a r z v t z v t j 1 n i 1 n λ j t λ i γ t x i x j 2 i 1 n λ i γ t x i v γ t v v where 13 γ t v v 1 v 2 v v γ t x y d x d y the uncertainty of quantile kriging qk is substantially different from that of ordinary kriging ok as the procedure is not linear the uncertainty cannot be calculated directly as was done using 13 instead in order to provide uncertainty estimates on different spatial scales a simulation approach can be adopted for this purpose for each time step n conditional realizations are simulated and the corresponding statistics can be calculated 6 results the five interpolation methods described above were applied for the 8 year observation period 2003 2010 for a 1 km x 1 km regular grid over iran using daily and monthly temporal resolutions for external drift kriging edk four different drift variables i the topographical elevation ii the geographical coordinates iii the interpolated long term mean precipitation iv the mean precipitation corresponding to each circulation pattern were used while elevation and geographical coordinates do not have a significant correlation with daily precipitation these variables were used as the external drift is only considered in the neighborhood of the target location for selected regions such as in the zagros mountains the correlation between precipitation and elevation is significant and can improve interpolation finally 9 different estimators were considered the estimated data were subsequently aggregated to six different spatial resolutions of 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 2 5 degree regular grids this was done to investigate the difference between the interpolation methods at different spatial scales upsampling to coarser resolutions is recommended instead of reinterpolating at the center of a coarser cell because it takes many samples from within the cell to give a mean value rather than taking the value at the center which may not be representative furthermore it is better than block kriging as a lot of extra computations such as estimating the mean variogram value over a cell are avoided as an example figs 7 and 8 show the interpolated daily precipitation on december 9 2004 and december 17 2006 using four of the six different interpolation methods at six different spatial resolutions while the maps differ for high resolutions for coarser resolutions of 1 and 2 5 the maps become very similar showing that the choice of interpolation method only plays an important role for small scale details fig 9 shows different interpolation results for selected months due to a stationary system in january 2008 extreme heavy rainfall took place in the southeast of iran which is in contrast about the same as the long term annual precipitation in this area for example the monthly total precipitation was recorded equal to 160 mm which is eight times more than the long term monthly precipitation at iranshahr a station in this region azirani et al 2016 for example please see fig 10 for a selected year at point scale these figures demonstrate the high spatial variability of precipitation at different time scales in order to compare the interpolation results the correlation between the results was calculated for different spatial resolutions the time series for each pixel was correlated and the mean correlation over all pixels determined temporal correlation in addition for each day the corresponding pixels were correlated spatial correlations table 1 shows the results for selected methods for comparison with available products the gpcc results at the same resolution were also included note that the temporal correlations are higher than the spatial ones this can be explained by the fact that the cps are common for each day that are mostly wet or mostly dry at the same time the gpcc results differ the most from the other methods this is most likely due to the different stations considered the differences between the results of the methods decrease with decreasing resolution while at the 0 1 o resolution the spatial correlations vary between 0 67 and 0 96 at the 2 5 o resolution the spatial correlations are much higher all above 0 947 table 1 this implies that for coarse resolutions the choice of the interpolation method does not matter much 6 1 cross validation results all the used interpolation methods lead to different precipitation estimates therefore it is important to compare not only the results but also to assess the quality of the interpolated fields for this purpose a leave one out cross validation was performed all individual precipitation measurements were removed and estimated using the remaining data this was done both for daily and monthly temporal resolutions the cross validation results for the daily and monthly data are listed in tables 2 and 3 first the results calculated on all data are shown then the results comparing the time series and those comparing the spatial patterns are shown for daily precipitation table 2 shows that ok with variograms calculated for the cps perform slightly better than ok with variograms clustered directly with the exception of nn all the methods perform similarly ok using cp defined variograms performs the best of all measures followed by edk with cp defined variograms and long term precipitation mean as external drift the relatively poor performance of stk is most likely due to the facts that the temporal correlation of the subsequent days is very small 0 2 and that stk cannot profit from different station configurations at different times when it comes to monthly results table 3 shows that external drift kriging edk location is superior to the other methods but the differences among the methods are not large note that for the monthly data cps could not be used due to the fact that they are usually defined on a daily scale the results show that nearest neighbor nn is a very poor estimator the other five methods perform nearly equally well at the daily resolution for the monthly resolution nn and id are worse than the three geostatistical interpolation methods on the daily time scale the temporal correlations are much higher than the spatial ones which are quite poor all below 0 5 the reason for the good temporal behavior is partly the seasonality of precipitation and partly the dependence caused by the same cp on the monthly scale all measures are better the spatial performance becomes nearly as good as the temporal monthly precipitation is much more regular than the daily 6 2 combined interpolation the different interpolators have different errors some work well for example in mountainous regions others near the coast the interpolation errors are partly structured in space therefore it is reasonable to test if combinations of the interpolators perform better than the individual ones a simple combination is to take the mean of pairs of interpolators in most cases these simple combinations perform better than the original ones table 4 shows the cross validation results for four pairs ok with variogram clustering or cp variograms combined with edk with long term mean as external drift or cp dependent mean as external drift these combinations are all better than the best single interpolator the differences are not big but due to the very large sample size 4 4 million they are significant 6 3 uncertainty uncertainty of gridded data is of great importance for various applications for example for the calibration of satellite based precipitation this error should be taken into account similarly for rainfall runoff modelling the model performance depends highly on the input precipitation quality this aspect is seldom explicitly considered and most gridded products do not have a quantitative quality estimate one way of expressing uncertainty is to compare the results of the different estimation methods where the difference between the method is high there the uncertainty is likely to be high fig 11 shows difference maps at different resolutions in mm from top to bottom the resolution goes from fine to coarse for the fine resolution the difference is high in comparison to a coarse resolution ok has mostly higher precipitation estimates than id and edk in the deserts and low elevation regions where the uncertainty is high in kriging methods while ok and qk have the lowest difference due to the nature of qk for geostatistical methods estimation variance can be calculated explicitly on the basis of the underlying hypotheses the estimated standard deviation for ok and edk is calculated for different spatial resolutions with the different variogram clusters using eq 12 as the variance according to 12 is linear with respect to the variogram and it depends only on the location of the observation points the uncertainty corresponding to a selected time step t can be calculated by multiplying the kriged standard deviation map corresponding to the cluster representative variogram with the sill equal to 1 multiplied by the standard deviation of the precipitation of that time step fig 12 shows the estimated standard deviation map for two different variogram clusters note that the uncertainty is only dependent on the location of the observation points the uncertainty decreases with the increasing spatial block size cross validation results show that for some locations the number of days where the error is below the kriging standard deviation is above 95 while for others lower than 50 thus this error measure is not appropriate in contrast the uncertainty of qk is specific to the given day or month whereas other uncertainty assessments do not consider this aspect and provide general uncertainty measures days with high precipitation have high uncertainty where the precipitation is falling as it would be expected fig 13 shows the estimated standard deviation for two selected days calculated using 100 quantile simulations taken at random note that the estimation error decreases with increasing grid size but that the structure of the errors is different from one day to the other depending on where intense precipitation is falling this is a more understandable representation of uncertainty the differences between the maps obtained from the different estimation methods reflect the spatial distribution of the corresponding precipitation and are thus an indicator of the uncertainty the maps of the standard deviation of the estimation shown in fig 13 and those of the differences of the estimation methods in fig 11 show a similar pattern indicating that the uncertainty estimation of qk is plausible on the other hand the uncertainty of ok for the corresponding cluster in fig 12 is completely different and seems not to be related to the selected day aggregation of the data in space and time reduces the difference between the interpolation methods as an example fig 14 shows the relative differences compared to the mean between the results of ok and edk for a selected day month and year on three spatial resolutions point 1 and 2 5 degree blocks one can see that the difference decreases much stronger in space than in time 7 summary and conclusions in this paper six different interpolation methods were applied to provide high resolution gridded daily and monthly precipitation datasets for iran in order to reflect the climatological influences a daily circulation pattern classification was developed and used the interpolation methods were compared using leave one out cross validation the nearest neighbour technique turns out to be the poorest interpolation method the other methods show a very similar performance inverse distance weighting performs nearly as well as the geostatistical methods on a daily time scale but deteriorates at a monthly scale the consideration of cps for the variogram calculations and for the external drift improves the interpolation slightly experimental variograms can be normed and subsequently clustered clustering can be done using the month of the year cps or by clustering the spatial variability through the consideration of a distance between the normed variograms this makes a simplification of the geostatistical interpolation possible and reduces the difference between their computational complexity to a level comparable to that of the empirical interpolations the interpolation results do not differ too much for the different methods of variogram calculations however the cp based ones perform the best the gridded data corresponding to different interpolation methods differ depending on the observations mainly near the boundaries between very wet and low intensity or dry areas the difference decreases substantially with decreasing spatial resolution for example at a 2 5 degree square resolution the results of the different methods do not differ substantially for coarse resolutions one could use the simplest and quickest interpolation method due to the moderate size of the observation network compared to the large area of iran interpolations are highly uncertain the results indicate that the interpolation cannot reliably reproduce the spatial pattern of precipitation on a daily scale but is reasonably good on the monthly time scale a comparison with gpcc shows that the major source of differences is the set of observations used not the interpolation method the uncertainty of the interpolation results can be calculated explicitly by geostatistical methods while for ok and edk the uncertainty maps depend only on the variogram and the location of the observations the uncertainty of qk reflects the specific spatial distribution of the day or month our conclusion is that qk requires much more computational effort than other kriging approaches but provides realistic uncertainty maps which reflect both the station density and the actual variability of precipitation credit authorship

8109,study region a peatland watershed was constructed on a post mined oil sands lease in northern alberta canada with the intention of replicating the function of natural wetlands removed by surface mining study focus given the potential for moisture limited conditions due to the sub humid regional climate ensuring sufficient water availability in these landscapes is a principal concern this research demonstrates how small recharge basins can modify the hydrology to promote groundwater recharge critical for sustaining saturated conditions in a downgradient wetland new hydrological insights for the region location was important in determining the efficacy of recharge basins specifically basins placed at the confluence of two hillslopes detained substantial volumes of runoff due to large upslope areas contributing 30 of the groundwater budget to the fen while only occupying 1 of the upland area basins situated near low relief hillslopes or altogether isolated from a hillslope did not detain appreciable runoff and therefore had a minor role in recharging groundwater groundwater in the vicinity and downgradient of active recharge basins had considerably lower solute concentrations because of dilution this suggests that basins can not only enhance recharge within engineered landscapes providing a consistent and focused supply of water to upland aquifers but offer

price et al 2010 the potential of depressional features to enhance recharge and redistribute salts must be evaluated recent investigations into the geochemical conditions generated by tailings sand materials in a reclaimed landscape have been reported by simhayov et al 2017 and kessel et al 2018 yet the role of system design and materials on recharge and transport processes responsible for the redistribution of na within such constructed upland fen systems are undocumented and poorly understood therefore the primary objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the efficacy of recharge basins on groundwater recharge 2 assess the optimal geometry size and shape and positioning of the recharge basins necessary to maximize recharge and 3 determine the implications for enhanced recharge on preferential flushing of na within the tailings sand upland the findings from this study will further contribute to the growing body of literature on techniques to aid in the reclamation of the post mined oil sands landscape specifically this work will inform reclamation practitioners and mine operators of the value of surface flow detention structures in creating upland landforms with more consistent hydrologic behavior that can efficiently partition water to groundwater recharge 2 study site 2 1 constructed tailings sand upland nfw is a constructed upland fen system situated on an oil sands mine lease 56 55 94 n 111 25 04 w 25 km north of fort mcmurray alberta nfw was designed with the aid of modeling that indicated the requisite morphology to maintain an adequate water supply to the fen under the periods of water stress that occur frequently in the aosr daly et al 2012 price et al 2010 the upland consists of a 3 m tailings sand aquifer overlain by a 0 3 0 5 m layer of lfh mineral mix herein referred to as lfh an over stripped forest floor soil commonly used in oil sands reclamation naeth et al 2013 sutton and price 2020a the upland and fen are underlain by an impermeable geosynthetic clay liner on a 3 grade that establishes a hydraulic gradient towards the fen and vastly reduces percolation losses to the regional groundwater flow system the fen peat is underlain by a highly permeable petroleum coke underdrain layer 0 5 m thick that projects 100 m upslope beneath the tailings sand upland a subregion of the upland herein referred to as the transition zone shaded area in fig 1 the entire upland fen system 10 6 ha fig 1 is situated in a much larger reclaimed watershed 32 1 ha composed of four primary hillslopes the west 2 4 ha and southeast 8 4 ha hillslopes were reclaimed in 2011 and had immature and relatively sparse vegetation communities at the time of this study the east 8 1 ha hillslope was reclaimed and planted in 2007 and had developed a substantial vegetation cover the southeast and west slopes were found to generate considerable runoff during rainfall events that flowed over the upland some of which infiltrated and contributed to the groundwater that sustains the fen ketcheson and price 2016a the south hillslope is an undisturbed hillslope which despite the steep relief does not contribute to upland recharge due to its small size dense vegetation undisturbed soil and position with respect to the geosynthetic clay liner ketcheson and price 2016a several meso scale raised landforms 10 100 m width by 1 m height were incorporated within the upland in which tailings sand was piled and capped 20 cm with lfh reclamation soil similar to the surrounding upland over the 2013 season these raised landforms herein referred to as hummocks detained and trapped a small amount of overland flow behind their upslope side however this water did not notably enhance recharge compared to the surrounding upland because the lfh that covered all upland areas had a relatively low infiltration capacity and high water holding capacity ketcheson 2016 sutton and price 2020a thus in late august 2013 several modifications were made to the configuration of the upland with the intention of promoting groundwater recharge first a bulldozer equipped with a ripper shank was used to till furrows furrow dimension typically approximately 24 cm wide 10 cm deep with 85 cm spacing ketcheson 2016 to retain overland flow increase water detention and thus infiltration second the lfh on the upslope side of the hummocks was excavated to expose the tailings sand the excavated soil material was placed at each end of the hummocks thereby extending them to further increase their detention capacity the resulting depressional features 30 50 cm deep herein referred to as recharge basins fig 2 were capable of detaining much larger volumes of overland flow and effectively increased the percolation to the tailings sand aquifer by removing the lfh reclamation soil a total of four recharge basins were added the east area 700 m2 central 450 m2 west 400 m2 and southeast 100 m2 recharge basins fig 1 in the several growing seasons post construction hillslope runoff from the southeast slope during heavy rainfall resulted in substantial fine grained materials transported into the east and southeast recharge basins forming a 20 30 cm cap across both basins 3 methods the study was conducted during the snow free periods of may to october for 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 as shown by early field observations the east recharge basin received the most surface runoff and therefore was chosen for the most detailed monitoring and instrumentation 3 1 instrumentation and hydrological monitoring in addition to the monitoring network of wells and piezometers within the upland and fen described in detail by kessel et al 2018 additional monitoring locations 2 25 2 75 m below ground surface bgs were instrumented within the east and southeast recharge basin in may 2014 monitoring wells and piezometers 2 75 m bgs were instrumented in the central and west recharge basins in may 2015 all groundwater wells had fully slotted intakes with depth ranging 2 6 3 7 m bgs piezometers had a 0 2 m slotted intake centered around their installation depth water tables were automatically recorded with water level loggers or pressure transducers dataflow systems ltd odyssey capacitance water level logger schlumberger limited mini diver onset hobo u20 manual measurements of hydraulic head were performed every 5 to 7 days to validate all autologging water levels initially in may and june 2014 an incremented rod was installed to monitor pond height stage within the east recharge basin but was replaced by a fully slotted standpipe with water level logger in july 2014 which recorded stage at 15 minute intervals the stage accurately monitored ponded water within the recharge basin only when it was above a threshold capacity of 10 cm due to the minimum height required for the water level logger detailed stage measurements were quality assured by field observations and manual measurements of pond depth in may 2013 two vertical soil moisture profiles were instrumented within the variably saturated layer of the tailings sand aquifer one in the south end of the upland and the other in the center of the upland 15 m downslope of the central recharge basin these are herein referred to as the south and central upland vwc stations respectively fig 1 soil moisture profiles consisted of 8 dielectric impedance reflectometry soil moisture probes stevens water monitoring systems inc hydra ii four within the lfh soil cap and four within the underlying tailings sand typically at depths of 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 40 m and 0 50 0 60 1 00 1 50 m bgs respectively probe depths varied slightly depending on lfh layer thicknesses in may 2015 the east and central recharge basin were instrumented with similar vertical soil moisture profiles within the variably saturated tailings sand two soil moisture profiles were instrumented in the east recharge basin 10 m apart and consisted of 5 and 3 sensors at 0 05 0 25 0 40 0 60

taylor approach discussed later based on data from the fen meteorological station which was assumed to be most representative of open water evaporation to simulate the evaporative loss of the ponded

3 2 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were taken periodically from monitoring wells and piezometers within the recharge basins and surrounding upland throughout the duration of the study period several grab samples were also taken from the water ponded within the recharge basins following large rain events 24 hr period 10 mm all samples were stored at 4 c until being passed through a 0 45 µm

orion star a329 ph conductivity portable multiparameter meter at the time of retrieval in the field 3 3 soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties including particle size distribution porosity and infiltration capacity for upland lfh and tailings sands are reported in ketcheson 2016 single ring constant head infiltration tests were conducted using 5 cm inner diameter steel rings for tailings sands within all four recharge basins infiltration tests within the east and southeast recharge basins included tests in which the fine material over wash sediments were excavated to expose the tailings sand due to the negligible surface overland flow into the central and west recharge basins there was little to no introduction of fine sediments therefore no excavation was necessary and infiltration tests were simply conducted on the bare tailings sand additional single ring infiltration tests were conducted on the fine grained over wash material within the east recharge basin 3 4 recharge basin capacity and infiltration volumes recharge volumes were calculated for only the east recharge basin given its frequent filling with runoff the stage ponding water depth versus bathymetry volume and infiltration area is documented in appendix a fig a1 change in volume over time dv dt of ponded water within the east recharge basin was determined by a water balance approach 1 dv dt p r in et f out where p is precipitation mm hr 1 r is runoff into the basin mm hr 1 et is evaporation of open water mm hr 1 and f is the infiltration rate mm hr 1 et was estimated using the priestley taylor available energy approach for equilibrium evapotranspiration which applies an alpha of 1 0 to closely estimate the evaporation for open water priestley and taylor 1972 given that there were no hydrometeorological measurements made above the recharge basins net radiation and ground heat flux from the fen meteorological tower were used instead which appropriately reflects the atmospheric and surface conditions of the recharge basins scarlett et al 2017 a base infiltration rate f mm hr 1 for the recharge basin was approximated by back calculating eq 1 during periods of infiltration only high intensity rainfall events 10 mm hr 1 resulted in rapid filling of the recharge basin immediately after the basin was filled p and r following the rainfall event can be assumed to equal zero and 2 f et dv dt finally the cumulative infiltrated volume of water through a recharge basin was the summation of the product of f and the period of ponding for each time step δt 15 min such that 3 total volume infiltrated i 1 f i t i 1 t i based on evidence from the field it was assumed that a single basin capacity infiltrated through each recharge basin immediately following snowmelt not included in the study period ketcheson and price 2016b sutton and price 2020a which was included in each total seasonal recharge volume by this method it was determined that the total basin capacity of the east recharge basin was 240 m3 which equates to 5 mm of r from the east southeast slope sub catchment 4 9 ha 4 results 4 1 hydrological context of recharge basins a total of 254 193 126 and 222 mm of p were received between 17 may and 24 august in the 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 study periods respectively p in all seasons was dominated by infrequent but high intensity 24 hr period 10 mm events fig 3 following p events that exceeded this intensity the east recharge basin was observed to fill within 15 min of peak rainfall as a consequence of r from the east southeast slope confluence 4 9 ha once filled the ponded water spilled out around the edges of the raised hummock continuing as overland flow towards the fen largely intercepted by the aforementioned furrows some p events were not received in a single period of continuous rainfall but could span over 24 48 hour periods resulting in partial re filling of the east recharge basin illustrated by the saw tooth pattern in the ponded water level stage hydrograph fig 3 the infiltration rate f for the exposed tailings sand in recharge basins averaged 319 mm hr 1 sample size n for the east central and west recharge basin is 3 9 and 6 respectively which was higher than reported for the lfh upland soil cover using the same method average of 66 mm hr 1 ketcheson 2016 and within an order of magnitude of the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of the tailings sand aquifer 4 m day or 167 mm hr 1 sutton et al submitted recharge basins experienced stronger increases in vwc in the underlying tailings sand compared to that in tailings sands of the surrounding upland overlain by lfh fig 4 vwc within the tailings sand layers 0 05 and 0 60 m bgs in the east and central recharge basins responded to rainfall events greater than 10 and 15 mm day 1 for each respective basin the water table in the east recharge basin was shallower ranging 0 60 and 1 90 m bgs between 2014 and 2016 and responded to these events fig 4 the water table beneath the central recharge basin was deeper 2 60 m bgs and did not appear to respond to any early season infiltration events fig 4 following the larger rainfall events that elicited large water table rise under the east recharge basin no comparable water table responses 0 2 m rise were recorded in the lfh covered south and central upland sites fig 4 c and d periods of ponding within the recharge basins resulted in prolonged elevated vwc in the tailings sand persisting above field capacity for 20 days following large rainfall events fig 4 relatively dry periods between large rainfall events 2 to 3 weeks resulted in vwc returning to a residual water content 0 10 at all locations and the mounded water tables beneath the recharge basins to dissipate the east recharge basin received the most overland flow of all the recharge basins within the upland having ponded water present for 27 23 and 30 of the 2014 2015 and 2016 study periods respectively fig 3 compared to the central recharge basin which was ponded for less than 5 of both seasons for the east recharge basin periods of ponding typically persisted for 5 to 12 days except for a period of prolonged ponding for 15 days in 2015 due to successive rain events refilling the basin fig 3 cumulative infiltrated volumes through the east recharge basin were 1308 928 and 1506 m3 45 32 and 52 mm with respect to the fen area in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 4 high overland flow rates from the southeast slope which fed the east recharge basin resulted in a fine grained material outwash that covered the entire basin the value of f estimated by the measured change in ponded water levels within the east recharge basin ranged from 2 to 12 mm hr 1 mean of 8 0 mm hr 1 which was reasonably close to the value approximated by single ring infiltration tests mean of 4 6 mm hr 1 sample size of 3 not shown 4 2 groundwater geochemistry groundwater ec and na concentrations within the tailings sand aquifer had a strong linear relationship fig a2 and suggests ec is a good indicator of na concentrations na concentrations in the upland groundwater were uniformly high 200 mg l 1 throughout the tailings sand aquifer in 2013 prior to the addition of recharge basins fig 5 after the addition of recharge basins groundwater concentrations rapidly decreased beneath the east recharge basin 100 mg l 1 figs 3 and 5 in 2015 groundwater ec and na were relatively high before any ponding or response at the water table occurred with mean concentrations of 2390 µs cm 1 and 140 mg l 1 respectively decreasing considerably to below 1072 µs cm 1 and 46 mg l 1 below the east recharge basin immediately following ponding and percolation groundwater concentrations remained relatively low below the east basin for the remaining portion of 2015 seasons fig 5 with similar patterns repeating in 2016 fig 3 comparable decreases in na concentrations in groundwater were observed downgradient of the east recharge basin along the east side of the upland fig 5 ec within the tailings sand aquifer below the central recharge basin remained relatively high average 2690 µs cm 1 throughout 2015 until a stark decrease to below 1300 µs cm 1 late in the growing season following a slight rise in water table fig 3 ec in groundwater beneath the west recharge basin did not decrease throughout 2015 remaining well above 2500 µs cm 1 fig 3 ec remained high beneath the central and west recharge basins throughout 2016 fig 3 5 discussion 5 1 recharge basins as recharge windows water availability is a primary concern when constructing a wetland within a sub humid region where potential evapotranspiration generally exceeds precipitation as is the case in the aosr price et al 2010 devito et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2017 this potential moisture limitation must be managed intentionally through landscape design to ensure that water is partitioned and distributed efficiently in all four years studied 2013 2016 nfw aet from the fen was greater than p kessel et al 2018 most notable was the large water deficit in the study period in 2015 p aet 30 for periods 17 may to 27 august 2015 which led to particularly dry conditions throughout the nfw and an advance of high na concentrations beneath the fen fig 5 the east recharge basin had prolonged ponding fig 3 and table 1 a persistent response in vwc fig 4 and pronounced mounding in the proximal water table fig 3 when compared to the central or west basins the east basin was clearly the most successful in contributing groundwater recharge to the tailing sand aquifer the recharge volumes calculated for the east recharge basin were 25 17 and 33 of the fen groundwater inflow component q fen as calculated by ketcheson et al 2017 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively table 1 given the very small area of the east recharge basin relative to the rest of the upland 0 9 these contributions scale to it being 22 53 times more effective at recharging the aquifer than the surrounding areas of upland overlain by lfh 98 0 of the area the efficacy of the basin can be partly attributed to the large upslope catchment that contributed to this basin 4 9 ha but perhaps of even greater consequence was the topography of the east and southeast hillslopes that converged flow into the confluence thus providing limited opportunities for infiltration as the water moved downslope importantly the topographic relief of the hillslopes did not appear to correlate with the propensity for runoff generation as the west hillslope that produced negligible quantities of overland flow had the same grade as the southeast slope 19 and a slightly steeper grade than the east slope 15 the position of this basin at the toe of the confluence between the east and southeast hillslopes and large contributing catchment 4 9 ha resulted in the east recharge basin filling to capacity 240 m3 8 mm depth over the fen area after every rain event exceeding 10 mm day 1 fig 3 however the capacity of the east recharge basin was easily overwhelmed as seen by frequent filling to maximum stage runoff that exceeded the basin capacity flowed across the upland and infiltrated into the lfh likely leading to water loss predominantly from soil evaporation or transpiration as opposed to groundwater recharge sutton and price 2020a given the need for parsimonious water use on the reclaimed landscape water lost as soil evaporation does not help achieve the primary reclamation objectives of supporting downgradient peatlands or contributing to the maintenance of upland forest therefore ensuring that the basin has sufficient capacity to detain all runoff is a priority although the size of the west and central basins was appropriate the east and southeast basins should have had a considerably larger capacity periodic scouring of the basins to remove sediment will not be a viable long term strategy for maintaining the efficacy of the basins however in the early post construction period when the hillslopes are producing the most runoff and have the greatest potential for erosion it could be a valuable intervention it was observed that a proportion of overland flow from the east recharge basin reached the central recharge basin where it likely further contributed to recharging the tailings sand aquifer thus suggesting the utility of successive cascading basins to capture more surface flow due to high runoff ratios from this catchment hillslope erosion introduced a considerable amount of sediment likely peat mineral mix that began to fill the east recharge basin which decreased the infiltration rate 319 to 5 mm hr 1 of the basin yet despite this reduction in infiltration capacity the detention of water behind the hummock ultimately allowed for adequate opportunity time for ponded water to infiltrate thereby recharging the aquifer figs 3 and 4 although sedimentation resulted in a decrease in basin efficacy at nfw the hillslopes integrated into the nikanotee watershed are steeper than is typically prescribed in other systems thus strategies to control erosion and sedimentation may not need to be implemented at every site for example biagi et al 2021 reported no runoff from slopes at the nearby sandhill fen watershed under any rainfall events however the propensity of a slope for runoff generation is not solely a consequence of slope grade other factors such as whether the slope converges or diverges water flow presence and density of vegetation soil moisture storage antecedent moisture and hydraulic properties of the surficial soil will also exert an influence furthermore due to the bulking factor associated with processing of surface mined oil sands whereby the volume of tailings waste exceeds the pre mined material by a factor of 1 4 mikula 2012 the closure landscape is expected to be one of greater topographic variability than the pre disturbance landscape rooney et al 2012 thus the reclaimed areas will likely need to integrate undulating topography with slopes of varying grades in contrast to the east recharge basin the small drainage area and placement of the central and west recharge basins minimized their contribution to subsurface recharge the absence of sedimentation attests to the low rate and volume of runoff entering them the central recharge basin was distant 100 m from surrounding hillslopes and isolated from upslope contributing areas however the central recharge basin did elicit responses in vwc following rainfall although this did not result in appreciable water table rise except for one rainfall event in 2015 fig 4 the size and positioning of the central recharge basin did not promote recharge to the same degree as the east recharge basin the west recharge basin situated adjacent to the relatively small and low relief west slope received very little runoff as there was no notable response in the water table directly beneath the basin fig 3 and 4 5 2 implication for na flushing and migration recharge basins had a considerable influence on the spatial distribution of na concentrations within the upland tailings sand aquifer in general freshwater recharge diluted groundwater concentrations in close proximity to and downgradient of recharge basins fig 5 however the enhanced recharge to the upland increased the flushing rates of na from the unsaturated regions of tailings sand in the vicinity below active recharge basins fig 5 which may be an undesired effect when considering the water quality transmission to downgradient ecosystems daly et al 2012 simhayov et al 2017 as a consequence of the higher hydraulic gradients instituted by the east basin recharge the downgradient fen received a greater mass of sodium overall and earlier arrival of na at the surface yet it was apparent that dilution by the relatively fresh recharge water was capable of moderating the groundwater concentrations figs 3 and 5 the east recharge basin was successful in providing recharge and kept groundwater concentrations well below 150 mg l 1 along the east region of the upland for the duration of the study furthermore there was no apparent accumulation or hotspots of na observed directly down gradient of the east recharge basin at the fen or in the transition zone at the interface between fen and upland fig 5 as such at the nfw the enhanced mobilization of na due to recharge basins is not a concern for down gradient ecosystems with vegetation species with low salt tolerance the observed change in groundwater concentration below the central or west recharge basin was minor due to the smaller quantities of freshwater recharge compared to the east recharge basin fig s 3 5 nevertheless flushing rates of na below these less active basins are still greater compared to rest of the upland as even in the absence of surface overland flow contributions bare tailings sand recharge greatly exceeded that in lfh covered areas sutton and price 2020a 5 3 recommendations for reclamation strategies this research demonstrates the disproportionate effectiveness of basins in contributing to groundwater recharge that sustains saturated conditions in the down gradient wetland removing the lfh cover soil and exposing the underlying highly permeable tailings sand was a successful intervention that promoted groundwater recharge in larger scale closure landscapes undulating topography where aquifer material outcrops in depressions could be used to promote localized recharge this could offer a variety of hydrogeomorphic settings to encourage the establishment of diverse vegetation communities sutton and price 2020b in this way areas overlain with lfh or areas that will not receive the same degree of freshwater recharge will retain solutes for longer extending the time that solutes take to arrive at down gradient systems if the interaction of freshwater with unsaturated tailings sand is undesired permeable underdrain layers of alternative materials can be extended beneath these recharge basins for example at the nfw by extending the existing petroleum coke underdrain or moving the recharge basins down gradient over the underdrain recharging water would converge in the underdrain limiting the interaction with tailings materials through a reduction in horizontal groundwater flow through tailing sand would reduce mixing with saline porewater furthermore increasing the thickness of lfh or comparable reclamation soil prescriptions across the remaining upland area would minimize the undesired mobilization of solutes that are held within the unsaturated zone of the tailings sand aquifer sutton and price 2020b while this would lengthen the time for solutes to flush from a reclaimed watershed it would decrease the peak solute concentration at the fen surface thus ameliorating the negative ecological consequences of high salinity on fen vegetation pouliot et al 2012 vitt et al 2020 recharge basins are not anticipated to maintain their efficacy in perpetuity as several processes will compromise their function as mentioned previously the runoff from the hillslopes contained large amounts of entrained sediment that was deposited in the basin this not only decreased the infiltration rate due to the hydraulic properties of the highly organic sediment but also reduced the total detention volume of the basin while the east basin maintained its function throughout the study period the detention capacity of the southeast basin was markedly reduced by sedimentation the rate of sedimentation can be partially mitigated by implementing sediment controls such as silt fencing careful selection of hillslope soil prescriptions or immediate post construction planting of vegetation selected to increase slope stability and limit erosion furthermore there may be an optimum topographic relief for hillslopes included in reclamation watersheds that reaches a compromise between runoff generation and sediment production yet this study offers limited insight into this issue as the differing morphology reclamation age hillslope size and soil prescription confound such an analysis even if sedimentation can be reduced or eliminated it is expected that hillslope surface runoff will decrease as soils evolve and vegetation develops on the slope ketcheson et al 2016 however this anticipated decrease in hillslope runoff was not observed in this study nevertheless if the appropriate topography and watershed morphology allow for it placing bare tailings basins in areas that receive surface runoff can greatly contribute to the initial saturation of upland aquifers given the importance of quickly establishing groundwater flow to fen peatlands in the early post construction period to restrict peat oxidation and support wetland vegetation recharge basins are valuable features to include in reclamation design 5 4 empirical uncertainties there are several uncertainties that should be noted in this study the average infiltration rate was calculated as a residual term within the water balance eq 2 in which no error term is explicitly considered however since the infiltration rate approaches the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the material a favorable comparison between the calculated infiltration rate and the measured hydraulic conductivity offers some validation since these were indeed similar this gives confidence to the magnitude of infiltration and recharge rates reported here infiltration rates were also corroborated by the manual single ring infiltration tests any error introduced due to the method to estimate water loss by evaporation using the fen ec tower was thought to be negligible since evaporation constituted a very small proportion of water compared to total infiltration amount although there was no mass balance between the groundwater recharge and infiltrated volume the large groundwater mound observed beneath the east recharge basin immediately following a recharge event suggests that the infiltrated volumes are reasonable 6 conclusion given the abundance and ecological value of wetlands within the undisturbed landscape of the aosr reclaiming the post mined oil sands landscape of the aosr must include ecosystems that exhibit functional similarities characteristic of fens since these systems rely on groundwater to offset water deficits accrued over the growing season reclamation strategies should include practices that enhance subsurface storage and thereby ensure the long erm sustainability of these systems this study found a recharge basin ideally positioned at the confluence of two hillslopes strongly promoted groundwater recharge that supplied 30 of the post snowmelt water to the downgradient fen reclaimed uplands that are integrated to support wetlands or other aquatic ecosystems and which are designed to promote recharge should incorporate recharge basins located accordingly these basins require a relatively small footprint thus allowing remaining upland areas to prioritize water storage for forest growth sutton and price 2020b isolated basins or those positioned next to low relief slopes albeit not as effective in promoting recharge still encourage more recharge than the surrounding lfh cover soil in the early years post construction it is essential to ensure saturated conditions within fen peatlands as the establishment of fen vegetation will be influenced by the position of the water table borkenhagen and cooper 2019 these recharge basins contribute disproportionally to the aquifer storage while simultaneously moderating variability in groundwater flow to the downgradient peatland this is especially valuable during dry years when the maintenance of the water table near the surface of the fen is predominantly a consequence of groundwater contributions from the upland enhanced groundwater recharge also increased the mobility of solutes found in the process affected tailings sand which must be considered when incorporating recharge basins into the reclaimed landscape however due to dilution the higher rate of na flushing from recharge basins was deemed an acceptable compromise however further research will be needed to identify whether the current mass flux rate affects the development of the wetland vegetation species in the fen with time as reclaimed hillslopes transition from water conveyance to water storage features ketcheson et al 2016 and the detention and infiltration capacity of the basins decreases due to sedimentation the efficacy of the recharge basins will likely diminish investigation of the longevity and future role of these recharge features is recommended credit authorship contribution statement eric d kessel

8109,study region a peatland watershed was constructed on a post mined oil sands lease in northern alberta canada with the intention of replicating the function of natural wetlands removed by surface mining study focus given the potential for moisture limited conditions due to the sub humid regional climate ensuring sufficient water availability in these landscapes is a principal concern this research demonstrates how small recharge basins can modify the hydrology to promote groundwater recharge critical for sustaining saturated conditions in a downgradient wetland new hydrological insights for the region location was important in determining the efficacy of recharge basins specifically basins placed at the confluence of two hillslopes detained substantial volumes of runoff due to large upslope areas contributing 30 of the groundwater budget to the fen while only occupying 1 of the upland area basins situated near low relief hillslopes or altogether isolated from a hillslope did not detain appreciable runoff and therefore had a minor role in recharging groundwater groundwater in the vicinity and downgradient of active recharge basins had considerably lower solute concentrations because of dilution this suggests that basins can not only enhance recharge within engineered landscapes providing a consistent and focused supply of water to upland aquifers but offer relatively fresh groundwater to downgradient ecosystems this could ameliorate the impact of high salinity present in oil sands process affected materials keywords recharge basins reclamation oil sands

price et al 2010 the potential of depressional features to enhance recharge and redistribute salts must be evaluated recent investigations into the geochemical conditions generated by tailings sand materials in a reclaimed landscape have been reported by simhayov et al 2017 and kessel et al 2018 yet the role of system design and materials on recharge and transport processes responsible for the redistribution of na within such constructed upland fen systems are undocumented and poorly understood therefore the primary objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the efficacy of recharge basins on groundwater recharge 2 assess the optimal geometry size and shape and positioning of the recharge basins necessary to maximize recharge and 3 determine the implications for enhanced recharge on preferential flushing of na within the tailings sand upland the findings from this study will further contribute to the growing body of literature on techniques to aid in the reclamation of the post mined oil sands landscape specifically this work will inform reclamation practitioners and mine operators of the value of surface flow detention structures in creating upland landforms with more consistent hydrologic behavior that can efficiently partition water to groundwater recharge 2 study site 2 1 constructed tailings sand upland nfw is a constructed upland fen system situated on an oil sands mine lease 56 55 94 n 111 25 04 w 25 km north of fort mcmurray alberta nfw was designed with the aid of modeling that indicated the requisite morphology to maintain an adequate water supply to the fen under the periods of water stress that occur frequently in the aosr daly et al 2012 price et al 2010 the upland consists of a 3 m tailings sand aquifer overlain by a 0 3 0 5 m layer of lfh mineral mix herein referred to as lfh an over stripped forest floor soil commonly used in oil sands reclamation naeth et al 2013 sutton and price 2020a the upland and fen are underlain by an impermeable geosynthetic clay liner on a 3 grade that establishes a hydraulic gradient towards the fen and vastly reduces percolation losses to the regional groundwater flow system the fen peat is underlain by a highly permeable petroleum coke underdrain layer 0 5 m thick that projects 100 m upslope beneath the tailings sand upland a subregion of the upland herein referred to as the transition zone shaded area in fig 1 the entire upland fen system 10 6 ha fig 1 is situated in a much larger reclaimed watershed 32 1 ha composed of four primary hillslopes the west 2 4 ha and southeast 8 4 ha hillslopes were reclaimed in 2011 and had immature and relatively sparse vegetation communities at the time of this study the east 8 1 ha hillslope was reclaimed and planted in 2007 and had developed a substantial vegetation cover the southeast and west slopes were found to generate considerable runoff during rainfall events that flowed over the upland some of which infiltrated and contributed to the groundwater that sustains the fen ketcheson and price 2016a the south hillslope is an undisturbed hillslope which despite the steep relief does not contribute to upland recharge due to its small size dense vegetation undisturbed soil and position with respect to the geosynthetic clay liner ketcheson and price 2016a several meso scale raised landforms 10 100 m width by 1 m height were incorporated within the upland in which tailings sand was piled and capped 20 cm with lfh reclamation soil similar to the surrounding upland over the 2013 season these raised landforms herein referred to as hummocks detained and trapped a small amount of overland flow behind their upslope side however this water did not notably enhance recharge compared to the surrounding upland because the lfh that covered all upland areas had a relatively low infiltration capacity and high water holding capacity ketcheson 2016 sutton and price 2020a thus in late august 2013 several modifications were made to the configuration of the upland with the intention of promoting groundwater recharge first a bulldozer equipped with a ripper shank was used to till furrows furrow dimension typically approximately 24 cm wide 10 cm deep with 85 cm spacing ketcheson 2016 to retain overland flow increase water detention and thus infiltration second the lfh on the upslope side of the hummocks was excavated to expose the tailings sand the excavated soil material was placed at each end of the hummocks thereby extending them to further increase their detention capacity the resulting depressional features 30 50 cm deep herein referred to as recharge basins fig 2 were capable of detaining much larger volumes of overland flow and effectively increased the percolation to the tailings sand aquifer by removing the lfh reclamation soil a total of four recharge basins were added the east area 700 m2 central 450 m2 west 400 m2 and southeast 100 m2 recharge basins fig 1 in the several growing seasons post construction hillslope runoff from the southeast slope during heavy rainfall resulted in substantial fine grained materials transported into the east and southeast recharge basins forming a 20 30 cm cap across both basins 3 methods the study was conducted during the snow free periods of may to october for 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 as shown by early field observations the east recharge basin received the most surface runoff and therefore was chosen for the most detailed monitoring and instrumentation 3 1 instrumentation and hydrological monitoring in addition to the monitoring network of wells and piezometers within the upland and fen described in detail by kessel et al 2018 additional monitoring locations 2 25 2 75 m below ground surface bgs were instrumented within the east and southeast recharge basin in may 2014 monitoring wells and piezometers 2 75 m bgs were instrumented in the central and west recharge basins in may 2015 all groundwater wells had fully slotted intakes with depth ranging 2 6 3 7 m bgs piezometers had a 0 2 m slotted intake centered around their installation depth water tables were automatically recorded with water level loggers or pressure transducers dataflow systems ltd odyssey capacitance water level logger schlumberger limited mini diver onset hobo u20 manual measurements of hydraulic head were performed every 5 to 7 days to validate all autologging water levels initially in may and june 2014 an incremented rod was installed to monitor pond height stage within the east recharge basin but was replaced by a fully slotted standpipe with water level logger in july 2014 which recorded stage at 15 minute intervals the stage accurately monitored ponded water within the recharge basin only when it was above a threshold capacity of 10 cm due to the minimum height required for the water level logger detailed stage measurements were quality assured by field observations and manual measurements of pond depth in may 2013 two vertical soil moisture profiles were instrumented within the variably saturated layer of the tailings sand aquifer one in the south end of the upland and the other in the center of the upland 15 m downslope of the central recharge basin these are herein referred to as the south and central upland vwc stations respectively fig 1 soil moisture profiles consisted of 8 dielectric impedance reflectometry soil moisture probes stevens water monitoring systems inc hydra ii four within the lfh soil cap and four within the underlying tailings sand typically at depths of 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 40 m and 0 50 0 60 1 00 1 50 m bgs respectively probe depths varied slightly depending on lfh layer thicknesses in may 2015 the east and central recharge basin were instrumented with similar vertical soil moisture profiles within the variably saturated tailings sand two soil moisture profiles were instrumented in the east recharge basin 10 m apart and consisted of 5 and 3 sensors at 0 05 0 25 0 40 0 60

taylor approach discussed later based on data from the fen meteorological station which was assumed to be most representative of open water evaporation to simulate the evaporative loss of the ponded

3 2 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were taken periodically from monitoring wells and piezometers within the recharge basins and surrounding upland throughout the duration of the study period several grab samples were also taken from the water ponded within the recharge basins following large rain events 24 hr period 10 mm all samples were stored at 4 c until being passed through a 0 45 µm

orion star a329 ph conductivity portable multiparameter meter at the time of retrieval in the field 3 3 soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties including particle size distribution porosity and infiltration capacity for upland lfh and tailings sands are reported in ketcheson 2016 single ring constant head infiltration tests were conducted using 5 cm inner diameter steel rings for tailings sands within all four recharge basins infiltration tests within the east and southeast recharge basins included tests in which the fine material over wash sediments were excavated to expose the tailings sand due to the negligible surface overland flow into the central and west recharge basins there was little to no introduction of fine sediments therefore no excavation was necessary and infiltration tests were simply conducted on the bare tailings sand additional single ring infiltration tests were conducted on the fine grained over wash material within the east recharge basin 3 4 recharge basin capacity and infiltration volumes recharge volumes were calculated for only the east recharge basin given its frequent filling with runoff the stage ponding water depth versus bathymetry volume and infiltration area is documented in appendix a fig a1 change in volume over time dv dt of ponded water within the east recharge basin was determined by a water balance approach 1 dv dt p r in et f out where p is precipitation mm hr 1 r is runoff into the basin mm hr 1 et is evaporation of open water mm hr 1 and f is the infiltration rate mm hr 1 et was estimated using the priestley taylor available energy approach for equilibrium evapotranspiration which applies an alpha of 1 0 to closely estimate the evaporation for open water priestley and taylor 1972 given that there were no hydrometeorological measurements made above the recharge basins net radiation and ground heat flux from the fen meteorological tower were used instead which appropriately reflects the atmospheric and surface conditions of the recharge basins scarlett et al 2017 a base infiltration rate f mm hr 1 for the recharge basin was approximated by back calculating eq 1 during periods of infiltration only high intensity rainfall events 10 mm hr 1 resulted in rapid filling of the recharge basin immediately after the basin was filled p and r following the rainfall event can be assumed to equal zero and 2 f et dv dt finally the cumulative infiltrated volume of water through a recharge basin was the summation of the product of f and the period of ponding for each time step δt 15 min such that 3 total volume infiltrated i 1 f i t i 1 t i based on evidence from the field it was assumed that a single basin capacity infiltrated through each recharge basin immediately following snowmelt not included in the study period ketcheson and price 2016b sutton and price 2020a which was included in each total seasonal recharge volume by this method it was determined that the total basin capacity of the east recharge basin was 240 m3 which equates to 5 mm of r from the east southeast slope sub catchment 4 9 ha 4 results 4 1 hydrological context of recharge basins a total of 254 193 126 and 222 mm of p were received between 17 may and 24 august in the 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 study periods respectively p in all seasons was dominated by infrequent but high intensity 24 hr period 10 mm events fig 3 following p events that exceeded this intensity the east recharge basin was observed to fill within 15 min of peak rainfall as a consequence of r from the east southeast slope confluence 4 9 ha once filled the ponded water spilled out around the edges of the raised hummock continuing as overland flow towards the fen largely intercepted by the aforementioned furrows some p events were not received in a single period of continuous rainfall but could span over 24 48 hour periods resulting in partial re filling of the east recharge basin illustrated by the saw tooth pattern in the ponded water level stage hydrograph fig 3 the infiltration rate f for the exposed tailings sand in recharge basins averaged 319 mm hr 1 sample size n for the east central and west recharge basin is 3 9 and 6 respectively which was higher than reported for the lfh upland soil cover using the same method average of 66 mm hr 1 ketcheson 2016 and within an order of magnitude of the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of the tailings sand aquifer 4 m day or 167 mm hr 1 sutton et al submitted recharge basins experienced stronger increases in vwc in the underlying tailings sand compared to that in tailings sands of the surrounding upland overlain by lfh fig 4 vwc within the tailings sand layers 0 05 and 0 60 m bgs in the east and central recharge basins responded to rainfall events greater than 10 and 15 mm day 1 for each respective basin the water table in the east recharge basin was shallower ranging 0 60 and 1 90 m bgs between 2014 and 2016 and responded to these events fig 4 the water table beneath the central recharge basin was deeper 2 60 m bgs and did not appear to respond to any early season infiltration events fig 4 following the larger rainfall events that elicited large water table rise under the east recharge basin no comparable water table responses 0 2 m rise were recorded in the lfh covered south and central upland sites fig 4 c and d periods of ponding within the recharge basins resulted in prolonged elevated vwc in the tailings sand persisting above field capacity for 20 days following large rainfall events fig 4 relatively dry periods between large rainfall events 2 to 3 weeks resulted in vwc returning to a residual water content 0 10 at all locations and the mounded water tables beneath the recharge basins to dissipate the east recharge basin received the most overland flow of all the recharge basins within the upland having ponded water present for 27 23 and 30 of the 2014 2015 and 2016 study periods respectively fig 3 compared to the central recharge basin which was ponded for less than 5 of both seasons for the east recharge basin periods of ponding typically persisted for 5 to 12 days except for a period of prolonged ponding for 15 days in 2015 due to successive rain events refilling the basin fig 3 cumulative infiltrated volumes through the east recharge basin were 1308 928 and 1506 m3 45 32 and 52 mm with respect to the fen area in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 4 high overland flow rates from the southeast slope which fed the east recharge basin resulted in a fine grained material outwash that covered the entire basin the value of f estimated by the measured change in ponded water levels within the east recharge basin ranged from 2 to 12 mm hr 1 mean of 8 0 mm hr 1 which was reasonably close to the value approximated by single ring infiltration tests mean of 4 6 mm hr 1 sample size of 3 not shown 4 2 groundwater geochemistry groundwater ec and na concentrations within the tailings sand aquifer had a strong linear relationship fig a2 and suggests ec is a good indicator of na concentrations na concentrations in the upland groundwater were uniformly high 200 mg l 1 throughout the tailings sand aquifer in 2013 prior to the addition of recharge basins fig 5 after the addition of recharge basins groundwater concentrations rapidly decreased beneath the east recharge basin 100 mg l 1 figs 3 and 5 in 2015 groundwater ec and na were relatively high before any ponding or response at the water table occurred with mean concentrations of 2390 µs cm 1 and 140 mg l 1 respectively decreasing considerably to below 1072 µs cm 1 and 46 mg l 1 below the east recharge basin immediately following ponding and percolation groundwater concentrations remained relatively low below the east basin for the remaining portion of 2015 seasons fig 5 with similar patterns repeating in 2016 fig 3 comparable decreases in na concentrations in groundwater were observed downgradient of the east recharge basin along the east side of the upland fig 5 ec within the tailings sand aquifer below the central recharge basin remained relatively high average 2690 µs cm 1 throughout 2015 until a stark decrease to below 1300 µs cm 1 late in the growing season following a slight rise in water table fig 3 ec in groundwater beneath the west recharge basin did not decrease throughout 2015 remaining well above 2500 µs cm 1 fig 3 ec remained high beneath the central and west recharge basins throughout 2016 fig 3 5 discussion 5 1 recharge basins as recharge windows water availability is a primary concern when constructing a wetland within a sub humid region where potential evapotranspiration generally exceeds precipitation as is the case in the aosr price et al 2010 devito et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2017 this potential moisture limitation must be managed intentionally through landscape design to ensure that water is partitioned and distributed efficiently in all four years studied 2013 2016 nfw aet from the fen was greater than p kessel et al 2018 most notable was the large water deficit in the study period in 2015 p aet 30 for periods 17 may to 27 august 2015 which led to particularly dry conditions throughout the nfw and an advance of high na concentrations beneath the fen fig 5 the east recharge basin had prolonged ponding fig 3 and table 1 a persistent response in vwc fig 4 and pronounced mounding in the proximal water table fig 3 when compared to the central or west basins the east basin was clearly the most successful in contributing groundwater recharge to the tailing sand aquifer the recharge volumes calculated for the east recharge basin were 25 17 and 33 of the fen groundwater inflow component q fen as calculated by ketcheson et al 2017 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively table 1 given the very small area of the east recharge basin relative to the rest of the upland 0 9 these contributions scale to it being 22 53 times more effective at recharging the aquifer than the surrounding areas of upland overlain by lfh 98 0 of the area the efficacy of the basin can be partly attributed to the large upslope catchment that contributed to this basin 4 9 ha but perhaps of even greater consequence was the topography of the east and southeast hillslopes that converged flow into the confluence thus providing limited opportunities for infiltration as the water moved downslope importantly the topographic relief of the hillslopes did not appear to correlate with the propensity for runoff generation as the west hillslope that produced negligible quantities of overland flow had the same grade as the southeast slope 19 and a slightly steeper grade than the east slope 15 the position of this basin at the toe of the confluence between the east and southeast hillslopes and large contributing catchment 4 9 ha resulted in the east recharge basin filling to capacity 240 m3 8 mm depth over the fen area after every rain event exceeding 10 mm day 1 fig 3 however the capacity of the east recharge basin was easily overwhelmed as seen by frequent filling to maximum stage runoff that exceeded the basin capacity flowed across the upland and infiltrated into the lfh likely leading to water loss predominantly from soil evaporation or transpiration as opposed to groundwater recharge sutton and price 2020a given the need for parsimonious water use on the reclaimed landscape water lost as soil evaporation does not help achieve the primary reclamation objectives of supporting downgradient peatlands or contributing to the maintenance of upland forest therefore ensuring that the basin has sufficient capacity to detain all runoff is a priority although the size of the west and central basins was appropriate the east and southeast basins should have had a considerably larger capacity periodic scouring of the basins to remove sediment will not be a viable long term strategy for maintaining the efficacy of the basins however in the early post construction period when the hillslopes are producing the most runoff and have the greatest potential for erosion it could be a valuable intervention it was observed that a proportion of overland flow from the east recharge basin reached the central recharge basin where it likely further contributed to recharging the tailings sand aquifer thus suggesting the utility of successive cascading basins to capture more surface flow due to high runoff ratios from this catchment hillslope erosion introduced a considerable amount of sediment likely peat mineral mix that began to fill the east recharge basin which decreased the infiltration rate 319 to 5 mm hr 1 of the basin yet despite this reduction in infiltration capacity the detention of water behind the hummock ultimately allowed for adequate opportunity time for ponded water to infiltrate thereby recharging the aquifer figs 3 and 4 although sedimentation resulted in a decrease in basin efficacy at nfw the hillslopes integrated into the nikanotee watershed are steeper than is typically prescribed in other systems thus strategies to control erosion and sedimentation may not need to be implemented at every site for example biagi et al 2021 reported no runoff from slopes at the nearby sandhill fen watershed under any rainfall events however the propensity of a slope for runoff generation is not solely a consequence of slope grade other factors such as whether the slope converges or diverges water flow presence and density of vegetation soil moisture storage antecedent moisture and hydraulic properties of the surficial soil will also exert an influence furthermore due to the bulking factor associated with processing of surface mined oil sands whereby the volume of tailings waste exceeds the pre mined material by a factor of 1 4 mikula 2012 the closure landscape is expected to be one of greater topographic variability than the pre disturbance landscape rooney et al 2012 thus the reclaimed areas will likely need to integrate undulating topography with slopes of varying grades in contrast to the east recharge basin the small drainage area and placement of the central and west recharge basins minimized their contribution to subsurface recharge the absence of sedimentation attests to the low rate and volume of runoff entering them the central recharge basin was distant 100 m from surrounding hillslopes and isolated from upslope contributing areas however the central recharge basin did elicit responses in vwc following rainfall although this did not result in appreciable water table rise except for one rainfall event in 2015 fig 4 the size and positioning of the central recharge basin did not promote recharge to the same degree as the east recharge basin the west recharge basin situated adjacent to the relatively small and low relief west slope received very little runoff as there was no notable response in the water table directly beneath the basin fig 3 and 4 5 2 implication for na flushing and migration recharge basins had a considerable influence on the spatial distribution of na concentrations within the upland tailings sand aquifer in general freshwater recharge diluted groundwater concentrations in close proximity to and downgradient of recharge basins fig 5 however the enhanced recharge to the upland increased the flushing rates of na from the unsaturated regions of tailings sand in the vicinity below active recharge basins fig 5 which may be an undesired effect when considering the water quality transmission to downgradient ecosystems daly et al 2012 simhayov et al 2017 as a consequence of the higher hydraulic gradients instituted by the east basin recharge the downgradient fen received a greater mass of sodium overall and earlier arrival of na at the surface yet it was apparent that dilution by the relatively fresh recharge water was capable of moderating the groundwater concentrations figs 3 and 5 the east recharge basin was successful in providing recharge and kept groundwater concentrations well below 150 mg l 1 along the east region of the upland for the duration of the study furthermore there was no apparent accumulation or hotspots of na observed directly down gradient of the east recharge basin at the fen or in the transition zone at the interface between fen and upland fig 5 as such at the nfw the enhanced mobilization of na due to recharge basins is not a concern for down gradient ecosystems with vegetation species with low salt tolerance the observed change in groundwater concentration below the central or west recharge basin was minor due to the smaller quantities of freshwater recharge compared to the east recharge basin fig s 3 5 nevertheless flushing rates of na below these less active basins are still greater compared to rest of the upland as even in the absence of surface overland flow contributions bare tailings sand recharge greatly exceeded that in lfh covered areas sutton and price 2020a 5 3 recommendations for reclamation strategies this research demonstrates the disproportionate effectiveness of basins in contributing to groundwater recharge that sustains saturated conditions in the down gradient wetland removing the lfh cover soil and exposing the underlying highly permeable tailings sand was a successful intervention that promoted groundwater recharge in larger scale closure landscapes undulating topography where aquifer material outcrops in depressions could be used to promote localized recharge this could offer a variety of hydrogeomorphic settings to encourage the establishment of diverse vegetation communities sutton and price 2020b in this way areas overlain with lfh or areas that will not receive the same degree of freshwater recharge will retain solutes for longer extending the time that solutes take to arrive at down gradient systems if the interaction of freshwater with unsaturated tailings sand is undesired permeable underdrain layers of alternative materials can be extended beneath these recharge basins for example at the nfw by extending the existing petroleum coke underdrain or moving the recharge basins down gradient over the underdrain recharging water would converge in the underdrain limiting the interaction with tailings materials through a reduction in horizontal groundwater flow through tailing sand would reduce mixing with saline porewater furthermore increasing the thickness of lfh or comparable reclamation soil prescriptions across the remaining upland area would minimize the undesired mobilization of solutes that are held within the unsaturated zone of the tailings sand aquifer sutton and price 2020b while this would lengthen the time for solutes to flush from a reclaimed watershed it would decrease the peak solute concentration at the fen surface thus ameliorating the negative ecological consequences of high salinity on fen vegetation pouliot et al 2012 vitt et al 2020 recharge basins are not anticipated to maintain their efficacy in perpetuity as several processes will compromise their function as mentioned previously the runoff from the hillslopes contained large amounts of entrained sediment that was deposited in the basin this not only decreased the infiltration rate due to the hydraulic properties of the highly organic sediment but also reduced the total detention volume of the basin while the east basin maintained its function throughout the study period the detention capacity of the southeast basin was markedly reduced by sedimentation the rate of sedimentation can be partially mitigated by implementing sediment controls such as silt fencing careful selection of hillslope soil prescriptions or immediate post construction planting of vegetation selected to increase slope stability and limit erosion furthermore there may be an optimum topographic relief for hillslopes included in reclamation watersheds that reaches a compromise between runoff generation and sediment production yet this study offers limited insight into this issue as the differing morphology reclamation age hillslope size and soil prescription confound such an analysis even if sedimentation can be reduced or eliminated it is expected that hillslope surface runoff will decrease as soils evolve and vegetation develops on the slope ketcheson et al 2016 however this anticipated decrease in hillslope runoff was not observed in this study nevertheless if the appropriate topography and watershed morphology allow for it placing bare tailings basins in areas that receive surface runoff can greatly contribute to the initial saturation of upland aquifers given the importance of quickly establishing groundwater flow to fen peatlands in the early post construction period to restrict peat oxidation and support wetland vegetation recharge basins are valuable features to include in reclamation design 5 4 empirical uncertainties there are several uncertainties that should be noted in this study the average infiltration rate was calculated as a residual term within the water balance eq 2 in which no error term is explicitly considered however since the infiltration rate approaches the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the material a favorable comparison between the calculated infiltration rate and the measured hydraulic conductivity offers some validation since these were indeed similar this gives confidence to the magnitude of infiltration and recharge rates reported here infiltration rates were also corroborated by the manual single ring infiltration tests any error introduced due to the method to estimate water loss by evaporation using the fen ec tower was thought to be negligible since evaporation constituted a very small proportion of water compared to total infiltration amount although there was no mass balance between the groundwater recharge and infiltrated volume the large groundwater mound observed beneath the east recharge basin immediately following a recharge event suggests that the infiltrated volumes are reasonable 6 conclusion given the abundance and ecological value of wetlands within the undisturbed landscape of the aosr reclaiming the post mined oil sands landscape of the aosr must include ecosystems that exhibit functional similarities characteristic of fens since these systems rely on groundwater to offset water deficits accrued over the growing season reclamation strategies should include practices that enhance subsurface storage and thereby ensure the long erm sustainability of these systems this study found a recharge basin ideally positioned at the confluence of two hillslopes strongly promoted groundwater recharge that supplied 30 of the post snowmelt water to the downgradient fen reclaimed uplands that are integrated to support wetlands or other aquatic ecosystems and which are designed to promote recharge should incorporate recharge basins located accordingly these basins require a relatively small footprint thus allowing remaining upland areas to prioritize water storage for forest growth sutton and price 2020b isolated basins or those positioned next to low relief slopes albeit not as effective in promoting recharge still encourage more recharge than the surrounding lfh cover soil in the early years post construction it is essential to ensure saturated conditions within fen peatlands as the establishment of fen vegetation will be influenced by the position of the water table borkenhagen and cooper 2019 these recharge basins contribute disproportionally to the aquifer storage while simultaneously moderating variability in groundwater flow to the downgradient peatland this is especially valuable during dry years when the maintenance of the water table near the surface of the fen is predominantly a consequence of groundwater contributions from the upland enhanced groundwater recharge also increased the mobility of solutes found in the process affected tailings sand which must be considered when incorporating recharge basins into the reclaimed landscape however due to dilution the higher rate of na flushing from recharge basins was deemed an acceptable compromise however further research will be needed to identify whether the current mass flux rate affects the development of the wetland vegetation species in the fen with time as reclaimed hillslopes transition from water conveyance to water storage features ketcheson et al 2016 and the detention and infiltration capacity of the basins decreases due to sedimentation the efficacy of the recharge basins will likely diminish investigation of the longevity and future role of these recharge features is recommended credit authorship contribution statement eric d kessel

global positioning system leica geosystems viva gs14 gnss rtk gps was used to survey the land surface of the east recharge basin masl 0 5 cm vertical accuracy the bathymetry was used to determine the area of infiltration and basin volume as a function of pond stage fig a1 ec vs na groundwater concentrations the relationship between ec and na groundwater concentrations for beneath the east central and west recharge basins are near linear relationships for each respective location indicating only groundwater dilution and no other geochemical reactions are occurring however the linear relationship was different for beneath each basin due to the geochemical variability in the tailings sand aquifer fig a2
