composite membranes with fine hierarchical nanostructure were facilely fabricated by intercalation with 1d carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts cooh into 2d graphene oxide go nanosheets for efficient organic wastewater treatment by characterization results of xrd raman ftir tem and water contact angle mwcnts cooh was successfully to be intercalated into go lamellar interlayers with grafting reactions which would improve water permeated flux and stability of membrane the influences of go cnts ratios loading amounts cnts types and support types on the membrane separation performance were systematically investigated towards methylene blue dye solution for the go cnts composite membranes prepared under the optimized conditions the permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection over 99 7 were obtained towards methylene blue solutions under the transmembrane pressure difference of 0 9 bar respectively compared with pristine go membrane it exhibited a nearly 10 fold water permeated flux improvement meanwhile maintaining high rejection moreover the electrostatic interaction and size exclusion effects were synergistically contributed to be responsible for the efficiently separation properties of the go cnts membranes towards different positively negatively charged dyes and neutral organic molecules such the go cnts membranes also exhibited good chemical stability for acid resistance with highly efficient separation performance keywords graphene oxide carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes membrane separation wastewater chemical stability 1 introduction graphene oxide go is a typical two dimensional material which is composed of hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups recently it has attracted much attention in membrane separation field due to the presence of abundant oxygen containing functional groups on the go surface 1 3 therefore as a type of novel membrane materials go based membranes are reported in a widely range of application for gas separation organic solvents dehydration desalination etc 4 11 however pristine go membrane is mainly maintained by hydrogen bond between oxygen containing functional groups hydrogen bonds are easily destroyed due to hydration effect in aqueous solution 12 and then d spacing between go lamellar interlayers is increased 9 thus leading to a significant nanochannels expansion in pristine go membrane with lower rejection performance even so pristine go membrane exhibited fairly water permeated flux during the nanofiltration processes especially for dyes wastewater treatment 3 5 generally dyes wastewater is composed of many toxic compounds e g acid alkali salt and other intermediates that are difficult to treat with conventional methods which also has a great influence on pristine go membrane 5 therefore it is urgent to prepare a go based membrane with high water permeability and favorable stability for the efficient treatment of dye wastewater with complex components two approaches had been proposed by some researchers to fabricate go based membranes with high separation performance and enhanced stability 13 19 on the one hand covalent modification is considered to be a controllable approach to adjust d spacing of go membranes for example hung et al 13 prepared graphene oxide framework gof membranes by go nanosheets cross linking with chosen diamine monomers such as ethylenediamine butylenediamine and p phenylenediamine which were expected to improve water permeability as a result these gof membranes exhibited d spacing of 0 91 0 97 and 1 01 nm in the dry state and in the wetting state of 0 93 0 99 and 2 09 nm respectively meanwhile the d spacing of pristine go membrane increased from 0 85 dry state to 1 31 nm in the wetting process on the other hand chemical intercalation is also advocated to be a controllable method to enhance membrane stability wang et al 15 reported that zero dimensional carbon quantum dots were combined into the gaps between go nanosheets to fabricate go composite membranes with adjustable permeability gao et al 16 firstly fabricated ultra thin go membranes by the intercalation of one dimensional 1d single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts into go layers it would expand the nanochannels of water transport which showed water permeance as high as 660 720 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 han et al 17 also developed a novel high flux go nanofiltration membrane intercalated by multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts which would expand the interlayer space and enhance antifouling performance this go mwcnts membrane displayed water permeance up to 11 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was 2 times that of go membrane despite these reported go cnts composite membranes shows high water flux and good separation performance there are still no significant binding forces between cnts and go nanosheets the chemical stability of go cnts composite membrane especially the resistance to acid base environment is crucially required for membrane application in dyes wastewater treatment recently we successfully prepared go attapulgite composite membranes by incorporating 1d natural attapulgite nanorods into go layers to form stable c o si bonds via grafting modification it significantly enhanced stability and water permeability of 13 3 l m 2 h 1 towards rhodamine b dye wastewater 5 moreover the relationships of preparation parameters and separation properties even separation mechanism for dye wastewater treatment remain unclear for these go cnts membranes which will be to better understand the effects of cnts intercalating to go membrane on the d spacing membrane microstructure permeability and even stability 19 20 herein we construct three dimensional go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance and stability by intercalation with 1d mwcnts cooh into go nanosheets via grafting reactions for highly efficient treatment of organic wastewater the influence of synthesis parameters such as go cnts ratios loading amounts cnts types and support types on separation performance were systematically investigated the separation mechanism and stability go cnts composite membranes towards organic wastewater treatment were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of go cnts composite membranes as shown in fig 1 go nanosheets jcgo 99 1 2 purity 99 thickness of 0 8 1 2 nm diameter of 1 5 μm nanjing jcnano were dispersed in deionized water followed by ultrasonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous 0 02 g l 1 solution then appropriate carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes powder mwcnts cooh purity 95 out diameter of 30 50 nm length of 10 20 μm aladdin was added in the go suspension and vigorously stirred for 2 h to promote the grafting reaction and ensure go nanosheets intercalated by mwcnts cooh at room temperature finally the resulting go cnts composite suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm cr21giii hitachi japan and washed with deionized water repeatedly the products dried at 60 c for the following characterization and membrane fabrication the go cnts composite membrane was prepared by 5 ml of the go cnts suspensions through polycarbonate filters pc isopore gttp02500 diameter of 25 mm average pore size of 0 22 μm millipore using a vacuum filtration assembly which was described in details elsewhere 5 the thickness of go cnts separation layer is easily controlled by adjusting the filtration volume of the added go cnts suspensions also called go cnts composite loading amounts then go cnts membrane was washed carefully with deionized water and dried in vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h for comparison the same process was adopted to fabricate pristine go membrane a series of pristine go and go cnts membranes with the same loading about 0 1 mg go amount were fabricated with different go contents from 0 1 to 1 0 which correspondingly noted as gox cntsy membrane go cnts x y wt x y 100 to investigate the effect of cnts types on the membrane separation performance mwcnts cooh was replaced with other three types of cnts to fabricate go20 cnts80 composite membrane with the same loading amounts mwcnts hydroxylated mwcnts mwcnts oh and aminated mwcnts mwcnts nh2 all the cnts purchased from aladdin showed the out diameter of about 50 nm and the length of 10 20 μm respectively similarly to examine the influence of porous support types on the membrane separation performance polypropylene pp pore size of 220 nm and anodic aluminum oxide aao pore size of 200 nm disk filters purchased from millipore was replaced with pc support to prepare go20 cnts80 composite membrane with the same procedure 2 2 characterization the chemical composition and structure of samples were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv x ray diffractometer equipped with the cu kα source 40 kv 20 ma λ 0 15418 nm and raman spectroscopy jobin yvon labram hr spectrometer the sample morphologies were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi su 8020 and transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 2100 the zeta potential and static water contact angle of go based membranes were analyzed using a zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer nano zs and contact angle measurement instrument shanghai zhongchen digital technical apparatus jc2000c2 respectively thermogravimetry tg analysis was conducted a perkin elmer instrument diamond tg dta 6300 with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under n2 flow 2 3 separation performance tests the separation performance of the as prepared go cnts composite membranes were measured by a self designed dead end filtration device with different charged dyes and neutral organic molecules solutions at room temperature 5 also shown in fig s1 the effective filtration area was about 2 83 cm2 and the transmembrane pressure difference was kept at about 0 9 bar by a r300 type vacuum pump the pure water flux was measured when it was steady after 1 h of filtration after switch to organic solutions for more than 12 h to eliminate the adsorption effect of organic solutes the permeated flux was determined with 30 ml organic solution during the fixed operating time of 1 h all the results of membrane separation performance in this work are the average values obtained by more than three measurements to ensure reproducibility the permeated water flux j l m 2 h 1 and rejection rate rej of these membranes were evaluated for separation performance by the following equations 1 j v at 2 rej 1 c p c f 100 where v is the permeate volume l collected over a period time t h a is the effective membrane area m2 cp and cf are the solution concentration of dye and organic molecules in the permeate and feed side respectively uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis jasco v 750 and total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc vcph were used to evaluate the organic solute concentrations for these separating systems through go cnts composite membranes positively charged dyes of methylene blue meb and rhodamine b rhb negatively charged dyes of evans blue eb and methyl blue mb were ar grade which was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent of china sucrose and d glucose were also a r grade from aladdin unless otherwise stated the membrane separation performance was evaluated with 7 5 mg l 1 meb dye solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of go cnts ratios compared with pristine go membrane of 7 0 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 2 the pure water flux firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing go contents for the go cnts composite membranes for example the average flux of 8 1 16 5 8 8 and 2 2 l m 2 h 1 was obtained for go10 cnts90 go20 cnts80 go40 cnts60 and go80 cnts20 composite membranes respectively similarly although all the rejection ratios were over 99 0 for these go cnts membranes there were the same trends for permeated flux towards meb dye solutions as the go contents increased the permeated flux showed a promoting increase and then decreased rapidly the highest permeated flux of go20 cnts80 membrane 12 3 l m 2 h 1 i e 13 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was over 3 times higher than that of pristine go membrane 3 7 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection remained changeless over 99 2 in the meb solutions it was also obviously higher than those of most go mwcnts or common nf membranes 17 meanwhile the permeated flux of go80 cnts20 membrane was reduced by 86 5 compared to that of pristine go membrane it might be attributed to the microstructure and surface hydrophilicity for these go cnts membranes except for the broad characteristic diffraction peak of pc supports at 2θ 17 00 as shown in fig 3 a pristine go membrane exhibited a typical peak at 2θ 10 08 21 and pure mwcnts cooh membrane displayed a dominant peak at about 25 96 corresponding to the crystal plane 002 of cnts 22 the cnts typical diffraction peak gradually disappeared with increasing go contents for these go cnts composite membranes while the intensity of go characteristic diffraction peak gradually increased with the go cnts ratios moreover all the go typical peaks of these go cnts composite membranes were slightly less than that of pristine go 10 08 thus the d spacing or interlayer spacing of these go based membranes were calculated by the bragg s equation 2dsinθ nλ as shown in fig 3 b the corresponding d spacing of pristine go membrane was 0 878 nm meanwhile those of all the go cnts composite membranes were unexpectedly decreased slightly as 0 850 nm unchanged with increasing go contents it implicates the microstructures of cnts intercalated go membranes are well preserved with that of go lamellar layers which is agreement with other reports 16 therefore it didn t seem to be increased for the d spacing via the incorporation of cnts into the interlayers of go lamellar nanosheets in this work which was different with the go attapulgite membranes 5 it suggested that some interactions occurred between go and mwcnts cooh during the cnts intercalation process for these go cnts membranes the lateral size of go nanosheets is smaller than the length of mwcnts cooh while larger than the out diameter of mwcnts cooh 30 50 nm consequently go sheets would parcel the mwcnts cooh to form 3d hierarchical nanostructure and then establish the water channels for fast transport via grafting modification reaction fig 1 the raman spectra of pure mwcnts cooh pristine go and go cnts composite membranes shown in fig 3 c were also verified to some extent the intercalation of mwcnts cooh into the stacked go lamellar layers the values of i d i g which are calculated by the intensity ratio of d bands 1340 cm 1 and g bands 1600 cm 1 ordinarily determine the degree of graphitized structure for carbon materials 5 21 23 the values of i d i g of these go cnts composites 1 21 1 29 were interestingly between that of go 1 14 and that of mwcnts cooh 1 31 it also suggested that more carbon lattice structural disorders were constructed during the process of mwcnts cooh intercalated into go nanosheets furthermore the water contact angles of pure mwcnts cooh and pristine go membranes were approximately 121 and 63 fig 3 d respectively which indicated strong hydrophobicity of cnts and good hydrophilcity of go even though they all contained a lot of carboxyl functional groups 23 however compared with that of pure mwcnts cooh membrane all the water contact angles of these go cnts composite membranes drastically decreased to around 60 by the intercalation into go nanosheets indicating the highly hydrophilic and compatible natures of go and go cnts composites for example the water contact angle of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was the lowest 56 among in these membranes lower water contact angles implied stronger hydrophilcity which is mainly attributed to the large amount of hydrophilic hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the mwcnts cooh it can attract more water molecules on the membrane surface which is beneficial to improve the membrane permeability for water transport thus showing the higher water flux 5 16 17 20 however when the mwcnts cooh amounts is high enough agglomeration phenomenon is inevitable observed and thus decreasing surface hydrophilicity it could be explained the highest flux of go20 cnts80 membrane and was also consistent with the water flux trends with different go contents loading in these go cnts membranes see fig 2 to further investigate the interactions between go and cnts in these go cnts membranes some characterization measurements of ftir tem tg and zeta potential were thoroughly conducted with go mwcnts cooh and go cnts composite powders the go cnts composite sample was chosen as go20 cnts80 powder as shown in fig 4 all the ftir spectrum of the three samples demonstrated the presence of oh bands broad stretching vibration peaks around 3425 cm 1 ch2 vibration bands symmetrical stretching at 2925 cm 1 and coh from carboxyl at 1384 cm 1 meanwhile go characteristic absorption peaks at 1722 and 1629 1265 and 1080 cm 1 respectively were ascribed to the co stretching vibration of carboxylic acid carbonyl moieties co c and c o stretching vibrations respectively morover mwcnts cooh spectrum presented characteristic adsorption bands of asymmetric ch2 stretching 2855 cm 1 and c o or co stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group 1563 1166 1120 and 1045 cm 1 24 25 for go cnts composite the peaks of go at 1722 1629 and 1265 cm 1 almost disappeared and the band at 1384 cm 1 decayed significantly while the co stretching vibration at 1080 cm 1 strengthened indicating the dehydration and reduction reaction of oh and c o groups similarly the mwcnts cooh peaks at 2855 1166 1120 and 1045 cm 1 also disappeared and the band at 1384 cm 1 declined accordingly however compared with the spectra of mwcnts cooh a new stronger peak around 1575 cm 1 appeared in the spectra of go cnts composite and could be attributed to carboxyl stretching vibrations these results further confirmed that mwcnts cooh had been successfully incorporated into the interlayers of go lamellar nanosheets via grafting modification reaction moreover as observed tem morphology images in the fig s2 go was exfoliated into large transparent lamellar nanosheets with typical wrinkles fig s2 a meanwhile mwcnts cooh had a strong tendency to agglomerate and wind into bundles due to the strong van der waals interaction fig s2 b 5 15 23 as shown in fig s2 c the modified go with mwcnts cooh showed some bridge moieties morphology associated with the formation of hierarchical nanostructure which could assist in cnts intercalation 23 furthermore the measurements of tg fig s3 and zeta potential table 1 exhibited similar results to verify these deduction compared with those of pure mwcnts cooh and pristine go membranes go20 cnts80 composite membrane showed good thermostability and surface properties which was sufficient for the practical application in dyes wastewater treatment 3 2 effect of go cnts composite loading amounts fig 5 displayed the influence of go cnts composite loading amounts on the pure water flux and separation performance towards meb dyes solutions the thicknesses of these go20 cnts80 composite membranes namely go cnts composite loading amounts were easily adjusted by controlling the filtration volumes during the membrane fabrication process 5 23 26 as described in fig 5 both pure water flux and permeated flux through these membranes showed a rapid decrease with the increasing loading amounts from 0 35 to 1 75 g m 2 and then approached to an approximate steady value when the loading amount were over 3 50 g m 2 which was also observed with the similar tendency in our previous work and literatures 5 17 18 generally the go cnts composite loading amounts is directly proportional to the membrane thickness lower loading amounts leads to thinner membrane separation layers which generates shorter diffusive path length for water transport through go based membrane and thus demonstrates higher water flux of membrane 5 17 18 by contrast the rejection of meb dye molecules gradually increased from 84 4 99 6 with the increasing loading amounts from 0 35 to 1 05 g m 2 and then maintained the stable tendency of rejection over 99 5 even the loading amount exceeded to 5 30 g m 2 similarly the change tendency of stable mechanical properties which was also important for membrane long term stability was similar to that of rejection for these go cnts composite membranes with different loading amounts as shown in fig 6 a very thin film with some pinholes and typical wrinkled surface of go morphology was observed on the of pc support when the membrane was prepared with low loading amounts e g 0 35 g m 2 thus such this membrane demonstrated relative lower rejection for dye molecules and poor mechanical stability however the fine hierarchical nanostructures surface with more aggregated rough and no distinct defects were detected for the go cnts composite membranes with increasing loading amount over 1 40 g m 2 showing obvious characteristic morphologies with higher entangled configuration for cnts incorporation into go nanosheets 17 24 moreover the thicknesses of these membranes obviously increased with the increasing loading amounts which was also consistent with the membrane separation performance as shown in fig 5 it also illustrated an enhanced interactions between go and cnts in these membranes therefore considering the membrane separation performance and mechanical strength factors comprehensively the optimized loading amount of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was performed as 1 40 g m 2 in this work such the go20 cnts80 membrane showed high permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection ratio over 99 7 respectively see fig 5 3 3 effect of cnts and support types on the membrane separation performance as shown in fig 7 a the membrane prepared with mwcnts cooh displayed the highest permeated flux 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection over 99 7 towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb dye solutions also except for mwcnts other three membranes modified with functional mwcnts such as mwcnts oh and mwcnts nh2 exhibited relative high water flux and rejection over 98 8 it might be contributed to these beneficial functional groups such as carboxylic hydroxyl and amino groups which would form fine nanostructure go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance via chemical grafting reactions similarly the effect of porous support types on the membrane separation performance was also investigated in fig 7 b compared with pc support the membranes prepared with pp and aao exhibited very higher water flux and slightly lower rejection towards meb solutions for example the permeated flux of 129 4 87 2 l m 2 h 1 and rejection of 86 9 99 5 were achieved for the pp aao related go20 cnts80 membrane respectively fig 7 b however considering these supports costs and their corresponding membrane separation performance pc was preferentially selected as support in this work 3 4 separation performance of go cnts composite membranes for removing different organic molecules as illustrated in table 2 the go20 cnts80 composite membranes prepared with the optimized synthesis conditions were used to investigate the separation mechanism with three serial organic species positively charged dyes of meb and rhb negatively charged dyes of eb and mb and neutral organics molecules of sucrose and glucose these membranes showed different separation performance towards different organic molecules firstly there is no apparent relationship between the water flux and molecular weight mw for these organic charged dyes and neutral molecules for example pure water glucose meb sucrose rhb mb and eb have molecular weights of 18 180 320 342 479 800 and 961 da respectively 5 27 but their corresponding flux are 46 9 10 6 8 5 34 4 30 3 35 3 and 27 1 l m 2 h 1 respectively however the rejection of these organic molecules was obviously related to the electrostatic interaction for charged molecules for positively charged dyes of meb and rhb go cnts membrane had excellent separation performance especially with high rejection over 90 due to an strong interaction between positively charged dye molecules and negatively charged membrane surface see zeta potential in table 1 which was in agreement with other reports 5 28 actually as seen in table 2 although the three dimensional size of negatively charged dye molecules of mb 2 0 nm and eb 1 2 3 1 nm are larger than those of positively charged meb 1 4 0 6 nm and rhb 1 8 1 4 nm their rejection still are much lower as less than 77 secondly for neutral molecules glucose with smaller size of 0 7 nm has relatively higher flux and lower rejection than those of larger sucrose molecule diameter size of 1 0 nm respectively moreover the membrane flux with glucose and sucrose decrease with the increasing feed concentrations from 1 to 100 mmol l 1 and the fluxes of glucose are always higher than those of sucrose data not shown in this work it further indicates that there exists size exclusion effect during the nanofiltration membrane process which is consistent with previous mi s work and our previous work 5 28 consequently organic molecules were efficiently rejected through the go20 cnts80 membrane by the synergistic separation mechanism of electrostatic interaction and size exclusion effects 3 5 chemical stability of go cnts composite membranes in order to further investigate their resistance to acid or base environment two optimized go20 cnts80 composite membranes were firstly immersed into meb solution 7 5 mg l 1 for overnight and then soaked in hcl solution hcl h2o 1 1 wt and naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 for 2 h to remove the dyes on the membrane surface respectively after that the membranes were taken out for dried and then measured the separation performance towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb solutions to examine their chemical stability as illustrated in fig s4 it was found that the go20 cnts80 membrane soaked in hydrochloric acid could effectively remove the residual meb dyes and then show high rejection for dye molecules meanwhile that membrane soaked in naoh solution was completely curled and even broken with loss of separation performance which might be caused by the membrane deformation or rupture due to the hydrolysis or other reactions of pc supports under base environment the go20 cnts80 membrane soaked in hcl solution was performed with meb separation test for 1 h and then treated with hcl solutions repeatedly for cycle tests as shown in fig 8 this membrane exhibited good acid resistance and could restore high rejection rate nearly to 99 0 for four cycles moreover the permeated flux and rejection of over 32 7 l m 2 h 1 and 91 3 respectively were achieved for this go20 cnts80 membrane even after five cycles fig 9 showed the xrd patterns of this go20 cnts80 composite membrane after five cycle tests by comparison with fig 3 a the structure of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was some changed except keeping go characteristic peak 2θ 10 70 and d 0 827 nm it also indicated that this membrane illustrated good stability for acid resistance even loss of the microstructure of go cnts composites the structural changes also affect the separation performance of this membrane undergone with five cycle tests fig 8 consequently such go cnts composite membranes had good chemical stability for acid resistance to some extent and further improvement of membrane fouling was under investigation for future application in water purification and dyes wastewater treatment 4 conclusions go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance were successfully fabricated by mwcnts cooh intercalation into go laminar nanosheets for highly efficient treatment of dyes wastewater the 3d membrane nanostructure was constructed via grafting modification reaction by various characterization results which would significantly improve water permeability and stability under the optimization synthesis conditions pure water flux up to 46 9 l m 2 h 1 and the permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and the rejection over 99 7 towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb solutions were achieved for the go20 cnts80 composite membranes respectively compared with those of pristine go membrane the go20 cnts80 composite membranes exhibited a nearly 10 fold water permeated flux improvement with keeping high rejection and also showed good chemical stability for acid resistance such these go cnts composite membranes provided additional

composite membranes with fine hierarchical nanostructure were facilely fabricated by intercalation with 1d carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts cooh into 2d graphene oxide go nanosheets for efficient organic wastewater treatment by characterization results of xrd raman ftir tem and water contact angle mwcnts cooh was successfully to be intercalated into go lamellar interlayers with grafting reactions which would improve water permeated flux and stability of membrane the influences of go cnts ratios loading amounts cnts types and support types on the membrane separation performance were systematically investigated towards methylene blue dye solution for the go cnts composite membranes prepared under the optimized conditions the permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection over 99 7 were obtained towards methylene blue solutions under the transmembrane pressure difference of 0 9 bar respectively compared with pristine go membrane it exhibited a nearly 10 fold water permeated flux improvement meanwhile maintaining high rejection moreover the electrostatic interaction and size exclusion effects were synergistically contributed to be responsible for the efficiently separation properties of the go cnts membranes towards different positively negatively charged dyes and neutral organic molecules such the go cnts membranes also exhibited good chemical stability for acid resistance with highly efficient separation performance keywords graphene oxide carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes membrane separation wastewater chemical stability 1 introduction graphene oxide go is a typical two dimensional material which is composed of hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups recently it has attracted much attention in membrane separation field due to the presence of abundant oxygen containing functional groups on the go surface 1 3 therefore as a type of novel membrane materials go based membranes are reported in a widely range of application for gas separation organic solvents dehydration desalination etc 4 11 however pristine go membrane is mainly maintained by hydrogen bond between oxygen containing functional groups hydrogen bonds are easily destroyed due to hydration effect in aqueous solution 12 and then d spacing between go lamellar interlayers is increased 9 thus leading to a significant nanochannels expansion in pristine go membrane with lower rejection performance even so pristine go membrane exhibited fairly water permeated flux during the nanofiltration processes especially for dyes wastewater treatment 3 5 generally dyes wastewater is composed of many toxic compounds e g acid alkali salt and other intermediates that are difficult to treat with conventional methods which also has a great influence on pristine go membrane 5 therefore it is urgent to prepare a go based membrane with high water permeability and favorable stability for the efficient treatment of dye wastewater with complex components two approaches had been proposed by some researchers to fabricate go based membranes with high separation performance and enhanced stability 13 19 on the one hand covalent modification is considered to be a controllable approach to adjust d spacing of go membranes for example hung et al 13 prepared graphene oxide framework gof membranes by go nanosheets cross linking with chosen diamine monomers such as ethylenediamine butylenediamine and p phenylenediamine which were expected to improve water permeability as a result these gof membranes exhibited d spacing of 0 91 0 97 and 1 01 nm in the dry state and in the wetting state of 0 93 0 99 and 2 09 nm respectively meanwhile the d spacing of pristine go membrane increased from 0 85 dry state to 1 31 nm in the wetting process on the other hand chemical intercalation is also advocated to be a controllable method to enhance membrane stability wang et al 15 reported that zero dimensional carbon quantum dots were combined into the gaps between go nanosheets to fabricate go composite membranes with adjustable permeability gao et al 16 firstly fabricated ultra thin go membranes by the intercalation of one dimensional 1d single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts into go layers it would expand the nanochannels of water transport which showed water permeance as high as 660 720 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 han et al 17 also developed a novel high flux go nanofiltration membrane intercalated by multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts which would expand the interlayer space and enhance antifouling performance this go mwcnts membrane displayed water permeance up to 11 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was 2 times that of go membrane despite these reported go cnts composite membranes shows high water flux and good separation performance there are still no significant binding forces between cnts and go nanosheets the chemical stability of go cnts composite membrane especially the resistance to acid base environment is crucially required for membrane application in dyes wastewater treatment recently we successfully prepared go attapulgite composite membranes by incorporating 1d natural attapulgite nanorods into go layers to form stable c o si bonds via grafting modification it significantly enhanced stability and water permeability of 13 3 l m 2 h 1 towards rhodamine b dye wastewater 5 moreover the relationships of preparation parameters and separation properties even separation mechanism for dye wastewater treatment remain unclear for these go cnts membranes which will be to better understand the effects of cnts intercalating to go membrane on the d spacing membrane microstructure permeability and even stability 19 20 herein we construct three dimensional go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance and stability by intercalation with 1d mwcnts cooh into go nanosheets via grafting reactions for highly efficient treatment of organic wastewater the influence of synthesis parameters such as go cnts ratios loading amounts cnts types and support types on separation performance were systematically investigated the separation mechanism and stability go cnts composite membranes towards organic wastewater treatment were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of go cnts composite membranes as shown in fig 1 go nanosheets jcgo 99 1 2 purity 99 thickness of 0 8 1 2 nm diameter of 1 5 μm nanjing jcnano were dispersed in deionized water followed by ultrasonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous 0 02 g l 1 solution then appropriate carboxylated multi walled carbon nanotubes powder mwcnts cooh purity 95 out diameter of 30 50 nm length of 10 20 μm aladdin was added in the go suspension and vigorously stirred for 2 h to promote the grafting reaction and ensure go nanosheets intercalated by mwcnts cooh at room temperature finally the resulting go cnts composite suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm cr21giii hitachi japan and washed with deionized water repeatedly the products dried at 60 c for the following characterization and membrane fabrication the go cnts composite membrane was prepared by 5 ml of the go cnts suspensions through polycarbonate filters pc isopore gttp02500 diameter of 25 mm average pore size of 0 22 μm millipore using a vacuum filtration assembly which was described in details elsewhere 5 the thickness of go cnts separation layer is easily controlled by adjusting the filtration volume of the added go cnts suspensions also called go cnts composite loading amounts then go cnts membrane was washed carefully with deionized water and dried in vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h for comparison the same process was adopted to fabricate pristine go membrane a series of pristine go and go cnts membranes with the same loading about 0 1 mg go amount were fabricated with different go contents from 0 1 to 1 0 which correspondingly noted as gox cntsy membrane go cnts x y wt x y 100 to investigate the effect of cnts types on the membrane separation performance mwcnts cooh was replaced with other three types of cnts to fabricate go20 cnts80 composite membrane with the same loading amounts mwcnts hydroxylated mwcnts mwcnts oh and aminated mwcnts mwcnts nh2 all the cnts purchased from aladdin showed the out diameter of about 50 nm and the length of 10 20 μm respectively similarly to examine the influence of porous support types on the membrane separation performance polypropylene pp pore size of 220 nm and anodic aluminum oxide aao pore size of 200 nm disk filters purchased from millipore was replaced with pc support to prepare go20 cnts80 composite membrane with the same procedure 2 2 characterization the chemical composition and structure of samples were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv x ray diffractometer equipped with the cu kα source 40 kv 20 ma λ 0 15418 nm and raman spectroscopy jobin yvon labram hr spectrometer the sample morphologies were observed by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi su 8020 and transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 2100 the zeta potential and static water contact angle of go based membranes were analyzed using a zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer nano zs and contact angle measurement instrument shanghai zhongchen digital technical apparatus jc2000c2 respectively thermogravimetry tg analysis was conducted a perkin elmer instrument diamond tg dta 6300 with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under n2 flow 2 3 separation performance tests the separation performance of the as prepared go cnts composite membranes were measured by a self designed dead end filtration device with different charged dyes and neutral organic molecules solutions at room temperature 5 also shown in fig s1 the effective filtration area was about 2 83 cm2 and the transmembrane pressure difference was kept at about 0 9 bar by a r300 type vacuum pump the pure water flux was measured when it was steady after 1 h of filtration after switch to organic solutions for more than 12 h to eliminate the adsorption effect of organic solutes the permeated flux was determined with 30 ml organic solution during the fixed operating time of 1 h all the results of membrane separation performance in this work are the average values obtained by more than three measurements to ensure reproducibility the permeated water flux j l m 2 h 1 and rejection rate rej of these membranes were evaluated for separation performance by the following equations 1 j v at 2 rej 1 c p c f 100 where v is the permeate volume l collected over a period time t h a is the effective membrane area m2 cp and cf are the solution concentration of dye and organic molecules in the permeate and feed side respectively uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis jasco v 750 and total organic carbon analyzer toc shimadzu toc vcph were used to evaluate the organic solute concentrations for these separating systems through go cnts composite membranes positively charged dyes of methylene blue meb and rhodamine b rhb negatively charged dyes of evans blue eb and methyl blue mb were ar grade which was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent of china sucrose and d glucose were also a r grade from aladdin unless otherwise stated the membrane separation performance was evaluated with 7 5 mg l 1 meb dye solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of go cnts ratios compared with pristine go membrane of 7 0 l m 2 h 1 as shown in fig 2 the pure water flux firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing go contents for the go cnts composite membranes for example the average flux of 8 1 16 5 8 8 and 2 2 l m 2 h 1 was obtained for go10 cnts90 go20 cnts80 go40 cnts60 and go80 cnts20 composite membranes respectively similarly although all the rejection ratios were over 99 0 for these go cnts membranes there were the same trends for permeated flux towards meb dye solutions as the go contents increased the permeated flux showed a promoting increase and then decreased rapidly the highest permeated flux of go20 cnts80 membrane 12 3 l m 2 h 1 i e 13 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was over 3 times higher than that of pristine go membrane 3 7 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection remained changeless over 99 2 in the meb solutions it was also obviously higher than those of most go mwcnts or common nf membranes 17 meanwhile the permeated flux of go80 cnts20 membrane was reduced by 86 5 compared to that of pristine go membrane it might be attributed to the microstructure and surface hydrophilicity for these go cnts membranes except for the broad characteristic diffraction peak of pc supports at 2θ 17 00 as shown in fig 3 a pristine go membrane exhibited a typical peak at 2θ 10 08 21 and pure mwcnts cooh membrane displayed a dominant peak at about 25 96 corresponding to the crystal plane 002 of cnts 22 the cnts typical diffraction peak gradually disappeared with increasing go contents for these go cnts composite membranes while the intensity of go characteristic diffraction peak gradually increased with the go cnts ratios moreover all the go typical peaks of these go cnts composite membranes were slightly less than that of pristine go 10 08 thus the d spacing or interlayer spacing of these go based membranes were calculated by the bragg s equation 2dsinθ nλ as shown in fig 3 b the corresponding d spacing of pristine go membrane was 0 878 nm meanwhile those of all the go cnts composite membranes were unexpectedly decreased slightly as 0 850 nm unchanged with increasing go contents it implicates the microstructures of cnts intercalated go membranes are well preserved with that of go lamellar layers which is agreement with other reports 16 therefore it didn t seem to be increased for the d spacing via the incorporation of cnts into the interlayers of go lamellar nanosheets in this work which was different with the go attapulgite membranes 5 it suggested that some interactions occurred between go and mwcnts cooh during the cnts intercalation process for these go cnts membranes the lateral size of go nanosheets is smaller than the length of mwcnts cooh while larger than the out diameter of mwcnts cooh 30 50 nm consequently go sheets would parcel the mwcnts cooh to form 3d hierarchical nanostructure and then establish the water channels for fast transport via grafting modification reaction fig 1 the raman spectra of pure mwcnts cooh pristine go and go cnts composite membranes shown in fig 3 c were also verified to some extent the intercalation of mwcnts cooh into the stacked go lamellar layers the values of i d i g which are calculated by the intensity ratio of d bands 1340 cm 1 and g bands 1600 cm 1 ordinarily determine the degree of graphitized structure for carbon materials 5 21 23 the values of i d i g of these go cnts composites 1 21 1 29 were interestingly between that of go 1 14 and that of mwcnts cooh 1 31 it also suggested that more carbon lattice structural disorders were constructed during the process of mwcnts cooh intercalated into go nanosheets furthermore the water contact angles of pure mwcnts cooh and pristine go membranes were approximately 121 and 63 fig 3 d respectively which indicated strong hydrophobicity of cnts and good hydrophilcity of go even though they all contained a lot of carboxyl functional groups 23 however compared with that of pure mwcnts cooh membrane all the water contact angles of these go cnts composite membranes drastically decreased to around 60 by the intercalation into go nanosheets indicating the highly hydrophilic and compatible natures of go and go cnts composites for example the water contact angle of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was the lowest 56 among in these membranes lower water contact angles implied stronger hydrophilcity which is mainly attributed to the large amount of hydrophilic hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the mwcnts cooh it can attract more water molecules on the membrane surface which is beneficial to improve the membrane permeability for water transport thus showing the higher water flux 5 16 17 20 however when the mwcnts cooh amounts is high enough agglomeration phenomenon is inevitable observed and thus decreasing surface hydrophilicity it could be explained the highest flux of go20 cnts80 membrane and was also consistent with the water flux trends with different go contents loading in these go cnts membranes see fig 2 to further investigate the interactions between go and cnts in these go cnts membranes some characterization measurements of ftir tem tg and zeta potential were thoroughly conducted with go mwcnts cooh and go cnts composite powders the go cnts composite sample was chosen as go20 cnts80 powder as shown in fig 4 all the ftir spectrum of the three samples demonstrated the presence of oh bands broad stretching vibration peaks around 3425 cm 1 ch2 vibration bands symmetrical stretching at 2925 cm 1 and coh from carboxyl at 1384 cm 1 meanwhile go characteristic absorption peaks at 1722 and 1629 1265 and 1080 cm 1 respectively were ascribed to the co stretching vibration of carboxylic acid carbonyl moieties co c and c o stretching vibrations respectively morover mwcnts cooh spectrum presented characteristic adsorption bands of asymmetric ch2 stretching 2855 cm 1 and c o or co stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group 1563 1166 1120 and 1045 cm 1 24 25 for go cnts composite the peaks of go at 1722 1629 and 1265 cm 1 almost disappeared and the band at 1384 cm 1 decayed significantly while the co stretching vibration at 1080 cm 1 strengthened indicating the dehydration and reduction reaction of oh and c o groups similarly the mwcnts cooh peaks at 2855 1166 1120 and 1045 cm 1 also disappeared and the band at 1384 cm 1 declined accordingly however compared with the spectra of mwcnts cooh a new stronger peak around 1575 cm 1 appeared in the spectra of go cnts composite and could be attributed to carboxyl stretching vibrations these results further confirmed that mwcnts cooh had been successfully incorporated into the interlayers of go lamellar nanosheets via grafting modification reaction moreover as observed tem morphology images in the fig s2 go was exfoliated into large transparent lamellar nanosheets with typical wrinkles fig s2 a meanwhile mwcnts cooh had a strong tendency to agglomerate and wind into bundles due to the strong van der waals interaction fig s2 b 5 15 23 as shown in fig s2 c the modified go with mwcnts cooh showed some bridge moieties morphology associated with the formation of hierarchical nanostructure which could assist in cnts intercalation 23 furthermore the measurements of tg fig s3 and zeta potential table 1 exhibited similar results to verify these deduction compared with those of pure mwcnts cooh and pristine go membranes go20 cnts80 composite membrane showed good thermostability and surface properties which was sufficient for the practical application in dyes wastewater treatment 3 2 effect of go cnts composite loading amounts fig 5 displayed the influence of go cnts composite loading amounts on the pure water flux and separation performance towards meb dyes solutions the thicknesses of these go20 cnts80 composite membranes namely go cnts composite loading amounts were easily adjusted by controlling the filtration volumes during the membrane fabrication process 5 23 26 as described in fig 5 both pure water flux and permeated flux through these membranes showed a rapid decrease with the increasing loading amounts from 0 35 to 1 75 g m 2 and then approached to an approximate steady value when the loading amount were over 3 50 g m 2 which was also observed with the similar tendency in our previous work and literatures 5 17 18 generally the go cnts composite loading amounts is directly proportional to the membrane thickness lower loading amounts leads to thinner membrane separation layers which generates shorter diffusive path length for water transport through go based membrane and thus demonstrates higher water flux of membrane 5 17 18 by contrast the rejection of meb dye molecules gradually increased from 84 4 99 6 with the increasing loading amounts from 0 35 to 1 05 g m 2 and then maintained the stable tendency of rejection over 99 5 even the loading amount exceeded to 5 30 g m 2 similarly the change tendency of stable mechanical properties which was also important for membrane long term stability was similar to that of rejection for these go cnts composite membranes with different loading amounts as shown in fig 6 a very thin film with some pinholes and typical wrinkled surface of go morphology was observed on the of pc support when the membrane was prepared with low loading amounts e g 0 35 g m 2 thus such this membrane demonstrated relative lower rejection for dye molecules and poor mechanical stability however the fine hierarchical nanostructures surface with more aggregated rough and no distinct defects were detected for the go cnts composite membranes with increasing loading amount over 1 40 g m 2 showing obvious characteristic morphologies with higher entangled configuration for cnts incorporation into go nanosheets 17 24 moreover the thicknesses of these membranes obviously increased with the increasing loading amounts which was also consistent with the membrane separation performance as shown in fig 5 it also illustrated an enhanced interactions between go and cnts in these membranes therefore considering the membrane separation performance and mechanical strength factors comprehensively the optimized loading amount of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was performed as 1 40 g m 2 in this work such the go20 cnts80 membrane showed high permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection ratio over 99 7 respectively see fig 5 3 3 effect of cnts and support types on the membrane separation performance as shown in fig 7 a the membrane prepared with mwcnts cooh displayed the highest permeated flux 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and rejection over 99 7 towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb dye solutions also except for mwcnts other three membranes modified with functional mwcnts such as mwcnts oh and mwcnts nh2 exhibited relative high water flux and rejection over 98 8 it might be contributed to these beneficial functional groups such as carboxylic hydroxyl and amino groups which would form fine nanostructure go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance via chemical grafting reactions similarly the effect of porous support types on the membrane separation performance was also investigated in fig 7 b compared with pc support the membranes prepared with pp and aao exhibited very higher water flux and slightly lower rejection towards meb solutions for example the permeated flux of 129 4 87 2 l m 2 h 1 and rejection of 86 9 99 5 were achieved for the pp aao related go20 cnts80 membrane respectively fig 7 b however considering these supports costs and their corresponding membrane separation performance pc was preferentially selected as support in this work 3 4 separation performance of go cnts composite membranes for removing different organic molecules as illustrated in table 2 the go20 cnts80 composite membranes prepared with the optimized synthesis conditions were used to investigate the separation mechanism with three serial organic species positively charged dyes of meb and rhb negatively charged dyes of eb and mb and neutral organics molecules of sucrose and glucose these membranes showed different separation performance towards different organic molecules firstly there is no apparent relationship between the water flux and molecular weight mw for these organic charged dyes and neutral molecules for example pure water glucose meb sucrose rhb mb and eb have molecular weights of 18 180 320 342 479 800 and 961 da respectively 5 27 but their corresponding flux are 46 9 10 6 8 5 34 4 30 3 35 3 and 27 1 l m 2 h 1 respectively however the rejection of these organic molecules was obviously related to the electrostatic interaction for charged molecules for positively charged dyes of meb and rhb go cnts membrane had excellent separation performance especially with high rejection over 90 due to an strong interaction between positively charged dye molecules and negatively charged membrane surface see zeta potential in table 1 which was in agreement with other reports 5 28 actually as seen in table 2 although the three dimensional size of negatively charged dye molecules of mb 2 0 nm and eb 1 2 3 1 nm are larger than those of positively charged meb 1 4 0 6 nm and rhb 1 8 1 4 nm their rejection still are much lower as less than 77 secondly for neutral molecules glucose with smaller size of 0 7 nm has relatively higher flux and lower rejection than those of larger sucrose molecule diameter size of 1 0 nm respectively moreover the membrane flux with glucose and sucrose decrease with the increasing feed concentrations from 1 to 100 mmol l 1 and the fluxes of glucose are always higher than those of sucrose data not shown in this work it further indicates that there exists size exclusion effect during the nanofiltration membrane process which is consistent with previous mi s work and our previous work 5 28 consequently organic molecules were efficiently rejected through the go20 cnts80 membrane by the synergistic separation mechanism of electrostatic interaction and size exclusion effects 3 5 chemical stability of go cnts composite membranes in order to further investigate their resistance to acid or base environment two optimized go20 cnts80 composite membranes were firstly immersed into meb solution 7 5 mg l 1 for overnight and then soaked in hcl solution hcl h2o 1 1 wt and naoh solution 0 1 mol l 1 for 2 h to remove the dyes on the membrane surface respectively after that the membranes were taken out for dried and then measured the separation performance towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb solutions to examine their chemical stability as illustrated in fig s4 it was found that the go20 cnts80 membrane soaked in hydrochloric acid could effectively remove the residual meb dyes and then show high rejection for dye molecules meanwhile that membrane soaked in naoh solution was completely curled and even broken with loss of separation performance which might be caused by the membrane deformation or rupture due to the hydrolysis or other reactions of pc supports under base environment the go20 cnts80 membrane soaked in hcl solution was performed with meb separation test for 1 h and then treated with hcl solutions repeatedly for cycle tests as shown in fig 8 this membrane exhibited good acid resistance and could restore high rejection rate nearly to 99 0 for four cycles moreover the permeated flux and rejection of over 32 7 l m 2 h 1 and 91 3 respectively were achieved for this go20 cnts80 membrane even after five cycles fig 9 showed the xrd patterns of this go20 cnts80 composite membrane after five cycle tests by comparison with fig 3 a the structure of go20 cnts80 composite membrane was some changed except keeping go characteristic peak 2θ 10 70 and d 0 827 nm it also indicated that this membrane illustrated good stability for acid resistance even loss of the microstructure of go cnts composites the structural changes also affect the separation performance of this membrane undergone with five cycle tests fig 8 consequently such go cnts composite membranes had good chemical stability for acid resistance to some extent and further improvement of membrane fouling was under investigation for future application in water purification and dyes wastewater treatment 4 conclusions go cnts composite membranes with high separation performance were successfully fabricated by mwcnts cooh intercalation into go laminar nanosheets for highly efficient treatment of dyes wastewater the 3d membrane nanostructure was constructed via grafting modification reaction by various characterization results which would significantly improve water permeability and stability under the optimization synthesis conditions pure water flux up to 46 9 l m 2 h 1 and the permeated flux of 34 4 l m 2 h 1 and the rejection over 99 7 towards 7 5 mg l 1 meb solutions were achieved for the go20 cnts80 composite membranes respectively compared with those of pristine go membrane the go20 cnts80 composite membranes exhibited a nearly 10 fold water permeated flux improvement with keeping high rejection and also showed good chemical stability for acid resistance such these go cnts composite membranes provided additional

heterogeneous media the air permeable membrane layered biofilms liquid film and bulk to better understand large scale mabr performance under real operation conditions a comprehensive mabr model was developed and model calibration was completed with a pilot scale mabr system for the pilot system operated with municipal wastewater mixed with return activated sludge the biofilm thickness was 1000

introduction high levels of nitrogen nutrients e g ammonia nitrate and organic nitrogen can be present in various wastewater streams including domestic wastewater agricultural wastewater and animal manure waste excessive release of nitrogen nutrients into natural water systems can cause serious environmental problems such as algal bloom formation and eutrophication that threaten the aquatic ecosystem 1 3 therefore nitrogen nutrient removal is essential in modern wastewater treatment systems 4 6 conventional activated sludge is widely used in municipal wastewater treatment for ammonia and organic nitrogen removal by nitrification however it requires high oxygen demands increasing the aeration cost coupled with a long solids retention time increasing the pumping cost 7 9 also additional reactors are necessary for complete denitrification requiring a large footprint for wastewater treatment facilities 10 biological nitrification and denitrification can also be achieved using attached growth bioreactors such as trickling filters moving bed biofilm reactors and rotating biological contactors membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs are a relatively new treatment method which is considered as a promising alternative for conventional attached growth reactors for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd with a significant reduction of the facility size and operation cost 11 17 in mabr operation oxygen is provided through gas permeable membranes to the biofilm as a result the aerobic zone is formed in the inner layers of the biofilm for nitrification while the anoxic zone is created in the outer layers of the biofilm for denitrification 3 6 10 12 since soluble organics are readily diffused from the bulk solution to the outer biofilm mabrs are known to achieve more efficient denitrification compared to conventional attached growth reactors 8 9 12 15 numerical modeling of mabr is important to comprehensively describe the rate mechanisms and identify the complex correlation between the process parameters numerical models can also be used for assessing the performance of mabr under various operational conditions 18 therefore numerical modeling leads to better conceptual understanding for the mabr operation as the level of complexity can be selected based on the resources availability and aimed accuracy 19 21 numerical comprehensive model including the biological reactions in the biofilm oxygen partial pressure along the membrane fiber and biological reactions in the bulk solution is essential to detect the sophisticated relations between model parameters in the mabr operation also model calibration with pilot scale operation data is significantly important as it forms robust models to reflect realistic values for the model parameters compared to those determined using lab scale results most of other mabr studies have examined the feasibility of mabr based on lab scale experiments with specific focuses on nitrification

operational conditions on nitrogen removal 18 20 33 describe the microbial community in the biofilm 34 and determine the removal mechanisms in mabr 12 35 also other mabr studies combined lab scale experimental work with numerical modeling to show the importance of oxygen concentration 36 39 c n ratio and biofilm thickness 8 and ph and alkalinity 14 on cod and nitrogen removal in mabr the calibration of numerical models with mabr pilot scale operation data is significantly important because some model parameters are difficult to be measured during the complicated system operation 40 41 however there is no previous model calibration study with mabr pilot scale operation to determine the important parameters in mabr e g biofilm thickness liquid film thickness i e boundary diffusive layer between the biofilm and bulk and diffusion coefficient of soluble components operational conditions play an important role in cod and nitrogen removal in mabrs in other mabr studies the oxygen concentration at the membrane surface and bulk solution was found to govern the efficiency of nitrification in mabr 4 22 24 36 37 it was also found that the influent ammonia loading rate controls ammonia removal in mabr 5 38 two other critical operational factors are the c n ratio and influent cod concentration as they affect the microbial competition between autotrophic bacteria for nitrification and heterotrophic bacteria for denitrification in mabr biofilms 6 18 23 28 42 especially denitrification can be dramatically improved by adjusting the oxygen flux as a function of the influent cod and ammonia loadings 8 however the effect of the c n ratio on nitrification for high strength wastewater e g downstream liquid from dewatering processes with higher levels of ammonia nitrogen than typical municipal wastewater has not been investigated in mabr also there were no systematic investigations on the liquid film thickness for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in this study the main objectives are to 1 develop a comprehensive model to simulate the mass transport and biological reactions in the mabr biofilm and bulk solution including the oxygen partial pressure changes along the membrane fiber 2 calibrate the comprehensive model with mabr pilot scale operation data to estimate the important model parameters 3 identify the rate limiting parameters on nitrification and denitrification in mabr for low and high strength wastewater and 4 assess the effect of operational conditions e g biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification in mabr 2 pilot mabr experiments 2 1 pilot mabr installation and operation a pilot mabr reactor was built in a container with an effective wastewater volume of 16 5 m3 where a mabr cassette 3 0 m in length 1 75 m in width and 2 15 m in depth was immersed zeelung mabr module suez water technologies solutions canada fig s1 the mabr cassette contained 300 000 cords and each cord consisted of a central string providing mechanical strength and 40 gas permeable membrane fibers length 2 0 m inner diameter 70 μm outer diameter 95 μm each membrane fiber provided an effective surface area of 4 4 10 4 m2 for biofilm attachment resulting in a total surface area of 1920 m2 in the pilot rector the mabr pilot reactor was installed in a local municipal wastewater treatment facility between the primary clarifiers and aeration tanks of conventional activated sludge adelaide wastewater treatment plant london ontario canada the primary clarifier effluent mixed with the return activated sludge ras was continuously introduced into the pilot reactor to examine the nitrification and denitrification capacity with an extra nitrate input from ras table 1 the wastewater flow rate was 45 4 7 m3 hr resulting in a very short mean hydraulic retention time in the mabr reactor 22 min the pilot operation was initiated in february 2017 and operated for 14 months until march 2018 during the pilot operation fresh air was continuously provided to the mabr cassette and the air traveled from the top to the bottom of individual gas permeable membrane fibers as the air flew inside the membrane fiber oxygen was transported from the membrane surface into the attached biofilm only by diffusion requiring a significantly low pressure 0 34 atm and low air flow rate 8 m3 hr the oxygen partial pressure of the inlet and exhaust air was monitored every weekday using a hand held oxygen partial pressure sensor max o2 ae by maxtec usa to estimate the rate of oxygen consumption the exhaust air from the mabr cassette was collected in separate air pockets beneath the mabr cassette and the collected exhaust air was released every 90 s to provide a partial mixing condition 43 the influent and effluent samples were collected and analyzed for cod chemical oxygen demand nh4 n ammonia no3 n nitrate and tss total suspended solids every weekday according to the standard methods 44 on the other hand no2 n nitrite and vss volatile suspended solids were analyzed once a week 44 the influent and effluent were also monitored for temperature and ph using real time thermometers endress and hauser switzerland and ph probes george fisher switzerland respectively 2 2 mabr pilot operation data the raw pilot operation measurements ammonia nitrite nitrate and cod

table s2 the effect of ph on nitrification was reflected on the maximum specific growth rate of x a o b μ a o b table 2 the reaction kinetics for soluble cod s c o d utilization by x h particulate cod x s hydrolysis into s c o d and microbial respiration reactions were also included in the model table s2 the daily temperature condition in the pilot operation data was reflected for the individual biological reactions using temperature correction factor θ table 2 in the biofilm the soluble components s n h 4 s n o 2 s n o 3 s o 2 and s c o d were mobile by diffusion while the particulate components x a o b x n o b x h and x s were assumed to be immobile 3 2 boundary conditions the concentration of soluble components at the interface between the liquid film and bulk was defined using the measured effluent concentration during the pilot operation table 1 soluble components except for oxygen diffused from the bulk to biofilm in the liquid film where biological reactions were assumed to be negligible on the membrane surface x 0 it was assumed that there is no flux for each of the soluble components except for oxygen eq 3 while the oxygen concentration s o 2 at the membrane surface was defined by henry s law eq 4 3 d s i d x x 0 0 where s i is an individual soluble component except for oxygen and x is the distance from the membrane surface 4 s o 2 p o 2 k h where s o 2 is the oxygen concentration mg o2 l p o 2 is the oxygen partial pressure atm and k h is the henry s law constant k h 0 024 atm mg o2 l at 25 c note that the henry s law constant was corrected for pilot operation temperature conditions using van t hoff equation 47 3 3 numerical solution methods and model verification the nine steady state mass balance equations for individual soluble s n h 4 s n o 2 s n o 3 s o 2 and s c o d and particulate x a o b x n o b x h and x s components were discretized by the finite difference methods table s2 48 in the finite difference method the biofilm was evenly divided into fifty grids regardless of the biofilm thickness the 450 discretized mass balance equations 50 grids 9 components were solved numerically by the fixed point iteration approach 48 the built numerical model was validated by comparing simulation results with another mabr model study fig s2 8 3 4 model expansion for 2 0 m long mabr membrane the one dimensional biofilm model was expanded to reflect the changes in the oxygen partial pressure p o 2 along the air flow direction from the top to the bottom of an individual mabr fiber in the pilot operation the average oxygen partial pressure decreased from 0 209 atm inlet p o 2 to 0 157 0 01 atm exhaust p o 2 along the air flow direction in the 2 0 meter long air permeable hollow membrane fiber the 2 0 m long membrane was discretized into ten segments in the direction of air flow and it was assumed that the oxygen partial pressure changes linearly from the inlet to exhaust p o 2 along the membrane height the oxygen partial pressure in each membrane segment was then applied to the henry s law equation eq 4 to determine the oxygen concentration at the membrane surface 3 5 biological reactions in bulk solution the biological reactions in the bulk solution pilot reactor effective volume of 16 5 m3 were combined with the biofilm biological reactions to build a comprehensive mabr model the rates of individual biological reactions were calculated based on the effluent characteristics of the daily pilot operation table 1 using asm3 tables 2 and s2 8 46 the biomass fractions were assumed as 13 60 for x h 0 027 for x a o b 0 018 for x n o b 50 for x s and the rest for x i 50 51 the daily wastewater temperature and ph conditions were reflected on the biological reactions in the bulk and biofilm table 2 3 6 model calibration using pilot operation data the comprehensive model including the biological reactions in the bulk solution and the biofilms on the 2 0 m long fibers was calibrated using the daily pilot operation data over 14 months to determine the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and the diffusion coefficient of soluble components in the biofilm table 3 the daily operation data of the pilot reactor effluent concentrations of ammonia nitrite nitrate cod inlet and exhaust oxygen partial pressure wastewater temperature and ph were used in the model calibration 4 results and discussion 4 1 the mabr pilot operation results in the pilot mabr operation the ammonia removal rate was enhanced with the increasing influent ammonia loading rate fig 1 a and increasing oxygen supply rate fig 1b the ammonia removal rate increased linearly with the increasing ammonia loading rate up to 1 25 kg n m3 day fig 1a indicating that mabr can effectively handle high ammonia loading conditions this finding is consistent with another mabr study where efficient ammonia removal at high ammonia loading rates up to 1 50 kg n m3 day was demonstrated 24 efficient oxygen transfer from the membrane to biofilms was critical for enhanced ammonia removal fig 1b note that the membrane material of the mabr pilot was suez zeelung media the membrane material is known to control the oxygen transfer efficiency through the membrane surface in other mabr studies hollow fiber membranes made of polydimethyl siloxane 54 and silicone based membranes 11 were examined for efficient oxygen transfer in ammonia removal moreover the oxygen supply pressure through the membrane fibers is an important factor in efficient ammonia removal in the mabr 3 55 the ammonia removal rate was enhanced with the decreasing effluent ph fig 1c while the influent c n ratio hardly affected the ammonia removal rate in the pilot mabr operation fig 1d although the range of bulk solution ph was narrow 7 1 7 5 low ph was correlated to enhanced ammonia removal during the pilot operation fig 1c this finding is not consistent with the well known low ph inhibition on nitrification 56 57 indicating that the bulk solution ph does not represent the ph condition in the mabr biofilm as previously claimed 58 it was also found in other mabr studies that nitrification reaction in biofilms can affect the bulk ph significantly 14 59 during the pilot operation the influent c n ratio varied in a wide range from 1 5 to 5 7 g cod g n however there were no clear relationships between the influent c n ratio and ammonia removal rate because the growth rate of xaob was insensitive to the influent c n ratio within the operated range of c n ratio fig 1d this finding is consistent with the results of other mabr studies where it was reported that ammonia removal was independent of the c n ratio 6 8 18 60 a clear seasonal dependency of the removal rate of ammonia nitrate and cod was observed during the pilot operation as high wastewater temperature enhanced the biological reactions in the mabr fig 2 and table s3 the ammonia removal rate ranged between 1 55 and 6 20 kg n d with an annual average rate of 3 75 kg n d fig 2a at the beginning of the mabr pilot operation february august biofilms were thin on the membrane surface indicating sufficient oxygen transport throughout the biofilm thickness while the ammonia removal rate increased quickly during this period february august there was limited nitrate removal until august because anoxic zones were not established in the biofilm fig 2b after the first seven months of the operation august and thereafter the nitrate removal rate increased rapidly as the biofilm was thick enough to have the outer anoxic layer for active denitrification fig 2b this trend of the nitrate removal rate was consistent with that of the cod removal rate during the pilot operation fig 2b and c for the first seven months of the mabr operation february august the average cod removal rate was relatively low at 6 45 kg cod day and then it increased to 12 25 kg cod day between september and march with active denitrification fig 2c 4 2 model calibration with the pilot operation results the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and diffusion coefficient of soluble components in the numerical model were determined using the pilot operation data more emphasis on the data collected from august to march fig 2 table 3 based on the comprehensive model calibration the biofilm thickness was found to range from 1000 to 2000 μm figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 note that the scanning electron microscope sem image of the biofilms and mabr membrane fibers in fig s7 was taken after the biofilms shrank and partially fell off while the membrane sample was processed and dried for the sem analysis also the determined biofilm thickness range is consistent with those observed or used in other mabr studies 8 13 16 42 61 62 based on the model calibration in fig 2 1500 μm was used for the biofilm thickness in the study although the estimated biofilm thickness ranged from 1000 to 2000 μm figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 the calibrated liquid film thickness approximately 250 μm using the comprehensive model was also consistent with assumed values in other mabr model studies 18 63 65 although it was reported in another mabr study that the liquid film thickness should be smaller than 100 μm under a sufficient mixing condition in mabr reactors 8 the liquid film thickness in the pilot mabr was expected to be thicker than 100 μm during our pilot operation due to the relatively mild mixing condition using exhaust air from the mabr cassette 43 4 3 biological reactions in biofilm versus bulk in the model calibration with the pilot data the ammonia removal in the biofilm represented 77 of the total ammonia removal during the pilot operation while 23 of the total ammonia 0 8 kg n day was removed in the bulk solution table 4 this result is consistent with another lab scale experimental study where the ammonia removal in the biofilm was higher than that in the bulk solution 24 although the nitrification rate in the biofilm was considerable 0 27 kg n day nitrification was limited in the bulk solution due to the absence of dissolved oxygen on the other hand denitrification in the bulk solution was substantial 82 of the total nitrate removal and only 18 was denitrified in the biofilm table 4 as a result of active denitrification in the bulk solution 40 of the total cod removal 5 0 out of 12 7 kg cod day was achieved in the bulk solution this finding clearly indicates that that the biological reactions in the bulk solution should not be ignored in mabr operation while there are no previously studies reporting the importance of the biological reactions in the bulk solution 4 4 distribution of soluble components in the biofilm in the model simulation with 1500 μm thick biofilms other model parameters in tables 1 3 oxygen diffused up to 600 μm from the membrane surface forming an inner aerobic layer for nitrification fig 3 a this aerobic layer thickness is comparable with previously reported ranges in lab scale mabr systems 300 700 μm 21 42 66 67 the oxygen concentration became practically zero 0 01 mg l at 600 μm from the membrane surface creating an outer anoxic layer of the biofilm for denitrification based on the comprehensive model simulation results the biofilm thickness must be at least 600 μm for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr this model result is consistent with the suggested range in another mabr study for optimal biofilm thickness to achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr 600 1200 μm 8 ammonia concentration in the biofilm decreased gradually from 8 mg n l at the interface between the biofilm and liquid film to 0 mg n l at the membrane surface creating a concentration gradient for the diffusive transport of ammonia to the inner layer of biofilm where ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate fig 3b and c it should be noted that there was no considerable residual ammonia concentration near the membrane due to active ammonia removal indicating that oxygen transport from the membrane surface was sufficient for ammonia oxidation in the mabr simulation the importance of oxygen in ammonia removal is consistent with other studies that emphasized the role of oxygen transport for efficient nitrification in mabr 5 20 30 therefore it is recommended that mabr membrane fibers be manufactured or coated with materials of high oxygen selectivity for enhanced nitrification although nitrate was consistently high across the biofilms 3 0 mg n l and oxygen concentration was negligible beyond 600 μm fig 3a active denitrification was driven only in the narrow range of 1300 1500 μm i e 200 μm from the interface with the liquid film fig 3c because of the limited soluble cod concentration in the biofilm fig 3d this finding indicates that soluble cod transport is the rate limiting factor for denitrification in the biofilm due to relatively low soluble cod concentration in the bulk scod 22 mg cod l with c n ratio 2 2 g cod g n this limited denitrification result is consistent with the results of another mabr study where it was mentioned that the c n ratio should be maintained higher than 5 g cod g n to allow efficient denitrification 28 therefore soluble cod availability in the biofilm is the rate limiting factor for the rapid denitrification in mabr systems in an addition model simulation with a doubled soluble cod concentration in the bulk from 22 to 44 mg cod l the denitrification rate was increased nine times from 0 1 to 0 9 kg n m3 therefore high soluble cod is recommended for enhanced denitrification in mabr although fresh air was introduced from the top of the membrane fibers and travelled down to the bottom end of the membrane fibers it was noticed that there were not significant changes in the removal rate of ammonia nitrite and cod and the microbial population along the air flow direction for example the ammonia removal rate at the bottom of the membrane was lower than that at the membrane top by only 8 from 0 282 to 0 260 kg n day on the other hand the nitrate removal rate changed along the fiber height where the nitrate creation was dominant in the upper part of the mabr membrane and the nitrate removal was dominant in the lower part of the membrane 0 025 kg n day because of oxygen diffusion along the membrane height based on this model simulation result it is recommended to use longer membrane fibers 2 m to achieve more efficient oxygen utilization in mabr operation 4 5 effect of biofilm thickness thin biofilms were suitable for efficient ammonia removal and it was noticed that the highest ammonia removal rate 7 1 kg n day occurred at biofilm thickness of 300 μm fig 4 a for the biofilm thickness greater than 300 μm the ammonia removal rate decreased gradually with the increasing biofilm thickness because of ammonia diffusion through thick biofilms when the ammonia concentration in the bulk was doubled from 10 mg n l to 20 mg n l the ammonia removal rate at 300 μm thick biofilm was also the highest 12 4 kg n day and decreased gradually to 3 9 kg n day at biofilm thickness of 2000 μm indicating that the ammonia removal rate increased by 76 compared to ammonia concentration of 10 mg n l case this finding asserts that the ammonia loading rate i e ammonia concentration in the bulk solution governs the rate of nitrification in mabr the importance of the ammonia loading rate in ammonia removal is consistent with the pilot mabr operation fig 1a nitrite creation was dominant in mabr for biofilm thickness less than 700 μm due to the high ammonia oxidation rate and the high activity of aob over nob near the membrane surface fig 4a for thick biofilms 700 μm nitrite removal became balanced with nitrite creation resulting in a relatively low nitrite average removal rate 0 35 kg n day at a biofilm thickness of 1400 μm there was a balance between the nitrate creation and removal rates fig 4a although the outer anoxic layer was thick enough for denitrification nitrate creation was dominant up to a biofilm thickness of 1400 μm because the soluble cod concentration in the bulk solution was the governing factor on denitrification in mabr scod 22 mg cod l the maximum nitrate creation rate was observed at a biofilm thickness of 300 μm 3 9 kg n day corresponding to the highest ammonia oxidation rate 7 1 kg n day due to the absence of the anoxic layer for denitrification for a biofilm thickness larger than 1400 μm the net nitrate removal rate increased gradually to 1 1 kg n day biofilm thickness of 2000 μm when soluble cod concentration in the bulk is doubled scod 44 mg cod l the balance between the nitrate creation and removal occurred at biofilm thickness of 1000 μm and the maximum denitrification rate was 1 9 kg n day at a biofilm thickness of 2000 μm increasing by 73 these model simulation results are consistent with those results of the calibrated comprehensive model where it was recommended to maintain the biofilm thickness thicker than 600 μm for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in other studies it was also found that the optimal biofilm thickness to achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr was 1600 μm 10 600 1200 μm 8 and 750 1500 μm 61 as a result the determination of optimal biofilm thickness in mabr is highly dependent on the operational conditions e g c n ratio ammonia loading rate liquid film thickness and membrane material however a relative thick biofilm thickness 600 μm is generally preferred it was observed that the biofilm thickness should be at least 500 μm to minimize the contribution of aerobic cod removal in mabr fig 4b aerobic cod removal had a significant contribution to the total cod removal up to biofilm thickness of 200 μm 5 2 kg cod day representing 80 of total cod removal because of the absence of sufficient anoxic layer for denitrification however it became negligible and constant for biofilms thicker than 400 μm 1 2 kg cod day where only 11 of cod was utilized under aerobic conditions on the other hand the anoxic cod removal enhanced with the increasing biofilm thickness due to the formation of a wide anoxic layer allowing better removal of nitrate in the mabr for biofilms thicker than 800 μm anoxic cod removal represented 89 of the total cod removal 4 6 effect of liquid film thickness the liquid film thickness hardly affected the ammonia oxidation rate up to 300 μm fig 5 a because ammonia transport from the bulk solution to biofilm was sufficiently high table 3 however ammonia oxidation was governed by the bulk ammonia concentration thus the increasing ammonia concentration enhanced the ammonia oxidation rate in the biofilm up to 100 mg n l fig 5a indicating that the examined mabr operation conditions are suitable for municipal wastewater treatment where tkn ranges up to 100 mg n l 54 68 70 for high strength wastewater e g liquid downstream from dewatering processes 71 73 however the ammonia oxidation rate did not increase beyond 22 3 kg n day with the increasing bulk phase ammonia concentration above 200 mg n l fig 5a thin liquid films i e turbulent mixing conditions in the bulk solution significantly enhanced anoxic cod removal i e denitrification fig 5b the anoxic cod removal rate increased by 230 with the decreasing liquid film thickness from 300 to 50 μm because thin liquid films allowed rapid transport of soluble cod from the bulk to biofilm this finding is consistent with the results of other studies that demonstrated a negative correlation between the liquid film thickness and cod removal in a bench scale submerged rotating disc biofilm reactor 74 and a lab scale moving bed biofilm reactor 75 denitrification was enhanced with the increasing soluble cod in the bulk fig 5b indicating that denitrification in the biofilm is limited by soluble cod thus it can be concluded that denitrification is sensitive to the liquid film thickness while ammonia oxidation can hardly be affected by the mass transport resistance in the liquid film based on the model simulation results it is highly recommended that turbulent mixing conditions be established for effective denitrification although nitrification will be achieved regardless of mixing conditions 4 7 effect of c n ratio the decreasing c n ratio enhanced the ammonia oxidation rate for the bulk ammonia concentration higher than 100 mg n l however the c n ratio did not affect ammonia oxidation for ammonia concentration from 10 to 100 mg n l fig 6 this finding negligible effect of the c n ratio for low ammonia concentration is consistent with the pilot operation results fig 1d indicating sufficient oxygen supply and thus no competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen at the membrane surface on the other hand the ammonia oxidation rate decreased substantially with the increasing c n ratio for ammonia concentration of 200 1000 mg n l high strength wastewater due to the competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen for bulk ammonia concentration higher than 400 mg n l the ammonia removal rate was insensitive to the change in the c n ratio from 4 to 10 g cod g n because of the large amount of organics in the biofilm resulting in a greater growth rate of x h compared to x a o b although the c n ratio is not an important parameter in mabr operation for municipal wastewater the c n ratio must be reflected in mabr operation for high strength wastewater 5 conclusions a comprehensive mabr model was established to simulate the mass transport and biological reactions in the mabr biofilm the model was further extended to include the oxygen partial pressure along the mabr membrane fiber and the biological reactions in the bulk solution because active denitrification in the bulk solution cannot be neglected in mabr operation also a pilot scale mabr cassette was operated in a municipal wastewater treatment facility with an emphasis on enhanced denitrification in the pilot operation the increasing influent ammonia loading rate and increasing oxygen supply rate enhanced the ammonia removal rate however the influent c n ratio hardly affected the ammonia removal rate moreover active nitrification in the mabr biofilm caused decreases in the effluent ph the pilot operation data over 14 months were used to calibrate the comprehensive numerical model by determining the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and diffusivity of soluble components the numerical simulation results indicated that the bulk ammonia concentration is a dominant parameter on efficient nitrification in the mabr biofilm for municipal wastewater while the bulk ammonia concentration showed insignificant effects on nitrification for high strength wastewater moreover low soluble cod can limit active denitrification in the mabr biofilm based on the model simulation results the biofilm thickness should be maintained at 600 μm or thicker to house both the aerobic and anoxic zones in the biofilm it was also found that the liquid film thickness is not an important factor for nitrification however thick liquid films limit denitrification because of the slow transport of soluble cod through the liquid film the c n ratio becomes an important parameter in mabr operation only for high strength wastewater due to the competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen therefore numerical

heterogeneous media the air permeable membrane layered biofilms liquid film and bulk to better understand large scale mabr performance under real operation conditions a comprehensive mabr model was developed and model calibration was completed with a pilot scale mabr system for the pilot system operated with municipal wastewater mixed with return activated sludge the biofilm thickness was 1000 2000 μm the liquid film thickness was 200 300 μm and the diffusivity of the soluble components in the biofilm was 10 45 of that in the infinite dilute solution in the pilot operation the ammonia

600 μm for snd thin liquid films i e sufficient mixing conditions are necessary for active denitrification as the slow transport of soluble organics through the liquid film limits denitrification

introduction high levels of nitrogen nutrients e g ammonia nitrate and organic nitrogen can be present in various wastewater streams including domestic wastewater agricultural wastewater and animal manure waste excessive release of nitrogen nutrients into natural water systems can cause serious environmental problems such as algal bloom formation and eutrophication that threaten the aquatic ecosystem 1 3 therefore nitrogen nutrient removal is essential in modern wastewater treatment systems 4 6 conventional activated sludge is widely used in municipal wastewater treatment for ammonia and organic nitrogen removal by nitrification however it requires high oxygen demands increasing the aeration cost coupled with a long solids retention time increasing the pumping cost 7 9 also additional reactors are necessary for complete denitrification requiring a large footprint for wastewater treatment facilities 10 biological nitrification and denitrification can also be achieved using attached growth bioreactors such as trickling filters moving bed biofilm reactors and rotating biological contactors membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs are a relatively new treatment method which is considered as a promising alternative for conventional attached growth reactors for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd with a significant reduction of the facility size and operation cost 11 17 in mabr operation oxygen is provided through gas permeable membranes to the biofilm as a result the aerobic zone is formed in the inner layers of the biofilm for nitrification while the anoxic zone is created in the outer layers of the biofilm for denitrification 3 6 10 12 since soluble organics are readily diffused from the bulk solution to the outer biofilm mabrs are known to achieve more efficient denitrification compared to conventional attached growth reactors 8 9 12 15 numerical modeling of mabr is important to comprehensively describe the rate mechanisms and identify the complex correlation between the process parameters numerical models can also be used for assessing the performance of mabr under various operational conditions 18 therefore numerical modeling leads to better conceptual understanding for the mabr operation as the level of complexity can be selected based on the resources availability and aimed accuracy 19 21 numerical comprehensive model including the biological reactions in the biofilm oxygen partial pressure along the membrane fiber and biological reactions in the bulk solution is essential to detect the sophisticated relations between model parameters in the mabr operation also model calibration with pilot scale operation data is significantly important as it forms robust models to reflect realistic values for the model parameters compared to those determined using lab scale results most of other mabr studies have examined the feasibility of mabr based on lab scale experiments with specific focuses on nitrification

operational conditions on nitrogen removal 18 20 33 describe the microbial community in the biofilm 34 and determine the removal mechanisms in mabr 12 35 also other mabr studies combined lab scale experimental work with numerical modeling to show the importance of oxygen concentration 36 39 c n ratio and biofilm thickness 8 and ph and alkalinity 14 on cod and nitrogen removal in mabr the calibration of numerical models with mabr pilot scale operation data is significantly important because some model parameters are difficult to be measured during the complicated system operation 40 41 however there is no previous model calibration study with mabr pilot scale operation to determine the important parameters in mabr e g biofilm thickness liquid film thickness i e boundary diffusive layer between the biofilm and bulk and diffusion coefficient of soluble components operational conditions play an important role in cod and nitrogen removal in mabrs in other mabr studies the oxygen concentration at the membrane surface and bulk solution was found to govern the efficiency of nitrification in mabr 4 22 24 36 37 it was also found that the influent ammonia loading rate controls ammonia removal in mabr 5 38 two other critical operational factors are the c n ratio and influent cod concentration as they affect the microbial competition between autotrophic bacteria for nitrification and heterotrophic bacteria for denitrification in mabr biofilms 6 18 23 28 42 especially denitrification can be dramatically improved by adjusting the oxygen flux as a function of the influent cod and ammonia loadings 8 however the effect of the c n ratio on nitrification for high strength wastewater e g downstream liquid from dewatering processes with higher levels of ammonia nitrogen than typical municipal wastewater has not been investigated in mabr also there were no systematic investigations on the liquid film thickness for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in this study the main objectives are to 1 develop a comprehensive model to simulate the mass transport and biological reactions in the mabr biofilm and bulk solution including the oxygen partial pressure changes along the membrane fiber 2 calibrate the comprehensive model with mabr pilot scale operation data to estimate the important model parameters 3 identify the rate limiting parameters on nitrification and denitrification in mabr for low and high strength wastewater and 4 assess the effect of operational conditions e g biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and c n ratio on nitrification and denitrification in mabr 2 pilot mabr experiments 2 1 pilot mabr installation and operation a pilot mabr reactor was built in a container with an effective wastewater volume of 16 5 m3 where a mabr cassette 3 0 m in length 1 75 m in width and 2 15 m in depth was immersed zeelung mabr module suez water technologies solutions canada fig s1 the mabr cassette contained 300 000 cords and each cord consisted of a central string providing mechanical strength and 40 gas permeable membrane fibers length 2 0 m inner diameter 70 μm outer diameter 95 μm each membrane fiber provided an effective surface area of 4 4 10 4 m2 for biofilm attachment resulting in a total surface area of 1920 m2 in the pilot rector the mabr pilot reactor was installed in a local municipal wastewater treatment facility between the primary clarifiers and aeration tanks of conventional activated sludge adelaide wastewater treatment plant london ontario canada the primary clarifier effluent mixed with the return activated sludge ras was continuously introduced into the pilot reactor to examine the nitrification and denitrification capacity with an extra nitrate input from ras table 1 the wastewater flow rate was 45 4 7 m3 hr resulting in a very short mean hydraulic retention time in the mabr reactor 22 min the pilot operation was initiated in february 2017 and operated for 14 months until march 2018 during the pilot operation fresh air was continuously provided to the mabr cassette and the air traveled from the top to the bottom of individual gas permeable membrane fibers as the air flew inside the membrane fiber oxygen was transported from the membrane surface into the attached biofilm only by diffusion requiring a significantly low pressure 0 34 atm and low air flow rate 8 m3 hr the oxygen partial pressure of the inlet and exhaust air was monitored every weekday using a hand held oxygen partial pressure sensor max o2 ae by maxtec usa to estimate the rate of oxygen consumption the exhaust air from the mabr cassette was collected in separate air pockets beneath the mabr cassette and the collected exhaust air was released every 90 s to provide a partial mixing condition 43 the influent and effluent samples were collected and analyzed for cod chemical oxygen demand nh4 n ammonia no3 n nitrate and tss total suspended solids every weekday according to the standard methods 44 on the other hand no2 n nitrite and vss volatile suspended solids were analyzed once a week 44 the influent and effluent were also monitored for temperature and ph using real time thermometers endress and hauser switzerland and ph probes george fisher switzerland respectively 2 2 mabr pilot operation data the raw pilot operation measurements ammonia nitrite nitrate and cod

simulate the biological reactions in the mabr biofilm based on iwa asm3 international water association activated sludge model no 3 46 and the biological reactions in another mabr model study 8 the

table s2 the effect of ph on nitrification was reflected on the maximum specific growth rate of x a o b μ a o b table 2 the reaction kinetics for soluble cod s c o d utilization by x h particulate cod x s hydrolysis into s c o d and microbial respiration reactions were also included in the model table s2 the daily temperature condition in the pilot operation data was reflected for the individual biological reactions using temperature correction factor θ table 2 in the biofilm the soluble components s n h 4 s n o 2 s n o 3 s o 2 and s c o d were mobile by diffusion while the particulate components x a o b x n o b x h and x s were assumed to be immobile 3 2 boundary conditions the concentration of soluble components at the interface between the liquid film and bulk was defined using the measured effluent concentration during the pilot operation table 1 soluble components except for oxygen diffused from the bulk to biofilm in the liquid film where biological reactions were assumed to be negligible on the membrane surface x 0 it was assumed that there is no flux for each of the soluble components except for oxygen eq 3 while the oxygen concentration s o 2 at the membrane surface was defined by henry s law eq 4 3 d s i d x x 0 0 where s i is an individual soluble component except for oxygen and x is the distance from the membrane surface 4 s o 2 p o 2 k h where s o 2 is the oxygen concentration mg o2 l p o 2 is the oxygen partial pressure atm and k h is the henry s law constant k h 0 024 atm mg o2 l at 25 c note that the henry s law constant was corrected for pilot operation temperature conditions using van t hoff equation 47 3 3 numerical solution methods and model verification the nine steady state mass balance equations for individual soluble s n h 4 s n o 2 s n o 3 s o 2 and s c o d and particulate x a o b x n o b x h and x s components were discretized by the finite difference methods table s2 48 in the finite difference method the biofilm was evenly divided into fifty grids regardless of the biofilm thickness the 450 discretized mass balance equations 50 grids 9 components were solved numerically by the fixed point iteration approach 48 the built numerical model was validated by comparing simulation results with another mabr model study fig s2 8 3 4 model expansion for 2 0 m long mabr membrane the one dimensional biofilm model was expanded to reflect the changes in the oxygen partial pressure p o 2 along the air flow direction from the top to the bottom of an individual mabr fiber in the pilot operation the average oxygen partial pressure decreased from 0 209 atm inlet p o 2 to 0 157 0 01 atm exhaust p o 2 along the air flow direction in the 2 0 meter long air permeable hollow membrane fiber the 2 0 m long membrane was discretized into ten segments in the direction of air flow and it was assumed that the oxygen partial pressure changes linearly from the inlet to exhaust p o 2 along the membrane height the oxygen partial pressure in each membrane segment was then applied to the henry s law equation eq 4 to determine the oxygen concentration at the membrane surface 3 5 biological reactions in bulk solution the biological reactions in the bulk solution pilot reactor effective volume of 16 5 m3 were combined with the biofilm biological reactions to build a comprehensive mabr model the rates of individual biological reactions were calculated based on the effluent characteristics of the daily pilot operation table 1 using asm3 tables 2 and s2 8 46 the biomass fractions were assumed as 13 60 for x h 0 027 for x a o b 0 018 for x n o b 50 for x s and the rest for x i 50 51 the daily wastewater temperature and ph conditions were reflected on the biological reactions in the bulk and biofilm table 2 3 6 model calibration using pilot operation data the comprehensive model including the biological reactions in the bulk solution and the biofilms on the 2 0 m long fibers was calibrated using the daily pilot operation data over 14 months to determine the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and the diffusion coefficient of soluble components in the biofilm table 3 the daily operation data of the pilot reactor effluent concentrations of ammonia nitrite nitrate cod inlet and exhaust oxygen partial pressure wastewater temperature and ph were used in the model calibration 4 results and discussion 4 1 the mabr pilot operation results in the pilot mabr operation the ammonia removal rate was enhanced with the increasing influent ammonia loading rate fig 1 a and increasing oxygen supply rate fig 1b the ammonia removal rate increased linearly with the increasing ammonia loading rate up to 1 25 kg n m3 day fig 1a indicating that mabr can effectively handle high ammonia loading conditions this finding is consistent with another mabr study where efficient ammonia removal at high ammonia loading rates up to 1 50 kg n m3 day was demonstrated 24 efficient oxygen transfer from the membrane to biofilms was critical for enhanced ammonia removal fig 1b note that the membrane material of the mabr pilot was suez zeelung media the membrane material is known to control the oxygen transfer efficiency through the membrane surface in other mabr studies hollow fiber membranes made of polydimethyl siloxane 54 and silicone based membranes 11 were examined for efficient oxygen transfer in ammonia removal moreover the oxygen supply pressure through the membrane fibers is an important factor in efficient ammonia removal in the mabr 3 55 the ammonia removal rate was enhanced with the decreasing effluent ph fig 1c while the influent c n ratio hardly affected the ammonia removal rate in the pilot mabr operation fig 1d although the range of bulk solution ph was narrow 7 1 7 5 low ph was correlated to enhanced ammonia removal during the pilot operation fig 1c this finding is not consistent with the well known low ph inhibition on nitrification 56 57 indicating that the bulk solution ph does not represent the ph condition in the mabr biofilm as previously claimed 58 it was also found in other mabr studies that nitrification reaction in biofilms can affect the bulk ph significantly 14 59 during the pilot operation the influent c n ratio varied in a wide range from 1 5 to 5 7 g cod g n however there were no clear relationships between the influent c n ratio and ammonia removal rate because the growth rate of xaob was insensitive to the influent c n ratio within the operated range of c n ratio fig 1d this finding is consistent with the results of other mabr studies where it was reported that ammonia removal was independent of the c n ratio 6 8 18 60 a clear seasonal dependency of the removal rate of ammonia nitrate and cod was observed during the pilot operation as high wastewater temperature enhanced the biological reactions in the mabr fig 2 and table s3 the ammonia removal rate ranged between 1 55 and 6 20 kg n d with an annual average rate of 3 75 kg n d fig 2a at the beginning of the mabr pilot operation february august biofilms were thin on the membrane surface indicating sufficient oxygen transport throughout the biofilm thickness while the ammonia removal rate increased quickly during this period february august there was limited nitrate removal until august because anoxic zones were not established in the biofilm fig 2b after the first seven months of the operation august and thereafter the nitrate removal rate increased rapidly as the biofilm was thick enough to have the outer anoxic layer for active denitrification fig 2b this trend of the nitrate removal rate was consistent with that of the cod removal rate during the pilot operation fig 2b and c for the first seven months of the mabr operation february august the average cod removal rate was relatively low at 6 45 kg cod day and then it increased to 12 25 kg cod day between september and march with active denitrification fig 2c 4 2 model calibration with the pilot operation results the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and diffusion coefficient of soluble components in the numerical model were determined using the pilot operation data more emphasis on the data collected from august to march fig 2 table 3 based on the comprehensive model calibration the biofilm thickness was found to range from 1000 to 2000 μm figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 note that the scanning electron microscope sem image of the biofilms and mabr membrane fibers in fig s7 was taken after the biofilms shrank and partially fell off while the membrane sample was processed and dried for the sem analysis also the determined biofilm thickness range is consistent with those observed or used in other mabr studies 8 13 16 42 61 62 based on the model calibration in fig 2 1500 μm was used for the biofilm thickness in the study although the estimated biofilm thickness ranged from 1000 to 2000 μm figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 the calibrated liquid film thickness approximately 250 μm using the comprehensive model was also consistent with assumed values in other mabr model studies 18 63 65 although it was reported in another mabr study that the liquid film thickness should be smaller than 100 μm under a sufficient mixing condition in mabr reactors 8 the liquid film thickness in the pilot mabr was expected to be thicker than 100 μm during our pilot operation due to the relatively mild mixing condition using exhaust air from the mabr cassette 43 4 3 biological reactions in biofilm versus bulk in the model calibration with the pilot data the ammonia removal in the biofilm represented 77 of the total ammonia removal during the pilot operation while 23 of the total ammonia 0 8 kg n day was removed in the bulk solution table 4 this result is consistent with another lab scale experimental study where the ammonia removal in the biofilm was higher than that in the bulk solution 24 although the nitrification rate in the biofilm was considerable 0 27 kg n day nitrification was limited in the bulk solution due to the absence of dissolved oxygen on the other hand denitrification in the bulk solution was substantial 82 of the total nitrate removal and only 18 was denitrified in the biofilm table 4 as a result of active denitrification in the bulk solution 40 of the total cod removal 5 0 out of 12 7 kg cod day was achieved in the bulk solution this finding clearly indicates that that the biological reactions in the bulk solution should not be ignored in mabr operation while there are no previously studies reporting the importance of the biological reactions in the bulk solution 4 4 distribution of soluble components in the biofilm in the model simulation with 1500 μm thick biofilms other model parameters in tables 1 3 oxygen diffused up to 600 μm from the membrane surface forming an inner aerobic layer for nitrification fig 3 a this aerobic layer thickness is comparable with previously reported ranges in lab scale mabr systems 300 700 μm 21 42 66 67 the oxygen concentration became practically zero 0 01 mg l at 600 μm from the membrane surface creating an outer anoxic layer of the biofilm for denitrification based on the comprehensive model simulation results the biofilm thickness must be at least 600 μm for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr this model result is consistent with the suggested range in another mabr study for optimal biofilm thickness to achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr 600 1200 μm 8 ammonia concentration in the biofilm decreased gradually from 8 mg n l at the interface between the biofilm and liquid film to 0 mg n l at the membrane surface creating a concentration gradient for the diffusive transport of ammonia to the inner layer of biofilm where ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate fig 3b and c it should be noted that there was no considerable residual ammonia concentration near the membrane due to active ammonia removal indicating that oxygen transport from the membrane surface was sufficient for ammonia oxidation in the mabr simulation the importance of oxygen in ammonia removal is consistent with other studies that emphasized the role of oxygen transport for efficient nitrification in mabr 5 20 30 therefore it is recommended that mabr membrane fibers be manufactured or coated with materials of high oxygen selectivity for enhanced nitrification although nitrate was consistently high across the biofilms 3 0 mg n l and oxygen concentration was negligible beyond 600 μm fig 3a active denitrification was driven only in the narrow range of 1300 1500 μm i e 200 μm from the interface with the liquid film fig 3c because of the limited soluble cod concentration in the biofilm fig 3d this finding indicates that soluble cod transport is the rate limiting factor for denitrification in the biofilm due to relatively low soluble cod concentration in the bulk scod 22 mg cod l with c n ratio 2 2 g cod g n this limited denitrification result is consistent with the results of another mabr study where it was mentioned that the c n ratio should be maintained higher than 5 g cod g n to allow efficient denitrification 28 therefore soluble cod availability in the biofilm is the rate limiting factor for the rapid denitrification in mabr systems in an addition model simulation with a doubled soluble cod concentration in the bulk from 22 to 44 mg cod l the denitrification rate was increased nine times from 0 1 to 0 9 kg n m3 therefore high soluble cod is recommended for enhanced denitrification in mabr although fresh air was introduced from the top of the membrane fibers and travelled down to the bottom end of the membrane fibers it was noticed that there were not significant changes in the removal rate of ammonia nitrite and cod and the microbial population along the air flow direction for example the ammonia removal rate at the bottom of the membrane was lower than that at the membrane top by only 8 from 0 282 to 0 260 kg n day on the other hand the nitrate removal rate changed along the fiber height where the nitrate creation was dominant in the upper part of the mabr membrane and the nitrate removal was dominant in the lower part of the membrane 0 025 kg n day because of oxygen diffusion along the membrane height based on this model simulation result it is recommended to use longer membrane fibers 2 m to achieve more efficient oxygen utilization in mabr operation 4 5 effect of biofilm thickness thin biofilms were suitable for efficient ammonia removal and it was noticed that the highest ammonia removal rate 7 1 kg n day occurred at biofilm thickness of 300 μm fig 4 a for the biofilm thickness greater than 300 μm the ammonia removal rate decreased gradually with the increasing biofilm thickness because of ammonia diffusion through thick biofilms when the ammonia concentration in the bulk was doubled from 10 mg n l to 20 mg n l the ammonia removal rate at 300 μm thick biofilm was also the highest 12 4 kg n day and decreased gradually to 3 9 kg n day at biofilm thickness of 2000 μm indicating that the ammonia removal rate increased by 76 compared to ammonia concentration of 10 mg n l case this finding asserts that the ammonia loading rate i e ammonia concentration in the bulk solution governs the rate of nitrification in mabr the importance of the ammonia loading rate in ammonia removal is consistent with the pilot mabr operation fig 1a nitrite creation was dominant in mabr for biofilm thickness less than 700 μm due to the high ammonia oxidation rate and the high activity of aob over nob near the membrane surface fig 4a for thick biofilms 700 μm nitrite removal became balanced with nitrite creation resulting in a relatively low nitrite average removal rate 0 35 kg n day at a biofilm thickness of 1400 μm there was a balance between the nitrate creation and removal rates fig 4a although the outer anoxic layer was thick enough for denitrification nitrate creation was dominant up to a biofilm thickness of 1400 μm because the soluble cod concentration in the bulk solution was the governing factor on denitrification in mabr scod 22 mg cod l the maximum nitrate creation rate was observed at a biofilm thickness of 300 μm 3 9 kg n day corresponding to the highest ammonia oxidation rate 7 1 kg n day due to the absence of the anoxic layer for denitrification for a biofilm thickness larger than 1400 μm the net nitrate removal rate increased gradually to 1 1 kg n day biofilm thickness of 2000 μm when soluble cod concentration in the bulk is doubled scod 44 mg cod l the balance between the nitrate creation and removal occurred at biofilm thickness of 1000 μm and the maximum denitrification rate was 1 9 kg n day at a biofilm thickness of 2000 μm increasing by 73 these model simulation results are consistent with those results of the calibrated comprehensive model where it was recommended to maintain the biofilm thickness thicker than 600 μm for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in other studies it was also found that the optimal biofilm thickness to achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in mabr was 1600 μm 10 600 1200 μm 8 and 750 1500 μm 61 as a result the determination of optimal biofilm thickness in mabr is highly dependent on the operational conditions e g c n ratio ammonia loading rate liquid film thickness and membrane material however a relative thick biofilm thickness 600 μm is generally preferred it was observed that the biofilm thickness should be at least 500 μm to minimize the contribution of aerobic cod removal in mabr fig 4b aerobic cod removal had a significant contribution to the total cod removal up to biofilm thickness of 200 μm 5 2 kg cod day representing 80 of total cod removal because of the absence of sufficient anoxic layer for denitrification however it became negligible and constant for biofilms thicker than 400 μm 1 2 kg cod day where only 11 of cod was utilized under aerobic conditions on the other hand the anoxic cod removal enhanced with the increasing biofilm thickness due to the formation of a wide anoxic layer allowing better removal of nitrate in the mabr for biofilms thicker than 800 μm anoxic cod removal represented 89 of the total cod removal 4 6 effect of liquid film thickness the liquid film thickness hardly affected the ammonia oxidation rate up to 300 μm fig 5 a because ammonia transport from the bulk solution to biofilm was sufficiently high table 3 however ammonia oxidation was governed by the bulk ammonia concentration thus the increasing ammonia concentration enhanced the ammonia oxidation rate in the biofilm up to 100 mg n l fig 5a indicating that the examined mabr operation conditions are suitable for municipal wastewater treatment where tkn ranges up to 100 mg n l 54 68 70 for high strength wastewater e g liquid downstream from dewatering processes 71 73 however the ammonia oxidation rate did not increase beyond 22 3 kg n day with the increasing bulk phase ammonia concentration above 200 mg n l fig 5a thin liquid films i e turbulent mixing conditions in the bulk solution significantly enhanced anoxic cod removal i e denitrification fig 5b the anoxic cod removal rate increased by 230 with the decreasing liquid film thickness from 300 to 50 μm because thin liquid films allowed rapid transport of soluble cod from the bulk to biofilm this finding is consistent with the results of other studies that demonstrated a negative correlation between the liquid film thickness and cod removal in a bench scale submerged rotating disc biofilm reactor 74 and a lab scale moving bed biofilm reactor 75 denitrification was enhanced with the increasing soluble cod in the bulk fig 5b indicating that denitrification in the biofilm is limited by soluble cod thus it can be concluded that denitrification is sensitive to the liquid film thickness while ammonia oxidation can hardly be affected by the mass transport resistance in the liquid film based on the model simulation results it is highly recommended that turbulent mixing conditions be established for effective denitrification although nitrification will be achieved regardless of mixing conditions 4 7 effect of c n ratio the decreasing c n ratio enhanced the ammonia oxidation rate for the bulk ammonia concentration higher than 100 mg n l however the c n ratio did not affect ammonia oxidation for ammonia concentration from 10 to 100 mg n l fig 6 this finding negligible effect of the c n ratio for low ammonia concentration is consistent with the pilot operation results fig 1d indicating sufficient oxygen supply and thus no competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen at the membrane surface on the other hand the ammonia oxidation rate decreased substantially with the increasing c n ratio for ammonia concentration of 200 1000 mg n l high strength wastewater due to the competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen for bulk ammonia concentration higher than 400 mg n l the ammonia removal rate was insensitive to the change in the c n ratio from 4 to 10 g cod g n because of the large amount of organics in the biofilm resulting in a greater growth rate of x h compared to x a o b although the c n ratio is not an important parameter in mabr operation for municipal wastewater the c n ratio must be reflected in mabr operation for high strength wastewater 5 conclusions a comprehensive mabr model was established to simulate the mass transport and biological reactions in the mabr biofilm the model was further extended to include the oxygen partial pressure along the mabr membrane fiber and the biological reactions in the bulk solution because active denitrification in the bulk solution cannot be neglected in mabr operation also a pilot scale mabr cassette was operated in a municipal wastewater treatment facility with an emphasis on enhanced denitrification in the pilot operation the increasing influent ammonia loading rate and increasing oxygen supply rate enhanced the ammonia removal rate however the influent c n ratio hardly affected the ammonia removal rate moreover active nitrification in the mabr biofilm caused decreases in the effluent ph the pilot operation data over 14 months were used to calibrate the comprehensive numerical model by determining the biofilm thickness liquid film thickness and diffusivity of soluble components the numerical simulation results indicated that the bulk ammonia concentration is a dominant parameter on efficient nitrification in the mabr biofilm for municipal wastewater while the bulk ammonia concentration showed insignificant effects on nitrification for high strength wastewater moreover low soluble cod can limit active denitrification in the mabr biofilm based on the model simulation results the biofilm thickness should be maintained at 600 μm or thicker to house both the aerobic and anoxic zones in the biofilm it was also found that the liquid film thickness is not an important factor for nitrification however thick liquid films limit denitrification because of the slow transport of soluble cod through the liquid film the c n ratio becomes an important parameter in mabr operation only for high strength wastewater due to the competition between x h and x a o b for oxygen therefore numerical modeling of mabr coupled with pilot scale calibration is essential for better understanding of the complex removal mechanisms and relations between numerous model parameters in mabr declaration of

13612,anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs the combination of anaerobic digestion and membrane technology have gained increasing popularity due to their remarkable advantages over aerobic membrane bioreactors such as biogas production and potential energy use however membrane fouling remains a challenging issue that deteriorates the performance of membrane and shortens its lifespan pretreatment of feed wastewater by adding fouling reduction enhancers such as adsorbents and flocculants into anaerobic membrane bioreactor can effectively mitigate membrane fouling by altering the feed properties activated carbon such as powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac has been widely applied as an adsorbent to aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors for membrane fouling control organic enhancers such as biochar and waste yeast and inorganic enhancers like polyaluminum chloride and zeolite have also been applied to anmbrs promoting flocculation and coagulation thus this review discusses the impacts of different fouling reduction enhancers under anaerobic conditions as well as anmbr system in addition the mechanisms of the enhancers mitigating the membrane fouling are also summarized for better understanding of the effects of the enhancers in anmbrs abbreviations anmbr anaerobic membrane bioreactor pac powder activated carbon gac granular activated

bioreactor membrane fouling enhancers activated carbon 1 introduction in recent years anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr technology which combines anaerobic process and membrane filtration has been gaining increasing popularity anmbrs have the same benefits as aerobic mbrs such as a footprint reduction and superior permeate quality anmbrs also can provide several advantages over the aerobic processes including long solids retention time srt low sludge production and potential energy use 1 moreover as anmbr is the integration of anaerobic digestion process with membrane separation these processes can provide benefits as well anaerobic digestion process which involves four major stages of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis occurs in the bioreactor throughout this process organic materials are biodegraded into volatile fatty acids vfas and hydrogen as intermediate products and into methane as a final product 2 all these products can make the anmbr an energy neutral or even energy positive technology in addition unlike anaerobic digestion that requires mesophilic ranges from 35 to 37 anmbr can be operated in room temperature or even in cold temperatures by expanding srt which is both cost and energy efficient 3 however there are some issues that need further attention in anmbr technology one of the most challenging issues is membrane fouling which deteriorates the performance of membrane and shortens membrane lifespan membrane fouling generally occurs when the components of sludge interact with membrane material causing an initial pore blocking and cake layer formation it is reported that membrane fouling in anmbr has more severe impacts compared to the aerobic system in terms of pollutant removal efficiency and sludge characteristics even using the same membrane material 1 meng et al 4 also mentioned that the cake layer formed with anaerobic sludge might have a comparatively lower removability than that with aerobic sludge many researchers have carried out studies on alleviating membrane fouling which have involved pretreatment of feed wastewater optimization of operational conditions membrane module or surface modification 1 3 5 to control membrane fouling different pretreatment methods have been introduced such as alkaline pretreatment acid pretreatment ozone pretreatment and settling organic contaminants 6 9 some studies have shown that feed characteristics have significant impacts on the formation and compactness of the cake layer enhancers such as adsorbent agents carriers and other chemical agents can be effective in modifying the properties of feed water in anmbrs adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolite and bentonite promote adsorption and ion exchange phenomena coagulants including polyaluminum chloride and ferric chloride and suspended carriers can promote coagulation and flocculation respectively consequently enlarged floc size and decreased soluble organics in the supernatant can mitigate membrane fouling 1 10 to date there are many investigations of fouling control in aerobic mbrs by adding different additives as adsorbents 11 12 coagulants flocculants 13 16 and suspended carriers 17 however only a limited amount of research is available to investigate the effects of enhancers on fouling control in anaerobic mbrs additionally most review papers of fouling control in anmbrs have only focused on controlling operating conditions and overall mitigation strategies 1 5 18 19 this is the first review article that focuses on the different kinds of fouling reduction enhancers in anmbr and their influences on membrane fouling reduction effects of adding activated carbon including powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac on anmbr performance will firstly be discussed then the following sub sections will concentrate on the effects of adding other enhancers 2 enhancers to anmbr 2 1 activated carbon activated carbon ac has been widely applied in membrane bioreactors mbrs due to its high adsorption capability enhancement of biodegradation and subsequent removal of recalcitrant pollutants the addition of ac can also efficiently mitigate membrane fouling as it has high potential to enhance membrane flux as well as removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod and recalcitrant pollutants 20 21 moreover the use of ac in the anaerobic digestion process has been gaining more attention because it facilitated the alleviation of organic shock loading the enrichment of essential anaerobic microorganisms and the improvement of anaerobic digestion stability 21 there are two types of ac namely pac and gac pac has high porosity and large surface area which can lead to high adsorption capacity while removing odour colour and taste 21 compared to pac gac has larger size than pac which is more easily retained in the reactor and more economical when it is used continuously because gac can be regenerated by thermal process due to the larger size gac also has stronger physical interactions with the membrane surface 22 2 1 1 powdered activated carbon pac can reduce membrane fouling through three mechanisms firstly at the initial stage of pac addition adsorption of organic matters occurs which greatly removes the dissolved organic matters dom from wastewater secondly after initially adsorbing organic matters and becoming saturated microorganisms aggregate on the porous surfaces of pac particles as supporting medium for attached bacterial growth 23 finally the formation of biologically activated carbon bac promotes the degradation of pollutants and modifies the sludge properties which is the most important mechanism after the colonization of microorganisms the planktonic microorganisms transform into biofilm once attached bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substance eps it helps not only the attachment of microorganisms to biofilm but also the stabilisation of the biofilm structure the active biofilm continues to biodegrade organic compounds as well as to reduce the attachment of microorganisms on the membrane surface so that it can relieve the membrane biofouling 12 24 in addition the scouring effect of pac also alleviates membrane fouling as it can remove the deposited cake layer on membrane surface while limiting the accumulation of foulants 25 fig 1 illustrates the mechanism of fouling reduction when activated carbon is added more recent studies have confirmed that pac has positive effects on sludge morphology aggregation ability of sludge flocs and microbial properties and thus the pollutants removal mechanism can be enhanced the study by zhang et al 26 reported that pac addition in a submerged anmbr was able to form larger floc size of the sludge compared to anmbr without pac however in case of long term operation over 140 days the sludge diameter decreased from 20 66 μm to 17 00 μm which was contrary to the result from previous research about pac in anmbr 27 this may have resulted from the fact that pac enabled the generation of free living filamentous microbes after the long term operation and prevented the large floc size formation in mixed liquor in addition the sludge aggregation ability was able to be assessed using the total interaction energy which is a function of separation distance between the sludge surfaces it could be calculated by summing lifshitz van der waals energy lewis acid base energy and repulsive or attractive electrostatic double layer energy 28 29 pac addition showed highly negative value of total interaction energy per unit area of sludge which indicated that the characteristics of sludge surface has transformed into hydrophobicity and thus sludge cells adherence could be strengthened by stronger attractive interaction this improvement of aggregation ability led to more stable sludge flocs and potentially reduced the eps release which mitigated the pore blocking and irremovable membrane fouling 11 the increased bacterial diversity and evolution of the bacterial community were also attributed to pac addition creating additional microbial environment in the form of bac which promoted the enrichment and growth of some special functional bacteria the enrichment of acinetobacter comamonas flavobacterium and pseudomonas which can contribute to formation of sludge flocs and degradation of organics were highly promoted 28 when pac was applied in anaerobic batch biofilm reactors as a biofilm carrier for the enhancement of refractory compounds degradation it increased the abundance of methanothrix methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium which were favourable for the methane production 30 in a study of hu and stukey 31 1 7 g l of pac addition to submerged anmbr showed significant benefits for the removal of fine colloidal particles as well as membrane flux improvement and transmembrane pressure tmp reduction it was also found that pac addition showed 22 4 of increase rate in cod removal while gac showed no significant increase the reason why pac was more efficient than gac in terms of cod removal might be due to the greater surface area per mass than gac another study which applied 1 7 g l of pac as well showed 30 increased dissolved organic carbon doc removal and decrease in smp concentration 32 on the other hand when the more pac concentration of 4 g l was added the smp was rather accumulated while having excellent cod and colour removal efficiency 33 34 several studies have revealed that the pac addition not only decreased turbidity and colour but also removed potential foulants such as fine colloids and soluble microbial products smp which could lead to the reduction of fouling layer thickness 25 26 35 table 1 summarizes the effects of pac addition on membrane fouling control in submerged anmbrs pac can also be beneficial to anmbrs in terms of the removal of antibiotics which have negative impact on membrane fouling in fact the existence of antibiotics in anmbrs has worsened performance and issues associated with membrane fouling since it could lead to a decrease of the floc size and ph and an increase in the secretion of eps and smp moreover it could facilitate the development of microbial communities which had the most contribution to membrane fouling such as firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi 36 37 according to a review by cheng et al 38 the addition of antibiotics and combined antibiotics to anaerobic reactors such as sulfamethoxazole smx tetracycline tc erythromycin tetracycline sulfamethoxazole ets and erythromycin tetracycline st could cause negative effects on ph cod removal efficiency and biogas production both the ph value and cod removal efficiency in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors significantly decreased when the high concentration of antibiotics such as 45 mg l of smx 8 5 mg l of tc and 46 mg l of ets were added 39 41 biogas generation which is inherently related to cod removals under anaerobic conditions was inhibited as well and the reason for this might be the methanogenesis process was sensitive to the presence of antibiotics in anaerobic processes likewise 100 μg l of smx and tc in anaerobic aerobic mbr accelerated the rate of tmp rise and decreased the membrane fouling cycle from 25 days to 8 days in addition the fouling layer became denser and thicker with 20 μm of thickness furthermore higher concentration of two antibiotics 1000 μg l of smx and tc resulted in further decrease in membrane fouling cycle to 4 days and 40 μm of the fouling layer thickness 42 however the addition of activated carbon could remediate these negative results as a case in point the addition of pac into anmbr increased removal efficiencies of five different pharmaceuticals including smx trimethoprim tmp carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf and triclosan tcs by approximately 5 92 as the adsorption of pharmaceuticals to pac thermodynamically enhanced their biotransformation 43 although the optimal dosage of pac resulted in significant alleviation in membrane fouling overdosing might have contrary results due to its potential to become a foulant akram and stuckey 44 proposed that appropriate amount of pac should be added for the best improvement of performance of anmbr and membrane fouling amelioration in their research pac concentration of 1 67 g l highly improved the flux by more than four times while 3 4 g l of pac caused a decrease of flux and adsorption incapacity of pac to higher concentration of biomass the excessive dosage of pac could result in poor membrane filtration due to the increased sludge viscosity caused by the presence of more extracellular polymers moreover small pac particles 8 35 μm at high concentration in suspension increased turbidity of mixed liquor and caused more membrane pore blockage and abrasion 20 therefore the optimal pac dosage is effective for flux improvement and adsorption of fine solutes and regular replacement of aged pac with fresh pac is necessary 4 2 1 2 granular activated carbon in recent years the addition of gac has been extensively applied in anaerobic digestion process to enhance both reactor efficiency and abundance of special functional microorganisms anaerobic digestion process contains electron exchange between fermentative bacteria and methanogens in the form of metabolites such as acetate h2 and methanol previous studies have demonstrated that conductive additives like gac enabled direct electron exchange instead of metabolites which could eventually enhance methanogenic conversion of short chain fatty acids such as acetate butyrate and propionate and subsequent improvement of methane production 45 47 zhang et al 48 showed that gac remarkably promoted methanogenesis by enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer between fermentative bacteria geobacteraceae and methanogens methanosaetaceae another research has also concluded that surface modified gac with magnetite stimulated enrichment of electroactive bacteria such as shewanella pseudomonas geobacter and desulfuromonas enhancing the methane production by a degradation of propionate to acetates and electrons that can be utilized by methanogens 45 as a membrane fouling mitigation strategy methods of inducing unsteady state shear on the membrane surface such as bubbling and vibration have been applied to mbrs particle fluidization recently has been presented as an alternative to bubbling as it could have the same effect on membrane fouling reduction with at least ten times lower energy requirements than bubbling particularly the fluidization of gac has gained significant attention because larger gac was more effective during long term operation 49 50 therefore previous studies have reported that gac fluidization resulted in significant membrane fouling alleviation in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 51 56 in the studies of integrated anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor high amount of protein was adsorbed resulting in remarkable improvement of membrane filtration 52 53 the effect of gac fluidization has been demonstrated with its energy efficient and effective advantages unlike the popular air sparging method which required comparatively high energy costs 57 as gac fluidization is one way to induce unsteady state shear on membrane which has been identified as a cost effective method it could reduce the energy requirement in the process 58 as a case in point the electrical energy requirement for anaerobic fluidized bed ceramic membrane bioreactor operation was estimated to be 0 039 kw h m3 which was only 17 of electrical energy that can be generated from produced methane 59 the average energy consumption of gac fluidization is generally reported as 0 15 kw h m3 whereas that of gas sparging is twice higher which is 0 31 kw h m3 including pumping and mixing 60 the table 2 summarizes the effects of gac in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor in the research of ding et al 61 they added 50 g l of gac to an expanded membrane coupled granular sludge bed egsb and showed a remarkable enhancement of cod removals 80 vs 62 without pac and decrease in smp concentration the cake layer resistance which was the main fouling mechanism in membrane coupled egsb process was also decreased by 53 5 another research by wang et al 62 treating wastewater containing phenol and quinolone reported that a 2 g l of gac could not only remove cod and smp by adsorption but also enhance the degradation of phenol and quinolone the high adsorption capacity of gac could capture some fouling causing compounds like smp prior to attachment on membrane surface meanwhile gac could scour the foulants from the membrane surface and prevent the accumulation of foulants hence the use of gac as suspended medium effectively mitigated irreversible fouling 63 as a case in point the scouring effect of gac with flux of 16 l m2 h in a two stage anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor was able to mitigate membrane fouling along with effective removal of 20 commonly found pharmaceuticals i e ibuprofen caffeine and smx etc through adsorption and biodegradation 64 65 although having positive effects on membrane fouling control wu et al 55 suggested that the behaviour and characteristics of gac might have a harmful influence on membrane performance due to the fine carbon particles that are released from gac itself during fluidization the fouling could be aggravated by blocking the pores and forming a thin cake layer gac abrasion also led to a partial loss from the initial membrane quality the reduction in adsorption capacity of gac over time was also a major limitation thus the exhausted gac needs to be replaced or regenerated by thermal process to recover the adsorption capability 24 furthermore the energy requirements for fluidization and membrane fouling mitigation were significantly different depending on the particle size of gac as well as adsorption capacity when the adsorption of fresh gac predominantly took place comparatively small gac particles had greater effect on fouling reduction due to large surface area along with less energy consumption however after the adsorption capacity was exhausted dominant process for fouling reduction became the scouring effect then the relatively large gac particles were more effective in fouling reduction but more energy is required for fluidization 66 charfi et al 67 showed that 2 3 mm of gac particles acted as a better method of fouling reduction by removing cake layer on membrane surface whereas small particles from 0 18 mm to 0 5 mm rather intended to accumulate on membrane surface it was also found that although large particles were more effective in scouring due to inertial forces the energy requirement on fluidizing the particle was also higher 49 thus further studies are necessary for a better understanding of production of fine carbon particles gac abrasion and choosing suitable particle sizes for mitigating membrane fouling 2 2 other enhancers 2 2 1 biochar biochar is a porous and carbonaceous residue obtained from thermal decomposition of biomass in an oxygen deleted environment or from other processes such as pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonisation gasification and torrefaction it is usually produced at a lower temperature than 700 because reaction above 900 causes the destruction of walls between pores which results in widening of pores of biochar 68 69 unlike ac it is produced without any activation and this non activation makes the specific surface area of biochar less efficient compared to ac however the production cost of biochar is one tenth cheaper than that of ac 68 69 71 after a series of reactions of biomass such as dehydration depolymerisation and carbonisation during thermal decomposition three products namely condensable liquid bio oil non condensable gases syngas and biochar are produced which depends on the type of biomass used and process conditions i e temperature and residence time biochar usually consists of fixed carbon labile carbon and other volatile compounds as well as moisture and ash fast pyrolysis aims at liquid oil production whereas the goal of slow pyrolysis is biochar production as the slow evaporation of water and release of volatile components can result in an increase in relatively fixed carbon content of the solid 70 72 the heterogeneous surface of biochar which has both carbonised and non carbonised fractions accommodates several adsorption mechanisms physical adsorption surface precipitation and the pore filling are the major routes of adsorption moreover for positively charged organic compounds hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding of biochar surface are the important adsorption routes on the other hand the removal of inorganic compounds largely depends on electrostatic attraction precipitation and ion exchange 70 73 the addition of biochar on anaerobic digestion process has shown to be effective in terms of biogas production and selectively enriched microbial groups the biochar addition was able to enhance vfa production and degradation and improve both hydrogen and methane production 68 74 some studies demonstrated that better biogas production could be obtained from enhanced direct interspecies electron transfer diet process by enrichment of electrogenic geobacter and bacteroidetes which are potential direct interspecies electron transfer partners during anaerobic digestion 75 76 in addition since biochar contains redox active moieties such as quinines phenolics and phenazines they can catalyse the electron transfer between biochar and outer membrane cytochromes during redox reactions 77 78 moreover biochar addition significantly enhanced methanogenesis by facilitating the enrichment of methanosarcina even in high ammonium stress and also favoured anaerobic sludge granulation due to the ability of promoting biofilm formation and reducing the inhibition behaviour of ammonia 79 80 similar to the biogas yield enhancement biochar could facilitate hydrogen production via enrichment of hydrogen producing bacteria 81 the alleviation of sulphide toxicity during anaerobic treatment of sulphate rich wastewater using biochar was investigated and biochar promoted reactor stability by adsorption of h2s from biogas 82 due to the adsorption capability and functional groups on the surface biochar was also able to adsorb eps and enhance sludge granulation which could lead to significant mitigation of membrane fouling in aerobic mbrs 83 85 some previous studies have demonstrated that biochar could be beneficial to anaerobic membrane bioreactor bamboo charcoal one kind of biochar was able to enhance the removal performance of anmbr as well as mitigate membrane fouling in this study two anmbrs treating bamboo industry wastewater were analysed with and without bamboo charcoal addition the result showed that cod removal efficiency increased about 5 after the addition of bamboo charcoal as well as reduced membrane fouling owing to the decrease of both smp concentration and resistance of the fouling layer meanwhile the methane yield became higher as a result of greater microbial activity of dominant microorganisms in methane production such as methanosaeta methanospirillum and methanobacterium occurring additionally inside the pores of the bamboo charcoal 86 more recent study showed that membrane fouling was effectively reduced in a biochar amended anmbr along with 56 of decreased tmp rising rate and decreased proteins of eps in addition arcobacter one of the bio foulants that is involved in membrane biofouling was hardly accumulated due to the presence of biochar 87 2 2 2 waste yeast waste yeast is traditionally used as a protein supplement in animal feed or alimentary substrate for the food processing industry the brewing industry is the major source of spent yeast which also produces other residues in addition to brewery wastewater such as methanogens and small cellulosic particles 88 due to the high degradation capacity of yeast it was favourable in treatment of landfill leachate which contained high amount of recalcitrant compounds like phenolic compounds as well as toxic substances such as halogenated and heavy metals 89 yeast had lower tendency to adhere on membrane surfaces than other microorganisms so that its application in mbr can be beneficial in membrane fouling control and system operation 89 the presence of yeast in aerobic mbr could significantly remove not only cod colour and eps but also refractory substances including polyacrylamide 90 93 anaerobic co digestion which balances the nutrient component of different residues is widely applied as a way to dilute potential toxic compounds and enhance biogas production 94 some previous studies have demonstrated that additional co substrates in anaerobic wastewater treatment increased methane production by maintaining a ph level within the methanogenesis range between 7 0 and 7 5 while improving the degradation of low biodegradable substrates 88 95 97 the research on the supplementation of yeast in brewery wastewater treatment as a co substrate in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor showed enhanced biogas production by 50 while no significant changes in cod removal efficiency and accumulation of vfas were observed up to 1 1 v v of brewery yeast concentration 88 94 these results indicated that the additional waste yeast could be a feasible substrate in anaerobic digestion in terms of high biodegradability and biogas yield the supplementation of yeast wastes as co substrate in an anmbr can have positive effects on membrane fouling control as well a research by yun et al 98 investigated the effects of yeast on anmbr performance treating low grade coal wastewater lcww compared to no methane production in the absence of yeast wastes anmbr with yeast wastes gradually increased cod removal efficiency as well as methane production in addition the presence of yeast wastes showed the significant growth of some microorganisms such as methanococcus and methanosarcina which were responsible for the degradation of lcww and biogas production however due to the metabolism of these bacteria the fraction of smps and aromatic group with high molecular weight 1 kda also increased thus the addition of yeast wastes could be a potential alternative as an additive to anmbr due to their positive effects on biodegradation of lcww and growth of microorganisms but further research should be carried out to find out the effect on fouling control 2 2 3 iron iron which is the most abundant transition metal on the earth is also an essential component for the growth of most living organisms although iron itself is a non toxic and electron donor in redox reactions the presence of iron in anaerobic environment plays an important role in the electron cycling and metabolic activity of microorganisms 99 100 the fe ii and fe iii which are generated from several iron compounds can be provided as nutrients for microbial activity or as redox mediators to facilitate the conversion of organic matters to methane 100 one of the strong reductants zero valent iron zvi is an active anode material in electrocoagulation and electrically produces fe ii ions which promote coagulation and effectively decrease the soluble and colloidal particular matters although the generation of fe ii ions from zvi in aerobic process needs to be triggered by the electric field it can occur spontaneously in the anaerobic digestion process the protons which are released by acidogens during the acidification can help spontaneous generation of fe ii ions without any drive of electric field 101 many previous studies have investigated the addition of iron or zvi into anaerobic digestion which could significantly increase methane production and improve cod removal 102 105 when iron was added to anaerobic aquatic environment hydrogen was produced by iron corrosion this hydrogen evolution can benefit methane production by enhancing both hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis in addition iron was able to serve as an electron donor to reduce oxidation reduction potential orp and led to the decrease in propionic type fermentation and subsequent enhancement of methanogenesis as the accumulation of propionate destroyed the ph balance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis as well as hindered the methanogenesis of acetate it should be reduced during the anaerobic process 106 107 although anaerobic digestion can be limited by low efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification zvi could intensify the activities of enzymes related to hydrolysis and acidification such as protease which is responsible for catalysing hydrolysis of polysaccaharide to monoses 107 moreover the presence of zvi stimulated the growth of hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens thereby enhancing acetate or methane production 107 108 in addition iron could also effectively eliminate odorous h2s gas by precipitation of fes likewise the iron might be used for phosphate recovery in the form of compounds of iron and phosphate such as vivianite 99 it was also found that the supplementation of iron salts to anaerobic digestion could be potentially advantageous to membrane fouling by supporting granulation and stabilisation when ferrous iron was supplied to uasb reactor anaerobic bacteria and eps tended to adhere to iron in order to form a more stable structure with 56 of enlarged granule diameter moreover inorganic precipitates such as ferrous sulphide could contribute to the stability of granules 109 110 the iron addition to anmbr provided remarkable benefits on membrane fouling mitigation in several previous studies dong et al 111 showed the influence of fecl3 as an additive in long term operation of an anmbr treating municipal sewage the performance of the anmbr including removal efficiencies of cod and bod5 was enhanced by adding 26 mg l of fecl3 furthermore even though the addition of fecl3 caused the increase of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration and formation of a more thickened cake layer membrane fouling has been mitigated due to the more porous cake layer formation and increased filterability of mixed liquor zhang et al 26 also investigated the addition of fecl3 to anmbr which effectively reduced membrane fouling by increasing both sludge floc size and the colloids as well as decreasing smps since iron remained in the reactor as a precipitate resulting in minimal concentration of iron in the effluent or supernatant it was expected to be advantageous for a long term operation in a recent study zvi has been applied into anmbr with and without electric field although zvi with electric field facilitated the increase of iron releasing rate of zvi by 12 times and enhanced removal performances of cod and total phosphorous tp by about 3 and 50 respectively it resulted in more severe fouling due to the high density of fe rich fouling layer however zvi without electric field significantly mitigated membrane fouling rate by 20 through the enhancement of mixed liquor filterability 101 2 2 4 calcium calcium can be another special additive to alleviate fouling and enhance characteristics of granular sludge by enhancing bioflocculation eps which is known to be the main substance affecting membrane fouling typically contains negatively charged functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl due to negatively charged eps cations play an important role in sludge flocculation divalent cations including calcium ions tend to combine preferentially with carboxylic functional groups of eps and form bridges between the eps molecules this bridge formation promotes the improvement of bioflocculation enlarges flocs and mitigates fouling 112 115 since the cost of calcium salts is relatively low they have been widely used in aerobic process as an additive which improve the properties of mixed liquor 114 116 however the decline in permeability and subsequent inorganic fouling occurred with high concentration of calcium of 830 mg l due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate therefore more research is necessary to have a better understanding of effects of calcium addition and find out the optimal calcium concentration 117 the addition of calcium can also positively affect anaerobic processes some previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the influence of calcium addition and the most effective dosage for anaerobic digestion when five different concentrations of calcium chloride cacl2 which are 0 1 3 5 and 7 g l were added to anaerobic digestion process 3 g l of calcium concentration was optimal for the best performance of anaerobic digestion and biogas production 118 similarly according to a study of ahmad et al 119 calcium oxide cao in the uasb reactor enhanced granulation and the accumulation of biomass as well as the degradation of butyrate and acetate acid since the addition of calcium on anaerobic digestion process significantly increased the abundance of methanosaeta as the dominant methanogen the methane production could be improved 120 however an overdose of calcium from 5 to 7 g l of concentration which may lead to precipitation and limit mass transfer between microbes and organic compounds further inhibit anaerobic process when the precipitates such as calcium carbonate were formed on the surface or within the granules they can cause sludge washout as well as the declined methanogenic activity and diffusion limitation 118 119 due to the positive effects of calcium addition on anaerobic process the use of calcium as an additive in membrane bioreactors can also be a promising way to reduce membrane fouling 121 an investigation on the effects of calcium addition 0 50 and 100 mg l of calcium was conducted in three sequencing batch reactors with external dead end microfiltration the result showed that the highest dosage of calcium was able to enhance the reduction of fine particles eps and colloids in supernatant leading to the mitigation of membrane fouling 122 this significant reduction of membrane fouling was mainly due to calcium promoted bioflocculation which achieved high volumetric organic removal and increased methane production rate furthermore the enlarged size of anaerobic sludge granules by calcium addition was also reported in some studies using membrane coupled expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor or uasb reactors 123 126 when calcium chloride was added to the egsb reactor the membrane fouling was alleviated effectively and the concentration of smp decreased 121 2 2 5 polyaluminum chloride one of the aluminum salts polyaluminum chloride generally consists of various polynuclear aluminum hydrolysis products including al monomers such as al oh 2 dimer al2 oh 2 4 trimer al3 oh 4 5 al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 and aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 due to the presence of these products polyaluminum chloride is superior to the traditional aluminum coagulants such as alcl3 and al2 so4 3 for removing organic matters 127 the behaviour of aluminum coagulants can be greatly affected by basicity values b which is the molar ratio of oh al3 because the dominant hydrolysis products are different under different basicity conditions polyaluminum chloride with high basicity value b 2 4 resulted in increased membrane fouling propensity as well as higher doc removal efficiency and zeta potential of flocs compared to polyaluminum chloride with lower basicity b 2 0 and b 1 6 this phenomenon might be related to the different dominant mechanisms of coagulation according to the content of al species as the percentage of al13 increased along with the basicity value increase it could provide a larger amount of positive charges for charge neutralization rather than adsorption bridge effect as the flocs produced from charge neutralization are smaller than those from adsorption bridge effect it could result in more severe membrane fouling 128 many previous studies have reported high charge neutralization capacity of polyaluminum chloride which can lead to enlarged floc size and better filtration performance the dose of polyaluminum chloride and subsequent hydrolysis can provide positive charge which can neutralize the negatively charged sludge flocs and colloids this neutralization results in weaker repulsion among flocs and colloids and easier formation of large particles in addition smp and eps in mixed liquor can be compressed and removed from membrane surface by the charge neutralization and adsorption of polyaluminum chloride 129 when polyaluminum chloride was added in anaerobic digestion process it facilitated the reduction of smp and improved sludge filterability however a high concentration of polyaluminum chloride over 500 mg l in anaerobic digestion could inhibit short chain fatty acids scfa production as well as anaerobic process such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis by decreasing the ratio of bioavailable nutrient especially phosphorous 130 131 the positive effects of polyaluminum chloride dosing into anmbr as an inorganic coagulant on membrane fouling control have been studied in some previous research the addition of polyaluminum chloride could influence microbial characteristics as well as cake layer structure in the anaerobic digestion process the abundance of anaerobic microorganisms especially cloacimonetes and smithella was significantly enriched in anmbr 132 moreover polyaluminum chloride was able to increase the hydrogen yield by washing out hydrogen consumers including acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus 127 it was also reported that the cake layer on the membrane surface became more porous and looser when polyaluminum chloride was added which could provide better filterability a result from a study showed that polyaluminum chloride dosing could lower the composition rate of carbohydrate in smp and eps as well as compress the concentration of eps this resulted in reduction of adherence capacity of sludge and more substantially porous cake layer 129 133 2 2 6 zeolite zeolite is a porous substance with high crystallinity which mainly consists of aluminium oxygen and metals such as titanium tin and zinc while natural zeolite can be normally found in rocks near volcanoes all over the world it can also be synthesized or modified in order to improve properties for different applications both natural and modified zeolites can be used for adsorption and ion exchange the presence of cations like na ca2 k and mg2 on the porous surface of zeolite facilitates ion exchange from a contact solution thus the use of zeolite can be applied in both aerobic and anaerobic biological processes including nitrification and denitrification activated sludge and anaerobic digestion in aerobic processes zeolite can act as an ion exchanger as well as a biomass carrier whilst in anaerobic processes zeolite can also act as an inhibitor of ammonia and heavy metals by ion exchange 134 136 zeolite has been reported to improve the performance of anaerobic processes as a porous microbial carrier as well as ion exchanger its high ion exchange capacity can contribute to enhance nh4 removal which is known as an inhibitor of anaerobic digestion indeed lin et al 137 used modified zeolite to reduce nh4 concentration by ion exchange with na and ca2 as dominant ions for nh4 adsorption additionally the application of zeolite also showed remarkable improvement in methane production and cod removal 138 140 these improvements of anaerobic digestion can be attributed to ion exchange of nh4 cations like ca2 and mg2 and long chain fatty acids lcfa 140 141 another researcher focused on the microbial communities apart from ion exchange and suggested that zeolite could specifically preserve the growth and immobilisation of microorganisms especially methanosarcina and methanobacteriums 142 zeolite has been widely applied to aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactor for membrane fouling reduction this is because it can improve the settlement of sludge as well as the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous as zeolite has high porosity and large surface area it provides a stable environment for bacterial attachment and substantial microbial aggregation can enhance the settleability of sludge 143 as a result membrane fouling can be alleviated by forming rigid sludge flocs and enhancing membrane permeability likewise the application of zeolite as a carrier showed effective removal of cod and suspended solid ss which could facilitate better membrane performance and less fouling in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 144 145 when an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor was operated with natural zeolites as carriers the removal rate of ss significantly improved by 22 it was also observed that the anaerobic microorganisms were able to attach on the surface of zeolites with remarkable growth thus no membrane fouling was observed due to the low cod and ss concentrations 144 2 2 7 beads the use of granular media fluidizing in anmbr has been gaining attention along with the development of anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor previous studies showed that fluidization of glass beads and polyethylene terephthalate pet beads can act as turbulence promotors and scouring media respectively which effectively controlled membrane fouling polymer based gel beads have also been proved to be an ideal microbial carrier based on their cost effectiveness high bio compatibility strong stability for long term use as well as porous structure for microbial attachment and aggregation moreover controlling the size and density of the beads can be achievable by changing the synthesis conditions 146 147 polyvinyl alcohol pva which is water soluble polymer can form gel beads by cross linking with other materials like sodium alginate and chitosan 148 moreover when pva and chitosan form more stable structure through covalent bonds with metal ions they can be applied in different fields as adsorbent materials antibacterial agents or biocarriers 149 150 a research by wang et al 146 showed the effect of pva chitosan gel beads and pva chitosan iron gel beads on anaerobic sludge both gel beads favoured the adhesion and aggregation of methanogens mainly mathanospirillum methanosaeta and methanobacterium according to düppenbecker et al 151 the use of fluidized glass beads in anmbr with external tubular membrane could be a promising option for alleviating membrane fouling in anmbrs the optimal diameter of 1 5 mm fluidized glass beads reduced the fouling despite the membrane has been damaged by abrasion moreover the cod removal rate was remained between 77 and 83 and methane production increased by around 30 as well the same research group also evaluated the fouling behaviour by three different ceramic membranes including zro2 and al2o3 ultrafiltration membranes and tio2 microfiltration membrane the presence of fluidized glass beads was able to reduce the fouling rate by around 95 for all three membranes although all types of membranes were damaged by abrasion of glass beads al2o3 microfiltration membrane showed the least abrasion in a clean water filtration test 152 similarly the fluidization of pet beads with bigger size and lower density also demonstrated significant fouling reduction by scouring the membrane 153 154 these fluidized beads can mitigate membrane fouling by two mechanisms firstly the mixing action of particles can lead to increase in turbulence and thus concentration polarization can be decreased secondly scouring effect on the previously deposited foulants can also alleviate fouling 151 table 3 lists the effects of the above mentioned enhancers on anmbr performance and table 4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different enhancers for fouling reduction 3 future perspectives membrane fouling is one of the most challenging issues in operating mbr processes pretreatment of feed wastewater can effectively mitigate membrane fouling by changing the feed properties the addition of fouling reduction enhancers to bioreactors as adsorbents coagulants flocculants and suspended carriers can significantly modify the feed characteristics to date there have been investigations of many different enhancers applied to aerobic mbrs for the purpose of fouling control and improvement of bioreactor performance however only a limited number of studies were available to investigate the effects of enhancers addition in anmbrs and only a few types of enhancers were studied previously hence it is necessary and important not only to study the application of novel enhancers in anaerobic treatment but also to understand the fouling reduction mechanisms of each enhancer under anaerobic condition as discussed in this review previous studies have applied several enhancers to anmbrs the addition of activated carbon such as pac and gac has proven to be effective solution to alleviate membrane fouling both pac and gac could act as a supporting medium for the growth of anaerobic microorganisms due to its high adsorption capacity pac could effectively adsorb colloids and dissolved organic matters in anmbrs while gac mainly adopted as fluidized media and could scour membrane as well as enhance methane production throughout the organic and inorganic enhancers biochar and zeolite could be applied as adsorbents while calcium was able to act as flocculants in addition iron and pacl were added as coagulants and waste yeast and beads could perform as co substrates and biocarriers respectively however overdosing or large particle size of enhancers caused more severe membrane fouling and deterioration of removal performances due to their potential to become a foulant although optimal pac replenishment ratio for effective fouling mitigation in aerobic mbr was reported to be 1 67 the refreshment ratio of pac or gac in anmbr remains as a challenging issue 155 thus further studies regarding the optimization of the dosage as well as replacement ratio of enhancers should be carried out for the best improvement of performance as well as controlling membrane fouling furthermore more studies on the different types of novel enhancers such as waste yeast and beads are necessary because there are much less number of studies compared to that of activated carbon additionally more research regarding the long term effect of enhancers is also required since they may influence negatively on anmbr performance during long term operation moreover it is also important to consider the lifespan of membrane itself when enhancer is added the addition of particulate enhancers such as pac gac and biochar could greatly mitigate irreversible membrane fouling and prolong the lifespan of membrane however comparatively large particle size or fluidization of gac and glass beads could lead to abrasion and damage on membrane therefore more research on the membrane lifespan with enhancers is also required for better understanding on the performance of enhancers in spite of many applications and research have been carried out in anmbr with various enhancers most of the research is confined to lab scale experiments the major obstacle limiting scale up and wider application of anmbrs can be membrane fouling as membrane is one of the main contributors to capital and operational costs in anmbrs the capital cost of a full scale submerged anmbr system was about 800 usd m3 day it was also estimated that almost 72 3 of capital cost accounted for membrane fraction with the assumed capacity of 20 000 m3 day which was higher than that of aerobic mbr system 25 60 1 156 on the other hand the operational cost including gas scouring pumping and sludge disposal for submerged anmbr was reported to be almost one third of that of aerobic mbr system which was about usd 235 000 year and usd 822 741 year respectively 156 thus the full scale anmbr system could be economically feasible by adopting solutions such as low cost filters since the energy requirement for membrane fouling control in anmbr accounted more than 75 of the total energy requirement it is important to apply efficient fouling control strategies in terms of energy consumption and costs as discussed in section 2 1 2 gac fluidization had lower energy consumption than gas sparging the addition of enhancers such as fecl3 required much lower energy of 0 08 kw h m3 due to the lack of rotation 157 in terms of cost activated carbon 0 6 20 usd kg and biochar 0 2 0 5 usd kg could be relatively cheaper compared to other chemical enhancers 158 therefore careful consideration and further analysis of enhancers for practical anmbr application should be conducted to sum up further studies on the optimisation of the adequate dosage and the impact of different particle size of each enhancer should be done in the near future accompanied by the investigation of long term impact moreover the interaction mechanisms between the enhancers and anaerobic microbial activities also needs further exploration to better understand the influences on membrane fouling mitigation since the scale up from bench scale experiment to full scale application is not simple it is necessary to research further for the wide implementation of full scale anmbr with minimized membrane fouling 4 conclusion the main conclusions in this review are as follows the addition of fouling reduction enhancers including activated carbon biochar zeolite and polyaluminum chloride could effectively alleviate membrane fouling in anmbrs enlarged floc size and decreased soluble organics mainly contributed to the mitigation of fouling overdosing or large particle size of enhancers could lead to contrary result due to their potential to be a foulant declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13612,anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs the combination of anaerobic digestion and membrane technology have gained increasing popularity due to their remarkable advantages over aerobic membrane bioreactors such as biogas production and potential energy use however membrane fouling remains a challenging issue that deteriorates the performance of membrane and shortens its lifespan pretreatment of feed wastewater by adding fouling reduction enhancers such as adsorbents and flocculants into anaerobic membrane bioreactor can effectively mitigate membrane fouling by altering the feed properties activated carbon such as powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac has been widely applied as an adsorbent to aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactors for membrane fouling control organic enhancers such as biochar and waste yeast and inorganic enhancers like polyaluminum chloride and zeolite have also been applied to anmbrs promoting flocculation and coagulation thus this review discusses the impacts of different fouling reduction enhancers under anaerobic conditions as well as anmbr system in addition the mechanisms of the enhancers mitigating the membrane fouling are also summarized for better understanding of the effects of the enhancers in anmbrs abbreviations anmbr anaerobic membrane bioreactor pac powder activated carbon gac granular activated

bioreactor membrane fouling enhancers activated carbon 1 introduction in recent years anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr technology which combines anaerobic process and membrane filtration has been gaining increasing popularity anmbrs have the same benefits as aerobic mbrs such as a footprint reduction and superior permeate quality anmbrs also can provide several advantages over the aerobic processes including long solids retention time srt low sludge production and potential energy use 1 moreover as anmbr is the integration of anaerobic digestion process with membrane separation these processes can provide benefits as well anaerobic digestion process which involves four major stages of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis occurs in the bioreactor throughout this process organic materials are biodegraded into volatile fatty acids vfas and hydrogen as intermediate products and into methane as a final product 2 all these products can make the anmbr an energy neutral or even energy positive technology in addition unlike anaerobic digestion that requires mesophilic ranges from 35 to 37 anmbr can be operated in room temperature or even in cold temperatures by expanding srt which is both cost and energy efficient 3 however there are some issues that need further attention in anmbr technology one of the most challenging issues is membrane fouling which deteriorates the performance of membrane and shortens membrane lifespan membrane fouling generally occurs when the components of sludge interact with membrane material causing an initial pore blocking and cake layer formation it is reported that membrane fouling in anmbr has more severe impacts compared to the aerobic system in terms of pollutant removal efficiency and sludge characteristics even using the same membrane material 1 meng et al 4 also mentioned that the cake layer formed with anaerobic sludge might have a comparatively lower removability than that with aerobic sludge many researchers have carried out studies on alleviating membrane fouling which have involved pretreatment of feed wastewater optimization of operational conditions membrane module or surface modification 1 3 5 to control membrane fouling different pretreatment methods have been introduced such as alkaline pretreatment acid pretreatment ozone pretreatment and settling organic contaminants 6 9 some studies have shown that feed characteristics have significant impacts on the formation and compactness of the cake layer enhancers such as adsorbent agents carriers and other chemical agents can be effective in modifying the properties of feed water in anmbrs adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolite and bentonite promote adsorption and ion exchange phenomena coagulants including polyaluminum chloride and ferric chloride and suspended carriers can promote coagulation and flocculation respectively consequently enlarged floc size and decreased soluble organics in the supernatant can mitigate membrane fouling 1 10 to date there are many investigations of fouling control in aerobic mbrs by adding different additives as adsorbents 11 12 coagulants flocculants 13 16 and suspended carriers 17 however only a limited amount of research is available to investigate the effects of enhancers on fouling control in anaerobic mbrs additionally most review papers of fouling control in anmbrs have only focused on controlling operating conditions and overall mitigation strategies 1 5 18 19 this is the first review article that focuses on the different kinds of fouling reduction enhancers in anmbr and their influences on membrane fouling reduction effects of adding activated carbon including powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac on anmbr performance will firstly be discussed then the following sub sections will concentrate on the effects of adding other enhancers 2 enhancers to anmbr 2 1 activated carbon activated carbon ac has been widely applied in membrane bioreactors mbrs due to its high adsorption capability enhancement of biodegradation and subsequent removal of recalcitrant pollutants the addition of ac can also efficiently mitigate membrane fouling as it has high potential to enhance membrane flux as well as removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod and recalcitrant pollutants 20 21 moreover the use of ac in the anaerobic digestion process has been gaining more attention because it facilitated the alleviation of organic shock loading the enrichment of essential anaerobic microorganisms and the improvement of anaerobic digestion stability 21 there are two types of ac namely pac and gac pac has high porosity and large surface area which can lead to high adsorption capacity while removing odour colour and taste 21 compared to pac gac has larger size than pac which is more easily retained in the reactor and more economical when it is used continuously because gac can be regenerated by thermal process due to the larger size gac also has stronger physical interactions with the membrane surface 22 2 1 1 powdered activated carbon pac can reduce membrane fouling through three mechanisms firstly at the initial stage of pac addition adsorption of organic matters occurs which greatly removes the dissolved organic matters dom from wastewater secondly after initially adsorbing organic matters and becoming saturated microorganisms aggregate on the porous surfaces of pac particles as supporting medium for attached bacterial growth 23 finally the formation of biologically activated carbon bac promotes the degradation of pollutants and modifies the sludge properties which is the most important mechanism after the colonization of microorganisms the planktonic microorganisms transform into biofilm once attached bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substance eps it helps not only the attachment of microorganisms to biofilm but also the stabilisation of the biofilm structure the active biofilm continues to biodegrade organic compounds as well as to reduce the attachment of microorganisms on the membrane surface so that it can relieve the membrane biofouling 12 24 in addition the scouring effect of pac also alleviates membrane fouling as it can remove the deposited cake layer on membrane surface while limiting the accumulation of foulants 25 fig 1 illustrates the mechanism of fouling reduction when activated carbon is added more recent studies have confirmed that pac has positive effects on sludge morphology aggregation ability of sludge flocs and microbial properties and thus the pollutants removal mechanism can be enhanced the study by zhang et al 26 reported that pac addition in a submerged anmbr was able to form larger floc size of the sludge compared to anmbr without pac however in case of long term operation over 140 days the sludge diameter decreased from 20 66 μm to 17 00 μm which was contrary to the result from previous research about pac in anmbr 27 this may have resulted from the fact that pac enabled the generation of free living filamentous microbes after the long term operation and prevented the large floc size formation in mixed liquor in addition the sludge aggregation ability was able to be assessed using the total interaction energy which is a function of separation distance between the sludge surfaces it could be calculated by summing lifshitz van der waals energy lewis acid base energy and repulsive or attractive electrostatic double layer energy 28 29 pac addition showed highly negative value of total interaction energy per unit area of sludge which indicated that the characteristics of sludge surface has transformed into hydrophobicity and thus sludge cells adherence could be strengthened by stronger attractive interaction this improvement of aggregation ability led to more stable sludge flocs and potentially reduced the eps release which mitigated the pore blocking and irremovable membrane fouling 11 the increased bacterial diversity and evolution of the bacterial community were also attributed to pac addition creating additional microbial environment in the form of bac which promoted the enrichment and growth of some special functional bacteria the enrichment of acinetobacter comamonas flavobacterium and pseudomonas which can contribute to formation of sludge flocs and degradation of organics were highly promoted 28 when pac was applied in anaerobic batch biofilm reactors as a biofilm carrier for the enhancement of refractory compounds degradation it increased the abundance of methanothrix methanomassiliicoccus and methanobacterium which were favourable for the methane production 30 in a study of hu and stukey 31 1 7 g l of pac addition to submerged anmbr showed significant benefits for the removal of fine colloidal particles as well as membrane flux improvement and transmembrane pressure tmp reduction it was also found that pac addition showed 22 4 of increase rate in cod removal while gac showed no significant increase the reason why pac was more efficient than gac in terms of cod removal might be due to the greater surface area per mass than gac another study which applied 1 7 g l of pac as well showed 30 increased dissolved organic carbon doc removal and decrease in smp concentration 32 on the other hand when the more pac concentration of 4 g l was added the smp was rather accumulated while having excellent cod and colour removal efficiency 33 34 several studies have revealed that the pac addition not only decreased turbidity and colour but also removed potential foulants such as fine colloids and soluble microbial products smp which could lead to the reduction of fouling layer thickness 25 26 35 table 1 summarizes the effects of pac addition on membrane fouling control in submerged anmbrs pac can also be beneficial to anmbrs in terms of the removal of antibiotics which have negative impact on membrane fouling in fact the existence of antibiotics in anmbrs has worsened performance and issues associated with membrane fouling since it could lead to a decrease of the floc size and ph and an increase in the secretion of eps and smp moreover it could facilitate the development of microbial communities which had the most contribution to membrane fouling such as firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi 36 37 according to a review by cheng et al 38 the addition of antibiotics and combined antibiotics to anaerobic reactors such as sulfamethoxazole smx tetracycline tc erythromycin tetracycline sulfamethoxazole ets and erythromycin tetracycline st could cause negative effects on ph cod removal efficiency and biogas production both the ph value and cod removal efficiency in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors significantly decreased when the high concentration of antibiotics such as 45 mg l of smx 8 5 mg l of tc and 46 mg l of ets were added 39 41 biogas generation which is inherently related to cod removals under anaerobic conditions was inhibited as well and the reason for this might be the methanogenesis process was sensitive to the presence of antibiotics in anaerobic processes likewise 100 μg l of smx and tc in anaerobic aerobic mbr accelerated the rate of tmp rise and decreased the membrane fouling cycle from 25 days to 8 days in addition the fouling layer became denser and thicker with 20 μm of thickness furthermore higher concentration of two antibiotics 1000 μg l of smx and tc resulted in further decrease in membrane fouling cycle to 4 days and 40 μm of the fouling layer thickness 42 however the addition of activated carbon could remediate these negative results as a case in point the addition of pac into anmbr increased removal efficiencies of five different pharmaceuticals including smx trimethoprim tmp carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf and triclosan tcs by approximately 5 92 as the adsorption of pharmaceuticals to pac thermodynamically enhanced their biotransformation 43 although the optimal dosage of pac resulted in significant alleviation in membrane fouling overdosing might have contrary results due to its potential to become a foulant akram and stuckey 44 proposed that appropriate amount of pac should be added for the best improvement of performance of anmbr and membrane fouling amelioration in their research pac concentration of 1 67 g l highly improved the flux by more than four times while 3 4 g l of pac caused a decrease of flux and adsorption incapacity of pac to higher concentration of biomass the excessive dosage of pac could result in poor membrane filtration due to the increased sludge viscosity caused by the presence of more extracellular polymers moreover small pac particles 8 35 μm at high concentration in suspension increased turbidity of mixed liquor and caused more membrane pore blockage and abrasion 20 therefore the optimal pac dosage is effective for flux improvement and adsorption of fine solutes and regular replacement of aged pac with fresh pac is necessary 4 2 1 2 granular activated carbon in recent years the addition of gac has been extensively applied in anaerobic digestion process to enhance both reactor efficiency and abundance of special functional microorganisms anaerobic digestion process contains electron exchange between fermentative bacteria and methanogens in the form of metabolites such as acetate h2 and methanol previous studies have demonstrated that conductive additives like gac enabled direct electron exchange instead of metabolites which could eventually enhance methanogenic conversion of short chain fatty acids such as acetate butyrate and propionate and subsequent improvement of methane production 45 47 zhang et al 48 showed that gac remarkably promoted methanogenesis by enhancing direct interspecies electron transfer between fermentative bacteria geobacteraceae and methanogens methanosaetaceae another research has also concluded that surface modified gac with magnetite stimulated enrichment of electroactive bacteria such as shewanella pseudomonas geobacter and desulfuromonas enhancing the methane production by a degradation of propionate to acetates and electrons that can be utilized by methanogens 45 as a membrane fouling mitigation strategy methods of inducing unsteady state shear on the membrane surface such as bubbling and vibration have been applied to mbrs particle fluidization recently has been presented as an alternative to bubbling as it could have the same effect on membrane fouling reduction with at least ten times lower energy requirements than bubbling particularly the fluidization of gac has gained significant attention because larger gac was more effective during long term operation 49 50 therefore previous studies have reported that gac fluidization resulted in significant membrane fouling alleviation in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 51 56 in the studies of integrated anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor high amount of protein was adsorbed resulting in remarkable improvement of membrane filtration 52 53 the effect of gac fluidization has been demonstrated with its energy efficient and effective advantages unlike the popular air sparging method which required comparatively high energy costs 57 as gac fluidization is one way to induce unsteady state shear on membrane which has been identified as a cost effective method it could reduce the energy requirement in the process 58 as a case in point the electrical energy requirement for anaerobic fluidized bed ceramic membrane bioreactor operation was estimated to be 0 039 kw h m3 which was only 17 of electrical energy that can be generated from produced methane 59 the average energy consumption of gac fluidization is generally reported as 0 15 kw h m3 whereas that of gas sparging is twice higher which is 0 31 kw h m3 including pumping and mixing 60 the table 2 summarizes the effects of gac in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor in the research of ding et al 61 they added 50 g l of gac to an expanded membrane coupled granular sludge bed egsb and showed a remarkable enhancement of cod removals 80 vs 62 without pac and decrease in smp concentration the cake layer resistance which was the main fouling mechanism in membrane coupled egsb process was also decreased by 53 5 another research by wang et al 62 treating wastewater containing phenol and quinolone reported that a 2 g l of gac could not only remove cod and smp by adsorption but also enhance the degradation of phenol and quinolone the high adsorption capacity of gac could capture some fouling causing compounds like smp prior to attachment on membrane surface meanwhile gac could scour the foulants from the membrane surface and prevent the accumulation of foulants hence the use of gac as suspended medium effectively mitigated irreversible fouling 63 as a case in point the scouring effect of gac with flux of 16 l m2 h in a two stage anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor was able to mitigate membrane fouling along with effective removal of 20 commonly found pharmaceuticals i e ibuprofen caffeine and smx etc through adsorption and biodegradation 64 65 although having positive effects on membrane fouling control wu et al 55 suggested that the behaviour and characteristics of gac might have a harmful influence on membrane performance due to the fine carbon particles that are released from gac itself during fluidization the fouling could be aggravated by blocking the pores and forming a thin cake layer gac abrasion also led to a partial loss from the initial membrane quality the reduction in adsorption capacity of gac over time was also a major limitation thus the exhausted gac needs to be replaced or regenerated by thermal process to recover the adsorption capability 24 furthermore the energy requirements for fluidization and membrane fouling mitigation were significantly different depending on the particle size of gac as well as adsorption capacity when the adsorption of fresh gac predominantly took place comparatively small gac particles had greater effect on fouling reduction due to large surface area along with less energy consumption however after the adsorption capacity was exhausted dominant process for fouling reduction became the scouring effect then the relatively large gac particles were more effective in fouling reduction but more energy is required for fluidization 66 charfi et al 67 showed that 2 3 mm of gac particles acted as a better method of fouling reduction by removing cake layer on membrane surface whereas small particles from 0 18 mm to 0 5 mm rather intended to accumulate on membrane surface it was also found that although large particles were more effective in scouring due to inertial forces the energy requirement on fluidizing the particle was also higher 49 thus further studies are necessary for a better understanding of production of fine carbon particles gac abrasion and choosing suitable particle sizes for mitigating membrane fouling 2 2 other enhancers 2 2 1 biochar biochar is a porous and carbonaceous residue obtained from thermal decomposition of biomass in an oxygen deleted environment or from other processes such as pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonisation gasification and torrefaction it is usually produced at a lower temperature than 700 because reaction above 900 causes the destruction of walls between pores which results in widening of pores of biochar 68 69 unlike ac it is produced without any activation and this non activation makes the specific surface area of biochar less efficient compared to ac however the production cost of biochar is one tenth cheaper than that of ac 68 69 71 after a series of reactions of biomass such as dehydration depolymerisation and carbonisation during thermal decomposition three products namely condensable liquid bio oil non condensable gases syngas and biochar are produced which depends on the type of biomass used and process conditions i e temperature and residence time biochar usually consists of fixed carbon labile carbon and other volatile compounds as well as moisture and ash fast pyrolysis aims at liquid oil production whereas the goal of slow pyrolysis is biochar production as the slow evaporation of water and release of volatile components can result in an increase in relatively fixed carbon content of the solid 70 72 the heterogeneous surface of biochar which has both carbonised and non carbonised fractions accommodates several adsorption mechanisms physical adsorption surface precipitation and the pore filling are the major routes of adsorption moreover for positively charged organic compounds hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding of biochar surface are the important adsorption routes on the other hand the removal of inorganic compounds largely depends on electrostatic attraction precipitation and ion exchange 70 73 the addition of biochar on anaerobic digestion process has shown to be effective in terms of biogas production and selectively enriched microbial groups the biochar addition was able to enhance vfa production and degradation and improve both hydrogen and methane production 68 74 some studies demonstrated that better biogas production could be obtained from enhanced direct interspecies electron transfer diet process by enrichment of electrogenic geobacter and bacteroidetes which are potential direct interspecies electron transfer partners during anaerobic digestion 75 76 in addition since biochar contains redox active moieties such as quinines phenolics and phenazines they can catalyse the electron transfer between biochar and outer membrane cytochromes during redox reactions 77 78 moreover biochar addition significantly enhanced methanogenesis by facilitating the enrichment of methanosarcina even in high ammonium stress and also favoured anaerobic sludge granulation due to the ability of promoting biofilm formation and reducing the inhibition behaviour of ammonia 79 80 similar to the biogas yield enhancement biochar could facilitate hydrogen production via enrichment of hydrogen producing bacteria 81 the alleviation of sulphide toxicity during anaerobic treatment of sulphate rich wastewater using biochar was investigated and biochar promoted reactor stability by adsorption of h2s from biogas 82 due to the adsorption capability and functional groups on the surface biochar was also able to adsorb eps and enhance sludge granulation which could lead to significant mitigation of membrane fouling in aerobic mbrs 83 85 some previous studies have demonstrated that biochar could be beneficial to anaerobic membrane bioreactor bamboo charcoal one kind of biochar was able to enhance the removal performance of anmbr as well as mitigate membrane fouling in this study two anmbrs treating bamboo industry wastewater were analysed with and without bamboo charcoal addition the result showed that cod removal efficiency increased about 5 after the addition of bamboo charcoal as well as reduced membrane fouling owing to the decrease of both smp concentration and resistance of the fouling layer meanwhile the methane yield became higher as a result of greater microbial activity of dominant microorganisms in methane production such as methanosaeta methanospirillum and methanobacterium occurring additionally inside the pores of the bamboo charcoal 86 more recent study showed that membrane fouling was effectively reduced in a biochar amended anmbr along with 56 of decreased tmp rising rate and decreased proteins of eps in addition arcobacter one of the bio foulants that is involved in membrane biofouling was hardly accumulated due to the presence of biochar 87 2 2 2 waste yeast waste yeast is traditionally used as a protein supplement in animal feed or alimentary substrate for the food processing industry the brewing industry is the major source of spent yeast which also produces other residues in addition to brewery wastewater such as methanogens and small cellulosic particles 88 due to the high degradation capacity of yeast it was favourable in treatment of landfill leachate which contained high amount of recalcitrant compounds like phenolic compounds as well as toxic substances such as halogenated and heavy metals 89 yeast had lower tendency to adhere on membrane surfaces than other microorganisms so that its application in mbr can be beneficial in membrane fouling control and system operation 89 the presence of yeast in aerobic mbr could significantly remove not only cod colour and eps but also refractory substances including polyacrylamide 90 93 anaerobic co digestion which balances the nutrient component of different residues is widely applied as a way to dilute potential toxic compounds and enhance biogas production 94 some previous studies have demonstrated that additional co substrates in anaerobic wastewater treatment increased methane production by maintaining a ph level within the methanogenesis range between 7 0 and 7 5 while improving the degradation of low biodegradable substrates 88 95 97 the research on the supplementation of yeast in brewery wastewater treatment as a co substrate in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor showed enhanced biogas production by 50 while no significant changes in cod removal efficiency and accumulation of vfas were observed up to 1 1 v v of brewery yeast concentration 88 94 these results indicated that the additional waste yeast could be a feasible substrate in anaerobic digestion in terms of high biodegradability and biogas yield the supplementation of yeast wastes as co substrate in an anmbr can have positive effects on membrane fouling control as well a research by yun et al 98 investigated the effects of yeast on anmbr performance treating low grade coal wastewater lcww compared to no methane production in the absence of yeast wastes anmbr with yeast wastes gradually increased cod removal efficiency as well as methane production in addition the presence of yeast wastes showed the significant growth of some microorganisms such as methanococcus and methanosarcina which were responsible for the degradation of lcww and biogas production however due to the metabolism of these bacteria the fraction of smps and aromatic group with high molecular weight 1 kda also increased thus the addition of yeast wastes could be a potential alternative as an additive to anmbr due to their positive effects on biodegradation of lcww and growth of microorganisms but further research should be carried out to find out the effect on fouling control 2 2 3 iron iron which is the most abundant transition metal on the earth is also an essential component for the growth of most living organisms although iron itself is a non toxic and electron donor in redox reactions the presence of iron in anaerobic environment plays an important role in the electron cycling and metabolic activity of microorganisms 99 100 the fe ii and fe iii which are generated from several iron compounds can be provided as nutrients for microbial activity or as redox mediators to facilitate the conversion of organic matters to methane 100 one of the strong reductants zero valent iron zvi is an active anode material in electrocoagulation and electrically produces fe ii ions which promote coagulation and effectively decrease the soluble and colloidal particular matters although the generation of fe ii ions from zvi in aerobic process needs to be triggered by the electric field it can occur spontaneously in the anaerobic digestion process the protons which are released by acidogens during the acidification can help spontaneous generation of fe ii ions without any drive of electric field 101 many previous studies have investigated the addition of iron or zvi into anaerobic digestion which could significantly increase methane production and improve cod removal 102 105 when iron was added to anaerobic aquatic environment hydrogen was produced by iron corrosion this hydrogen evolution can benefit methane production by enhancing both hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis in addition iron was able to serve as an electron donor to reduce oxidation reduction potential orp and led to the decrease in propionic type fermentation and subsequent enhancement of methanogenesis as the accumulation of propionate destroyed the ph balance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis as well as hindered the methanogenesis of acetate it should be reduced during the anaerobic process 106 107 although anaerobic digestion can be limited by low efficiency of hydrolysis and acidification zvi could intensify the activities of enzymes related to hydrolysis and acidification such as protease which is responsible for catalysing hydrolysis of polysaccaharide to monoses 107 moreover the presence of zvi stimulated the growth of hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens thereby enhancing acetate or methane production 107 108 in addition iron could also effectively eliminate odorous h2s gas by precipitation of fes likewise the iron might be used for phosphate recovery in the form of compounds of iron and phosphate such as vivianite 99 it was also found that the supplementation of iron salts to anaerobic digestion could be potentially advantageous to membrane fouling by supporting granulation and stabilisation when ferrous iron was supplied to uasb reactor anaerobic bacteria and eps tended to adhere to iron in order to form a more stable structure with 56 of enlarged granule diameter moreover inorganic precipitates such as ferrous sulphide could contribute to the stability of granules 109 110 the iron addition to anmbr provided remarkable benefits on membrane fouling mitigation in several previous studies dong et al 111 showed the influence of fecl3 as an additive in long term operation of an anmbr treating municipal sewage the performance of the anmbr including removal efficiencies of cod and bod5 was enhanced by adding 26 mg l of fecl3 furthermore even though the addition of fecl3 caused the increase of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration and formation of a more thickened cake layer membrane fouling has been mitigated due to the more porous cake layer formation and increased filterability of mixed liquor zhang et al 26 also investigated the addition of fecl3 to anmbr which effectively reduced membrane fouling by increasing both sludge floc size and the colloids as well as decreasing smps since iron remained in the reactor as a precipitate resulting in minimal concentration of iron in the effluent or supernatant it was expected to be advantageous for a long term operation in a recent study zvi has been applied into anmbr with and without electric field although zvi with electric field facilitated the increase of iron releasing rate of zvi by 12 times and enhanced removal performances of cod and total phosphorous tp by about 3 and 50 respectively it resulted in more severe fouling due to the high density of fe rich fouling layer however zvi without electric field significantly mitigated membrane fouling rate by 20 through the enhancement of mixed liquor filterability 101 2 2 4 calcium calcium can be another special additive to alleviate fouling and enhance characteristics of granular sludge by enhancing bioflocculation eps which is known to be the main substance affecting membrane fouling typically contains negatively charged functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl due to negatively charged eps cations play an important role in sludge flocculation divalent cations including calcium ions tend to combine preferentially with carboxylic functional groups of eps and form bridges between the eps molecules this bridge formation promotes the improvement of bioflocculation enlarges flocs and mitigates fouling 112 115 since the cost of calcium salts is relatively low they have been widely used in aerobic process as an additive which improve the properties of mixed liquor 114 116 however the decline in permeability and subsequent inorganic fouling occurred with high concentration of calcium of 830 mg l due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate therefore more research is necessary to have a better understanding of effects of calcium addition and find out the optimal calcium concentration 117 the addition of calcium can also positively affect anaerobic processes some previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the influence of calcium addition and the most effective dosage for anaerobic digestion when five different concentrations of calcium chloride cacl2 which are 0 1 3 5 and 7 g l were added to anaerobic digestion process 3 g l of calcium concentration was optimal for the best performance of anaerobic digestion and biogas production 118 similarly according to a study of ahmad et al 119 calcium oxide cao in the uasb reactor enhanced granulation and the accumulation of biomass as well as the degradation of butyrate and acetate acid since the addition of calcium on anaerobic digestion process significantly increased the abundance of methanosaeta as the dominant methanogen the methane production could be improved 120 however an overdose of calcium from 5 to 7 g l of concentration which may lead to precipitation and limit mass transfer between microbes and organic compounds further inhibit anaerobic process when the precipitates such as calcium carbonate were formed on the surface or within the granules they can cause sludge washout as well as the declined methanogenic activity and diffusion limitation 118 119 due to the positive effects of calcium addition on anaerobic process the use of calcium as an additive in membrane bioreactors can also be a promising way to reduce membrane fouling 121 an investigation on the effects of calcium addition 0 50 and 100 mg l of calcium was conducted in three sequencing batch reactors with external dead end microfiltration the result showed that the highest dosage of calcium was able to enhance the reduction of fine particles eps and colloids in supernatant leading to the mitigation of membrane fouling 122 this significant reduction of membrane fouling was mainly due to calcium promoted bioflocculation which achieved high volumetric organic removal and increased methane production rate furthermore the enlarged size of anaerobic sludge granules by calcium addition was also reported in some studies using membrane coupled expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor or uasb reactors 123 126 when calcium chloride was added to the egsb reactor the membrane fouling was alleviated effectively and the concentration of smp decreased 121 2 2 5 polyaluminum chloride one of the aluminum salts polyaluminum chloride generally consists of various polynuclear aluminum hydrolysis products including al monomers such as al oh 2 dimer al2 oh 2 4 trimer al3 oh 4 5 al13 alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 and aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 due to the presence of these products polyaluminum chloride is superior to the traditional aluminum coagulants such as alcl3 and al2 so4 3 for removing organic matters 127 the behaviour of aluminum coagulants can be greatly affected by basicity values b which is the molar ratio of oh al3 because the dominant hydrolysis products are different under different basicity conditions polyaluminum chloride with high basicity value b 2 4 resulted in increased membrane fouling propensity as well as higher doc removal efficiency and zeta potential of flocs compared to polyaluminum chloride with lower basicity b 2 0 and b 1 6 this phenomenon might be related to the different dominant mechanisms of coagulation according to the content of al species as the percentage of al13 increased along with the basicity value increase it could provide a larger amount of positive charges for charge neutralization rather than adsorption bridge effect as the flocs produced from charge neutralization are smaller than those from adsorption bridge effect it could result in more severe membrane fouling 128 many previous studies have reported high charge neutralization capacity of polyaluminum chloride which can lead to enlarged floc size and better filtration performance the dose of polyaluminum chloride and subsequent hydrolysis can provide positive charge which can neutralize the negatively charged sludge flocs and colloids this neutralization results in weaker repulsion among flocs and colloids and easier formation of large particles in addition smp and eps in mixed liquor can be compressed and removed from membrane surface by the charge neutralization and adsorption of polyaluminum chloride 129 when polyaluminum chloride was added in anaerobic digestion process it facilitated the reduction of smp and improved sludge filterability however a high concentration of polyaluminum chloride over 500 mg l in anaerobic digestion could inhibit short chain fatty acids scfa production as well as anaerobic process such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis by decreasing the ratio of bioavailable nutrient especially phosphorous 130 131 the positive effects of polyaluminum chloride dosing into anmbr as an inorganic coagulant on membrane fouling control have been studied in some previous research the addition of polyaluminum chloride could influence microbial characteristics as well as cake layer structure in the anaerobic digestion process the abundance of anaerobic microorganisms especially cloacimonetes and smithella was significantly enriched in anmbr 132 moreover polyaluminum chloride was able to increase the hydrogen yield by washing out hydrogen consumers including acetoanaerobium and desulfobulbus 127 it was also reported that the cake layer on the membrane surface became more porous and looser when polyaluminum chloride was added which could provide better filterability a result from a study showed that polyaluminum chloride dosing could lower the composition rate of carbohydrate in smp and eps as well as compress the concentration of eps this resulted in reduction of adherence capacity of sludge and more substantially porous cake layer 129 133 2 2 6 zeolite zeolite is a porous substance with high crystallinity which mainly consists of aluminium oxygen and metals such as titanium tin and zinc while natural zeolite can be normally found in rocks near volcanoes all over the world it can also be synthesized or modified in order to improve properties for different applications both natural and modified zeolites can be used for adsorption and ion exchange the presence of cations like na ca2 k and mg2 on the porous surface of zeolite facilitates ion exchange from a contact solution thus the use of zeolite can be applied in both aerobic and anaerobic biological processes including nitrification and denitrification activated sludge and anaerobic digestion in aerobic processes zeolite can act as an ion exchanger as well as a biomass carrier whilst in anaerobic processes zeolite can also act as an inhibitor of ammonia and heavy metals by ion exchange 134 136 zeolite has been reported to improve the performance of anaerobic processes as a porous microbial carrier as well as ion exchanger its high ion exchange capacity can contribute to enhance nh4 removal which is known as an inhibitor of anaerobic digestion indeed lin et al 137 used modified zeolite to reduce nh4 concentration by ion exchange with na and ca2 as dominant ions for nh4 adsorption additionally the application of zeolite also showed remarkable improvement in methane production and cod removal 138 140 these improvements of anaerobic digestion can be attributed to ion exchange of nh4 cations like ca2 and mg2 and long chain fatty acids lcfa 140 141 another researcher focused on the microbial communities apart from ion exchange and suggested that zeolite could specifically preserve the growth and immobilisation of microorganisms especially methanosarcina and methanobacteriums 142 zeolite has been widely applied to aerobic and anaerobic membrane bioreactor for membrane fouling reduction this is because it can improve the settlement of sludge as well as the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous as zeolite has high porosity and large surface area it provides a stable environment for bacterial attachment and substantial microbial aggregation can enhance the settleability of sludge 143 as a result membrane fouling can be alleviated by forming rigid sludge flocs and enhancing membrane permeability likewise the application of zeolite as a carrier showed effective removal of cod and suspended solid ss which could facilitate better membrane performance and less fouling in anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor 144 145 when an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor was operated with natural zeolites as carriers the removal rate of ss significantly improved by 22 it was also observed that the anaerobic microorganisms were able to attach on the surface of zeolites with remarkable growth thus no membrane fouling was observed due to the low cod and ss concentrations 144 2 2 7 beads the use of granular media fluidizing in anmbr has been gaining attention along with the development of anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor previous studies showed that fluidization of glass beads and polyethylene terephthalate pet beads can act as turbulence promotors and scouring media respectively which effectively controlled membrane fouling polymer based gel beads have also been proved to be an ideal microbial carrier based on their cost effectiveness high bio compatibility strong stability for long term use as well as porous structure for microbial attachment and aggregation moreover controlling the size and density of the beads can be achievable by changing the synthesis conditions 146 147 polyvinyl alcohol pva which is water soluble polymer can form gel beads by cross linking with other materials like sodium alginate and chitosan 148 moreover when pva and chitosan form more stable structure through covalent bonds with metal ions they can be applied in different fields as adsorbent materials antibacterial agents or biocarriers 149 150 a research by wang et al 146 showed the effect of pva chitosan gel beads and pva chitosan iron gel beads on anaerobic sludge both gel beads favoured the adhesion and aggregation of methanogens mainly mathanospirillum methanosaeta and methanobacterium according to düppenbecker et al 151 the use of fluidized glass beads in anmbr with external tubular membrane could be a promising option for alleviating membrane fouling in anmbrs the optimal diameter of 1 5 mm fluidized glass beads reduced the fouling despite the membrane has been damaged by abrasion moreover the cod removal rate was remained between 77 and 83 and methane production increased by around 30 as well the same research group also evaluated the fouling behaviour by three different ceramic membranes including zro2 and al2o3 ultrafiltration membranes and tio2 microfiltration membrane the presence of fluidized glass beads was able to reduce the fouling rate by around 95 for all three membranes although all types of membranes were damaged by abrasion of glass beads al2o3 microfiltration membrane showed the least abrasion in a clean water filtration test 152 similarly the fluidization of pet beads with bigger size and lower density also demonstrated significant fouling reduction by scouring the membrane 153 154 these fluidized beads can mitigate membrane fouling by two mechanisms firstly the mixing action of particles can lead to increase in turbulence and thus concentration polarization can be decreased secondly scouring effect on the previously deposited foulants can also alleviate fouling 151 table 3 lists the effects of the above mentioned enhancers on anmbr performance and table 4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different enhancers for fouling reduction 3 future perspectives membrane fouling is one of the most challenging issues in operating mbr processes pretreatment of feed wastewater can effectively mitigate membrane fouling by changing the feed properties the addition of fouling reduction enhancers to bioreactors as adsorbents coagulants flocculants and suspended carriers can significantly modify the feed characteristics to date there have been investigations of many different enhancers applied to aerobic mbrs for the purpose of fouling control and improvement of bioreactor performance however only a limited number of studies were available to investigate the effects of enhancers addition in anmbrs and only a few types of enhancers were studied previously hence it is necessary and important not only to study the application of novel enhancers in anaerobic treatment but also to understand the fouling reduction mechanisms of each enhancer under anaerobic condition as discussed in this review previous studies have applied several enhancers to anmbrs the addition of activated carbon such as pac and gac has proven to be effective solution to alleviate membrane fouling both pac and gac could act as a supporting medium for the growth of anaerobic microorganisms due to its high adsorption capacity pac could effectively adsorb colloids and dissolved organic matters in anmbrs while gac mainly adopted as fluidized media and could scour membrane as well as enhance methane production throughout the organic and inorganic enhancers biochar and zeolite could be applied as adsorbents while calcium was able to act as flocculants in addition iron and pacl were added as coagulants and waste yeast and beads could perform as co substrates and biocarriers respectively however overdosing or large particle size of enhancers caused more severe membrane fouling and deterioration of removal performances due to their potential to become a foulant although optimal pac replenishment ratio for effective fouling mitigation in aerobic mbr was reported to be 1 67 the refreshment ratio of pac or gac in anmbr remains as a challenging issue 155 thus further studies regarding the optimization of the dosage as well as replacement ratio of enhancers should be carried out for the best improvement of performance as well as controlling membrane fouling furthermore more studies on the different types of novel enhancers such as waste yeast and beads are necessary because there are much less number of studies compared to that of activated carbon additionally more research regarding the long term effect of enhancers is also required since they may influence negatively on anmbr performance during long term operation moreover it is also important to consider the lifespan of membrane itself when enhancer is added the addition of particulate enhancers such as pac gac and biochar could greatly mitigate irreversible membrane fouling and prolong the lifespan of membrane however comparatively large particle size or fluidization of gac and glass beads could lead to abrasion and damage on membrane therefore more research on the membrane lifespan with enhancers is also required for better understanding on the performance of enhancers in spite of many applications and research have been carried out in anmbr with various enhancers most of the research is confined to lab scale experiments the major obstacle limiting scale up and wider application of anmbrs can be membrane fouling as membrane is one of the main contributors to capital and operational costs in anmbrs the capital cost of a full scale submerged anmbr system was about 800 usd m3 day it was also estimated that almost 72 3 of capital cost accounted for membrane fraction with the assumed capacity of 20 000 m3 day which was higher than that of aerobic mbr system 25 60 1 156 on the other hand the operational cost including gas scouring pumping and sludge disposal for submerged anmbr was reported to be almost one third of that of aerobic mbr system which was about usd 235 000 year and usd 822 741 year respectively 156 thus the full scale anmbr system could be economically feasible by adopting solutions such as low cost filters since the energy requirement for membrane fouling control in anmbr accounted more than 75 of the total energy requirement it is important to apply efficient fouling control strategies in terms of energy consumption and costs as discussed in section 2 1 2 gac fluidization had lower energy consumption than gas sparging the addition of enhancers such as fecl3 required much lower energy of 0 08 kw h m3 due to the lack of rotation 157 in terms of cost activated carbon 0 6 20 usd kg and biochar 0 2 0 5 usd kg could be relatively cheaper compared to other chemical enhancers 158 therefore careful consideration and further analysis of enhancers for practical anmbr application should be conducted to sum up further studies on the optimisation of the adequate dosage and the impact of different particle size of each enhancer should be done in the near future accompanied by the investigation of long term impact moreover the interaction mechanisms between the enhancers and anaerobic microbial activities also needs further exploration to better understand the influences on membrane fouling mitigation since the scale up from bench scale experiment to full scale application is not simple it is necessary to research further for the wide implementation of full scale anmbr with minimized membrane fouling 4 conclusion the main conclusions in this review are as follows the addition of fouling reduction enhancers including activated carbon biochar zeolite and polyaluminum chloride could effectively alleviate membrane fouling in anmbrs enlarged floc size and decreased soluble organics mainly contributed to the mitigation of fouling overdosing or large particle size of enhancers could lead to contrary result due to their potential to be a foulant declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13613,nitrogen discharged from mariculture industry leads to adjacent aquatic pollution this study utilized an electrochemically assisted submerged fixed bed bioreactor e sfbbr to treat carbon limited saline mariculture wastewater and aimed to evaluate the performance and pathways of nitrogen removal by testing the effects of electrical stimulation and different current densities cd electro stimulation increased nitrogen removal performance of e sfbbr from 1 1 to 2 2 g n m 2 d 1 to 3 0 3 4 g n m 2 d 1 cd of 0 10 ma cm 2 resulted in the highest n removal rate results of water quality at different depths and the batch experiment revealed the n removal pathways in e sfbbr in the cathode area nitrogen removal was mainly attributed to the processes of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and in the anode area nitrification and autotrophic denitrification driven by sulfur or iron contributed to nitrogen elimination these findings provided a promising method for enhancing n removal from carbon limited mariculture effluents keywords maricluture wastewater submerged fixed bed bioreactors electro stimulation n removal pathways 1 introduction global mariculture production expanded to 62 3 million tones in 2016 due to the rapid development of intensive aquaculture 1 mariculture wastewater has become one of the main sources of saline wastewater 2 during aquaculture ammonia generated from metabolism of fish and deamination of protein in residual feed is toxic to aquatic organisms due to the oxygen rich conditions in aquaculture systems ammonia can be easily oxidized into nitrate no3 n which has lower toxicity nevertheless the accumulated no3 n raises risks of adjacent aquatic environment deterioration and even eutrophication 3 nitrogen n elimination from mariculture wastewater has become a worldwide challenge that needs to be solved urgently submerged fixed bed bioreactor sfbbr is widely used for wastewater treatment e g aquaculture effluents municipal sewage and industrial wastewater due to the simple mechanical structure low energy consumption and operating cost 4 sufficient electron donors e g organic carbon are necessary to ensure the efficient n removal of sfbbr however low c n ratio of mariculture wastewater i e 1 3 limits the denitrification process and then the n removal adding extra carbon sources including chemical regent or solid slow releasing materials is a common way to enhance denitrification process 5 but this raises costs and the risk of secondary organic pollution considering the difficulty in managing carbon addition to coincide with periodic fluctuation of n concentration electrochemically assisted sfbbr e sfbbr offers an alternative for enhancing n removal from mariculture wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec as one representative type of bio electrochemical system bes has been successfully coupled with bioreactors for n removal enhancement no3 n reduction can be promoted at the cathode area through direct electron transfer and autohydrogenotrophic denitrification 6 7 table s1 listed various bioreactor electrochemical coupling systems that have been applied for nitrogen removal enhancement in those studies the impacts of operating parameters such as current density cd hydraulic retention time hrt and salinity on nitrogen removal were evaluated however no study has been reported on using e sfbbr to treat mariculture wastewater on one hand high salinity of mariculture effluents could increase the osmotic pressure of microbial cells lead to cell dehydration or even death which may in turn affect the nitrogen removal performance of e sfbbr on the other hand at the cathode area of e sfbbr rich sulfate in sea water so4 2 5 30 mmol l 1 could be reduced by hydrogen h2 and generate reductive sulfur compounds which are able to resupply the electrons for denitrifying microbes 8 relieving the limitation of low mass transfer induced by the low solubility of h2 1 7 ppm 28 1 atm 9 therefore evaluating the overall n removal performance and elucidating the underlying coupling pathways of n and s transformations are essential to broaden the applications of e sfbbr in treating carbon limited mariculture wastewater the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the n removal performance of e sfbbr through test the effects of electro stimulation and different current densities 2 explore n removal pathways in e sfbbr the results provide new insight into carbon limited mariculture wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic

could significantly enhance n removal fig 2 when cd were 0 10 and 0 20 ma cm 2 total inorganic nitrogen tin removal rates increased from 1 15 to 2 20 g n m 2 d 1 in control group to 2 95 3 43 g n m 2 d 1 in e sfbbr figure s1 electro stimulation has been reported to enhance n removal in bioreactors through improving the denitrification rate by transferring electrons directly to no3 n and stimulating the growth of denitrification microorganisms 13 14 besides the anode material i e sponge iron also made a contribution through performing the iron based denitrification 15 this could be confirmed by the higher tin removal rates of control 2 2 20 0 54 g n m 2 d 1 than that of control 1 1 12 0 54 g n m 2 d 1 p 0 05 cd of 0 10 ma cm 2 was suitable for e sfbbr treating carbon limited

performed the best when cd 0 10 ma cm 2 actually enhanced n elimination was mainly attributed to the improved no3 n removal which presented a linear positive correlation with the increased cd figure s1c however as cd increased nh4 n removal rates showed a different tendency the effluent concentration was 1 72 0 63 mg l 1 0 38 0 14 mg l 1 and 2 80 0 60 mg l 1 when cd was 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 ma cm 2 respectively under the highest cd more electrons flew to the cathode which created a more reductive environment thus promoting the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra 16 as shown in fig 2 no2 n accumulation occurred 0 3 0 1 mg l 1 in the effluent of e sfbbr throughout the experiment especially with the cd of 0 20 ma cm 2 1 1 0 1 mg l 1 higher cd in the present study may lead to a higher accumulation of no2 n in fact the denitrification process can be divided into two steps the reduction of no3 n to no2 n and the reduction of no2 n to n2 and the reaction rate of the first step is much faster than the second 18 besides the sudden rise of the no2 n concentration around d 47 and d 91 could be attributed to the disturbance caused by the sampling at different depths and the change of the experimental conditions cd on these two days when cd was 0 05 ma cm 2 n removal was not enhanced in e sfbbr suggesting that was not sufficient to drive water electrolysis and further denitrification 3 2 n removal pathways in e sfbbr changes of nitrogenous compounds fe2 fe3 and so4 2 concentrations along the longitudinal direction revealed the n transformations in e sfbbr fig 3 and figure s2 take cd 0 10 ma cm 2 for example from inlet to s2 the cathode area no3 n dropped strikingly from 33 2 1 9 mg l 1 to 17 9 1 5 mg l 1 and tin decreased from 36 2 1 9 mg l 1 to 30 7 1

indicates the occurrence of dnra which probably resulted from three reasons 1 the cathode of bes could stimulate the dnra process 16 2 the released fe2 0 089 0 033 mg l 1 detected in e sfbbr has been proven to be an effective electron donor for dnra 16 3 sulfide from so4 2 reduction from 1727 0 203 2 mg l 1 at the inlet to 1479 9 112 3 mg l 1 at s2 was able to drive dnra 17 as the wastewater flew from s2 to s3 the anode area of e sfbbr nh4 n dropped back to 0 4 0 0 mg l 1 while no3 n went up to 23 0 1 2 mg l 1 fig 3 nitrification was facilitated by the aeration which increased the do table s2 tin decreased from 30 7 1 3 mg l 1 to 24 1 0 8 mg l 1 with only 3 2 3 7 mg l 1 cod detected figure s2 suggesting the removed nitrogen could be attributed to the autotrophic denitrification we speculated that s driven or fe driven autotrophic denitrification might occur first in the batch experiment n compounds remained stable in a 1 within 12 h while no3 n decreased from 29 5 0 1 mg l 1 to 26 1 0 0 mg l 1 with no nh4 n and no2 n accumulation in a 2 suggesting the bsc was able to drive denitrification second the binding energy at the xps peak position of s2p3 2 and fe2p3 2 of the bsc in

in s2 to 1654 1 131 4 mg l 1 in s3 we speculated that the valence state of sulfur has changed and sulfur autotrophic denitrification may occurred in the anode area in addition the decreased tin from

13613,nitrogen discharged from mariculture industry leads to adjacent aquatic pollution this study utilized an electrochemically assisted submerged fixed bed bioreactor e sfbbr to treat carbon limited saline mariculture wastewater and aimed to evaluate the performance and pathways of nitrogen removal by testing the effects of electrical stimulation and different current densities cd electro stimulation increased nitrogen removal performance of e sfbbr from 1 1 to 2 2 g n m 2 d 1 to 3 0 3 4 g n m 2 d 1 cd of 0 10 ma cm 2 resulted in the highest n removal rate results of water quality at different depths and the batch experiment revealed the n removal pathways in e sfbbr in the cathode area nitrogen removal was mainly attributed to the processes of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and in the anode area nitrification and autotrophic denitrification driven by sulfur or iron contributed to nitrogen elimination these findings provided a promising method for enhancing n removal from carbon limited mariculture effluents keywords maricluture wastewater submerged fixed bed bioreactors electro stimulation n removal pathways 1 introduction global mariculture production expanded to 62 3 million tones in 2016 due to the rapid development of intensive aquaculture 1 mariculture wastewater has become one of the main sources of saline wastewater 2 during aquaculture ammonia generated from metabolism of fish and deamination of protein in residual feed is toxic to aquatic organisms due to the oxygen rich conditions in aquaculture systems ammonia can be easily oxidized into nitrate no3 n which has lower toxicity nevertheless the accumulated no3 n raises risks of adjacent aquatic environment deterioration and even eutrophication 3 nitrogen n elimination from mariculture wastewater has become a worldwide challenge that needs to be solved urgently submerged fixed bed bioreactor sfbbr is widely used for wastewater treatment e g aquaculture effluents municipal sewage and industrial wastewater due to the simple mechanical structure low energy consumption and operating cost 4 sufficient electron donors e g organic carbon are necessary to ensure the efficient n removal of sfbbr however low c n ratio of mariculture wastewater i e 1 3 limits the denitrification process and then the n removal adding extra carbon sources including chemical regent or solid slow releasing materials is a common way to enhance denitrification process 5 but this raises costs and the risk of secondary organic pollution considering the difficulty in managing carbon addition to coincide with periodic fluctuation of n concentration electrochemically assisted sfbbr e sfbbr offers an alternative for enhancing n removal from mariculture wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec as one representative type of bio electrochemical system bes has been successfully coupled with bioreactors for n removal enhancement no3 n reduction can be promoted at the cathode area through direct electron transfer and autohydrogenotrophic denitrification 6 7 table s1 listed various bioreactor electrochemical coupling systems that have been applied for nitrogen removal enhancement in those studies the impacts of operating parameters such as current density cd hydraulic retention time hrt and salinity on nitrogen removal were evaluated however no study has been reported on using e sfbbr to treat mariculture wastewater on one hand high salinity of mariculture effluents could increase the osmotic pressure of microbial cells lead to cell dehydration or even death which may in turn affect the nitrogen removal performance of e sfbbr on the other hand at the cathode area of e sfbbr rich sulfate in sea water so4 2 5 30 mmol l 1 could be reduced by hydrogen h2 and generate reductive sulfur compounds which are able to resupply the electrons for denitrifying microbes 8 relieving the limitation of low mass transfer induced by the low solubility of h2 1 7 ppm 28 1 atm 9 therefore evaluating the overall n removal performance and elucidating the underlying coupling pathways of n and s transformations are essential to broaden the applications of e sfbbr in treating carbon limited mariculture wastewater the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the n removal performance of e sfbbr through test the effects of electro stimulation and

13614,to enhance the anti fouling performance of polysulfone psf membranes polyaniline pani nanofibers were used as additives in a facile method to prepare pani psf blended membranes ppms the fouling behavior between the membrane and natural organic matters nom pollutant was further analyzed by implementing extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory overall the performance of the ppms was improved in comparison with that of the pristine psf membrane the pure water flux of the ppm increased to 2 4 times that of pristine psf reaching up to 169 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the tensile strength of the hybrid membranes also increased after the incorporation of pani nanofibers in particular in anti fouling measurement the ppms exhibited enhanced anti fouling properties for filtration serum albumin bsa humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa solutions the anti fouling mechanism was analyzed by the interfacial interaction energy which were obtained by applying the xdlvo theory results confirmed that there are reduced attractive interaction energies between the ppms and nom pollutants molecules in comparison to the interaction between the pristine psf and nom pollutants molecules keywords polyaniline ultrafiltration membrane nom pollutants anti fouling xdlvo 1 introduction in the 1960s commercial membranes fabricated by immersion phase inversion gradually entered the market membrane separation technology has been actively developed and currently has a significant role in various industries including the environment food and medicine 1 2 ultrafiltration uf membrane materials can be generally divided into two categories organic and inorganic in particular polysulfone psf exhibits high chemical resistance good mechanical properties and perfect thermal stability which has facilitated its extensive use in the fabrication of psf uf membranes that are applied in many fields e g water treatment chemical processing biomedicine and reverse osmosis 3 4 despite the many advantages of membrane separation technology in wastewater purification pressure driven filtration inevitably which leads to a decrease in both the permeate flux as well as the membrane lifetime nevertheless on the main shortcoming of hydrophobicity of psf based uf membranes which is easier to cause severe membrane fouling during the operation process this will limit its industrial application 2 5 many techniques have been employed to increase the hydrophilic and anti fouling properties of membranes thereby tailoring them with desirable features such as surface coating 6 8 artificial graft modification 9 10 and physical blending 11 13 blending modification is a straightforward procedure which is very suitable for large scale industrial production it is also an attractive method for creating uf membranes influencing both the membrane surface and inner pore walls various kinds of hybrid psf uf membranes have been prepared by blending modification via incorporating different additives polyaniline pani is an organic conducting polymer with excellent properties such as good environmental stability superior metal corrosion resistance low cost and facile synthesis and hence has promising applications in various fields e g uf membranes 14 16 gas separation membranes 17 pervaporation 18 and semiconductor membranes 19 unlike inorganic nanomaterials pani nanomaterials exhibit better dispersion due to the presence of amino groups which are likely to positively influence the hydrophilic modification of polymer membrane materials for example fan et al reported that pani nanofibers were more compatible with polymeric membrane material for creating more significant porosity and better hydrophilicity pure water flux of the hybrid membrane attained 2 4 times that of the original and the bovine serum albumin bsa rejection reached 96 16 teli et al prepared nanocomposite membranes with pani and pani titanium dioxide nanoparticles as hydrophilic additives during membrane preparation results indicated that the nanocomposite membranes were endowed with improved water flux and enhanced anti fouling behavior 20 pani nanomaterials can be prepared with different morphologies such as nanoparticles nanofibers and nanoflakes 21 furthermore pani nanofibers have a one dimensional nanofiber structure with high specific surface area and high specific surface energy both significantly affect the phase transformation and hence influence the structure and properties of the membrane 2 14 otherwise owing to its doping dedoping characteristics pani can be transformed via a simple acid based treatment simplifying the composite membrane fabrication in most current studies pani nanofibers are usually synthesized through oxidative chemical polymerization 22 23 according to the researches natural organic matters nom in the liquid phase is the main factor to cause membrane fouling 24 whose main components are protein bsa humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa which also are three typical pollutants for studying the membrane fouling processes 25 29 generally membrane fouling is caused by the foulant adhesion on the membrane s surface and the membrane pore s blockage however membrane fouling mainly depends on the interaction between materials and dissolved nom in water 30 the essence of membrane fouling is at the interface of the liquid and membrane where the interaction between the pollutant and the membrane occurs at a contact distance of less than 20 nm 31 extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory has been usually used as a theoretical model to calculate the adhesion between two solid surfaces 32 35 therefore xdlvo theory can be used to analyze the interaction energies between the membrane and pollutants during the initial stage of the membrane fouling process 36 thus providing an excellent theoretical background for understanding the improvement in the anti fouling behavior this study aimed to produce pani psf blended membranes ppms with enhanced anti fouling performance using pani as an additive via non solvent induced phase separation and the anti fouling mechanisms of membranes were quantitatively analyzed through the xdlvo theory the pani nanofibers were systematically characterized by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem the membranes were also characterized and fundamental characteristics were examined the presented ppms demonstrate a

experiments was 7 07 cm2 before filtration and bsa ultrafiltration testing membranes must perform pre pressurizing 2 bar for 20 min with pure water to stabilize the membrane the pure water flux of membrane filtration test was carried out based on the reported testing methods 29 the rejection properties were tested using a 1 0 g l 1 bsa solution ph 7 0 0 2 molecular weight 68 000 under the same filtration operating environment every new measurement will be replaced with a new bsa solution with the same background the concentration of bsa was indirectly characterized by uv vs at the

respectively 2 4 5 anti fouling ability evaluation in order to consistent with the actual environmental concentration we confirmed the concentration of pollutants 20 mg l 1 and the membrane s anti fouling ability was evaluated via bsa ha and sa solutions 20 mg l 1 in the same filtration system water flux j w 1 was obtained before nom pollutants solution filtration then nom pollutants solution flux j p was measured under the same osmotic pressure finally the membrane was backwashed for 10 min using di water followed by the water flux j w 2 test data were recorded once every 10 min and experiments were carried out nine times in one cycle the flux recovery ratio f r r and total fouling ratio r t are expressed by the following equations 39 5 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 6 r t j w 1 j p j w 1

at 900 nm in the uv vis spectrum of pani that correspond to π π conjugated electron transition of the benzene ring 14 the partial protonation of doped pani chains 51 and the transition of polarons in the pani molecular chain structure respectively the ft ir spectrum of the pani nanofibers prepared in this experiment is shown in fig 2 b the absorption peaks at approximately 3430 and 1124 cm 1 were caused by nh and cn stretching vibrations of the benzene ring respectively the characteristic bands at 1244 and 1615 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the cn bond in the quinone ring a peak at 1480 cm 1 was the stretching mode of cc of the quinoid ring and benzene ring bands at 600 to 800 cm 1 were attributed to the out of plane bending vibration of cc nh or ch bonds 14 52 the uv vis and ft ir spectra both confirm the successful preparation of pani tem and sem were performed to observe the micromorphology of the pani nanofibers based on the sem images fig 2 c and d pani nanofibers were found in piles likely caused by agglomeration during the drying process there was no clear morphology of single pani particles however in the tem images in fig 2 e pani nanofibers presented a fibrous shape by further observation of high multiples fig 2 f it can be clearly seen that pani had nanofiber morphology it was analyzed by software that pani nanofibers diameters were in the range of 15 50 nm seen from fig 2 g the average diameter of the nanofibers was 30 53 nm 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 morphology sem images of the top surfaces of the membranes m0 m1 m2 m3 and m4 are shown in fig 3 m0 a m4 a respectively as described in section 2 2 the membrane name corresponds to the different pani content in the membrane when comparing the size and surface pore number in the original psf membrane m0 a that in the pani psf hybrid membranes were significantly larger as listed in table 3 the mean pore size of the m1 and m2 membranes exhibited a higher range 31 7 38 5 nm in comparison to that of the membrane without pani m0 23 4 nm however when the amount of added pani approached saturation the average porosity and pore size of the hybrid membrane decreased r m 3 37 2 nm r m 4 29 1 nm the results indicate that excessive pani content may cause aggregation thereby decreasing porosity and mean pore radius of the membrane the fracture morphology or cross section of the membranes is presented in fig 3 m0 b m4 b when the membranes were immersed in the non solvent coagulation bath the polymer concentration gradient in the casting solution resulted in an asymmetric porous structure in the membranes theoretically a large number and larger size of finger holes can bring higher water flux however the ppms had a thinner skin layer and better finger like pores in comparison to that of the pristine psf membrane the finger like pores are the main contributor to the improved pure water flux as shown in fig 3 b with increasing pani content the skin layer became thinner and the finger like holes became wider when the pani content was 2 fig 3 m2 b the finger like holes were broad and straight spanning from the skin layer to the bottom surface of the membrane however when the pani content increased to 3 fig 3 m3 b and 4 fig 3 m4 b the finger like pores became shorter and the connectivity between the top and bottom membrane surfaces was also reduced the diffusion rate between dmac and water accelerated with the incorporation of hydrophilic pani thus enabling the formation of a layer with larger pores 14 38 however as the amount of pani was increased the viscosity of the casting solution also increased as a result the phase conversion rate was reduced which led to the production of narrower channels as shown in fig 3 m3 b m4 b these results are in line with that reported by ma et al 14 3 2 2 fundamental characteristics of membranes and mechanical performance 3 2 2 1 hydrophilicity water flux and bsa rejection the wca reflects the hydrophilicity of a solid surface where the lower the wca the better the hydrophilic properties are the wca for all ppms shown in fig 4 was lower than that of the pristine psf the initial wca of m1 was 88 and decreased with the addition of pani nanofibers 1 wt compared to that of the pristine psf 92 as pani content in the psf matrix was increased the wca of the membranes was further reduced reaching a minimum of 72 for m4 4 wt pani this indicates that the addition of pani improved the hydrophilicity of the blended membranes because of its higher surface energy and the presence of the hydrophilic nh groups pani migrates to the surface of the membrane during phase inversion promoting the formation of water channels in the membrane pani tends to migrate to the membrane surface and speed up the diffusion rate between dmac and water during the phase inversion its hydrophilicity is beneficial in the formation of larger pores and increased porosity compared to that of pristine psf as shown in table 3 fig 4 c shows the pure water ph 5 8 0 1 flux of the membranes the incorporated pani significantly enhanced the water flux of the hybrid membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 exhibited higher flux than that of m0 and the maximum water flux was 169 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 m2 which is 2 3 times that of m0 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 however when the pani concentration was increased to 3 0 wt and 4 0 wt the pure water flux of both m3 and m4 decreased respectively possibly aggregation and an uneven distribution of pani in the casting solution hindered the rate of phase transformation and impaired the formation of larger and wider finger like pore structure 14 thus resulting in the decrease in pure water flux when considering the water flux and the morphology revealed in the sem images fig 3 it was clear that adding an appropriate amount of pani nanofibers effectively enhanced the water flux of the membrane the bsa rejection rates for all kinds of the membranes at tmp 0 1 bar were also presented in fig 4 d each set of tests for new membrane will be carried out with the same concentration of bsa solution the data shown that the bsa rejection of the m0 reached 97 as the pani content was increased in the hybrid membrane the bsa rejection first decreased and then increased m2 exhibited the highest water flux and its bsa rejection was the lowest the bsa rejection of all blended membranes remained above 92 nonetheless 92 was an excellent bsa rejection rate while increasing the water flux which was the anticipated result of the modification process 3 2 3 mechanical strength and thermal stability fig 5 a presents the mechanical properties of the membranes when compared with m0 m1 and m2 exhibited higher tensile strength 3 98 mpa for m0 compared with 4 23 and 4 62 mpa for m1 and m2 respectively which may be attributed to the incorporation of pani as nanofibers were considered to be strengthening materials however an excessive amount of pani likely causes agglomeration resulting in uneven distribution in the polymer matrix and the formation of large voids and pores instead of long and wide finger like pores which reduces the density of the membrane thereby decreasing the mechanical strength of the membrane 14 accordingly for higher pani concentration 3 0 wt and 4 0 wt the tensile strength slightly decreased to 4 59 mpa for m3 and 4 51 mpa for m4 considering these results the optimal amount of pani is 2 0 wt the m2 sample was therefore chosen for further testing the thermal stability of the pristine psf m0 and strongest membrane m2 with 2 0 wt pani was characterized by tga as shown in fig 5 b m2 underwent a weight loss of almost 5 62 in the range of 240 503 and m0 exhibited less weight loss 3 91 than that of m2 over the same temperature range which may be caused by the decomposition of hcl impurities present in the pani molecular chain 38 however above 503 the thermal loss of m0 60 4 was higher than that of m2 52 9 this may be due to the excellent thermal stability of pani resulting in the improvement of the thermal stability of the membranes 38 3 3 anti fouling performance the inevitable membrane fouling process can be roughly divided into two stages deposition and adhesion in the deposition stage nom pollutants continuously deposit on the membrane surface and gradually block the membrane pores and followed by cake layer formation 12 53 the water decreases steadily and rapidly as the next stage the adhesion begins most of the pollutant particles deposited on the membrane surface gradually reaches saturation and becomes cohesive to any further pollutant in the solution meaning that free pollutants in the solution will adhere to the filter cake deposited on the cake layer surface our research focus is at the deposition stage because membrane fouling mainly occurs at this point m0 and m2 were used to filtrate the bsa ha and sa solutions 20 mg l 1 and the results have shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a the normalized f bsa filtrate s normalized flux decreased rapidly which could be related to the deposition of bsa protein molecules on the membrane surface and inside the membrane pores after washing with di water the normalized flux of m0 and m2 both increased but neither reached the original level due to the concentration polarization 24 and irreversible membrane fouling however the normalized flux of bsa filtrate for m2 ppm was enhanced in comparison to that of m0 pristine psf also the similar experimental results of sa and ha solutions fig 6 b and c corresponding to the above three different pollutants bsa ha and sa the r t of m0 was 70 8 62 9 and 54 5 and that of m2 was 46 0 43 7 and 42 4 fig 6 d and e the f r r of m0 was 43 2 52 4 and 54 8 where it reached 65 3 67 9 and 70 1 in m2 indicating that the blended membrane had improved antifouling performance this suggested that the inclusion of hydrophilic pani additive reduced the membrane fouling caused by adsorbed nom pollutants 54 55 furthermore the membrane fouling behavior of three typical organic representatives was different referring to fig 6 f for m0 the normalized flux of bsa filtrate decreased rapidly at the beginning of filtration 0 30 min and the normalized flux decline rate of ha filtrate is slower which was more moderate than the former two the normalized flux decline rate of sa filtrate was the slowest m2 reflected the same changes for the above three pollutants 3 4 anti fouling mechanisms of membranes the suggested phenomenon can be further confirmed theoretically the xdlvo theory was used to study the thermodynamic reaction between pollutants and membrane surfaces the measured physicochemical properties and relevant parameters of pollutants and that of two of the membranes m0 and m2 were listed in tables 4 and 5 it was worth mentioning that for all the samples the difference in γ l w was small but the change in the polarity γ γ and γ a b of m2 was significantly greater than that of m0 for m2 γ was clearly different from γ this indicates that on the membrane surface the effect of the electron donors was more significant than that of electron acceptors which may be caused by the increased number of hydrophilic groups on the ppm m2 surface than on the pristine psf membrane m0 referring to these values the interfacial interaction energy δ g d between membranes m0 and m2 surfaces and three typical pollutants bsa ha and sa molecules varies as separation distance was calculated according to eqs 10 16 and presented in fig 11 for m0 and m2 the absolute value of the a b acid base interaction is much higher than that of l w van der waals and e l electrostatic interactions which indicated that in the deposition stage a b interaction played a leading role in the total interface interaction the negative values of δ g d t o t meant that there was attraction between the pollutants and the membrane and the higher absolute value the stronger attraction for the membrane bsa scenarios fig 7 a and d when the distance was 0 158 nm the δ g d t o t of m2 was about one half that of m0 table 5 and as the distance increased the attraction gradually weakened which indicated the attraction between bsa and m2 was less than that between bsa and m0 that was to say m2 can better resist the adsorption of bsa on its surface and the experimental results agreed fig 6 a for the membrane ha scenarios fig 7 b and e although both membranes displayed negative δ g d t o t the m2 possessed relatively smaller δ g d t o t value therefore resulted in enhanced antifouling ability moreover the similarly for the membrane sa scenarios the declining trend in the flux during the fouling runs with the nom solution may be related to changes in the interaction energies between the pollutant molecules and membranes 4 conclusions in this study pani was successfully prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization as confirmed by tem imaging the obtained pani was fibrous with an average diameter of the nanofibers of 30 53 nm blended ppms incorporating pani were successfully fabricated by immersion phase inversion and the effect of pani concentration on the performance of the ppms was investigated the performance of the hybrid membrane was optimized with 2 wt of pani in comparison to that of pristine psf ppms showed higher porosity pore size and tensile strength as well as improved hydrophilicity and thermal stability the water flux maximized at 169 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was 2 4 times that of the pristine psf membrane 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ppms also showed enhanced anti fouling behavior and higher flux recovery with the addition of pani over that of pristine psf and in the membrane fouling of bsa ha and sa the f r r increased from 43 2 52 9 and 54 8 in the pristine psf to 65 3 67 9 and 70 1 in the ppms moreover to study the anti fouling mechanism the interfacial interaction energy on the membrane fouling caused by nom pollutants bsa ha and sa was investigated using the xdlvo theory calculations proved that the attractive energies between nom pollutants and ppms are lower than those between nom pollutants and the pristine psf it was therefore further confirmed that the anti fouling performance of the hybrid membrane fabricated by blending with pani was improved our approach represents a convincing theoretical background for understanding the

13614,to enhance the anti fouling performance of polysulfone psf membranes polyaniline pani nanofibers were used as additives in a facile method to prepare pani psf blended membranes ppms the fouling

confirmed that there are reduced attractive interaction energies between the ppms and nom pollutants molecules in comparison to the interaction between the pristine psf and nom pollutants molecules keywords polyaniline ultrafiltration membrane nom pollutants anti fouling xdlvo 1 introduction in the 1960s commercial membranes fabricated by immersion phase inversion gradually entered the market membrane separation technology has been actively developed and currently has a significant role in various industries including the environment food and medicine 1 2 ultrafiltration uf membrane materials can be generally divided into two categories organic and inorganic in particular polysulfone psf exhibits high chemical resistance good mechanical properties and perfect thermal stability which has facilitated its extensive use in the fabrication of psf uf membranes that are applied in many fields e g water treatment chemical processing biomedicine and reverse osmosis 3 4 despite the many advantages of membrane separation technology in wastewater purification pressure driven filtration inevitably which leads to a decrease in both the permeate flux as well as the membrane lifetime nevertheless on the main shortcoming of hydrophobicity of psf based uf membranes which is easier to cause severe membrane fouling during the operation process this will limit its industrial application 2 5 many techniques have been employed to increase the hydrophilic and anti fouling properties of membranes thereby tailoring them with desirable features such as surface coating 6 8 artificial graft modification 9 10 and physical blending 11 13 blending modification is a straightforward procedure which is very suitable for large scale industrial production it is also an attractive method for creating uf membranes influencing both the membrane surface and inner pore walls various kinds of hybrid psf uf membranes have been prepared by blending modification via incorporating different additives polyaniline pani is an organic conducting polymer with excellent properties such as good environmental stability superior metal corrosion resistance low cost and facile synthesis and hence has promising applications in various fields e g uf membranes 14 16 gas separation membranes 17 pervaporation 18 and semiconductor membranes 19 unlike inorganic nanomaterials pani nanomaterials exhibit better dispersion due to the presence of amino groups which are likely to positively influence the hydrophilic modification of polymer membrane materials for example fan et al reported that pani nanofibers were more compatible with polymeric membrane material for creating more significant porosity and better hydrophilicity pure water flux of the hybrid membrane attained 2 4 times that of the original and the bovine serum albumin bsa rejection reached 96 16 teli et al prepared nanocomposite membranes with pani and pani titanium dioxide nanoparticles as hydrophilic additives during membrane preparation results indicated that the nanocomposite membranes were endowed with improved water flux and enhanced anti fouling behavior 20 pani nanomaterials can be prepared with different morphologies such as nanoparticles nanofibers and nanoflakes 21 furthermore pani nanofibers have a one dimensional nanofiber structure with high specific surface area and high specific surface energy both significantly affect the phase transformation and hence influence the structure and properties of the membrane 2 14 otherwise owing to its doping dedoping characteristics pani can be transformed via a simple acid based treatment simplifying the composite membrane fabrication in most current studies pani nanofibers are usually synthesized through oxidative chemical polymerization 22 23 according to the researches natural organic matters nom in the liquid phase is the main factor to cause membrane fouling 24 whose main components are protein bsa humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa which also are three typical pollutants for studying the membrane fouling processes 25 29 generally membrane fouling is caused by the foulant adhesion on the membrane s surface and the membrane pore s blockage however membrane fouling mainly depends on the interaction between materials and dissolved nom in water 30 the essence of membrane fouling is at the interface of the liquid and membrane where the interaction between the pollutant and the membrane occurs at a contact distance of less than 20 nm 31 extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory has been usually used as a theoretical model to calculate the adhesion between two solid surfaces 32 35 therefore xdlvo theory can be used to analyze the interaction energies between the membrane and pollutants during the initial stage of the membrane fouling process 36 thus providing an excellent theoretical background for understanding the improvement in the anti fouling behavior this study aimed to produce pani psf blended membranes ppms with enhanced anti fouling performance using pani as an additive via non solvent induced phase separation and the anti fouling mechanisms of membranes were quantitatively analyzed through the xdlvo theory the pani nanofibers were systematically characterized by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem the membranes were also characterized and fundamental characteristics were examined the presented ppms demonstrate a convenient avenue toward improving the anti fouling properties in hybrid membranes and we represent a new idea for confirming the improved anti fouling performance of membranes 2 materials and methods

aniline was added into a three neck round bottomed flask and diluted with a solution of 100 ml 1 mol l 1 hcl solution a then 1 5 g aps was dissolved in another 100 ml 1 mol l 1 hcl solution solution b subsequently solution a was added to solution b and stirred vigorously for 60 s followed by mixing and reaction at laboratory room temperature for 5 h next the reaction product was purified by vacuum filtration and the filter cake was washed in series with hcl solution 0 1 mol l 1 acetone and deionized di water finally the synthesized pani was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h to remove any residual solvent the pani preparation process is shown in fig 1 a uv vis uv 2450 shimadzu japan was used to determine the chemical composition of pani ft ir was carried out with a thermo nicolet is50 spectroscope thermo nicolet corporation usa to analyze the chemical bonding the morphology and structure of the pani nanofibers were characterized by using a japan scanning electron microscope sem s4800 hitachi japan and a transmission electron microscope tem hitachi h7650 japan respectively to prepare the tem sample a dispersion in ethanol was prepared and mounted on a copper grating 300 mesh 2 3 fabrication of ppms the ppms were fabricated via phase inversion 37 as shown in fig 1 b pani and pvp were ultrasonically dispersed 80 w into dmac 99 5 for 1 h psf 16 wt was then added to the mixed solution which was stirred at 60 c until psf dissolved completely to remove air bubbles from the casting solution ultrasonic defoaming was carried out the mixture was cast onto a glass substrate using an applicator thickness 200 μm and then immediately dipped into a distilled water coagulation bath at room temperature to obtain a membrane of the various samples made the volume of psf was the same in all casting solutions the pani psf proportions were 0 0 wt 1 0 wt 2 0 wt 3 0 wt and 4 0 wt in membranes named m0 m1 m2 m3 and m4 respectively membranes were preserved in di water for filtration performance testing a section of each membrane was naturally dried and cut to a proper size for characterization the composition of the casting solutions is summarized in table 1 2 4 measurement and characterization of ppms 2 4 1 morphology the surface and cross sectional morphology of the pristine psf and ppms were investigated by using sem to prepare the sem samples the membranes were cut to a proper size cross section samples were prepared by fracturing the membrane in liquid nitrogen all samples were gold sputtered prior to imaging membrane porosity ε was determined by the wet dry method 29 38 and the ε of each membrane was calculated according to eq 1 1 ε w w w d ρ w a t e r w w w d ρ w a t e r w d ρ p 100 where w w g and w d g are the mass of the wet and dry membrane respectively ρ

transmembrane pressure l m and a m2 are the thickness and effective area of the samples respectively 2 4 2 membrane hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of all samples was determineed by measuring the water contact angle wca of a sessile drop by using a contact angle measurement device dsa100 kruss germany 41 approximately 2 μl water drops were placed at ten random positions on the surface of the same membrane using a high resolution camera to record the time course of wca the mean value was calculated 2 4 3 mechanical strength and thermal stability the tensile strength of the membranes was evaluated by a ly 06 electronic single fiber strength tester laizhou electronic instrument co ltd china dry membranes were cut into strips 50 mm 5 mm for measuring controlling the tensile speed to 10 mm min 1 and the average value was taken thermogravimetric analysis tga sta409pc germany was carried out to demonstrate the thermal stability of the membrane further the heating rate was 10 c min 1 from room temperature to 800 c in n2 atmosphere 2 4 4 pure water flux and bsa rejection the cross flow filtration as shown in fig 1 c system was applied to detect the pure water flux and rejection performance of each membrane and all experiments were performed under 1 bar feed pressure under normal condition the cross flow velocity is 0 78 m s 1 the effective membrane area used in the experiments was 7 07 cm2 before filtration and bsa ultrafiltration testing membranes must perform pre pressurizing 2 bar for 20 min with pure water to stabilize the membrane the pure water flux of membrane filtration test was carried out based on the reported testing methods 29 the rejection properties were tested using a 1 0 g l 1 bsa solution ph 7 0 0 2 molecular weight 68 000 under the same filtration operating environment every new measurement will be replaced with a new bsa solution with the same background the concentration of bsa was indirectly characterized by uv vs at the characteristic peak of 280 nm the pure water flux j and percentage of bsa rejection r are defined according to eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 j q a t 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where q l is the total volume penetrating through the effective filtration area a m2 of the membrane during the operation time t h r is the rejection of bsa and cp and cf are concentrations of bsa in the permeate and feed mg l 1 respectively 2 4 5 anti fouling ability evaluation in order to consistent with the actual environmental concentration we confirmed the concentration of pollutants 20 mg l 1 and the membrane s anti fouling ability was evaluated via bsa ha and sa solutions 20 mg l 1 in the same filtration system water flux j w 1 was obtained before nom pollutants solution filtration then nom pollutants solution flux j p was measured under the same osmotic pressure finally the membrane was backwashed for 10 min using di water followed by the water flux j w 2 test data were recorded once every 10 min and experiments were carried out nine times in one cycle the flux recovery ratio f r r and total fouling ratio r t are expressed by the following equations 39 5 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 6 r t j w 1 j p j w 1

at 900 nm in the uv vis spectrum of pani that correspond to π π conjugated electron transition of the benzene ring 14 the partial protonation of doped pani chains 51 and the transition of polarons in the pani molecular chain structure respectively the ft ir spectrum of the pani nanofibers prepared in this experiment is shown in fig 2 b the absorption peaks at approximately 3430 and 1124 cm 1 were caused by nh and cn stretching vibrations of the benzene ring respectively the characteristic bands at 1244 and 1615 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the cn bond in the quinone ring a peak at 1480 cm 1 was the stretching mode of cc of the quinoid ring and benzene ring bands at 600 to 800 cm 1 were attributed to the out of plane bending vibration of cc nh or ch bonds 14 52 the uv vis and ft ir spectra both confirm the successful preparation of pani tem and sem were performed to observe the micromorphology of the pani nanofibers based on the sem images fig 2 c and d pani nanofibers were found in piles likely caused by agglomeration during the drying process there was no clear morphology of single pani particles however in the tem images in fig 2 e pani nanofibers presented a fibrous shape by further observation of high multiples fig 2 f it can be clearly seen that pani had nanofiber morphology it was analyzed by software that pani nanofibers diameters were in the range of 15 50 nm seen from fig 2 g the average diameter of the nanofibers was 30 53 nm 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 morphology sem images of the top surfaces of the membranes m0 m1 m2 m3 and m4 are shown in fig 3 m0 a m4 a respectively as described in section 2 2 the membrane name corresponds to the different pani content in the membrane when comparing the size and surface pore number in the original psf membrane m0 a that in the pani psf hybrid membranes were significantly larger as listed in table 3 the mean pore size of the m1 and m2 membranes exhibited a higher range 31 7 38 5 nm in comparison to that of the membrane without pani m0 23 4 nm however when the amount of added pani approached saturation the average porosity and pore size of the hybrid membrane decreased r m 3 37 2 nm r m 4 29 1 nm the results indicate that excessive pani content may cause aggregation thereby decreasing porosity and mean pore radius of the membrane the fracture morphology or cross section of the membranes is presented in fig 3 m0 b m4 b when the membranes were immersed in the non solvent coagulation bath the polymer concentration gradient in the casting solution resulted in an asymmetric porous structure in the membranes theoretically a large number and larger size of finger holes can bring higher water flux however the ppms had a thinner skin layer and better finger like pores in comparison to that of the pristine psf membrane the finger like pores are the main contributor to the improved pure water flux as shown in fig 3 b with increasing pani content the skin layer became thinner and the finger like holes became wider when the pani content was 2 fig 3 m2 b the finger like holes were broad and straight spanning from the skin layer to the bottom surface of the membrane however when the pani content increased to 3 fig 3 m3 b and 4 fig 3 m4 b the finger like pores became shorter and the connectivity between the top and bottom membrane surfaces was also reduced the diffusion rate between dmac and water accelerated with the incorporation of hydrophilic pani thus enabling the formation of a layer with larger pores 14 38 however as the amount of pani was increased the viscosity of the casting solution also increased as a result the phase conversion rate was reduced which led to the production of narrower channels as shown in fig 3 m3 b m4 b these results are in line with that reported by ma et al 14 3 2 2 fundamental characteristics of membranes and mechanical performance 3 2 2 1 hydrophilicity water flux and bsa rejection the wca reflects the hydrophilicity of a solid surface where the lower the wca the better the hydrophilic properties are the wca for all ppms shown in fig 4 was lower than that of the pristine psf the initial wca of m1 was 88 and decreased with the addition of pani nanofibers 1 wt compared to that of the pristine psf 92 as pani content in the psf matrix was increased the wca of the membranes was further reduced reaching a minimum of 72 for m4 4 wt pani this indicates that the addition of pani improved the hydrophilicity of the blended membranes because of its higher surface energy and the presence of the hydrophilic nh groups pani migrates to the surface of the membrane during phase inversion promoting the formation of water channels in the membrane pani tends to migrate to the membrane surface and speed up the diffusion rate between dmac and water during the phase inversion its hydrophilicity is beneficial in the formation of larger pores and increased porosity compared to that of pristine psf as shown in table 3 fig 4 c shows the pure water ph 5 8 0 1 flux of the membranes the incorporated pani significantly enhanced the water flux of the hybrid membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 exhibited higher flux than that of m0 and the maximum water flux was 169 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 m2 which is 2 3 times that of m0 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 however when the pani concentration was increased to 3 0 wt and 4 0 wt the pure water flux of both m3 and m4 decreased respectively possibly aggregation and an uneven distribution of pani in the casting solution hindered the rate of phase transformation and impaired the formation of larger and wider finger like pore structure 14 thus resulting in the decrease in pure water flux when considering the water flux and the morphology revealed in the sem images fig 3 it was clear that adding an appropriate amount of pani nanofibers effectively enhanced the water flux of the membrane the bsa rejection rates for all kinds of the membranes at tmp 0 1 bar were also presented in fig 4 d each set of tests for new membrane will be carried out with the same concentration of bsa solution the data shown that the bsa rejection of the m0 reached 97 as the pani content was increased in the hybrid membrane the bsa rejection first decreased and then increased m2 exhibited the highest water flux and its bsa rejection was the lowest the bsa rejection of all blended membranes remained above 92 nonetheless 92 was an excellent bsa rejection rate while increasing the water flux which was the anticipated result of the modification process 3 2 3 mechanical strength and thermal stability fig 5 a presents the mechanical properties of the membranes when compared with m0 m1 and m2 exhibited higher tensile strength 3 98 mpa for m0 compared with 4 23 and 4 62 mpa for m1 and m2 respectively which may be attributed to the incorporation of pani as nanofibers were considered to be strengthening materials however an excessive amount of pani likely causes agglomeration resulting in uneven distribution in the polymer matrix and the formation of large voids and pores instead of long and wide finger like pores which reduces the density of the membrane thereby decreasing the mechanical strength of the membrane 14 accordingly for higher pani concentration 3 0 wt and 4 0 wt the tensile strength slightly decreased to 4 59 mpa for m3 and 4 51 mpa for m4 considering these results the optimal amount of pani is 2 0 wt the m2 sample was therefore chosen for further testing the thermal stability of the pristine psf m0 and strongest membrane m2 with 2 0 wt pani was characterized by tga as shown in fig 5 b m2 underwent a weight loss of almost 5 62 in the range of 240 503 and m0 exhibited less weight loss 3 91 than that of m2 over the same temperature range which may be caused by the decomposition of hcl impurities present in the pani molecular chain 38 however above 503 the thermal loss of m0 60 4 was higher than that of m2 52 9 this may be due to the excellent thermal stability of pani resulting in the improvement of the thermal stability of the membranes 38 3 3 anti fouling performance the inevitable membrane fouling process can be roughly divided into two stages deposition and adhesion in the deposition stage nom pollutants continuously deposit on the membrane surface and gradually block the membrane pores and followed by cake layer formation 12 53 the water decreases steadily and rapidly as the next stage the adhesion begins most of the pollutant particles deposited on the membrane surface gradually reaches saturation and becomes cohesive to any further pollutant in the solution meaning that free pollutants in the solution will adhere to the filter cake deposited on the cake layer surface our research focus is at the deposition stage because membrane fouling mainly occurs at this point m0 and m2 were used to filtrate the bsa ha and sa solutions 20 mg l 1 and the results have shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a the normalized f bsa filtrate s normalized flux decreased rapidly which could be related to the deposition of bsa protein molecules on the membrane surface and inside the membrane pores after washing with di water the normalized flux of m0 and m2 both increased but neither reached the original level due to the concentration polarization 24 and irreversible membrane fouling however the normalized flux of bsa filtrate for m2 ppm was enhanced in comparison to that of m0 pristine psf also the similar experimental results of sa and ha solutions fig 6 b and c corresponding to the above three different pollutants bsa ha and sa the r t of m0 was 70 8 62 9 and 54 5 and that of m2 was 46 0 43 7 and 42 4 fig 6 d and e the f r r of m0 was 43 2 52 4 and 54 8 where it reached 65 3 67 9 and 70 1 in m2 indicating that the blended membrane had improved antifouling performance this suggested that the inclusion of hydrophilic pani additive reduced the membrane fouling caused by adsorbed nom pollutants 54 55 furthermore the membrane fouling behavior of three typical organic representatives was different referring to fig 6 f for m0 the normalized flux of bsa filtrate decreased rapidly at the beginning of filtration 0 30 min and the normalized flux decline rate of ha filtrate is slower which was more moderate than the former two the normalized flux decline rate of sa filtrate was the slowest m2 reflected the same changes for the above three pollutants 3 4 anti fouling mechanisms of membranes the suggested phenomenon can be further confirmed theoretically the xdlvo theory was used to study the thermodynamic reaction between pollutants and membrane surfaces the measured physicochemical properties and relevant parameters of pollutants and that of two of the membranes m0 and m2 were listed in tables 4 and 5 it was worth mentioning that for all the samples the difference in γ l w was small but the change in the polarity γ γ and γ a b of m2 was significantly greater than that of m0 for m2 γ was clearly different from γ this indicates that on the membrane surface the effect of the electron donors was more significant than that of electron acceptors which may be caused by the increased number of hydrophilic groups on the ppm m2 surface than on the pristine psf membrane m0 referring to these values the interfacial interaction energy δ g d between membranes m0 and m2 surfaces and three typical pollutants bsa ha and sa molecules varies as separation distance was calculated according to eqs 10 16 and presented in fig 11 for m0 and m2 the absolute value of the a b acid base interaction is much higher than that of l w van der waals and e l electrostatic interactions which indicated that in the deposition stage a b interaction played a leading role in the total interface interaction the negative values of δ g d t o t meant that there was attraction between the pollutants and the membrane and the higher absolute value the stronger attraction for the membrane bsa scenarios fig 7 a and d when the distance was 0 158 nm the δ g d t o t of m2 was about one half that of m0 table 5 and as the distance increased the attraction gradually weakened which indicated the attraction between bsa and m2 was less than that between bsa and m0 that was to say m2 can better resist the adsorption of bsa on its surface and the experimental results agreed fig 6 a for the membrane ha scenarios fig 7 b and e although both membranes displayed negative δ g d t o t the m2 possessed relatively smaller δ g d t o t value therefore resulted in enhanced antifouling ability moreover the similarly for the membrane sa scenarios the declining trend in the flux during the fouling runs with the nom solution may be related to changes in the interaction energies between the pollutant molecules and membranes 4 conclusions in this study pani was successfully prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization as confirmed by tem imaging the obtained pani was fibrous with an average diameter of the nanofibers of 30 53 nm blended ppms incorporating pani were successfully fabricated by immersion phase inversion and the effect of pani concentration on the performance of the ppms was investigated the performance of the hybrid membrane was optimized with 2 wt of pani in comparison to that of pristine psf ppms showed higher porosity pore size and tensile strength as well as improved hydrophilicity and thermal stability the water flux maximized at 169 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 which was 2 4 times that of the pristine psf membrane 72 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 ppms also showed enhanced anti fouling behavior and higher flux recovery with the addition of pani over that of pristine psf and in the membrane fouling of bsa ha and sa the f r r increased from 43 2 52 9 and 54 8 in the pristine psf to 65 3 67 9 and 70 1 in the ppms moreover to study the anti fouling mechanism the interfacial interaction energy on the membrane fouling caused by nom pollutants bsa ha and sa was investigated using the xdlvo theory calculations proved that the attractive energies between nom pollutants and ppms are lower than those between nom pollutants and the pristine psf it was therefore further confirmed that the anti fouling performance of the hybrid membrane fabricated by blending with pani was improved our approach represents a convincing theoretical background for understanding the improvement in anti fouling behavior declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript and the manuscript was approved by all authors for publication
