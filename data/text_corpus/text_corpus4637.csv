23185,in order to conduct the comprehensive analysis of fluid structure interactions acoustic radiation and acoustic propagation a three dimensional sono elastic method in the frequency domain is proposed in this paper in this method the three dimensional hydroelasticity theory of floating structures is incorporated with the hydro acoustic propagation theory by introducing frequency domain green s functions appropriate to the ocean hydro acoustic waveguide environment the simple source boundary integral approach is adopted to obtain the sono elastic response in the frequency domain in order to deal with the irregular frequency problem in this approach a closed virtual impedance surface cvis method is put forward at last the sono elastic method is validated by calculating the acoustic radiation of a floating elastic spherical shell and an experiment of the underwater acoustic radiation of two ring stiffened cylindrical shell models keywords hydroelasticity sono elasticity green s function irregular frequencies vibration acoustic radiation 1 introduction for a long time the issue of floating structures vibration in the water along with the acoustic radiation and scattering has been studied separately from the issue of acoustic waves propagation in the ocean waveguide environment in the former issue the sea water is modelled as ideal acoustic medium and the influence of free surface and seabed boundary was often ignored as for the latter issue the investigations of the transmission of acoustic waves mainly focused on the monopole point source in practice these are two interrelated issues that need to be considered simultaneously with the development of theoretical methods and computational techniques it will be possible to perform an integrated calculation and analysis for problems in both of these two aspects including the floating structures fluid structure interactions the acoustic radiation and the acoustic propagation in the ocean waveguide environment in a broad sense this issue belongs to the category of hydroelasticity but the water here must be treated as compressible acoustic medium which differs from the conventional hydroelasticity studies wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 chen et al 2006 gao et al 2011 during the past few decades researchers have developed various methods to deal with the problem of floating structures acoustic radiation and scattering in the ideal acoustic medium for instance some analytical methods are established to evaluate the acoustic radiation of structures with regular shapes such as the elastic spherical shell the cylindrical shell and the equidistantly stiffened single or double cylindrical shell burroughs 1984 junger and feit 1986 skelton and james 1997 the approaches appropriate for the structures with complex shapes include the finite element finite element method fem fem hunt et al 1974 1975 the finite element finite element infinite element method fem fem iem astley and macaulay 1994 burnett and holford 1998 and the finite element boundary element method fem bem chen and schweikert 1963 everstine and henderson 1990 giordano and koopmann 1995 tong et al 2007 peters et al 2014 according to the finite element finite element method fem fem both of the floating structure and the water medium are modelled with discrete finite elements artificial absorbing boundary conditions are set at the edge of the water area when it comes to acoustic radiation problems in broad water areas the finite element method cost a large amount of computation thus only the sound field near the structure can be calculated and given when using the finite element finite element infinite element method fem fem iem the floating structure and the near field acoustic medium are modelled with finite elements while the far field acoustic medium is modelled with infinite elements at present the research on this method is still inadequate the strategy of the fem bem method is modelling the floating structures with finite elements and the fluid field with boundary elements on the wetted surface based on the boundary integral equation in this method the green s functions used to describe the acoustic propagation in the fluid field are often expressed in analytical forms as a consequence this method has the advantage of high precision and effectiveness when it s used to deal with the acoustic problems in the infinite or half infinite fluid field the fem bem method which avoids the deficiencies of the fem fem method is the most commonly used method to solve the complex structures sono elasticity problem in the low frequency band everstine and henderson 1990 regard the fem bem method as the most practical way to calculate the large scale structures acoustic radiation with high precision historically there are mainly two kinds of boundary element methods bem in the study of acoustics the helmholtz integral method and the simple source method when using these two kinds of methods in practice there is an irregular frequency problem i e the results near the irregular frequencies are often significantly distorted strictly speaking the irregular frequencies are of purely numerical problem with no physical explanation it has been proved in a mathematical manner that there is no solution at the irregular frequencies in the simple source method while the solution is not unique at the irregular frequencies in the helmholtz integral method schenck 1968 since the 1970s the helmholtz integral method has been widely used in acoustics for the reason that various methods are created to solve the problem of irregular frequencies in this method schenck 1968 burton and miller 1971 wu and seybert 1991 on the contrary improvement is still needed to deal with the irregular frequency problem in the simple source method in this paper the three dimensional hydroelasticity of floating structures wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 is incorporated with the hydro acoustic propagation theory to gain a three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain by introducing a frequency domain green s function appropriate to the hydro acoustic waveguide environment this method makes it possible to implement a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and sound propagation the details are given about how the simple source boundary integral equation is theoretically derived from helmholtz boundary integral equation it s pointed out that the irregular frequencies in the simple source method are induced by the resonances of imaginary inner fluid field taking this principle into consideration a closed virtual impedance surface is introduced in the imaginary inner fluid domain to absorb the energy of acoustic vibration thus eliminating the resonances and irregular frequencies this method is named as the closed virtual impedance surface cvis method according to the simple source method the acoustic field is obtained by the superposition of a series of monopole point sources with different amplitudes and phases distributed on the wetted surface of the floating structures since the monopole source s acoustic propagation in the ocean waveguide environment has been widely studied jensen et al 2011 lots of existing results can be directly introduced into the calculation of green s functions used in this work according to classic method of three dimensional hydroelasticity wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 the dry modals the structure vibration modals in vacuum are selected as the generalized basis functions because they are orthogonal complete and easy to solve the effect of fluid structure interaction is reflected in the corresponding added mass radiation damping and generalized restoring coefficients this approach has the advantage of high calculation efficiency and clear physical meaning besides it can separate the principal modes that make a significant contribution to the vibration and acoustic radiation the advantages of this method are inherited in this work with reference to the general definition of hydroelasticity heller and abramson 1959 the sono elasticity mentioned in this work is defined as a discipline that deals with the interactions between the inertia force the acoustic pressure in the water and the elastic force in the structures 2 the sono elasticity theory of ships in frequency domain for the zero forward speed case the fluid motion and responses of a floating body are defined in an equilibrium coordinate system oxyz with the x axis pointing towards the bow the z axis pointing upwards as shown in fig 1 the ship structure is assumed to be linear with small motions and distortions about its equilibrium position the displacement at any point of the structure may be expressed as the superposition of the principal modes in vacuum bishop et al 1986 1 u t r 1 m d r q r t where d r and q r t r 1 2 m are respectively the principal modes and principal coordinates with the first six r 1 2 6 being the rigid body modes during the process of structural vibration and acoustic radiation the fluid restoring force is rather small and negligible the generalized equations of motion of the ship structure may be written in matrix form as 2 a q b q c q ξ t g t where a b and c are matrices of generalized mass generalized damping and generalized stiffness of the dry modes q is a column vector of the principal coordinate if there is no incident acoustic waves and only mechanical excitations are concerned in the present analysis of structural vibration and acoustic radiation problems there exists generalized radiation wave force ξ t and generalized mechanical exciting force g t if the fluid is inviscid and compressible its flow is irrotational the fluid density is uniformly distributed and the amplitudes of acoustic waves are small there exists a velocity potential function φ for description of the acoustic field caused by structural vibrations of a ship the total velocity potential φ can be represented as the linear superposition of the acoustic wave radiation velocity potential of each order 3 φ x y z t r 1 m φ r x y z t where φ r x y z t is the r th order acoustic wave radiation velocity potential which is induced from the ship s vibration excited by the external loads the velocity of fluid is expressed as 4 v φ where x i y j z k is the hamilton differential operator i j and k are the unit vectors corresponding to the x y and z axis respectively the sound pressure in the fluid field can be written as 5 p x y z t ρ 0 φ t where ρ 0 is the fluid density assuming a time harmonic dependence in the form of e i ω t in frequency domain the corresponding r th radiation wave potential may be represented as 6 φ r x y z t φ r x y z q r t φ r x y z q r ω e i ω t where q r ω is the principal coordinate displacement of the r th order modal in the frequency domain in the frequency domain the acoustic wave velocity potential should satisfy the helmholtz equation as shown below 7 2 φ r k 2 φ r 0 where k ω c 0 is the acoustic wave number and c 0 is the sound speed in water as shown in fig 2 the elastic structure is located in the acoustic medium s denotes the wetted surface and n is the unit normal vector of s imagine that there is a fluid field τ i inside the structure with its wetted surface s i coinciding with s the unit normal vector of s i is n i n according to the green s formula and the helmholtz equation expressed in eq 7 the helmholtz boundary integral equation of the acoustic wave potential can be expressed by schenck 1968 copley 1967 8a s i φ i r r 0 g r r 0 n i r 0 g r r 0 φ i r r 0 n i r 0 d s 0 r τ 2 π φ i r r r s i 4 π φ i r r r τ i 8b s φ r r 0 g r r 0 n r 0 g r r 0 φ r r 0 n r 0 d s 4

appropriate source intensity is determined by the vibration boundary condition on the wetted surface s substituting eq 10a and eq 10b into eq 9 the simple source boundary integral equation of the velocity potential is obtained 11 φ r r 1 4 π s σ r r 0 g r r 0 d s if the hess smith constant panel method is adopted to divide the wet surface into discrete elements the acoustic field described by the simple source method can be regarded as a field formed by the superposition of a series of monopole point sources with different amplitudes and phases distributed on the wetted surface of the floating body considering the finite water depth case and assuming that the acoustic reflection coefficients at the seabed and sea surface are γ and γ 1 respectively we can get the green s function shown in eq 12 which corresponds to a virtual source chain formed due to a succession of reflections as shown in fig 3 brekhovskikh 1980 12 g r r 0 l 0 γ γ 1 l e i k r l 1 r l 1 γ e i k r l 2 r l 2 γ

surface which is the pressure release boundary when γ 0 1 0 6 it s found that only the first seven terms of eq 12 are needed to ensure satisfactory accuracy and convergence from eq 4 we can obtain the fluid structure coupling boundary condition that need to be satisfied at the wetted surface of the floating body 13 φ r n i ω u r n where u r is the r th mode displacement vector on the wetted surface according to eq 11 and eq 13 the source intensity σ r of each mode on the wetted surface can be solved 14 φ r r n r 1 2 σ r r 1 4 π s σ r r 0 g r r 0 n r d s r s where φ r r n r r s is the r th mode velocity in n direction as show in eq 13 after the source intensity on the wetted surface is got the corresponding acoustic velocity potential φ r of each mode can be calculated according to eq 3 eq 5

respectively the matrices of added mass and radiation damping coefficients in the frequency domain the elements of which can be obtained from eq 17 and eq 18 according to the principle of modal superposition the structural vibration can be directly calculated from eq 1 after the principal coordinates q r r 1 2 m are obtained by solving eq 19 the acoustic radiation pressure in the water can be calculated through eq 3 eq 5 and eq 6 the sound power radiated from the wetted surface of the structure in frequency domain is derived from eq 1 eq 3 eq 5 eq 6 and eq 18 20 p ω 1 2 re j 1 m r 1 m i ω q r b r j i ω q j where the superscript denotes complex conjugate 3 the cvis method used to eliminate the irregular frequencies there is also an irregular frequency problem when using the simple source approach to solve the intensity of the sources distributed on the wetted surface of the structure the occurrence of irregular frequencies in the analysis of a wave body or fluid structure interaction problem greatly reduces the precision of predictions this is a kind of mathematical phenomena representing one of the numerical solution regions of the corresponding boundary integral equations which are not the physical answers in the actual fluid domain to eliminate the irregular frequencies in the prediction of acoustic responses of a structure in acoustic medium τ it is proposed in this paper to place a closed virtual impedance surface s i 2 in the imaginary inner fluid domain τ i inside the wetted surface s see fig 4 assuming that φ i and φ are respectively the velocity potentials defined in the inner and the outer fluid domain the interface boundary conditions on s i 2 and s may be written as 21 φ i r n i r i ω u n i 2 r r s i 2 p n i 2 r i ω z s u n i 2 r i ω ρ 0 φ i r r s i 2 φ r n r i ω u n r r s where p n i 2 is the pressure on s i 2 u n i 2 and z s are respectively the displacement and mechanical impedance of s i 2 in n i direction u n is the displacement of s in n direction in the light of eq 21 and the derivation process of the simple source boundary integral equation the integral equations for solving the source strength σ in the outer domain and the unknown displacement u n i 2 are as follows 22 φ r n r 1 2 σ r 1 4 π s σ r 0 g r r 0 n r d s i ω 4 π s i 2 u n i 2 r 0 g r r 0 n r d s 1 4 π ρ 0 s i 2 z s u n i 2 r 0 2 g r r 0 n i r 0

surface inside the wetted surface of the body not only moves the oscillation frequencies of the inner fluid domain to the upper band by changing its volume but also absorbs the oscillation energy of the inner flow this enables the elimination or removal of the irregular frequencies 4 numerical examples and verification of the present method a fem bem method is used to implement the numerical calculation of the examples in this section two discrete models are used in this method one is the finite element model which is used to obtain the dry modes of the structure in vacuo the other is the boundary element model of the wetted surface also called the wet panel model which is used to calculate the fluid structure coupled vibration and acoustic radiation in this paper the dry modes of the structure is calculated using the finite element software abaqus meanwhile boundary element codes are developed by the authors and combined with the dry modes to obtain the fluid structure coupled vibration and acoustic radiation constant boundary elements wu 1984 marburg and nolte 2008 i e the wetted surface of the model is discretized into a series of quadrilateral wetted surface elements and the effect of each element is transferred to its center point equivalently after a numerical discretization the velocity potential in eq 11 becomes 24 ϕ r r 1 4 π j 1 n σ r j r 0 g r r 0 δ s j where n is the number of the discretized elements on the wetted surface of the floating body δ s j is the area of the jth element σ r j r 0 is the source intensity of the jth element 4 1 the verification of acoustic radiation of a single spherical shell in infinite fluid domain in this section the acoustic radiation of an elastic spherical shell which is symmetrical under the excitation of a concentrated harmonic force is computed and verified where the fluid domain is infinite and the effect of hydrostatic pressure is ignored the radius and thickness of the spherical shell are 0 5 m and 1 mm respectively the density young s modulus poisson s ratio and damping ratio of the shell s material are 7800 kg m3 2 1 1011n m2 0 3 and 0 01 respectively the density of the fluid is 1025 kg m3 and the sound velocity in the fluid medium is 1500 m s there is an analytical solution for the acoustic radiation of a spherical shell in the infinite fluid domain the sound pressure radiated by the spherical shell excited by a unit harmonic concentrated force f as shown in fig 5 is expressed as junger and feit 1986 25 p r s θ s ω ρ 0 ω 2 n 0 u n r h n 2 k r s k d h n 2 χ d χ χ k r p n cos θ s where u n r is the amplitude of the n th modal displacement in radial direction h n 2 is the n th sphere hankel function of the second kind p n is the n th legendre polynomial and r is the radius of the spherical shell in the process of numerical calculation the value of n can not be infinite that is it must be truncated the truncated value of n must be sufficiently large to gain convergence specifically it is related to the dimension of the spherical shell and the frequency range for the example presented in this paper n max 7 is enough to obtain a convergent solution by introducing a green s function appropriate for the infinite ideal acoustic medium the acoustic radiation pressure is calculated with the program developed on the basis of the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain the wetted surface panel model is shown in fig 6 where the grid length is about 0 05 m to verify the accuracy of this method as well as the program the numerical results are compared with the analytical solutions as shown in fig 7 it s seen that the numerical results almost entirely coincide with the analytical solutions the slight difference is caused by the numerical discretization which exactly proved the effectiveness of the sono elastic analysis method the sound pressure at a field point can be transformed into the sound pressure level spl by using the formula below 26 l p ω 20 log 10 p r s θ s ω 1 10 6 20 log 10 r s 4 2 the acoustic radiation of the spherical shell in finite depth water now consider that the spherical shell of section 4 1 is submerged in finite depth water as shown in fig 8 by introducing a green s function in finite depth water as shown in eq 12 the influence of finite water depth on the acoustic radiation of elastic structures is investigated in this section the underwater acoustic radiation power of the spherical shell is calculated with various water depths submerging depths the distance from the center of the sphere to the sea surface and acoustic reflection coefficients of the seabed the sound power can be expressed in the form of sound source level ssl by eq 27 as shown in fig 9 it s seen from fig 9 a that the acoustic radiation power of the spherical shell is influenced by the sea surface and the seabed this influence is more significant when considering shallow sea acoustic environment in fig 9 a it s found that as the water depth and submerged depth increase the curves from water depth 4 m submerged depth 2 m to water depth 10 m submerged depth 5 m and then to water depth 65 m submerged depth 30 m converge gradually in the ssl curve water depth 65 m submerged depth 30 m the fluctuations caused by the acoustic reflection at the sea surface and the seabed are slight 27 l s ω 10 log 10 p ω 4 π 0 65 10 18 by further analyzing the acoustic radiation of various structures it s found that when h 1 d s 10 50 and h 2 d s 10 50 where h 1 is the distance from the center of the structure to the sea surface h 2 is the distance from the center of the structure to the seabed d s is the draught or molded depth of the structure the effect of the sea surface and the seabed on the structure s acoustic radiation power can be ignored 4 3 example of eliminating irregular frequencies to examine the availability of the cvis method that is put forward to eliminate irregular frequencies in section 3 a spherical shell in infinite fluid domain is selected as a numerical example the acoustic impedance of sway vibration mode of the spherical shell is calculated the radius of the spherical shell is 0 5 m the density of the fluid is 1025 kg m3 and the sound velocity in the fluid is 1500 m s the grid length of the wetted surface panel is approximately 0 05 m for the sway mode the vibration displacements of the points on the spherical shell are all the same in this work the displacement magnitude is set to 1 m the non dimensional acoustic impedance is defined as 28 z s p f r i ω ρ 0 c 0 a s p 1 m 2 where f r s p n u r d s is the generalized fluid force a s p is the wetted surface area of the spherical shell 1 m 2 is for dimensional coordination the imaginary part of z s p is non dimensional acoustic reactance which corresponds to the added mass the real part of z s p is non dimensional acoustic resistance which corresponds to the radiation damping the closed virtual impedance surface consists of the six surfaces of a cubic box the side length of which is 0 4 m fig 10 presents the influence of different impedance values of the virtual surface on eliminating irregular frequencies it is seen that the numerical results are close to the analytical solutions and the irregular frequencies are effectively eliminated when z s 0 1 ρ 0 c 0 or z s ρ 0 c 0 however when z s 10 ρ 0 c 0 the result curves have peaks and valleys the inflection point of the imaginary part the acoustic reactance corresponds to the peak point of the real part the acoustic resistance which is exactly the characteristic of the irregular frequency according to the absorption principle of plane sound waves the acoustic energy will be completely absorbed when the impedance of the absorption surface is equal to the fluid s characteristic impedance and the acoustic absorption effect will be weak if the difference between the two kinds of impedance becomes big in practice it is suggested that the impedance of the virtual surface should be set as ρ 0 c 0 i e the characteristic impedance of the fluid theoretically as long as the real part of the virtual surface s impedance is not zero the resonance will not happen in the imaginary inner fluid domain and thus the irregular frequencies don t exist in this case but in practice due to the numerical discretization error the peaks and valleys at irregular frequencies are only abated when the absorption effect of the virtual surface is weak thus there is still a phenomenon of irregular frequencies but it s predicted that the dependence on z s will decrease with the grid of wetted surface panel further refined the surface of a cubic box is selected as the closed virtual impedance surface the impedance value of which is set as z s ρ 0 c 0 results under various side lengths of the cubic box are plotted and compared in fig 11 it s seen that as the side length increases the irregular frequencies are eliminated more effectively as the contact area of the virtual surface and the imaginary inner fluid domain increases the area of acoustic energy absorption increases thus the resonance of imaginary inner flow is suppressed better the ratio of the virtual surface area to the spherical wetted surface area is 0 076 when the side length b 0 2 m while this ratio is 0 306 when b 0 4 m by further analysis the author found that the results are not good when the minimum distance from the virtual surface to the wetted surface is less than the grid length of the wetted surface panel this phenomenon is induced by the numerical discretization in practice it s suggested that the area ratio of the virtual surface and the wetted surface should be about 0 1 0 4 5 verification of the numerical method and program by model tests 5 1 comparison of the dry vibration modal two ring stiffened steel cylindrical shell models are made in order to perform the test about the vibration and acoustic radiation caused by mechanical excitation in finite depth water the numerical method is validated by the test results the main parameters of the two models are shown in table 1 before implementing a three dimensional sono elastic analysis the dry structure numerical model should be established to solve dry modes the quality of the dry structure numerical model has a significant influence on the computation precision of acoustic radiation the dry finite element models of the two cylindrical shells are shown in fig 12 the cylindrical shells the stiffeners and the caps at both ends are modelled using four node shell elements the density the young s modulus and the poisson s ratio are respectively 7800 kg m3 2 1 1011n m2 and 0 3 the modal tests are implemented with the models hanged in the air using resilient ropes considering the symmetry of the models 8 accelerometers are evenly distributed on the half cycle at the mid cross section of the cylindrical shell to measure the vibration responses in the normal direction the model is excited by an electromagnetic vibration exciter and the natural frequencies as well as the dry vibration modes of the cross section are tested as shown in fig 13 the test results and calculation results are shown and compared in fig 14 fig 15 and table 2 it s seen that the natural frequencies calculated by the program are in good agreement with the results obtained from the tests where the error is within 5 the numerically calculated mode shapes of different circumferential wave numbers are similar to the test results which further proved the accuracy of the dry structure numerical models 5 2 comparison of underwater acoustic radiation in the test of underwater acoustic radiation the electromagnetic vibration exciter shown in fig 13 is still used as the excitation source the maximum exciting force of the exciter is approximately 50n an impedancemeter is installed on the bottom of the excitation rod for measuring excitation force and vibration response at the excitation point because the excitation force is required as the input of the numerical calculation this force must be tested precisely it s ideal that the excitation force from the excitation rod is the only vibration force transmitted to the cylindrical shell without any additional vibration forces however there must be supporting points for the electromagnetic exciter on the structure in order to cope with this problem the exciter is fixed on a mounting bracket which is installed on a foundation with four rubber vibration isolators in this way the vibration forces transmitted from the electromagnetic exciter to the foundation can be well isolated at frequencies above 80 hz the test of the two models underwater acoustic radiation is implemented in an open lake district the water depth of which is approximately 60 m 70 m as shown in fig 16 the model is located 10 m under the water surface and connected to the deck of a ship through a steel pipe the hydrophone is located at the water level of the mid cross section of the test model it is 5 2 m away from the axis of the test model exactly toward the direction of the electromagnetic exciter a wide frequency band exciting force is emitted from the exciter and transferred to the cylindrical shell the signal to noise ratio snr is sufficiently large in the frequency band of concern the hydrophone used in this experiment is bk 8103 this hydrophone can be used for making absolute sound measurements over the frequency range of 0 1 hz to 180 khz with a receiving sensitivity of 211 db re 1v μpa 2 db the sampling frequency of acoustic pressure f s should be set according to shannon s sampling theorem usually f s is approximately three or four times the maximum frequency of the signal the sampled signal is then amplified and transferred to the computer through the data acquisition system dividing the acoustic pressure tested by the hydrophone by the excitation force tested by the impedancemeter yields the transfer function of acoustic pressure this pressure is then transformed into the sound pressure level spl 1 m away from the axis of the test model and compared with the numerical results considering the water depth and the acoustic characteristic of the water bottom the green s function in eq 12 is introduced the water depth is h 65 m the acoustic reflection coefficient of the water bottom and the free surface are γ 0 5 and γ 1 1 respectively using the sono elastic analysis method the sound pressure at the hydrophone point is calculated for the two stiffened cylindrical shell models excited by a unit normal concentrated force the acoustic pressure is then transformed into the 1 3oct acoustic pressure spectrum level the numerical results are compared with the test results as shown in fig 17 it shows that in general the predictions of the numerical sono elastic analysis method agree well with the test results thus the validity and practicality of this method and the program are further proved 6 the thafts acoustic software based on the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain a software module named thafts acoustic is developed by the china ship scientific research center cssrc the logo of the software is shown in fig 18 this software provides user friendly preprocessing and post processing functions also it s suitable for large scale parallel computation this software makes it possible to perform a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and acoustic propagation the kernel codes of this module are developed on the basis of thafts three dimensional hydroelastic analyses of floating traveling structure software 7 conclusions in this paper the theoretical deductions of the three dimensional frequency domain sono elastic analysis method are described in detail by introducing a frequency domain green s function appropriate to the hydro acoustic waveguide environment the three dimensional hydroelasticity theory of floating structures is incorporated with the hydro acoustic propagation theory to gain a three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain this method makes it possible to implement a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and sound propagation the cvis method is put forward for the simple source boundary integral approach in this work by introducing a closed virtual impedance surface in the imaginary inner fluid field the acoustic energy is absorbed and the resonance of the inner virtual fluid field is suppressed and thus the irregular frequencies are eliminated the accuracy of this method is validated by calculating a spherical structure s modal acoustic impedances through a series of numerical examples the principles about the setting of the key parameters when using this method are summarized the impedance of the virtual surface should be equal to the characteristic impedance of the fluid the area of the virtual surface should be 0 1 0 4 times of the wetted surface area the acoustic radiation of an elastic spherical shell in infinite fluid is predicted and compared with analytical solution for validation of the sono elastic analysis method and then the accuracy and practicality of this method are further proved by the tests of underwater acoustic radiation of two ring stiffened cylindrical shells in finite depth water based on the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain a software module named thafts acoustic is developed by the china ship scientific research center cssrc this software module can be used to deal with a series of problems in the engineering practice acknowledgements this

calculation and analysis for problems in both of these two aspects including the floating structures fluid structure interactions the acoustic radiation and the acoustic propagation in the ocean waveguide environment in a broad sense this issue belongs to the category of hydroelasticity but the water here must be treated as compressible acoustic medium which differs from the conventional hydroelasticity studies wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 chen et al 2006 gao et al 2011 during the past few decades researchers have developed various methods to deal with the problem of floating structures acoustic radiation and scattering in the ideal acoustic medium for instance some analytical methods are established to evaluate the acoustic radiation of structures with regular shapes such as the elastic spherical shell the cylindrical shell and the equidistantly stiffened single or double cylindrical shell burroughs 1984 junger and feit 1986 skelton and james 1997 the approaches appropriate for the structures with complex shapes include the finite element finite element method fem fem hunt et al 1974 1975 the finite element finite element infinite element method fem fem iem astley and macaulay 1994 burnett and holford 1998 and the finite element boundary element method fem bem chen and schweikert 1963 everstine and henderson 1990 giordano and koopmann 1995 tong et al 2007 peters et al 2014 according to the finite element finite element method fem fem both of the floating structure and the water medium are modelled with discrete finite elements artificial absorbing boundary conditions are set at the edge of the water area when it comes to acoustic radiation problems in broad water areas the finite element method cost a large amount of computation thus only the sound field near the structure can be calculated and given when using the finite element finite element infinite element method fem fem iem the floating structure and the near field acoustic medium are modelled with finite elements while the far field acoustic medium is modelled with infinite elements at present the research on this method is still inadequate the strategy of the fem bem method is modelling the floating structures with finite elements and the fluid field with boundary elements on the wetted surface based on the boundary integral equation in this method the green s functions used to describe the acoustic propagation in the fluid field are often expressed in analytical forms as a consequence this method has the advantage of high precision and effectiveness when it s used to deal with the acoustic problems in the infinite or half infinite fluid field the fem bem method which avoids the deficiencies of the fem fem method is the most commonly used method to solve the complex structures sono elasticity problem in the low frequency band everstine and henderson 1990 regard the fem bem method as the most practical way to calculate the large scale structures acoustic radiation with high precision historically there are mainly two kinds of boundary element methods bem in the study of acoustics the helmholtz integral method and the simple source method when using these two kinds of methods in practice there is an irregular frequency problem i e the results near the irregular frequencies are often significantly distorted strictly speaking the irregular frequencies are of purely numerical problem with no physical explanation it has been proved in a mathematical manner that there is no solution at the irregular frequencies in the simple source method while the solution is not unique at the irregular frequencies in the helmholtz integral method schenck 1968 since the 1970s the helmholtz integral method has been widely used in acoustics for the reason that various methods are created to solve the problem of irregular frequencies in this method schenck 1968 burton and miller 1971 wu and seybert 1991 on the contrary improvement is still needed to deal with the irregular frequency problem in the simple source method in this paper the three dimensional hydroelasticity of floating structures wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 is incorporated with the hydro acoustic propagation theory to gain a three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain by introducing a frequency domain green s function appropriate to the hydro acoustic waveguide environment this method makes it possible to implement a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and sound propagation the details are given about how the simple source boundary integral equation is theoretically derived from helmholtz boundary integral equation it s pointed out that the irregular frequencies in the simple source method are induced by the resonances of imaginary inner fluid field taking this principle into consideration a closed virtual impedance surface is introduced in the imaginary inner fluid domain to absorb the energy of acoustic vibration thus eliminating the resonances and irregular frequencies this method is named as the closed virtual impedance surface cvis method according to the simple source method the acoustic field is obtained by the superposition of a series of monopole point sources with different amplitudes and phases distributed on the wetted surface of the floating structures since the monopole source s acoustic propagation in the ocean waveguide environment has been widely studied jensen et al 2011 lots of existing results can be directly introduced into the calculation of green s functions used in this work according to classic method of three dimensional hydroelasticity wu 1984 bishop et al 1986 the dry modals the structure vibration modals in vacuum are selected as the generalized basis functions because they are orthogonal complete and easy to solve the effect of fluid structure interaction is reflected in the corresponding added mass radiation damping and generalized restoring coefficients this approach has the advantage of high calculation efficiency and clear physical meaning besides it can separate the principal modes that make a significant contribution to the vibration and acoustic radiation the advantages of this method are inherited in this work with reference to the general definition of hydroelasticity heller and abramson 1959 the sono elasticity mentioned in this work is defined as a discipline that deals with the interactions between the inertia force the acoustic pressure in the water and the elastic force in the structures 2 the sono elasticity theory of ships in frequency domain for the zero forward speed case the fluid motion and responses of a floating body are defined in an equilibrium coordinate system oxyz with the x axis pointing towards the bow the z axis pointing upwards as shown in fig 1 the ship structure is assumed to be linear with small motions and distortions about its equilibrium position the displacement at any point of the

floating body considering the finite water depth case and assuming that the acoustic reflection coefficients at the seabed and sea surface are γ and γ 1 respectively we can get the green s function shown in eq 12 which corresponds to a virtual source chain formed due to a succession of reflections as shown in fig 3 brekhovskikh 1980 12 g r r 0 l 0 γ γ 1 l e i k r l 1 r l 1 γ e i k r l 2 r l 2 γ

source approach to solve the intensity of the sources distributed on the wetted surface of the structure the occurrence of irregular frequencies in the analysis of a wave body or fluid structure interaction problem greatly reduces the precision of predictions this is a kind of mathematical phenomena representing one of the numerical solution regions of the corresponding boundary integral equations which are not the physical answers in the actual fluid domain to eliminate the irregular frequencies in the prediction of acoustic responses of a structure in acoustic medium τ it is proposed in this paper to place a closed virtual impedance surface s i 2 in the imaginary inner fluid domain τ i inside the wetted surface s see fig 4 assuming that φ i and φ are respectively the velocity potentials defined in the inner and the outer fluid domain the interface boundary conditions on s i 2 and s may be written as 21 φ i r n i r i ω u n i 2 r r s i 2 p n i 2 r i ω z s u n i 2 r

surface inside the wetted surface of the body not only moves the oscillation frequencies of the inner fluid domain to the upper band by changing its volume but also absorbs the oscillation energy of the inner flow this enables the elimination or removal of the irregular frequencies 4 numerical examples and verification of the present method a fem bem method is used to implement the numerical calculation of the examples in this section two discrete models are used in this method one is the finite element model which is used to obtain the dry modes of the structure in vacuo the other is the boundary element model of the wetted surface also called the wet panel model which is used to calculate the fluid structure coupled vibration and acoustic radiation in this paper the dry modes of the structure is calculated using the finite element software abaqus meanwhile boundary element codes are developed by the authors and combined with the dry modes to obtain the fluid structure coupled vibration and acoustic radiation constant boundary elements wu 1984 marburg and nolte 2008 i e the wetted surface of the model is discretized into a series of quadrilateral wetted surface elements and the effect of each element is transferred to its center point equivalently after a numerical discretization the velocity potential in eq 11 becomes 24 ϕ r r 1 4 π j 1 n σ r j r 0 g r r 0 δ s j where n is the number of the discretized elements on the wetted surface of the floating body δ s j is the area of the jth element σ r j r 0 is the source intensity of the jth element 4 1 the verification of acoustic radiation of a single spherical shell in infinite fluid domain in this section the acoustic radiation of an elastic spherical shell which is symmetrical under the excitation of a concentrated harmonic force is computed and verified where the fluid domain is infinite and the effect of hydrostatic pressure is ignored the radius and thickness of the spherical shell are 0 5 m and 1 mm respectively the density young s modulus poisson s ratio and damping ratio of the shell s material are 7800 kg m3 2 1 1011n m2 0 3 and 0 01 respectively the density of the fluid is 1025 kg m3 and the sound velocity in the fluid medium is 1500 m s there is an analytical solution for the acoustic radiation of a spherical shell in the infinite fluid domain the sound pressure radiated by the spherical shell excited by a unit harmonic concentrated force f as shown in fig 5 is expressed as junger and feit 1986 25 p r s θ s ω ρ 0 ω 2 n 0 u n r h n 2 k r s k d h n 2 χ d χ χ k r p n cos θ s where u n r is the amplitude of the n th modal displacement in radial direction h n 2 is the n th sphere hankel function of the second kind p n is the n th legendre polynomial and r is the radius of the spherical shell in the process of numerical calculation the value of n can not be infinite that is it must be truncated the truncated value of n must be sufficiently large to gain convergence specifically it is related to the dimension of the spherical shell and the frequency range for the example presented in this paper n max 7 is enough to obtain a convergent solution by introducing a green s function appropriate for the infinite ideal acoustic medium the acoustic radiation pressure is calculated with the program developed on the basis of the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain the wetted surface panel model is shown in fig 6 where the grid length is about 0 05 m to verify the accuracy of this method as well as the program the numerical results are compared with the analytical solutions as shown in fig 7 it s seen that the numerical results almost entirely coincide with the analytical solutions the slight difference is caused by the numerical discretization which exactly proved the effectiveness of the sono elastic analysis method the sound pressure at a field point can be transformed into the sound pressure level spl by using the formula below 26 l p ω 20 log 10 p r s θ s ω 1 10 6 20 log 10 r s 4 2 the acoustic radiation of the spherical shell in finite depth water now consider that the spherical shell of section 4 1 is submerged in finite depth water as shown in fig 8 by introducing a green s function in finite depth water as shown in eq 12 the influence of finite water depth on the acoustic radiation of elastic structures is investigated in this section the underwater acoustic radiation power of the spherical shell is calculated with various water depths submerging depths the distance from the center of the sphere to the sea surface and acoustic reflection coefficients of the seabed the sound power can be expressed in the form of sound source level ssl by eq 27 as shown in fig 9 it s seen from fig 9 a that the acoustic radiation power of the spherical shell is influenced by the sea surface and the seabed this influence is more significant when considering shallow sea acoustic environment in fig 9 a it s found that as the water depth and submerged depth increase the curves from water depth 4 m submerged depth 2 m to water depth 10 m submerged depth 5 m and then to water depth 65 m submerged depth 30 m converge gradually in the ssl curve water depth 65 m submerged depth 30 m the fluctuations caused by the acoustic reflection at the sea surface and the seabed are slight 27 l s ω 10 log 10 p ω 4 π 0 65 10 18 by further analyzing the acoustic radiation of various structures it s found that when h 1 d s 10 50 and h 2 d s 10 50 where h 1 is the distance from the center of the structure to the sea surface h 2 is the distance from the center of the structure to the seabed d s is the draught or molded depth of the structure the effect of the sea surface and the seabed on the structure s acoustic radiation power can be ignored 4 3 example of eliminating irregular frequencies to examine the availability of the cvis method that is put forward to eliminate irregular frequencies in section 3 a spherical shell in infinite fluid domain is selected as a numerical example the acoustic impedance of sway vibration mode of the spherical shell is calculated the radius of the spherical shell is 0 5 m the density of the fluid is 1025 kg m3 and the sound velocity in the fluid is 1500 m s the grid length of the wetted surface panel is approximately 0 05 m for the sway mode the vibration displacements of the points on the spherical shell are all the same in this work the displacement magnitude is set to 1 m the non dimensional acoustic impedance is defined as 28 z s p f r i ω ρ 0 c 0 a s p 1 m 2 where f r s p n u r d s is the generalized fluid force a s p is the wetted surface area of the spherical shell 1 m 2 is for dimensional coordination the imaginary part of z s p is non dimensional acoustic reactance which corresponds to the added mass the real part of z s p is non dimensional acoustic resistance which corresponds to the radiation damping the closed virtual impedance surface consists of the six surfaces of a cubic box the side length of which is 0 4 m fig 10 presents the influence of different impedance values of the virtual surface on eliminating irregular frequencies it is seen that the numerical results are close to the analytical solutions and the irregular frequencies are effectively eliminated when z s 0 1 ρ 0 c 0 or z s ρ 0 c 0 however when z s 10 ρ 0 c 0 the result curves have peaks and valleys the inflection point of the imaginary part the acoustic reactance corresponds to the peak point of the real part the acoustic resistance which is exactly the characteristic of the irregular frequency according to the absorption principle of plane sound waves the acoustic energy will be completely absorbed when the impedance of the absorption surface is equal to the fluid s characteristic impedance and the acoustic absorption effect will be weak if the difference between the two kinds of impedance becomes big in practice it is suggested that the impedance of the virtual surface should be set as ρ 0 c 0 i e the characteristic impedance of the fluid theoretically as long as the real part of the virtual surface s impedance is not zero the resonance will not happen in the imaginary inner fluid domain and thus the irregular frequencies don t exist in this case but in practice due to the numerical discretization error the peaks and valleys at irregular frequencies are only abated when the absorption effect of the virtual surface is weak thus there is still a phenomenon of irregular frequencies but it s predicted that the dependence on z s will decrease with the grid of wetted surface panel further refined the surface of a cubic box is selected as the closed virtual impedance surface the impedance value of which is set as z s ρ 0 c 0 results under various side lengths of the cubic box are plotted and compared in fig 11 it s seen that as the side length increases the irregular frequencies are eliminated more effectively as the contact area of the virtual surface and the imaginary inner fluid domain increases the area of acoustic energy absorption increases thus the resonance of imaginary inner flow is suppressed better the ratio of the virtual surface area to the spherical wetted surface area is 0 076 when the side length b 0 2 m while this ratio is 0 306 when b 0 4 m by further analysis the author found that the results are not good when the minimum distance from the virtual surface to the wetted surface is less than the grid length of the wetted surface panel this phenomenon is induced by the numerical discretization in practice it s suggested that the area ratio of the virtual surface and the wetted surface should be about 0 1 0 4 5 verification of the numerical method and program by model tests 5 1 comparison of the dry vibration modal two ring stiffened steel cylindrical shell models are made in order to perform the test about the vibration and acoustic radiation caused by mechanical excitation in finite depth water the numerical method is validated by the test results the main parameters of the two models are shown in table 1 before implementing a three dimensional sono elastic analysis the dry structure numerical model should be established to solve dry modes the quality of the dry structure numerical model has a significant influence on the computation precision of acoustic radiation the dry finite element models of the two cylindrical shells are shown in fig 12 the cylindrical shells the stiffeners and the caps at both ends are modelled using four node shell elements the density the young s modulus and the poisson s ratio are respectively 7800 kg m3 2 1 1011n m2 and 0 3 the modal tests are implemented with the models hanged in the air using resilient ropes considering the symmetry of the models 8 accelerometers are evenly distributed on the half cycle at the mid cross section of the cylindrical shell to measure the vibration responses in the normal direction the model is excited by an electromagnetic vibration exciter and the natural frequencies as well as the dry vibration modes of the cross section are tested as shown in fig 13 the test results and calculation results are shown and compared in fig 14 fig 15 and table 2 it s seen that the natural frequencies calculated by the program are in good agreement with the results obtained from the tests where the error is within 5 the numerically calculated mode shapes of different circumferential wave numbers are similar to the test results which further proved the accuracy of the dry structure numerical models 5 2 comparison of underwater acoustic radiation in the test of underwater acoustic radiation the electromagnetic vibration exciter shown in fig 13 is still used as the excitation source the maximum exciting force of the exciter is approximately 50n an impedancemeter is installed on the bottom of the excitation rod for measuring excitation force and vibration response at the excitation point because the excitation force is required as the input of the numerical calculation this force must be tested precisely it s ideal that the excitation force from the excitation rod is the only vibration force transmitted to the cylindrical shell without any additional vibration forces however there must be supporting points for the electromagnetic exciter on the structure in order to cope with this problem the exciter is fixed on a mounting bracket which is installed on a foundation with four rubber vibration isolators in this way the vibration forces transmitted from the electromagnetic exciter to the foundation can be well isolated at frequencies above 80 hz the test of the two models underwater acoustic radiation is implemented in an open lake district the water depth of which is approximately 60 m 70 m as shown in fig 16 the model is located 10 m under the water surface and connected to the deck of a ship through a steel pipe the hydrophone is located at the water level of the mid cross section of the test model it is 5 2 m away from the axis of the test model exactly toward the direction of the electromagnetic exciter a wide frequency band exciting force is emitted from the exciter and transferred to the cylindrical shell the signal to noise ratio snr is sufficiently large in the frequency band of concern the hydrophone used in this experiment is bk 8103 this hydrophone can be used for making absolute sound measurements over the frequency range of 0 1 hz to 180 khz with a receiving sensitivity of 211 db re 1v μpa 2 db the sampling frequency of acoustic pressure f s should be set according to shannon s sampling theorem usually f s is approximately three or four times the maximum frequency of the signal the sampled signal is then amplified and transferred to the computer through the data acquisition system dividing the acoustic pressure tested by the hydrophone by the excitation force tested by the impedancemeter yields the transfer function of acoustic pressure this pressure is then transformed into the sound pressure level spl 1 m away from the axis of the test model and compared with the numerical results considering the water depth and the acoustic characteristic of the water bottom the green s function in eq 12 is introduced the water depth is h 65 m the acoustic reflection coefficient of the water bottom and the free surface are γ 0 5 and γ 1 1 respectively using the sono elastic analysis method the sound pressure at the hydrophone point is calculated for the two stiffened cylindrical shell models excited by a unit normal concentrated force the acoustic pressure is then transformed into the 1 3oct acoustic pressure spectrum level the numerical results are compared with the test results as shown in fig 17 it shows that in general the predictions of the numerical sono elastic analysis method agree well with the test results thus the validity and practicality of this method and the program are further proved 6 the thafts acoustic software based on the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain a software module named thafts acoustic is developed by the china ship scientific research center cssrc the logo of the software is shown in fig 18 this software provides user friendly preprocessing and post processing functions also it s suitable for large scale parallel computation this software makes it possible to perform a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and acoustic

theoretical deductions of the three dimensional frequency domain sono elastic analysis method are described in detail by introducing a frequency domain green s function appropriate to the hydro acoustic waveguide environment the three dimensional hydroelasticity theory of floating structures is incorporated with the hydro acoustic propagation theory to gain a three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain this method makes it possible to implement a unified analysis of fluid structure interaction acoustic radiation and sound propagation the cvis method is put forward for the simple source boundary integral approach in this work by introducing a closed virtual impedance surface in the imaginary inner fluid field the acoustic energy is absorbed and the resonance of the inner virtual fluid field is suppressed and thus the irregular frequencies are eliminated the accuracy of this method is validated by calculating a spherical structure s modal acoustic impedances through a series of numerical examples the principles about the setting of the key parameters when using this method are summarized the impedance of the virtual surface should be equal to the characteristic impedance of the fluid the area of the virtual surface should be 0 1 0 4 times of the wetted surface area the acoustic radiation of an elastic spherical shell in infinite fluid is predicted and compared with analytical solution for validation of the sono elastic analysis method and then the accuracy and practicality of this method are further proved by the tests of underwater acoustic radiation of two ring stiffened cylindrical shells in finite depth water based on the three dimensional sono elastic analysis method in the frequency domain a software module named

corresponding author slow strain rate tensile ssrt test in a simulated device was employed to investigate the effect of so2 on stress corrosion cracking scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 polluted marine atmosphere results revealed that so2 can greatly enhance the scc susceptibility of e690 steel in marine atmosphere and the scc mechanism in this environment is a combination of anodic dissolution ad and hydrogen embrittlement he the increase of scc susceptibility was attributed to the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface that scc microcracks can initiate from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer consequently moreover hydrogen evolution was greatly enhanced with the increase of so2 content and scc susceptibility increased rapidly as a result keywords sulfur dioxide so2 e690 high strength steel stress corrosion cracking scc marine atmosphere hydrogen embrittlement he 1 introduction due to its long term service in the harsh marine environment such as seawater splashing alternating dry wet corrosion polluted marine atmosphere et al and high stress level from internal and external load high strength steel is vulnerable to scc under the synergistic action of stress and corrosion han et al 2014 as for steel structures exposed in marine atmosphere a thin electrolyte layer would be formed on the steel surface due to high humidity and temperature fluctuation in that case the cathodic reaction can be greatly promoted due to the easier diffusion of oxygen through the thin electrolyte layer meanwhile anodic dissolution and hydrolysis reaction of iron ions would be significantly enhanced leading to the acidification of electrolyte layer and crack tip nishikata et al 1997 kong et al 2013 besides corrosive ions in crack tip would be concentrated with the thinning of electrolyte layer and ion migration due to occluded cell effect guocheng et al 2008 therefore anodic dissolution and hydrogen evolution reaction of crack tip would be greatly enhanced and the hydrogen evolved can be enriched in the high strained region near the crack tip through stress induced diffusion qiao et al 1998 dmytrakh et al 2013 adrover et al 2003 promoting the scc process through anodic dissolution ad and hydrogen embrittlement he effect gu et al 1999 li and cheng 2007 worse still marine atmosphere in many cities along the coastal lines such as qingdao in china has been polluted with so2 with the development of industry and has been changed to coastal industrial atmosphere with the co existence of so2 and cl in such environment due to acidification effect of so2 on thin electrolyte layer and reproduction of h through feso4 chen et al 2014a 2014b wang et al 2008 the corrosion rate is greatly accelerated with a more significant hydrogen evolution which may furtherly promote the scc process of high strength steel wang et al 1997 nishimura et al 2004 e690 steel as a type of newly developed high strength bainitic steel is very promising to be widely used in offshore platform in the near future for its excellent performance xiaoqiang et al 2013 however the resistance to corrosion and scc of this steel in marine environment still needs to be investigated at present preliminary researches have been conducted on its corrosion and scc behavior in marine environment zhang et al 2012 ma et al 2015 but few works have investigated its scc behavior in marine atmosphere especially in so2 polluted atmosphere therefore it s of great significance to investigate the scc behavior and mechanism of e690 steel in this environment in this work slow strain rate tensile ssrt test was employed in a self designed simulated device to investigate the scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 polluted marine atmosphere focusing on the effect of so2 on its

approximately 30 mm ssrt tests were performed on wdml 30kn materials test system with a strain rate of 0 5 10 6 per second fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of experiment device an atomizer was used to generate moisture to form a thin electrolyte layer on specimen surface to simulate marine atmosphere containing so2 the solution in the atomizer was in accordance with that used for electrochemical measurement section 2 2 tests were conducted at ambient temperature approximately 25 c prior to each test the specimen was maintained in an atmosphere with 100 rh for 24 h to ensure electrolyte layer formation on the surface moisture was pumped continuously during the whole experiment after failure the percentage of elongation and reduction in cross sectional area of each specimen were measured after removing corrosion products and fracture morphologies were observed using sem the loss percentage of elongation iδ and reduction in cross sectional area iψ were calculated to evaluate the scc susceptibility for each condition i δ 1 δ s δ 0 100 i ψ 1 ψ s ψ 0 100 where δs δ0 and ψs ψ0 are elongation and area reduction measured in moisture and in air respectively iδ and iψ represent the decrease of elongation and area reduction of fracture in solution compared to that in air respectively and are generally used as an evaluation of scc susceptibility each condition was reproduced at least three times to ensure reliability of experimental data 3 experimental results 3 1 potentiodynamic polarization measurement the potentiodynamic polarization curves of e690 steel in simulated solution with different nahso3 concentration are shown as fig 4 the curves revealed that the polarization curves of e690 steel appeared a significant rightward shift with the increase of nahso3 concentration indicating the electrochemical process was greatly facilitated by nahso3 especially cathodic one the cathodic reaction without nahso3 was controlled by oxygen diffusion while it was dominated by the combination of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction with presence of nahso3 the addition of nahso3 can not only reduce oxygen but also give rise to the concentration of proton from the weak acid and resulted in the enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction as well therefore the cathodic reaction was promoted with the increase of nahso3 concentration corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr for different nahso3 concentration were obtained using tafel fitting method with the fitted results shown as fig 5 each condition was measured at least three times it revealed that the corrosion potential of e690 steel in presence of nahso3 appeared a negative shift abruptly compared to that without nahso3 probably due to the introduction of proton reduction then the e corr increased gradually with the addition of nahso3 it may be caused by enhancement of hydrogen evolution and consequently upward moving of cathodic curves according to the mixed potential principle of cao 2008 meanwhile the i corr increased nearly linearly with the increase of nahso3 concentration the limited diffusion current density of oxygen reduction without nahso3 was approximately 0 0158 ma cm2 while the i corr with nahso3 concentration of 0 005 0 01 0 03 mol l was 0 0382 0 0676 0 182 ma cm2 respectively therefore the cathodic reaction in presence of nahso3 was mainly attributed to the hydrogen evolution reaction with the equivalent hydrogen charging current density of 0 0224 0 0518 and 0 166 ma cm2 respectively it has been demonstrated in our previous work ma et al 2015 that the e690 steel was highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement he and it had a high he susceptibility at 950mvsce equivalent to a hydrogen charging current density of 0 041 ma cm2 therefore hydrogen is definitely involved in the process of scc and the e690 steel would probably have a high scc susceptibility due to he effect 3 2 morphology of rust layer morphologies of rust layer in atmosphere with and without nahso3 are shown as fig 6 it can be seen that there were fewer corrosion products in atmosphere without nahso3 and the rust layer was much looser compared to that in atmosphere containing nahso3 fig 6 a b in contrast the rust layer in environment containing nahso3 was much more compact sem morphology of the rust layer with nahso3 showed that there were many microcracks in the rust layer perpendicular to the tensile stress the cross sectional morphology revealed that a successive and compact rust layer of approximately 10 μm was formed on the specimen surface with a lot of perfoliate cracks in the rust layer in the bottom of which the scc cracks were initiated and propagated fig 6 d 3 3 scc susceptibility the stress strain curves of e690 steel measured in air and in atmosphere with different nahso3 concentration are shown in fig 7 the curves revealed that e690 steel had a certain degree of scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere without nahso3 for the elongation appeared a considerable reduction compared to that in air the elongation in atmosphere with 0 005 mol l nahso3 appeared an obvious decrease compared to that without nahso3 and the elongation underwent a further decline with the increase of nahso3 concentration the scc susceptibility in atmosphere with different nahso3 concentration was evaluated by the loss percentage of elongation iδ and reduction in cross sectional area iψ shown as fig 8 it revealed that the e690 steel had a high scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere containing nahso3 and the scc susceptibility increased rapidly with the increase of nahso3 concentration which was in good agreement with the speculation according to the electrochemical measurement it also can be seen from the stress strain curves that the yield strength in marine atmosphere was a little higher than that in air this phenomenon once appeared in some previous study liu et al 2012 the reason may be that the cathodic reactions in this environment involve hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen permeation which has been demonstrated by many previous researches nishimura et al 2004 akiyama et al 2010 2011 the hydrogen produced during the corrosion process can penetrate into steel to form the so called cottrell atmosphere which can hinder the slip of dislocation leading to an increase of yield strength in some extent cottrell and bilby 1949 song and curtin 2014 as hydrogen concentration in defects such as dislocations grain boundaries inclusions etc exceeds a threshold value during the loading it would produce hydrogen embrittlement effect increasing the scc susceptibility arafin and szpunar 2011 murakami et al 2013 delafosse and magnin 2001 this may be one of the reasons that the scc susceptibility increased gradually with the increase of nahso3 concentration 3 4 fracture morphology observation fig 9 and fig 10 are sem morphologies of the fracture surface and side face in air and in atmosphere as shown in fig 9 a the microscopic morphology in air appeared an obvious necking and the micro morphology exhibited a ductile failure of dimple whereas the morphology in atmosphere without nahso3 presented a distinct feature of brittle rupture with the necking not so obvious and the fracture surface much smooth fig 9 b morphologies of the fracture side fig 10 showed that there were nearly no secondary cracks on the specimen surface in air condition whereas a few shallow microcracks were detected through some corrosion pits these morphologies revealed that e690 steel had a certain degree of scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere in comparison the morphologies in atmosphere containing nahso3 presented a more distinct feature of brittle rupture with a further decrease of necking percentage and much more large secondary cracks on the side of the fracture indicating a much higher susceptibility to scc in this environment which was consistent with the scc susceptibility curve fig 8 therefore it s reasonable to deduce that so2 in marine atmosphere can significantly facilitate the initiation and propagation of scc cracks and thus increase the scc susceptibility 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rust layer on initiation of scc cracks as shown in fig 6 a compact rust layer can be formed on steel surface in atmosphere containing so2 which has been demonstrated by many previous study chen et al 2014b wang et al 1997 lin et al 2010 so microcracks can be easily induced in the rust layer under dynamic tension since the compact rust layer is very brittle and has a low ductility then corrosive ions like h cl et al would be preferential to penetrate into the substrate through these cracks and be concentrated in the bottom of the cracks leading to localized anodic dissolution and formation of corrosion pits fig 6 d meanwhile due to hydrolysis reaction of iron ions and h penetration into the cracks hydrogen evolution reaction would be enhanced under the rust layer especially in the bottom of the cracks the hydrogen uptake into the steel can not only enhance the anodic dissolution of crack tip but also generate he effect gu et al 1999 li and cheng 2007 moreover it would also generate stress concentration at the bottom of the corrosion pits as a result scc occurred or propagated under the synergistic interaction of stress concentration anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement this is also why most scc cracks initiated from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer fig 6 d therefore so2 in marine atmosphere can facilitate the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface and significantly promote the initiation of scc cracks from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer resulting in the increase of scc susceptibility with the increase of nahso3 concentration the scc susceptibility increased rapidly partly because of earlier nucleation of scc cracks due to earlier formation of compact rust layer lin et al 2010 in addition to the enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction and he effect 4 2 scc mechanism many previous researches have demonstrated that so2 can result in electrolyte acidification and corrosion acceleration through acid regeneration mechanism of feso4 chen et al 2014b singh et al 2008 allam et al 1991 possible reactions involving anodic and cathodic reaction in this environment are as follows anodic reaction fe fe 2 2 e generation of ferrous sulfate feso4 hso 3 h so 3 2 2 so 3 2 o 2 2 so 4 2 so 4 2 fe 2 feso 4 acid regeneration mechanism of feso4 4 feso 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 feooh 4 h 2 so 4 2 h 2 so 4 o 2 2 fe 2 feso 4 2 h 2 o cathodic reaction o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 e h 2 from the reactions above it can be seen the bulk solution is acidic due to ionization of nahso3 which can also be verified by the measured ph values in section 2 2 moreover the acidity of electrolyte on specimen surface and beneath the rust layer can be further increased through sulphite oxidation and feso4 cyclic process this can probably result in a lower ph in the crack and enhance hydrogen uptake rate in crack tip thus hydrogen evolution reaction was definitely involved during the corrosion process which can be well verified by the polarization curves fig 4 showing the cathodic reaction was mainly attributed to hydrogen evolution reaction many previous work have also indicated that hydrogen can be produced and penetrated into steel in marine atmosphere especially in so2 polluted environment nishimura et al 2004 akiyama et al 2010 2011 tsuru et al 2005 moreover the current density of hydrogen evolution reaction was high enough to cause he of e690 steel according to analysis in section 3 1 therefore the effect of hydrogen and he was definitely involved in the scc process in this environment in addition anodic dissolution ad mechanism was apparent from fig 6 d that scc cracks were initiated from localized corrosion in the bottom of the rust layer in conclusion the scc mechanism of e690 steel in marine electrolyte layer containing so2 was a combination of ad and he 5 conclusions 1 e690 steel has a high scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere containing so2 with a combined mechanism of ad and he so2 in atmosphere can greatly enhance the cathodic reaction of e690 steel and consequently promote its corrosion and scc process 2 so2 in marine atmosphere can facilitate the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface and significantly promote the initiation of corrosion pits and scc cracks from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer resulting in the increase of scc

corresponding author slow strain rate tensile ssrt test in a simulated device was employed to investigate the effect of so2 on stress corrosion cracking scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 polluted marine atmosphere results revealed that so2 can greatly enhance the scc susceptibility of e690 steel in marine atmosphere and the scc mechanism in this environment is a combination of anodic dissolution ad and hydrogen embrittlement he the increase of scc susceptibility was attributed to the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface that scc microcracks can initiate from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer consequently moreover hydrogen evolution was greatly enhanced with the increase of so2 content and scc susceptibility increased rapidly as a result keywords sulfur dioxide so2 e690 high strength steel stress corrosion cracking scc marine atmosphere hydrogen embrittlement he 1 introduction due to its long term service in the harsh marine environment such as seawater splashing alternating dry wet corrosion polluted marine atmosphere et al and high stress level from internal and external load high strength steel is vulnerable to scc under the synergistic action of stress and corrosion han et al 2014 as for steel structures exposed in marine atmosphere a thin electrolyte layer would be formed on the steel surface due to high humidity and temperature fluctuation in that case the cathodic reaction can be greatly promoted due to the easier diffusion of oxygen through the thin electrolyte layer meanwhile anodic dissolution and hydrolysis reaction of iron ions would be significantly enhanced leading to the acidification of electrolyte layer and crack tip nishikata et al 1997 kong et al 2013 besides corrosive ions in crack tip would be concentrated with the thinning of electrolyte layer and ion migration due to occluded cell effect guocheng et al 2008 therefore anodic dissolution and hydrogen evolution reaction of crack tip would be greatly enhanced and the hydrogen evolved can be enriched in the high strained region near the crack tip through stress induced diffusion qiao et al 1998 dmytrakh et al 2013 adrover et al 2003 promoting the scc process through anodic dissolution ad and hydrogen embrittlement he effect gu et al 1999 li and cheng 2007 worse still marine atmosphere in many cities along the coastal lines such as qingdao in china has been polluted with so2 with the development of industry and has been changed to coastal industrial atmosphere with the co existence of so2 and cl in such environment due to acidification effect of so2 on thin electrolyte layer and reproduction of h through feso4 chen et al 2014a 2014b wang et al 2008 the corrosion rate is greatly accelerated with a more significant hydrogen evolution which may furtherly promote the scc process of high strength steel wang et al 1997 nishimura et al 2004 e690 steel as a type of newly developed high strength bainitic steel is very promising to be widely used in offshore platform in the near future for its excellent performance xiaoqiang et al 2013 however the resistance to corrosion and scc of this steel in marine environment still needs to be investigated at present preliminary researches have been conducted on its corrosion and scc behavior in marine environment zhang et al 2012 ma et al 2015 but few works have investigated its scc behavior in marine atmosphere especially in so2 polluted atmosphere therefore it s of great significance to investigate the scc behavior and mechanism of e690 steel in this environment in this work slow strain rate tensile ssrt test was employed in a self designed simulated device to investigate the scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 polluted marine atmosphere focusing on the effect of so2 on its scc behavior and susceptibility 2 experimental 2 1 material the material used in this study is high strength steel e690 with the following chemical composition wt 0 15 c 0 20 si 1 00 mn 0 0058 p 0 0014 s 0 99 cr 1 45 ni 0 0091 cu 0 37 mo 0 030 v 0 036 als and fe balance the microstructure of the steel is mainly lath bainite fig 1 with a yield strength of approximately 690 mpa 2 2 electrochemical measurements electrode used for electrochemical measurement was prepared by sealing the specimen with epoxy resin with an exposed area of 1 cm2 and was polished by successive silicon carbide paper up to 1000 the working electrode was then rinsed with deionized water degreased in acetone and dehydrated ethanol by ultrasonic sound and dried in air an electrochemical working station reference 3000 gamry was employed to carry out electrochemical measurements by using a traditional three electrode cell with the steel as a working electrode a large area of pt plate as a counter electrode and kcl saturated calomel electrode sce as a reference electrode the test solution is 3 5 nacl with 0 0 005 0 01 0 03 mol l nahso3 respectively and the ph values in different solutions were measured to be 8 0 4 1 3 8 3 7 respectively potentiodynamic polarization curves were measured with potential sweep rate of 0 5 mv s in a potential range from 1200 mv to 560 mv vs sce 2 3 slow strain rate tensile tests ssrt method was employed to investigate the effect of so2 on scc behavior of e690 steel in simulated so2 polluted marine atmosphere the tests were conducted according to astm g129 astm g129 1995 1995 and the tensile specimens were machined into smooth flat plate specimens shown as fig 2 prior to each scc test the specimens were polished in longitudinal direction by successive emery paper up to 1500 then rinsed with deionized water degreased in dehydrated ethanol and acetone by ultrasonic sound dried in air and then sealed with silicone rubber retaining an exposed length of approximately 30 mm ssrt tests were performed on wdml 30kn materials test system with a strain rate of 0 5 10 6 per second fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of experiment device an atomizer was used to generate moisture to form a thin electrolyte layer on specimen surface to simulate marine atmosphere containing so2 the solution in the atomizer was in accordance with that used for electrochemical measurement section 2 2 tests were conducted at ambient temperature approximately 25 c prior to each test the specimen was maintained in an atmosphere with 100 rh for 24 h to ensure electrolyte layer formation on the surface moisture was pumped continuously during the whole experiment after failure the percentage of elongation and reduction in cross sectional area of each specimen were measured after removing corrosion products and fracture morphologies were observed using sem the loss percentage of elongation iδ and reduction in cross sectional area iψ were calculated to evaluate the scc susceptibility for each condition i δ 1 δ s δ 0 100 i ψ 1 ψ s ψ 0 100 where δs δ0 and ψs ψ0 are elongation and area reduction measured in moisture and in air respectively iδ and iψ represent the decrease of elongation and area reduction of fracture in solution compared to that in air respectively and are generally used as an evaluation of scc susceptibility each condition was reproduced at least three times to ensure reliability of experimental data 3 experimental results 3 1 potentiodynamic polarization measurement the potentiodynamic polarization curves of e690 steel in simulated solution with different nahso3 concentration are shown as fig 4 the curves revealed that the polarization curves of e690 steel appeared a significant rightward shift with the increase of nahso3 concentration indicating the electrochemical process was greatly facilitated by nahso3 especially cathodic one the cathodic reaction without nahso3 was controlled by oxygen diffusion while it was dominated by the combination of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction with presence of nahso3 the addition of nahso3 can not only reduce oxygen but also give rise to the concentration of proton from the weak acid and resulted in the enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction as well therefore the cathodic reaction was promoted with the increase of nahso3 concentration corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr for different nahso3 concentration were obtained using tafel fitting method with the fitted results shown as fig 5 each condition was measured at least three times it revealed that the corrosion potential of e690 steel in presence of nahso3 appeared a negative shift abruptly compared to that without nahso3 probably due to the introduction of proton reduction then the e corr increased gradually with the addition of nahso3 it may be caused by enhancement of hydrogen evolution and consequently upward moving of cathodic curves according to the mixed potential principle of cao 2008 meanwhile the i corr increased nearly linearly with the increase of nahso3 concentration the limited diffusion current density of oxygen reduction without nahso3 was approximately 0 0158 ma cm2 while the i corr with nahso3 concentration of 0 005 0 01 0 03 mol l was 0 0382 0 0676 0 182 ma cm2 respectively therefore the cathodic reaction in presence of nahso3 was mainly attributed to the hydrogen evolution reaction with the equivalent hydrogen charging current density of 0 0224 0 0518 and 0 166 ma cm2 respectively it has been demonstrated in our previous work ma et al 2015 that the e690 steel was highly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement he and it had a high he susceptibility at 950mvsce equivalent to a hydrogen charging current density of 0 041 ma cm2 therefore hydrogen is definitely involved in the process of scc and the e690 steel would probably have a high scc susceptibility due to he effect 3 2 morphology of rust layer morphologies of rust layer in atmosphere with and without nahso3 are shown as fig 6 it can be seen that there were fewer corrosion products in atmosphere without nahso3 and the rust layer was much looser compared to that in atmosphere containing nahso3 fig 6 a b in contrast the rust layer in environment containing nahso3 was much more compact sem morphology of the rust layer with nahso3 showed that there were many microcracks in the rust layer perpendicular to the tensile stress the cross sectional morphology revealed that a successive and compact rust layer of approximately 10 μm was formed on the specimen surface with a lot of perfoliate cracks in the rust layer in the bottom of which the scc cracks were initiated and propagated fig 6 d 3 3 scc susceptibility the stress strain curves of e690 steel measured in air and in atmosphere with different nahso3 concentration are shown in fig 7 the curves revealed that e690 steel had a certain degree of scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere without nahso3 for the elongation appeared a considerable reduction compared to that in air the elongation in atmosphere with 0 005 mol l nahso3 appeared an obvious decrease compared to that without nahso3 and the elongation underwent a further decline with the increase of nahso3 concentration the scc susceptibility in atmosphere with different nahso3 concentration was evaluated by the loss percentage of elongation iδ and reduction in cross sectional area iψ shown as fig 8 it revealed that the e690 steel had a high scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere containing nahso3 and the scc susceptibility increased rapidly with the increase of nahso3 concentration which was in good agreement with the speculation according to the electrochemical measurement it also can be seen from the stress strain curves that the yield strength in marine atmosphere was a little higher than that in air this phenomenon once appeared in some previous study liu et al 2012 the reason may be that the cathodic reactions in this environment involve hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrogen permeation which has been demonstrated by many previous researches nishimura et al 2004 akiyama et al 2010 2011 the hydrogen produced during the corrosion process can penetrate into steel to form the so called cottrell atmosphere which can hinder the slip of dislocation leading to an increase of yield strength in some extent cottrell and bilby 1949 song and curtin 2014 as hydrogen concentration in defects such as dislocations grain boundaries inclusions etc exceeds a threshold value during the loading it would produce hydrogen embrittlement effect increasing the scc susceptibility arafin and szpunar 2011 murakami et al 2013 delafosse and magnin 2001 this may be one of the reasons that the scc susceptibility increased gradually with the increase of nahso3 concentration 3 4 fracture morphology observation fig 9 and fig 10 are sem morphologies of the fracture surface and side face in air and in atmosphere as shown in fig 9 a the microscopic morphology in air appeared an obvious necking and the micro morphology exhibited a ductile failure of dimple whereas the morphology in atmosphere without nahso3 presented a distinct feature of brittle rupture with the necking not so obvious and the fracture surface much smooth fig 9 b morphologies of the fracture side fig 10 showed that there were nearly no secondary cracks on the specimen surface in air condition whereas a few shallow microcracks were detected through some corrosion pits these morphologies revealed that e690 steel had a certain degree of scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere in comparison the morphologies in atmosphere containing nahso3 presented a more distinct feature of brittle rupture with a further decrease of necking percentage and much more large secondary cracks on the side of the fracture indicating a much higher susceptibility to scc in this environment which was consistent with the scc susceptibility curve fig 8 therefore it s reasonable to deduce that so2 in marine atmosphere can significantly facilitate the initiation and propagation of scc cracks and thus increase the scc susceptibility 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rust layer on initiation of scc cracks as shown in fig 6 a compact rust layer can be formed on steel surface in atmosphere containing so2 which has been demonstrated by many previous study chen et al 2014b wang et al 1997 lin et al 2010 so microcracks can be easily induced in the rust layer under dynamic tension since the compact rust layer is very brittle and has a low ductility then corrosive ions like h cl et al would be preferential to penetrate into the substrate through these cracks and be concentrated in the bottom of the cracks leading to localized anodic dissolution and formation of corrosion pits fig 6 d meanwhile due to hydrolysis reaction of iron ions and h penetration into the cracks hydrogen evolution reaction would be enhanced under the rust layer especially in the bottom of the cracks the hydrogen uptake into the steel can not only enhance the anodic dissolution of crack tip but also generate he effect gu et al 1999 li and cheng 2007 moreover it would also generate stress concentration at the bottom of the corrosion pits as a result scc occurred or propagated under the synergistic interaction of stress concentration anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement this is also why most scc cracks initiated from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer fig 6 d therefore so2 in marine atmosphere can facilitate the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface and significantly promote the initiation of scc cracks from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer resulting in the increase of scc susceptibility with the increase of nahso3 concentration the scc susceptibility increased rapidly partly because of earlier nucleation of scc cracks due to earlier formation of compact rust layer lin et al 2010 in addition to the enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction and he effect 4 2 scc mechanism many previous researches have demonstrated that so2 can result in electrolyte acidification and corrosion acceleration through acid regeneration mechanism of feso4 chen et al 2014b singh et al 2008 allam et al 1991 possible reactions involving anodic and cathodic reaction in this environment are as follows anodic reaction fe fe 2 2 e generation of ferrous sulfate feso4 hso 3 h so 3 2 2 so 3 2 o 2 2 so 4 2 so 4 2 fe 2 feso 4 acid regeneration mechanism of feso4 4 feso 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 feooh 4 h 2 so 4 2 h 2 so 4 o 2 2 fe 2 feso 4 2 h 2 o cathodic reaction o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 e h 2 from the reactions above it can be seen the bulk solution is acidic due to ionization of nahso3 which can also be verified by the measured ph values in section 2 2 moreover the acidity of electrolyte on specimen surface and beneath the rust layer can be further increased through sulphite oxidation and feso4 cyclic process this can probably result in a lower ph in the crack and enhance hydrogen uptake rate in crack tip thus hydrogen evolution reaction was definitely involved during the corrosion process which can be well verified by the polarization curves fig 4 showing the cathodic reaction was mainly attributed to hydrogen evolution reaction many previous work have also indicated that hydrogen can be produced and penetrated into steel in marine atmosphere especially in so2 polluted environment nishimura et al 2004 akiyama et al 2010 2011 tsuru et al 2005 moreover the current density of hydrogen evolution reaction was high enough to cause he of e690 steel according to analysis in section 3 1 therefore the effect of hydrogen and he was definitely involved in the scc process in this environment in addition anodic dissolution ad mechanism was apparent from fig 6 d that scc cracks were initiated from localized corrosion in the bottom of the rust layer in conclusion the scc mechanism of e690 steel in marine electrolyte layer containing so2 was a combination of ad and he 5 conclusions 1 e690 steel has a high scc susceptibility in marine atmosphere containing so2 with a combined mechanism of ad and he so2 in atmosphere can greatly enhance the cathodic reaction of e690 steel and consequently promote its corrosion and scc process 2 so2 in marine atmosphere can facilitate the formation of a compact rust layer on steel surface and significantly promote the initiation of corrosion pits and scc cracks from the bottom of cracks in the rust layer resulting in the increase of scc

23187,ships in congested waterways are more prone to collision than open sea conditions although in most waterways the overall accident probability is known their spatial distribution even for the most dangerous waterways in the world is not commonly available as a detailed map existing solutions distribute the ships along predetermined routes which distorts the actual spatial distribution in this study a collision model is developed based on molecular collision theory the model allows the use of long term ais data as input to calculate the encounter probability in two dimensional waterways the model is tested in the strait of istanbul which is divided into sectors and further subdivided into cells the encounter probability is calculated using vessel kinematics extracted from one year ais data results show that the collision probability increases as the narrow passages in the strait intensify the ship density also sharp turns in the soi cause additional expansion in collision diameters which further increases the accident probability the results are compatible with the observed collision accident locations the sector based approach provides a better understanding of the spatial distribution of accidents in high resolution digital maps which are useful for captains traffic controllers and other stakeholders to take necessary precautions keywords maritime accident probability maritime traffic collision diameter automatic identification system spatial accident map strait of istanbul 1 introduction maritime accidents affect people directly or indirectly in terms of health environment and economy accident probability assessment is one of the most important steps for deciding preventive actions maritime accident probability studies started in 1950 with pure mathematical calculations these studies do not consider the real sea conditions therefore the results are far away from the reality ship to ship collision is one of the most encountered accident types in congested waterways first studies on ship collision started in 1950s nichols 1950 sadler 1957 where the authors relied solely on deterministic formulas and therefore come short in reflecting the real sea conditions wylie 1962 in 1970s two pioneering works applied the molecular collision theory to maritime accidents fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 and introduced the first collision probability theory based on collision diameter pedersen 1995 later quantified fujii and shiobara s 1971 collision diameter to calculate the probability of causation factor montewka et al 2010 improved the collision diameter as the minimum distance to collision mdtc defined as the distance where the collision is unavoidable by any maneuver an alternative to molecular collision theory is the ship domain approach where the approach of two ships within a pre defined distance is defined as a critical situation goodwin 1975 to predict the number of collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 merrick et al 2003 shu et al 2017 wang and chin 2016 according to wang et al 2009 study there are more than one type of ship domain if the most effective ship domain is not decided for the given waterway it can cause epistemic uncertainty a detailed discussion of the uncertainties for maritime applications can be found in goerlandt and kujala 2014 merrick and van dorp 2006 however in molecular collision theory calculation steps of the parameters are well defined therefore the molecular collision approach is found to be more appropriate for the scope of this study ais data has been used for estimating the accident probability map of a waterway ylitalo 2010 and harbor entrances mou et al 2010 since 2010 these studies have been followed by ship collision risk off the coast of portugal silveira et al 2013 accident risk in the malacca strait maimun et al 2014 zaman et al 2013 ship sinking frequencies in madura strait indonesia mulyadi et al 2014 near miss detection in singapore port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 northern baltic sea zhang et al 2016 and collision probability in the strait of messina cucinotta et al 2017 a detailed discussion of the ais usage for maritime traffic can be found in altan and otay 2017 according to literature review the most widely used approach for assessing the accident probability is to analyze the two factors of an accident one of them is the opportunity of an obstacle e g ship shoal etc on the way of the ship and the other one is not being able to make evasive maneuvers during the contact time to an obstacle due to loss of navigational control human errors meteorological conditions mechanical failure and etc these two factors are called as geometric probability and causation probability respectively the pioneering works of fujii and macduff modified the molecular collision probability to model maritime accidents studies followed in the literature have proven the reliability of the molecular collision theory for predicting the maritime collisions up to now some approaches have tried to apply the theory to real waterways but they remained limited within the ship routes collision probability of ships outside the pre determined routes cannot be accounted in such models in this paper a new model is developed to study maritime collision probabilities based on molecular collision theory although there are good studies in this field there are still missing parts in the literature the main contributions of the paper are application of theory on a spatial distribution in section 3 4 and 4 application of data from long term ais data in a congested waterway section 4 comparison with the past maritime collision records section 5 these three contribution for the maritime collision theory and application results are discussed in coming chapters 2 problem statement and site specific conditions 2 1 problem statement in the literature geometric probability is used for representing the probability of obstacles on a given course in the scope of this study only ships collisions are studied therefore throughout the manuscript the term encounter probability is used for representing the geometric collision probability draper and bennett 1972 assumes that encounter occur when two ships pass within a specified distance of each other in this study encounter is defined to occur when distance between two ship centers are equal to collision diameter encounter probability of a waterway represents the maritime risk level without the captain s actions the result is the encounter probability of ships for a given time period if no evasive maneuver is made this encounter probability depends on the density of ships velocities and meeting angles in the literature there are many studies for solving the encounter probability of a waterway these studies consider that ships all travel along designated routes their lateral distribution along the routes are assumed by some probability distributions or found based on ais data but it is known that ships can make random movements along their paths especially in congested and narrow waterways in order to eliminate the route dependence in encounter probability a 2 d approach similar to finite volume as in the analysis of fluid flow is developed the considered waterway is divided into sectors considering the major course changes and these sectors are subdivided into cells in order to analyze the spatial distribution of the ships and encounter probability 2 2 site specific conditions strait of istanbul the strait of istanbul soi is one of the most complex waterways in the world in terms of its navigational properties soi is a natural navigational channel between black sea and marmara sea the sea level difference between these two seas is the main cause of the strong currents during the navigation of 16 8 nm variation of the width around 0 81 nm and the 13 turns are causing the fluctuations of the current magnitude and direction during the soi passage 309 000 vessel movements consist of transit and local ships with a ratio of 1 8 altan and otay 2017 the navigational properties and vessel density of the soi make it a critical waterway for the maritime accidents the transit traffic in the soi is regulated with traffic separation scheme tss as given in fig 1 tsmtr 1998 the northbound ships are allowed to use the east side of the tss and southbound ships are allowed to use the west side of the tss the local ships ferries scheduled and unscheduled passenger ships and etc have to keep clear from the transit traffic and they should spend minimum time inside the transit traffic zone unless it is necessary none of the ships are allowed to travel with a speed higher than 10 knots if there is a ship inside the soi with a loa bigger than 200 m vts operators may change to unidirectional traffic instead of bidirectional traffic when unidirectional traffic is used transit ships are allowed to use the both lanes of the tss in addition to these rules it is recommended to use pilot services but it is not enforced by the rules a representative sketch of the local traffic is given in fig 2 the redlines represent the designated ferry lines in addition to these redlines there are private passenger transportation means and their routes and time schedules are not determined exactly the dashed blackline represents the middle part of the soi maritime traffic in the soi including accident locations has been mapped by kornhauser and clark 1995 using official paper logs and incident records before the availability of real time electronic data vessel traffic in the soi has been analyzed with probabilistic models otay and özkan 2003 tan and otay 1999 yazici and otay 2009 these models can mathematically estimate long term vessel distributions and the expected accident frequencies based on statistics of transit vessels models helped to understand the statistical characteristics of the transit traffic however the detailed navigation patterns especially of local traffic remained unknown the first attempt to use ais data for the traffic analysis in the soi was based on a two day visual assessment of ais tracks at the southern entrance of the soi aydogdu et al 2012 3 theory in this section a detailed discussion of source of data molecular collision theory and application to maritime traffic is given the following parts give information about the parameters and modifications that has been developed for the spatial application molecular collision theory argues that if the distance between the centers of the particles moving inside a domain are equal to the collision diameter there will be a collision the collision diameter changes according to the dimensions and velocities of the molecules number of collisions for a given particle for a given time period is equal to the number of particle centers inside the area swept by the collision diameter the swept area is the product of collision diameter relative velocity of the particles and time period the application to ship collision is formulated by pedersen 1995 as 1 p e i j z i z j ρ i z i ρ j z j d ij v ij t d z i d z j where p e is the encounter probability z i is the position of the ship on the ith route z j is the position of the ship on the jth route ρ i z i is the ship density as a function of z in the ith direction ρ j z j is the ship density as a function of z in the jth direction t is the time period d i j is the collision diameter of the ships on ith and jth route v i j is the relative velocity of the ships on ith and jth route in the following sub sections of this chapter formulations explanations and source of the parameters are given 3 1 ship density in the studied area the number of ships have to be known in order to find the encounter probability ship density is the number of ships per unit area per time and calculated as 2 ρ i q i v i δ t δ t t q i v i t where q i is the number of ships per unit width in the ith direction v i is the velocity of ships that travel in the ith direction δ t is the travel time inside the considered area this formula not only considers the number of ith direction ships in the given area it also considers the travel speed of these ships if the ships in a certain direction are slow they will stay longer in the considered area and therefore will give a higher density compared to the faster ones the formula also considers the time spend inside the given area over the time period of the observation with the term δ t t 3 2 relative velocity the relative velocity vector of ships approaching to each other determines the collision diameter line and consequently the encounter probability it is calculated as 3 v ij v i v j v i 2 v j 2 2 v i v j cos θ where v i is the velocity of the first ship v j is the velocity of the second ship θ is the angle between the velocity vectors 3 3 collision diameter apart from the relative velocity and ship density collision diameter is the most sensitive variable in encounter probability calculations it depends both on meeting angle and size of the ships the collision diameter indicates that there will be a collision if the two ship centers are inside the collision diameter in fig 3 a general representation of the collision diameter is given the size of the collision diameter is represented with the projection of one ith ship s dimension and two jth ships half dimensions although the same dij value can be calculated by using only one jth ship s complete dimensions it will cause misinterpretation of the collision diameter because the collision diameter is developed for the distance between the ship centers therefore it is more proper to show and use the collision diameter based on distances between the ship centers the value of the collision diameter is the projection of the two approaching ships on to a line which perpendicular to the relativity velocity of the ships it can be calculated as pedersen 1995 4 d ij l i v j l j v i v ij sin θ b j 1 sin θ v i v ij 2 1 2 b i 1 sin θ v j v ij 2 1 2 where l is the length of the ship b is the width of the ship the calculation of equation 4 is done according to collision types which is a function of meeting angles of the ships and can be listed as take over collision θ 0 10 crossing collision 10 θ 170 head on collision θ 180 10 if the ships are on take over or head on collision meeting angle θ is expected as 0 or 180 respectively 3 4 analysis framework the spatial application of the encounter probability overall methodology and data source is discussed in a special framework in fig 4 the overall analysis scheme is given the variables that are used as input are the ship position speed over ground sog course over ground cog and ship dimensions loa beam these data are dynamically broadcasted over ais the daily average of the ais messages in the soi is approximately 1 7 million using all of the data for defining the ship movements over 1 year period of time needs 33 600 h of computational time on a machine with 12 processors and 32 gb of ram therefore the waterway is divided into sectors and the data at the boundaries of the sectors are used for characterizing the maritime traffic ship positions are the key parameter that are used to determine the sector of the ship the details about the size of the sector is given in section 4 4 spatial application of encounter probability to the soi the encounter formula in equation 1 gives the number of collisions for given ship routes in the considered area however it does not indicate which area of a certain domain is exposed to collision if there are no designated routes therefore a true spatial distribution cannot be achieved if the molecular collision theory is applied directly in order to reach 2d spatial variation the theory should be applied to smaller parts of the domain which are called as sectors the schematic representation of the sectors is given in fig 5 the traffic at the sector boundaries is named according to the entering directions the question that remains is the size of the sectors the characteristics include course over ground cog speed over ground sog and ship density the soi is divided into 13 sectors fig 6 a according to their maneuver points inside these sectors it is assumed that cog and sog change is minimum for a congested waterway setting up sectors with steady state ship density is very difficult therefore sectors are subdivided into smaller cells fig 6 b to which the encounter probability formula is applied individually the most important thing about the cell division is the cell size the cell sizes are selected to be larger than the collision diameter otherwise the collision diameter may exceed the cell border and create artificial collisions the formula applied cell by cell is given in equation 5 5 p e s i j ik s jk s ρ i ik s s ρ j jk s s v ij s d ij s δ l ik s δ l jk s t where s represents the sector i j the boundaries n s e w of the sector i n s e w j i w i k j k the cell inside the sector according to the entrance d i j collision diameter δ l travel distance t considered time in equation 5 i and j represents the boundaries and the travel direction of the ships therefore with the summation over i and j head on over taking and crossing collisions are calculated equation 5 gives the encounter probability of each cell which can get values between 0 and 1 and it should not be mixed with number of encounters although the parameters inside the cells are uniformly distributed throughout the solution process of equation 5 variation of parameters among the cells makes the equation inherently probabilistic therefore an extra probability function is not added to the equation according to the formula the main factors determining the encounter probability in a given area are the density of the ships the collision diameter and the relative velocity of the ships since ship collisions are rare events more than one collision at the same time is not considered in the study in fig 6 b extra cells outside the boundaries are observed these cells are placed for considering the local traffic eastbound and westbound between the boundaries of the sectors and the land the local traffic data is extrapolated from the traffic data that is collected at the sector boundaries east and west and the collision probability of the local to local traffic at these cells are presented in the results the spatial distribution of the encounter probability within the soi is determined using long term ais data a detailed discussion of the maritime traffic data and the navigational characteristics of the soi can be found in altan and otay 2017 the required maritime traffic data for equation 5 are analyzed at the boundaries of 13 sectors and the ship densities are updated for each of the 484 cells in the soi 5 results discussion using the maritime traffic data provided by altan 2016 the encounter probability is calculated from september 2014 to august 2015 calculations are performed based on average ship dimensions and sog which are varying along the sectors and travel directions the results of the model is compared with the past collision records from akten 2004 in the coming parts of this section discussion of the parameters results of the study and comparison with past accidents will be described the final outcome of this study is the spatial distribution of encounter probability among the 484 cells the resulting map that is given in fig 7 help to identify the collision hotspots along the soi the color of the each cell is assigned according to encounter probability result in other words the results indicate the annual probability of ship encounter at a given cell and the color bar is the one to one representation of model outputs the collision probabilities distributed over the 484 cells in the soi increases towards the central cells along the waterway this is mainly due to the transit vessels which set a course close to the centerline of the channel to stay within the officially enforced boundaries of the traffic separation scheme tss as a result this leads to an increasing ship density at central cells when the map is analyzed in terms of sectors sectors 2 4 5 7 9 and 10 contains the cells with collision probabilities larger than the average according to equation 5 and fig 4 parameters that control the collision probability are the relative velocity ship density and collision diameter relative velocity affects both directly and indirectly the encounter results in the mathematical scheme the relative velocity is very critical to determine the collision probability in the soi the speed limit is 10 knots which cannot be exceeded except risky situations in ship handling or a rapid change of course in addition to that due to currents ships do not sail at low speeds in order to maintain the rudder control therefore velocity variations inside the soi is very limited the second parameter that has a direct effect is the traffic density the traffic density shows a large variation in the soi due to non uniform local traffic and varying geometry of the navigational cross section these facts make the ship traffic density the most critical parameter to control the collision probability in equation 5 the effect of traffic density is observed at cells that belong to sectors 2 4 and 5 the last controlling parameter is the collision diameter the collision diameter is mostly affected by the approach angle of ships if the ship sizes are assumed uniform the value of the collision diameter increases as the approach angle of the ships approaches 90 the effect of the collision diameter become especially significant at sectors 8 9 and 10 where the effect of the sharp turn at sector 9 is observed the results of the present collision analysis are compared to two past studies conducted in the soi fig 8 a shows the present 2d model results based on one year ais data from september 2014 to august 2015 fig 8 b shows the collision probabilities predicted with a one dimensional ship motion model otay and özkan 2003 the present model shows improvements over their 1d collision model in identifying various collision hotspots in all sectors complying with the past accident logs fig 8 c shows the locations of actual ship collisions recorded by the ministry of transportation in the soi between 1982 and 2003 akten 2004 the advantage of the present study over the accident logs is that it would show the collision probability before the accident happens since the present analysis is based on ais records which are continuously available for any time period since 2014 onwards the lack of the model it cannot predict the collision accidents that are occurring during the approaching and departing maneuvers in fig 8 c some examples of these collision accidents can be found sector 3 and sector 9 in table 1 encounter probabilities per sector a and encounter probabilities per sector per nm2 b are given the encounter probability indicates the probability of a ship will encounter with another ship during its passage through the given sector the factors effecting the encounter probability are the parameters that are used in equation 5 according to encounter probabilities sector 3 has the highest probability but the encounter probabilities are highly biased with the size of the sectors therefore in table 1 b encounter probability per sector per nm2 are given the results represents if the ship will travel through 1 nm2 of the given sector what is the probability of an encounter according to these results sector 2 has the highest probability which is meaningful due to its local traffic density sector 2 is followed by sector 9 and 5 which contains the most probable encounter cells in their boundaries according to table 1 b sector 3 has a lower encounter probability per nm2 which is normal because of its long straight path fig 9 shows the encounter probabilities according to their types as expected crossing encounter is the most probable encounter type with 48 there are two reasons for that first in crossing encounter density of local and transit traffic is used second collision diameter increases in crossing situations the crossing encounter is followed by take over and head on encounters the encounter probability distribution of collision accidents in terms of loa is given in fig 10 most of the expected collision accidents involve ships with loa between 100 and 149 m since it is the most common ship size observed in the soi the results that are represented in fig 10 are biased with the number of ships therefore number of ship percentages are given in fig 11 the ships with loa between 100 and 149 m have the highest percentages and they are followed by 150 199 m 50 99 m in order to understand the effect of ship size on encounter probability a scaled collision probability graph is given in fig 12 the scaled collision probability is the relative probability of a ship class relative to the most common ship with loa 100 m 149 m as expected the collision probability increases with increasing loa but for the ships longer than 300 m the collision probability shows an extreme jump to 6 58 times the common ship although their encounter probability is 6 58 times the most common ship type their collision records are nearly insignificant due to the pilot captains 6 conclusion in this study a new framework for the encounter theory is proposed implemented to the strait of istanbul soi and results are mapped the results show the spatial distribution of the encounter probability throughout 484 cells along the soi these maps may help the captains and the stakeholders to quantify and assess the navigation risks another advantage of mapping the encounter probability is that captains can plan their routes through the soi based on minimum long term collision risk the encounter theory is improved by including real 2d spatial distribution and verified with the past collision records encounter probabilities reveal important hotspots along the strait results are coherent with the past studies and accident locations another improvement is the two dimensional positioning of the encounter probability map so the captains can decide their lateral position in the sector for minimizing the collision probability sectors 2 4 5 7 9 and 10 have above average collision probabilities the reasons for the increase in the encounter probability are found as the change in traffic density and in collision diameter in general the sectors with bends have the highest collision probabilities the proposed framework can be applied to all congested narrow waterways around the world a possible extension of the study would be to calculate the causality probability by considering the captains behavior to make an evasive maneuver another improvement can be achieved by modifying the system to calculate the dynamic collision probability with real time maritime traffic data collision probabilities can dynamically be updated and mapped for live risk forecasts 
23187,ships in congested waterways are more prone to collision than open sea conditions although in most waterways the overall accident probability is known their spatial distribution even for the most dangerous waterways in the world is not commonly available as a detailed map existing solutions distribute the ships along predetermined routes which distorts the actual spatial distribution in this study a collision model is developed based on molecular collision theory the model allows the use of long term ais data as input to calculate the encounter probability in two dimensional waterways the model is tested in the strait of istanbul which is divided into sectors and further subdivided into cells the encounter probability is calculated using vessel kinematics extracted from one year ais data results show that the collision probability increases as the narrow passages in the strait intensify the ship density also sharp turns in the soi cause additional expansion in collision diameters which further increases the accident probability the results are compatible with the observed collision accident locations the sector based approach provides a better understanding of the spatial distribution of accidents in high resolution digital maps which are useful for captains traffic controllers and other stakeholders to take necessary precautions keywords maritime accident probability maritime traffic collision diameter automatic identification system spatial accident map strait of istanbul 1 introduction maritime accidents affect people directly or indirectly in terms of health environment and economy accident probability assessment is one of the most important steps for deciding preventive actions maritime accident probability studies started in 1950 with pure mathematical calculations these studies do not consider the real sea conditions therefore the results are far away from the reality ship to ship collision is one of the most encountered accident types in congested waterways first studies on ship collision started in 1950s nichols 1950 sadler 1957 where the authors relied solely on deterministic formulas and therefore come short in reflecting the real sea conditions wylie 1962 in 1970s two pioneering works applied the molecular collision theory to maritime accidents fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 and introduced the first collision probability theory based on collision diameter pedersen 1995 later quantified fujii and shiobara s 1971 collision diameter to calculate the probability of causation factor montewka et al 2010 improved the collision diameter as the minimum distance to collision mdtc defined as the distance where the collision is unavoidable by any maneuver an alternative to molecular collision theory is the ship domain approach where the approach of two ships within a pre defined distance is defined as a critical situation goodwin 1975 to predict the number of collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 merrick et al 2003 shu et al 2017 wang and chin 2016 according to wang et al 2009 study there are more than one type of ship domain if the most effective ship domain is not decided for the given waterway it can cause epistemic uncertainty a detailed discussion of the uncertainties for maritime applications can be found in goerlandt and kujala 2014 merrick and van dorp 2006 however in molecular collision theory calculation steps of the parameters are well defined therefore the molecular collision approach is found to be more appropriate for the scope of this study ais data has been used for estimating the accident probability map of a waterway ylitalo 2010 and harbor entrances mou et al 2010 since 2010 these studies have been followed by ship collision risk off the coast of portugal silveira et al 2013 accident risk in the malacca strait maimun et al 2014 zaman et al 2013 ship sinking frequencies in madura strait indonesia mulyadi et al 2014 near miss detection in singapore port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 northern baltic sea zhang et al 2016 and collision probability in the strait of messina cucinotta et al 2017 a detailed discussion of the ais usage for maritime traffic can be found in altan and otay 2017 according to literature review the most widely used approach for assessing the accident probability is to analyze the two factors of an accident one of them is the opportunity of an obstacle e g ship shoal etc on the way of the ship and the other one is not being able to make evasive maneuvers during the contact time to an obstacle due to loss of navigational control human errors meteorological conditions mechanical failure and etc these two factors are called as geometric probability and causation probability respectively the pioneering works of fujii and macduff modified the molecular collision probability to model maritime accidents studies followed in the literature have proven the reliability of the molecular collision theory for predicting the maritime collisions up to now some approaches have tried to apply the theory to real waterways but they remained limited within the ship routes collision probability of ships outside the pre determined routes cannot be accounted in such models in this paper a new model is developed to study maritime collision probabilities based on molecular collision theory although there are good studies in this field there are still missing parts in the literature the main contributions of the paper are application of theory on a spatial distribution in section 3 4 and 4 application of data from long term ais data in a congested waterway section 4 comparison with the past maritime collision records section 5 these three contribution for the maritime collision theory and application results are discussed in coming chapters 2 problem statement and site specific conditions 2 1 problem statement in the literature geometric probability is used for representing the probability of obstacles on a given course in the scope of this study only ships collisions are studied therefore throughout the manuscript the term encounter probability is used for representing the geometric collision probability draper and bennett 1972 assumes that encounter occur when two ships pass within a specified distance of each other in this study encounter is defined to occur when distance between two ship centers are equal to collision diameter encounter probability of a waterway represents the maritime risk level without the captain s actions the result is the encounter probability of ships for a given time period if no evasive maneuver is made this encounter probability depends on the density of ships velocities and meeting angles in the literature there are many studies for solving the encounter probability of a waterway these studies consider that ships all travel along designated routes their lateral distribution along the routes are assumed by some probability distributions or found based on ais data but it is known that ships can make random movements along their paths especially in congested and narrow waterways in order to eliminate the route dependence in encounter probability a 2 d approach similar to finite volume as in the analysis of fluid flow is developed the considered waterway is divided into sectors considering the major course changes and these sectors are subdivided into cells in order to analyze the spatial distribution of the ships and encounter probability 2 2 site specific conditions strait of istanbul the strait of istanbul soi is one of the most complex waterways in the world in terms of its navigational properties soi is a natural navigational channel between black sea and marmara sea the sea level difference between these two seas is the main cause of the strong currents during the navigation of 16 8 nm variation of the width around 0 81 nm and the 13 turns are causing the fluctuations of the current magnitude and direction during the soi passage 309 000 vessel movements consist of transit and local ships with a ratio of 1 8 altan and otay 2017 the navigational properties and vessel density of the soi make it a critical waterway for the maritime accidents the transit traffic in the soi is regulated with traffic separation scheme tss as given in fig 1 tsmtr 1998 the northbound ships are allowed to use the east side of the tss and southbound ships are allowed to use the west side of the tss the local ships ferries scheduled and unscheduled passenger ships and etc have to keep clear from the transit traffic and they should spend minimum time inside the transit traffic zone unless it is necessary none of the ships are allowed to travel with a speed higher than 10 knots if there is a ship inside the soi with a loa bigger than 200 m vts operators may change to unidirectional traffic instead of bidirectional traffic when unidirectional traffic is used transit ships are allowed to use the both lanes of the tss in addition to these rules it is recommended to use pilot services but it is not enforced by the rules a representative sketch of the local traffic is given in fig 2 the redlines represent the designated ferry lines in addition to these redlines there are private passenger transportation means and their routes and time schedules are not determined exactly the dashed blackline represents the middle part of the soi maritime traffic in the soi including accident locations has been mapped by kornhauser and clark 1995 using official paper logs and incident records before the availability of real time electronic data vessel traffic in the soi has been analyzed with probabilistic models otay and özkan 2003 tan and otay 1999 yazici and otay 2009 these models can mathematically estimate long term vessel distributions and the expected accident frequencies based on statistics of transit vessels models helped to understand the statistical characteristics of the transit traffic however the detailed navigation patterns especially of local traffic remained unknown the first attempt to use ais data for the traffic analysis in the soi was based on a two day visual assessment of ais tracks at the southern entrance of the soi aydogdu et al 2012 3 theory in this section a detailed discussion of source of data molecular collision theory and application to maritime traffic is given the following parts give information about the parameters and modifications that has been developed for the spatial application molecular collision theory argues that if the distance between the centers of the particles moving inside a domain are equal to the collision diameter there will be a collision the collision diameter changes according to the dimensions and velocities of the molecules number of collisions for a given particle for a given time period is equal to the number of particle centers inside the area swept by the collision diameter the swept area is the product of collision diameter relative velocity of the particles and time period the application to ship collision is formulated by pedersen 1995 as 1 p e i j z i z j ρ i z i ρ j z j d ij v ij t d z i d z j where p e is the encounter probability z i is the position of the ship on the ith route z j is the position of the ship on the jth route ρ i z i is the ship density as a function of z in the ith direction ρ j z j is the ship density as a function of z in the jth direction t is the time period d i j is the collision diameter of the ships on ith and jth route v i j is the relative velocity of the ships on ith and jth route in the following sub sections of this chapter formulations explanations and source of the parameters are given 3 1 ship density in the studied area the number of ships have to be known in order to find the encounter probability ship density is the number of ships per unit area per time and calculated as 2 ρ i q i v i δ t δ t t q i v i t where q i is

the number of ith direction ships in the given area it also considers the travel speed of these ships if the ships in a certain direction are slow they will stay longer in the considered area and therefore will give a higher density compared to the faster ones the formula also considers the time spend inside the given area over the time period of the observation with the term δ t t 3 2 relative velocity the relative velocity vector of ships approaching to each other determines the collision diameter line and consequently the encounter probability it is calculated as 3 v ij v i v j v

it will cause misinterpretation of the collision diameter because the collision diameter is developed for the distance between the ship centers therefore it is more proper to show and use the collision diameter based on distances between the ship centers the value of the collision diameter is the projection of the two approaching ships on to a line which perpendicular to the relativity

encounter is followed by take over and head on encounters the encounter probability distribution of collision accidents in terms of loa is given in fig 10 most of the expected collision accidents involve ships with loa between 100 and 149 m since it is the most common ship size observed in the soi the results that are represented in fig 10 are biased with the number of ships therefore number of ship percentages are given in fig 11 the ships with loa between 100 and 149 m have the highest percentages and they are followed by 150 199 m 50 99 m in order to understand the effect of ship size on encounter probability a scaled collision probability graph is given in fig 12 the scaled collision probability is the relative probability of a ship class relative to the most common ship with loa 100 m 149 m as expected the collision probability increases with increasing loa but for the ships longer than 300 m the collision probability shows an extreme jump to 6 58 times the common ship although their encounter probability is 6 58 times the most common ship type their collision records are nearly insignificant due to the pilot captains 6 conclusion in this study a new framework for the encounter theory is proposed implemented to the strait of istanbul soi and results are mapped the results show the spatial distribution of the encounter probability throughout 484 cells along the soi these maps may help the captains and the stakeholders to quantify and assess the navigation risks another advantage of mapping the encounter probability is that captains can plan their routes through the soi based on minimum long term collision risk the encounter theory is improved by including real 2d spatial distribution and verified with the past collision records encounter probabilities reveal important hotspots along the strait results are coherent with the past studies and accident locations another improvement is the two dimensional positioning of the encounter probability map so the captains can decide their lateral position in the sector for minimizing the collision probability sectors 2 4 5 7 9 and 10 have above average collision probabilities the reasons for the increase in the encounter probability are found as the change in traffic density and in collision diameter in general the sectors with bends have the highest collision probabilities the proposed framework can be applied to all congested narrow waterways around the world a possible extension of the study would be to calculate the causality probability by considering the captains behavior to make an evasive maneuver another improvement can be achieved by modifying the system to calculate the dynamic collision probability with real time maritime traffic data collision probabilities can dynamically be updated and mapped for live risk forecasts

ensure the safe performance of floating structures during the service life in the literature and offshore industries damage diagnosis of mooring lines is based on fatigue analysis by considering rope

components in the offshore structures such as tlp floating vessels and wind turbines therefore many academic researchers are interested in studying the mooring static and dynamic behavior moreover because of the applied strong forces in the floating structures due to initial tensions and sea waves the early diagnosis of mooring lines plays a crucial role in safe operation of these structures the studies of the damage process in the mooring lines are based on different parameters such as fatigue rate analysis ma et al 2013 strength capacity of a mooring system brindley and comley 2014 fatigue damage philipp et al 2014 tension and durability of mooring lines christopher et al 2000 banfield et al 2005 ridge 2006 and the failure risk of the mooring lines based on extended period environmental loads huang and pan 2010 thus due to possible damages of mooring system monitoring and maintaining should be performed according to the above mentioned parameters one of the most common diagnosis methods in this field is based on fuzzy logic mentesismail 2011 jahangiri et al 2016 jamalkia et al 2016 despite the many advantages of the fuzzy method in identifying severe damages this method is not very successful in identifying the small and moderate damages another method for diagnosis is based on fault tolerant control fang et al 2015 in control methods fault diagnosis is possible by using vibration signals and structural reliability index this type of diagnosis cannot be used in the floating structures with moving parts such as wind turbines because in these structures identification of defects in the moving parts of the turbine and mooring lines from each other is impossible the most powerful methods for the diagnosis of the mooring systems are based on the computer simulation in the field of the mooring line modeling the fem is suggested as more accurate method similarly a significant research in the modeling with fem is suggested by reference tahar and kim 2008 in mentioned research by introducing shape functions and suitable numerical method for the solution the weak formulations for applying the fem technique are written it should be noted that the uncertainty should be considered for accurate modeling of the mooring lines therefore one of the most important steps in damage diagnosing of the mooring lines is applying the uncertainty in modeling of the mooring system vazquez hernandez et al 2006 zhang and gilbert 2006 montes iturrizaga et al 2007 in this paper firstly ssp is employed to apply boundary conditions uncertainty in modeling furthermore ssp is used to avoid large computational costs and round off errors secondly a new design of artificial neural networks anns is proposed for health monitoring of the mooring lines selection of the proper ann for specific case study is based on the input data of the ann in rbf networks a vector distance is calculated directly euclidean distance so rbf has more accurate results than the vector inner product which is used in other anns the main disadvantage of conventional rbf is the limitation of the number of input data for training the ann subsequently the proposed new architecture of rbf is designed for solving the problems of conventional one the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we start with modeling of the mooring systems by using the rod theory fem and ssp and then the proposed modeling is validated experimentally section 3 describes the uncertainties and damage classification of the considered case study section 4 presents the new architecture of rbf the achievable performance of proposed method and other methods are investigated in section 5 the conclusion of this paper is presented in section 6 2 modeling of mooring lines to mitigate the motion of the floating structures mooring lines with different materials have been used in offshore industry a steel wire rope with chains at both ends has been installed for spar platform in deep water also taut vertical mooring lines and tethers composed of several vertical steel pipes are intended to be installed in the tlp nowadays synthetic mooring lines made of polyester are considered as a more efficient solution these types of mooring lines are applied in the floating structures in very deep water over 6000 ft young bok 2003 in this section the static deflection of the polyester rope and the line tension are obtained by using the catenary equations in the catenary equations hydrodynamic forces on the line are not considered however for consideration of hydrodynamic effects on the line the boundary and measurement uncertainties are used further the strain and stress of the rope with geometric nonlinearity are solved with the beam theory using the updated lagrangian approach for this purpose the tensioned string theory is applied in this theory the string is modeled by using beam elements where it is called the elastic rod theory tahar and kim 2008 which is based on the formula derived by nordgren and garret nordgren 1974 garrett 1982 2 1 rod theory the behavior of a slender rod can be expressed in terms of the variation of the rod position a position vector r s t is the function of the rod arc length s and time t the equations 1 and 2 are the fundamental equations of motion for the elastic rod applied to the fem formulation young bok

is the weight of the rod per unit length t is the effective tension in the rod and w is the effective weight or the wet weight of the rod prime denotes the derivative with respect to arc length s and the dot denotes the time derivative also f s is the hydrostatic force on the rod which is defined as follows 4 f s b p r where b is the buoyancy force on the rod per unit length and p is the hydrostatic pressure at the point r on the rod 2 2 finite element method as described in previous part of this section the application of the fem is started on the equation 2 and following equation 5 1 2 r r 1 λ a e 0 the unknown variable r and λ can be approximated as 6 r s t a l s u i l t 7 λ s t p m s λ m t where 0 s l a l and p m are cubic and quadratic shape functions respectively also u i l and λ m are the unknown coefficients the weak formulations of the fem technique are written by multiplying the weighting function δ r i and δ λ as follows 8 0 l δ r i ρ r e i r λ r w d s 0 9 0 l δ λ 1

function is defined as follows 12 δ r i a l δ u i l δ λ p m δ λ m now the equations 8 and 9 can be expanded in terms and the partial integrations are applied to each term finally the equations can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 13 m i j l k u j k k i j l k 1 λ n k n i j l k 2 u j k f i l 0 14 g m a m i l u k l u k i b m c m n λ n 0 where 15 m i j l k ρ a l a k δ i j d s 16 k i j l k 1 0

unknown displacements and forces 38 δ q f k f f 1 f 0 k f s δ q 0 39 f s k s f δ q f k s s δ q 0 the size of the assembled stiffness matrix is 15 and the total number of equations is n 1 8 1 where n is the number of the element for a line correspondingly the stiffness matrix is symmetric and banded matrix it should be noted that equations 38 and 39 provide the means to calculate directly the unknown variables in the equation 34 then the round off error is removed from the modeling by using ssp instead of the iterative methods consequently more accurate modeling is obtained and the computation time is reduced furthermore this procedure is used to apply boundary conditions uncertainty in modeling in this study a quasi static process is used for coupled analysis of integrated platform and mooring system therefore the motion of the body is analyzed first and then in the post processing the short term performance quasi static of the mooring lines and risers are solved with the motions of the end nodes that are assumed to be the same amount as the body motion 2 4 model verification and validation the validation of the applied model is presented in this section for this purpose the results of the proposed modeling are compared to the literature data equation of elastic curve beer et al 2002 likewise an experimental test is provided to extract the behavior of a real rope in the laboratory scale then the results of experimental test are compared with the results of the proposed modeling 2 4 1 validation with reference equations in this part of section the applied forces on the rope are assumed to be uniformly distributed rope weight and concentrated load at the center also the main particulars of the rope are given in the table 1 the results of the comparisons are illustrated in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the results of both models are very close to each other thus the difference between the results is negligible in addition the results obtained from this test are shown in table 2 as it is clear from table 2 the difference of the deflection between the proposed and reference models at the critical point of the rope mid point is very low 2 4 2 validation with experimental test in this part of section the deflection of a real rope is measured experimentally in the first experimental test the applied force on the rope is considered uniformly distributed rope weight equally the boundary conditions are simply supported as shown in fig 2 the main particulars of the rope are given in table 3 the second experimental test is implemented in a water aquarium as shown in fig 3 the applied forces on the rope are the weight and buoyancy forces additionally the boundary conditions are simply supported the deviation of rope deflection obtained by the proposed model and experimental tests in air and water are shown in table 4 as shown in the table 4 the deviation of experimental deflection are very low so the proposed model is validated further the result of experiments shows that the proposed modeling method is able to apply on different cases in the air and water 3 damage classification of the mooring lines there are many studies to classify different faults in the mooring lines this paper applies an approach to classify the levels and locations of different damage damage classes at the beginning of this section the uncertainties in the mooring system should be defined then the fault classification will be described in the second part of this section 3 1 uncertainties in this research the material uncertainty is considered to be related to the young s modulus of the rope this type of uncertainty is assumed as normal distribution with the standard deviation of 0 01 moreover in all of the mooring systems in literature the boundary conditions are assumed fixed however in a real case study this assumption is impossible actually there is considerable fluctuation in boundary conditions because of floating structures nature effects of wave current and wind on the structure and consequently on the mooring lines for that reason in this research boundary conditions uncertainties are considered by variation of the joint position of the mooring lines which is connected to the floating structure fairlead it should be noted that the ranges of uncertainties are estimated by having more detailed information about the case study and its environmental conditions wind wave current hydrodynamic effects and etc in the present case study the uncertainties of the boundary conditions are performed using monte carlo simulation in the range of 10 10 cm further an uncertainty is considered in the measurement system this uncertainty is because of the noise and measurement error although mentioned uncertainty is minimized recently with the progress of technology and measurement equipment however considering this uncertainty is necessary for the exact diagnosis of small damages the following equation is used for adding measurement uncertainty to the extracted features chandrashekhar and ganguli 2009 40 f n o i s e y f n e t 1 u α where f n e t is the extracted features nodes locations of the proposed model u is a random number in the interval 0 01 0 01 and α is a noise level parameter the noise level parameter α defines the maximum variance between the extracted features and noisy features it should be noted that each damage detection project has its own noise level parameters which can be considered based on the provided guidelines by sensor and measurement equipment manufactures it should be added that in some damage identification and health monitoring methods the hydrodynamic effects are taken into account as uncertain parameters liu et al 2011 thus in this research the hydrodynamic effects wind current and wave and vessel motions are considered by boundary and measurement uncertainties these uncertainties are performed by variation of the nodes location using monte carlo simulation 3 2 mooring system damages in this study the damage in mooring line is represented by reduction in the stiffness young s modulus these damages are classified based on defined ranges as slight damage 2 10 reduction moderate damage 11 20 reduction and severe damage 21 30 reduction fig 4 illustrates the lower and upper limits of a rope by considering above mentioned damage modes and material uncertainty also the main particulars of the rope are presented in table 1 as it is expected increase in fault level of the rope causes an increase in the deflection fig 4 now the upper and lower limits of the mooring lines of a floating structure obtained by proposed modeling method is shown in fig 5 the main particulars of the mooring system are given in table 5 it should be noted that the figs 4 and 5 are considered to better illustrate the upper and lower limits of mooring motion for different levels of damage so damages in these figures are considered globally however the classification of data which is used in damage diagnosis is based on the local damage fig 5 shows the total distance of the upper and lower limits of mooring motion the mooring line shape is obtained by proposed simulation model subsequently the diagnosis of these structures is based on the shape of the mooring deflection z coordinate of the mooring line the mooring line is divided into five uniform segments of equal lengths labeled as root inboard center outboard and tip this type of representation of structural damage along various locations is useful to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis the mean and standard deviation of the features are presented in table 6 consequently the damage classes of the mooring system are defined as follows damage classes class 1 undamaged class 2 slight damage at root class 3 slight damage at inboard class 4 slight damage at center class 5 slight damage at outboard class 6 slight damage at tip class 7 moderate damage at root class 8 moderate damage at inboard class 9 moderate damage at center class 10 moderate damage at outboard class 11 moderate damage at tip class 12 severe damage at root class 13 severe damage at inboard class 14 severe damage at center class 15 severe damage at outboard class 16 severe damage at tip one of the basic problems in damage diagnosis is overlapping in damage classes of the mooring lines following probability distribution is used to specify the overlapping problem of the damage classes for this case study table 6 41 μ x 1 2 π σ e 0 5 x m σ 2 where m is midpoint of each class and σ is the spread standard deviation associated with the variable fig 6 shows the overlapping of the damage classes using the probability distribution as it is clear the overlap of the damage classes is very high therefore the diagnosis method for this case study must have the ability to recognize the overlapping such as shown in fig 6 4 neural network design for health monitoring intelligent fault diagnosis methods should be applied to solve the problems such as overlapping of the classes and uncertainties in modeling thus in this work ann is recognized as a powerful method for fault diagnosis among different ann models rbf is widely used to recognize the nonlinear multi dimensional classes it should be noted the main disadvantage of rbf is the limitation of the number of input data for training the ann consequently in this paper a new architecture of rbf is designed to solve the limitation problem accordingly a novel rbf is presented to improve the accuracy of the fault diagnosis 4 1 radial basis network architecture rbf networks with a sufficient number of neurons in the hidden layer are able to approximate any continuous function and classify the nonlinear behavior of mooring lines lowe 1989 rbf network fig 7 has been inspired based on statistical classification techniques also rbf is a universal approximator and can be used for function approximation or pattern recognition park and sandberg 1993 consequently in rbf network a set of weights can be found to approximate the relationship between input and target vectors better than any other functions broomhead and lowe 1988 another advantage of the rbf is using euclidean distance direct calculation of vectors distance instead of the matrix multiplication inner product between the weights and the input in rbf the net input to the radial basis transfer function is the vector distance between its weight vector w and the input vector p multiplied by the bias b furthermore the output value of the rbf is maximum when its input is 0 in other words if the distance between w and p decreases the output increases thus a radial basis radbas neuron acts as a detector that produces 1 maximum whenever the input p is identical to its weight vector w among different types of networks probabilistic anns can be used for classification problems when an input is presented the first layer computes distances from the input vector to the training input vectors and produces a vector whose elements indicate how close the input is to a training input the second layer sums these contributions for each class of inputs to produce a vector of probabilities as its net output finally a competitive transfer function on the output of the second layer picks the maximum of these probabilities and produces a 1 for that class and a 0 for the other classes the architecture of conventional rbf is shown in fig 8 demuth et al 2012 ch 8 in fig 8 i w is the first layer weight l w is the second layer weight b 1 is the first layer bias a 1 is the first layer output a 2 is the second layer output r is the number of elements in input vector it is assumed that there are q input vector target pairs each target vector has k elements and one of these elements is 1 and the remaining ones are 0 thus each input vector is associated with one of the k classes now a proposed new architecture of rbf is presented in fig 9 where s 1 is the number of neurons in layer 1 and s 2 is the number of neurons in layer 2 as shown in fig 9 in the proposed rbf the first layer has a gaussian function and the second layer has a linear and competitive function training and implementation of proposed rbf are described as follows 4 2 training first layer the first layer weights of the rbf is trained to perform a clustering of vectors using the kohonen learning rule as follows hagan et al 2014 42 w i 1 q w i 1 q 1 α p q w i 1 q 1 where p q is one of the input vectors in the training set and w i 1 q 1 is the closest weight vector to p q in addition to selecting the first layer weights the clustering process can provide us with a method for determining the first layer biases for each radbas neuron the n c input vectors are located from the training set that are closest to the corresponding weight vector center then the average distance is computed between the center and its neighbors as follows 43 d i s t i 1 n c j 1 n c p j i w i 1 2 1 2 where p 1 i is the input vector that is closest to w i 1 and p 2 i is the next closest input vector from these distances the first layer biases are set as follows 44 b i 1 1 2 d i s t i therefore when a cluster is wide the corresponding radbas neuron will be wide as well it should be noted that in this case each bias in the first layer can be different 4 3 training second layer after the training of the first layer weights and biases linear least squares is used to find the second layer weights and biases once the first layer parameters have been set the training of the second layer weights and biases is equivalent to training a linear ann each target vector t q has k rows and one of these rows is 10 and the remaining ones are zero it should be noted that a q 1 is qth input vector of the second layer consequently there are q pairs of input and target vector for training the training data set for the second layer is given by 45 a 1 1 t 1 a 2 1 t 2 a q 1 t q additionally the second layer response is linear as follows 46 a 2 w 2 a 1 b 2 in this layer the weights and biases are selected to minimize the sum square error performance index over the training set as follows 47 f x q 1 q t q a q 2 t t q a q 2 4 4 network implementation in this research matlab is used for implementation of the proposed network a two layer ann is considered to design the proposed rbf the first layer has radbas neurons and its weighted matrix is calculated with euclidean distance weight function d i s t the second layer has linear and competitive transfer function neurons and its weighted matrix is calculated with dot product weight function also its net inputs are calculated with sum net input function as shown in fig 9 both mentioned layers have biases it should be added that the proposed rbf iteratively creates a neuron at each iteration epoch neurons are added to the network until the sum squared error falls beneath an error goal or a maximum number of neurons have been reached the steps in the implementation of the proposed rbf are described as follows a initially the number of hidden layer neurons radial basis is equal to zero b the error rate of the output layer is given as a sum squared error goal c the network is run d the number of hidden layer neurons increase in each epoch equal to 1 by default e the first layer weights are trained by kohonen learning rule as mentioned in section 4 2 f the second layer weights are redesigned to minimize error as mentioned in section 4 3 g the error of the new network is checked and if error is more than goal the process should be back to the step d h the abovementioned steps are repeated until the network s sum squared error falls beneath an error goal i the training process of ann is completed j the output vector of the linear transfer function is used as the input vector to the competitive transfer function k finally output vector of ann has a value of 1 only in the row associated with that particular class of input vector and the remaining rows are 0 the flowchart of the proposed modeling and diagnosis process is illustrated in fig 10 5 results and discussion in this section the test results of health monitoring based on proposed new rbf will be discussed and compared with results of other existing methods therefore the results of two tests are presented which one of these tests is based on the simulation model and other one is experimental test 5 1 simulation model the training data are obtained by simulation model with material and boundary condition uncertainties additionally these data are classified according to the mentioned damage classes table 6 the input vectors have 11 rows associated with the z coordinate of the mooring at 11 nodes with equal distance between them also each target vector has 16 rows which one of these rows has a numerical value of 10 and the remaining ones have a numerical value of 0 the sum of squared errors during training process is illustrated in fig 11 as illustrated in fig 11 the error is reduced by increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer at each iteration also when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reach to 313 the sum of squared errors converge to defined value goal 0 08 thus the training is stopped table 7 shows the success rate of the proposed rbf and conventional one from table 7 it is observed that the results of the conventional rbf just for some classes are acceptable but the results of the proposed rbf has the highest percentage of success rate in each damage class consequently the proposed rbf has 13 average success rate higher than conventional one conventional rbf is unable to detect the lower damage level overlapping damage classes moreover the success rate of conventional rbf in fairlead damage in the tip segment is low as it is expected the main factor of this reduction is the boundary condition uncertainty because conventional rbf is unable to isolate the boundary uncertainty in other words the proposed rbf has a higher success rate in fairlead because of high ability to isolate the uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the mooring lines table 8 shows the success rate of the proposed rbf and fuzzy based methods it should be noted that the first fuzzy method uses the mean and standard deviation of five points in the rope five input features and the second one applies 14 points from table 8 it is observed that both of the fuzzy based methods have very low success rate the main reasons of this problem are the uncertainties overlapping damage classes and nonlinear behavior of the mooring lines the addition of noise to the simulations is needed to examine the robustness of the diagnosis method under noisy conditions therefore the proposed rbf is tested using the noisy data as mentioned in section 3 1 table 9 shows the success rates for proposed rbf at various noise levels as it is expected with increasing the level of the measurement noise the average success rate is decreased damage classes with low damage and tip segments fairlead are more sensitive classes to the noise in addition the greatest reduction of success rate is related to the undamaged class healthy because of narrow lower and upper limits as shown in fig 4 in other words when the motion range of the mooring is considered very small because of small range of stiffness reduction in undamaged class the high measurement noise causes a reduction of success rate the easy way to solve this problem is considering a little wider range of simulated motion in the undamaged class widening the range of stiffness reduction 5 2 experimental model in this part an experimental test is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a real case the main particulars of the rope used in this case are given in table 3 in this case the mooring line is divided into four uniform segments of equal lengths labeled as root inboard outboard and tip the structural damages in each segment are classified as slight moderate and severe damage sizes below slight damage are classified as undamaged further training data are classified according to the mentioned damage levels and locations 13 damage classes thus each target vector has 13 rows which one of these rows has a numerical value of 0 5 and the remaining ones have a numerical value of 0 the input vectors have five rows associated with the z coordinate of the rope at five nodes with equal distance between them the sum of squared errors during training process is illustrated in fig 12 as illustrated in fig 12 when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reaches to 86 the sum of squared errors converges to defined value goal 0 001 thus the training is stopped the damage is created by using uniform cross sectional cutting on the healthy segment as depicted in fig 13 slight a cross sectional cutting in each 5 cm along the length of the segment moderate a cross sectional cutting in each 2 5 cm along the length of the segment and severe a cross sectional cutting in each 1 cm along the length of the segment it should be noted that coordinates of the nodes of the elements are obtained from image processing table 10 presents the coordinates of the nodes of the elements that are obtained from experimental test these features are used as an input to the health monitoring methods to evaluate their performance the performance of the three methods are shown in table 11 the proposed rbf is validated with very good success rate however the success rate of the conventional rbf and fuzzy methods are not acceptable 6 conclusions this work has focused on the modeling and diagnosis of the mooring lines by considering the effects of uncertainties in the modeling the modeling process was developed by ssp that takes into consideration the uncertain parameters in the model therefore all of the material boundary and measurement uncertainties because of environmental forces hydrodynamic effects uncertainties in floating offshore and etc were considered in the model among the different methods for the diagnosis a new architecture of rbf was designed and proposed to solve the problems of conventional one unlike the other diagnosis methods the proposed rbf was able to diagnose low and moderate faults moreover the proposed rbf was able to learn the non linear behavior of the system finally the modeling and diagnosis methods were validated experimentally the results show that the proposed method has obvious advantages compared with other well known methods one of the important advantages is that the proposed method has been 65 percent higher performance than the fuzzy method and the proposed new design of rbf has been 13 percent higher performance than the conventional one also the proposed approach is robust to the measurement noise correspondingly an increase in noise level causes a 10 percent decrease in the success rate furthermore this method is based on the mooring behavior by

components in the offshore structures such as tlp floating vessels and wind turbines therefore many academic researchers are interested in studying the mooring static and dynamic behavior moreover because of the applied strong forces in the floating structures due to initial tensions and sea waves the early diagnosis of mooring lines plays a crucial role in safe operation of these structures the studies of the damage process in the mooring lines are based on different parameters such as fatigue rate analysis ma et al 2013 strength capacity of a mooring system brindley and comley 2014 fatigue damage philipp et al 2014 tension and durability of mooring lines christopher et al 2000 banfield et al 2005 ridge 2006 and the failure risk of the mooring lines based on extended period environmental loads huang and pan 2010 thus due to possible damages of mooring system monitoring and maintaining should be performed according to the above mentioned parameters one of the most common diagnosis methods in this field is based on fuzzy logic mentesismail 2011 jahangiri et al 2016 jamalkia et al 2016 despite the many advantages of the fuzzy method in identifying severe damages this method is not very successful in identifying the small and moderate damages another method for diagnosis is based on fault tolerant control fang et al 2015 in control methods fault diagnosis is possible by using vibration signals and structural reliability index this type of diagnosis cannot be used in the floating structures with moving parts such as wind turbines because in these structures identification of defects in the moving parts of the turbine and mooring lines from each other is impossible the most powerful methods for the diagnosis of the mooring systems are based on the computer simulation in the field of the mooring line modeling the fem is suggested as more accurate method similarly a significant research in the modeling with fem is suggested by reference tahar and kim 2008 in mentioned research by introducing shape functions and suitable numerical method for the solution the weak formulations for applying the fem technique are written it should be noted that the uncertainty should be considered for accurate modeling of the mooring lines therefore one of the most important steps in damage diagnosing of the mooring lines is applying the uncertainty in modeling of the mooring system vazquez hernandez et al 2006 zhang and gilbert 2006 montes iturrizaga et al 2007 in this paper firstly ssp is employed to apply boundary conditions uncertainty in modeling furthermore ssp is used to avoid large computational costs and round off errors secondly a new design of artificial neural networks anns is proposed for health monitoring of the mooring lines selection of the proper ann for specific case study is based on the input data of the ann in rbf networks a vector distance is calculated directly euclidean distance so rbf has more accurate results than the vector inner product which is used in other anns the main disadvantage of conventional rbf is the limitation of the number of input data for training the ann subsequently the proposed new architecture of rbf is designed for solving the problems of conventional one the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we start with modeling of the mooring systems by using the rod theory fem and ssp and then the proposed modeling is validated experimentally section 3 describes the uncertainties and damage classification of the considered case study section 4 presents the new architecture of rbf the achievable performance of proposed method and other methods are investigated in section 5 the conclusion of this paper is presented in section 6 2 modeling of mooring lines to mitigate the motion of the floating structures mooring lines with different materials have been used in offshore industry a steel wire rope with chains at both ends has been installed for spar platform in deep water also taut vertical mooring lines and tethers composed of several vertical steel pipes are intended to be installed in the tlp nowadays synthetic mooring lines made of polyester are considered as a more efficient solution these types of mooring lines are applied in the floating structures in very deep water over 6000 ft young bok 2003 in this section the static deflection of the polyester rope and the line tension are obtained by using the catenary equations in the catenary equations hydrodynamic forces on the line are not considered however for consideration of hydrodynamic effects on the line the boundary and measurement uncertainties are used further the strain and stress of the rope with geometric nonlinearity are solved with the beam theory using the updated lagrangian approach for this purpose the tensioned string theory is applied in this theory the string is modeled by using beam elements where it is called the elastic rod theory tahar and kim 2008 which is based on the formula derived by nordgren and garret nordgren 1974 garrett 1982 2 1 rod theory the behavior of a slender rod can be expressed in terms of the variation of the rod position a position vector r s t is the function of the rod arc length s and time t the equations 1 and 2 are the fundamental equations of motion for the elastic rod applied to the fem formulation young bok

is the weight of the rod per unit length t is the effective tension in the rod and w is the effective weight or the wet weight of the rod prime denotes the derivative with respect to arc length s and the dot denotes the time derivative also f s is the hydrostatic force on the rod which is defined as follows 4 f s b p r where b is the buoyancy force on the rod per unit length and p is the hydrostatic pressure at the point r on the rod 2 2 finite element method as described in previous part of this section the application of the fem is started on the equation 2 and following equation 5 1 2 r r 1 λ a e 0 the unknown variable r and λ can be approximated as 6 r s t a l s u i l t 7 λ s t p m s λ m t where 0 s l a l and p m are cubic and quadratic shape functions respectively also u i l and λ m are the unknown coefficients the weak formulations of the fem technique are written by multiplying the weighting function δ r i and δ λ as follows 8 0 l δ r i ρ r e i r λ r w d s 0 9 0 l δ λ 1

function is defined as follows 12 δ r i a l δ u i l δ λ p m δ λ m now the equations 8 and 9 can be expanded in terms and the partial integrations are applied to each term finally the equations can be rewritten in a matrix form as follows 13 m i j l k u j k k i j l k 1 λ n k n i j l k 2 u j k f i l 0 14 g m a m i l u k l u k i b m c m n λ n 0 where 15 m i j l k ρ a l a k δ i j d s 16 k i j l k 1 0

unknown displacements and forces 38 δ q f k f f 1 f 0 k f s δ q 0 39 f s k s f δ q f k s s δ q 0 the size of the assembled stiffness matrix is 15 and the total number of equations is n 1 8 1 where n is the number of the element for a line correspondingly the stiffness matrix is symmetric and banded matrix it should be noted that equations 38 and 39 provide the means to calculate directly the unknown variables in the equation 34 then the round off error is removed from the modeling by using ssp instead of the iterative methods consequently more accurate modeling is obtained and the computation time is reduced furthermore this procedure is used to apply boundary conditions uncertainty in modeling in this study a quasi static process is used for coupled analysis of integrated platform and mooring system therefore the motion of the body is analyzed first and then in the post processing the short term performance quasi static of the mooring lines and risers are solved with the motions of the end nodes that are assumed to be the same amount as the body motion 2 4 model verification and validation the validation of the applied model is presented in this section for this purpose the results of the proposed modeling are compared to the literature data equation of elastic curve beer et al 2002 likewise an experimental test is provided to extract the behavior of a real rope in the laboratory scale then the results of experimental test are compared with the results of the proposed modeling 2 4 1 validation with reference equations in this part of section the applied forces on the rope are assumed to be uniformly distributed rope weight and concentrated load at the center also the main particulars of the rope are given in the table 1 the results of the comparisons are illustrated in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the results of both models are very close to each other thus the difference between the results is negligible in addition the results obtained from this test are shown in table 2 as it is clear from table 2 the difference of the deflection between the proposed and reference models at the critical point of the rope mid point is very low 2 4 2 validation with experimental test in this part of section the deflection of a real rope is measured experimentally in the first experimental test the applied force on the rope is considered uniformly distributed rope weight equally the boundary conditions are simply supported as shown in fig 2 the main particulars of the rope are given in table 3 the second experimental test is implemented in a water aquarium as shown in fig 3 the applied forces on the rope are the weight and buoyancy forces additionally the boundary conditions are simply supported the deviation of rope deflection obtained by the proposed model and experimental tests in air and water are shown in table 4 as shown in the table 4 the deviation of experimental deflection are very low so the proposed model is validated further the result of experiments shows that the proposed modeling method is able to apply on different cases in the air and water 3 damage classification of the mooring lines there are many studies to classify different faults in the mooring lines this paper applies an approach to classify the levels and locations of different damage damage classes at the beginning of this section the uncertainties in the mooring system should be defined then the fault classification will be described in the second part of this section 3 1 uncertainties in this research the material uncertainty is considered to be related to the young s modulus of the rope this type of uncertainty is assumed as normal distribution with the standard deviation of 0 01 moreover in all of the mooring systems in literature the boundary conditions are assumed fixed however in a real case study this assumption is impossible actually there is considerable fluctuation in boundary conditions because of floating structures nature effects of wave current and wind on the structure and consequently on the mooring lines for that reason in this research boundary conditions uncertainties are considered by variation of the joint position of the mooring lines which is connected to the floating structure fairlead it should be noted that the ranges of uncertainties are estimated by having more detailed information about the case study and its environmental conditions wind wave current hydrodynamic effects and etc in the present case study the uncertainties of the boundary conditions are performed using monte carlo simulation in the range of 10 10 cm further an uncertainty is considered in the measurement system this uncertainty is because of the noise and measurement error although mentioned uncertainty is minimized recently with the progress of technology and measurement equipment however considering this uncertainty is necessary for the exact diagnosis of small damages the following equation is used for adding measurement uncertainty to the extracted features chandrashekhar and ganguli 2009 40 f n o i s e y f n e t 1 u α where f n e t is the extracted features nodes locations of the proposed model u is a random number in the interval 0 01 0 01 and α is a noise level parameter the noise level parameter α defines the maximum variance between the extracted features and noisy features it should be noted that each damage detection project has its own noise level parameters which can be considered based on the provided guidelines by sensor and measurement equipment manufactures it should be added that in some damage identification and health monitoring methods the hydrodynamic effects are taken into account as uncertain parameters liu et al 2011 thus in this research the hydrodynamic effects wind current and wave and vessel motions are considered by boundary and measurement uncertainties these uncertainties are performed by variation of the nodes location using monte carlo simulation 3 2 mooring system damages in this study the damage in mooring line is represented by reduction in the stiffness young s modulus these damages are classified based on defined ranges as slight damage 2 10 reduction moderate damage 11 20 reduction and severe damage 21 30 reduction fig 4 illustrates the lower and upper limits of a rope by considering above mentioned damage modes and material uncertainty also the main particulars of the rope are presented in table 1 as it is expected increase in fault level of the rope causes an increase in the deflection fig 4 now the upper and lower limits of the mooring lines of a floating structure obtained by proposed modeling method is shown in fig 5 the main particulars of the mooring system are given in table 5 it should be noted that the figs 4 and 5 are considered to better illustrate the upper and lower limits of mooring motion for different levels of damage so damages in these figures are considered globally however the classification of data which is used in damage diagnosis is based on the local damage fig 5 shows the total distance of the upper and lower limits of mooring motion the mooring line shape is obtained by proposed simulation model subsequently the diagnosis of these structures is based on the shape of the mooring deflection z coordinate of the mooring line the mooring line is divided into five uniform segments of equal lengths labeled as root inboard center outboard and tip this type of representation of structural damage along various locations is useful to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis the mean and standard deviation of the features are presented in table 6 consequently the damage classes of the mooring system are defined as follows damage classes class 1 undamaged class 2 slight damage at root class 3 slight damage at inboard class 4 slight damage at center class 5 slight damage at outboard class 6 slight damage at tip class 7 moderate damage at root class 8 moderate damage at inboard class 9 moderate damage at center class 10 moderate damage at outboard class 11 moderate damage at tip class 12 severe damage at root class 13 severe damage at inboard class 14 severe damage at center class 15 severe damage at outboard class 16 severe damage at tip one of the basic problems in damage diagnosis is overlapping in damage classes of the mooring lines following probability distribution is used to specify the overlapping problem of the damage classes for this case study table 6 41 μ x 1 2 π σ e 0 5 x m σ 2 where m is midpoint of each class and σ is the spread standard deviation associated with the variable fig 6 shows the overlapping of the damage classes using the probability distribution as it is clear the overlap of the damage classes is very high therefore the diagnosis method for this case study must have the ability to recognize the overlapping such as shown in fig 6 4 neural network design for health monitoring intelligent fault diagnosis methods should be applied to solve the problems such as overlapping of the classes and uncertainties in modeling thus in this work ann is recognized as a powerful method for fault diagnosis among different ann models rbf is widely used to recognize the nonlinear multi dimensional classes it should be noted the main disadvantage of rbf is the limitation of the number of input data for training the ann consequently in this paper a new architecture of rbf is designed to solve the limitation problem accordingly a novel rbf is presented to improve the accuracy of the fault diagnosis 4 1 radial basis network architecture rbf networks with a sufficient number of neurons in the hidden layer are able to approximate any continuous function and classify the nonlinear behavior of mooring lines lowe 1989 rbf network fig 7 has been inspired based on statistical classification techniques also rbf is a universal approximator and can be used for function approximation or pattern recognition park and sandberg 1993 consequently in rbf network a set of weights can be found to approximate the relationship between input and target vectors better than any other functions broomhead and lowe 1988 another advantage of the rbf is using euclidean distance direct calculation of vectors distance instead of the matrix multiplication inner product between the weights and the input in rbf the net input to the radial basis transfer function is the vector distance between its weight vector w and the input vector p multiplied by the bias b furthermore the output value of the rbf is maximum when its input is 0 in other words if the distance between w and p decreases the output increases thus a radial basis radbas neuron acts as a detector that produces 1 maximum whenever the input p is identical to its weight vector w among different types of networks probabilistic anns can be used for classification problems when an input is presented the first layer computes distances from the input vector to the training input vectors and produces a vector whose elements indicate how close the input is to a training input the second layer sums these contributions for each class of inputs to produce a vector of probabilities as its net output finally a competitive transfer function on the output of the second layer picks the maximum of these probabilities and produces a 1 for that class and a 0 for the other classes the architecture of conventional rbf is shown in fig 8 demuth et al 2012 ch 8 in fig 8 i w is the first layer weight l w is the second layer weight b 1 is the first layer bias a 1 is the first layer output a 2 is the second layer output r is the number of elements in input vector it is assumed that there are q input vector target pairs each target vector has k elements and one of these elements is 1 and the remaining ones are 0 thus each input vector is associated with one of the k classes now a proposed new architecture of rbf is presented in fig 9 where s 1 is the number of neurons in layer 1 and s 2 is the number of neurons in layer 2 as shown in fig 9 in the proposed rbf the first layer has a gaussian function and the second layer has a linear and competitive function training and implementation of proposed rbf are described as follows 4 2 training first layer the first layer weights of the rbf is trained to perform a clustering of vectors using the kohonen learning rule as follows hagan et al 2014 42 w i 1 q w i 1 q 1 α p q w i 1 q 1 where p q is one of the input vectors in the training set and w i 1 q 1 is the closest weight vector to p q in addition to selecting the first layer weights the clustering process can provide us with a method for determining the first layer biases for each radbas neuron the n c input vectors are located from the training set that are closest to the corresponding weight vector center then the average distance is computed between the center and its neighbors as follows 43 d i s t i 1 n c j 1 n c p j i w i 1 2 1 2 where p 1 i is the input vector that is closest to w i 1 and p 2 i is the next closest input vector from these distances the first layer biases are set as follows 44 b i 1 1 2 d i s t i therefore when a cluster is wide the corresponding radbas neuron will be wide as well it should be noted that in this case each bias in the first layer can be different 4 3 training second layer after the training of the first layer weights and biases linear least squares is used to find the second layer weights and biases once the first layer parameters have been set the training of the second layer weights and biases is equivalent to training a linear ann each target vector t q has k rows and one of these rows is 10 and the remaining ones are zero it should be noted that a q 1 is qth input vector of the second layer consequently there are q pairs of input and target vector for training the training data set for the second layer is given by 45 a 1 1 t 1 a 2 1 t 2 a q 1 t q additionally the second layer response is linear as follows 46 a 2 w 2 a 1 b 2 in this layer the weights and biases are selected to minimize the sum square error performance index over the training set as follows 47 f x q 1 q t q a q 2 t t q a q 2 4 4 network implementation in this research matlab is used for implementation of the proposed network a two layer ann is considered to design the proposed rbf the first layer has radbas neurons and its weighted matrix is calculated with euclidean distance weight function d i s t the second layer has linear and competitive transfer function neurons and its weighted matrix is calculated with dot product weight function also its net inputs are calculated with sum net input function as shown in fig 9 both mentioned layers have biases it should be added that the proposed rbf iteratively creates a neuron at each iteration epoch neurons are added to the network until the sum squared error falls beneath an error goal or a maximum number of neurons have been reached the steps in the implementation of the proposed rbf are described as follows a initially the number of hidden layer neurons radial basis is equal to zero b the error rate of the output layer is given as a sum squared error goal c the network is run d the number of hidden layer neurons increase in each epoch equal to 1 by default e the first layer weights are trained by kohonen learning rule as mentioned in section 4 2 f the second layer weights are redesigned to minimize error as mentioned in section 4 3 g the error of the new network is checked and if error is more than goal the process should be back to the step d h the abovementioned steps are repeated until the network s sum squared error falls beneath an error goal i the training process of ann is completed j the output vector of the linear transfer function is used as the input vector to the competitive transfer function k finally output vector of ann has a value of 1 only in the row associated with that particular class of input vector and the remaining rows are 0 the flowchart of the proposed modeling and diagnosis process is illustrated in fig 10 5 results and discussion in this section the test results of health monitoring based on proposed new rbf will be discussed and compared with results of other existing methods therefore the results of two tests are presented which one of these tests is based on the simulation model and other one is experimental test 5 1 simulation model the training data are obtained by simulation model with material and boundary condition uncertainties additionally these data are classified according to the mentioned damage classes table 6 the input vectors have 11 rows associated with the z coordinate of the mooring at 11 nodes with equal distance between them also each target vector has 16 rows which one of these rows has a numerical value of 10 and the remaining ones have a numerical value of 0 the sum of squared errors during training process is illustrated in fig 11 as illustrated in fig 11 the error is reduced by increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer at each iteration also when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reach to 313 the sum of squared errors converge to defined value goal 0 08 thus the training is stopped table 7 shows the success rate of the proposed rbf and conventional one from table 7 it is observed that the results of the conventional rbf just for some classes are acceptable but the results of the proposed rbf has the highest percentage of success rate in each damage class consequently the proposed rbf has 13 average success rate higher than conventional one conventional rbf is unable to detect the lower damage level overlapping damage classes moreover the success rate of conventional rbf in fairlead damage in the tip segment is low as it is expected the main factor of this reduction is the boundary condition uncertainty because conventional rbf is unable to isolate the boundary uncertainty in other words the proposed rbf has a higher success rate in fairlead because of high ability to isolate the uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the mooring lines table 8 shows the success rate of the proposed rbf and fuzzy based methods it should be noted that the first fuzzy method uses the mean and standard deviation of five points in the rope five input features and the second one applies 14 points from table 8 it is observed that both of the fuzzy based methods have very low success rate the main reasons of this problem are the uncertainties overlapping damage classes and nonlinear behavior of the mooring lines the addition of noise to the simulations is needed to examine the robustness of the diagnosis method under noisy conditions therefore the proposed rbf is tested using the noisy data as mentioned in section 3 1 table 9 shows the success rates for proposed rbf at various noise levels as it is expected with increasing the level of the measurement noise the average success rate is decreased damage classes with low damage and tip segments fairlead are more sensitive classes to the noise in addition the greatest reduction of success rate is related to the undamaged class healthy because of narrow lower and upper limits as shown in fig 4 in other words when the motion range of the mooring is considered very small because of small range of stiffness reduction in undamaged class the high measurement noise causes a reduction of success rate the easy way to solve this problem is considering a little wider range of simulated motion in the undamaged class widening the range of stiffness reduction 5 2 experimental model in this part an experimental test is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a real case the main particulars of the rope used in this case are given in table 3 in this case the mooring line is divided into four uniform segments of equal lengths labeled as root inboard outboard and tip the structural damages in each segment are classified as slight moderate and severe damage sizes below slight damage are classified as undamaged further training data are classified according to the mentioned damage levels and locations 13 damage classes thus each target vector has 13 rows which one of these rows has a numerical value of 0 5 and the remaining ones have a numerical value of 0 the input vectors have five rows associated with the z coordinate of the rope at five nodes with equal distance between them the sum of squared errors during training process is illustrated in fig 12 as illustrated in fig 12 when the number of neurons in the hidden layer reaches to 86 the sum of squared errors converges to defined value goal 0 001 thus the training is stopped the damage is created by using uniform cross sectional cutting on the healthy segment as depicted in fig 13 slight a cross sectional cutting in each 5 cm along the length of the segment moderate a cross sectional cutting in each 2 5 cm along the length of the segment and severe a cross sectional cutting in each 1 cm along the length of the segment it should be noted that coordinates of the nodes of the elements are obtained from image processing table 10 presents the coordinates of the nodes of the elements that are obtained from experimental test these features are used as an input to the health monitoring methods to evaluate their performance the performance of the three methods are shown in table 11 the proposed rbf is validated with very good success rate however the success rate of the conventional rbf and fuzzy methods are not acceptable 6 conclusions this work has focused on the modeling and diagnosis of the mooring lines by considering the effects of uncertainties in the modeling the modeling process was developed by ssp that takes into consideration the uncertain parameters in the model therefore all of the material boundary and measurement uncertainties because of environmental forces hydrodynamic effects uncertainties in floating offshore and etc were considered in the model among the different methods for the diagnosis a new architecture of rbf was designed and proposed to solve the problems of conventional one unlike the other diagnosis methods the proposed rbf was able to diagnose low and moderate faults moreover the proposed rbf was able to learn the non linear behavior of the system finally the modeling and diagnosis methods were validated experimentally the results show that the proposed method has obvious advantages compared with other well known methods one of the important advantages is that the proposed method has been 65 percent higher performance than the fuzzy method and the proposed new design of rbf has been 13 percent higher performance than the conventional one also the proposed approach is robust to the measurement noise correspondingly an increase in noise level causes a 10 percent decrease in the success rate furthermore this method is based on the mooring behavior by considering the floating structure motion as uncertainties on boundary conditions as a result unlike some other diagnosis methods it can be used in all types of floating offshore structures such as floating wind turbine furthermore present study has demonstrated the modeling and health monitoring method of mooring lines and thus will help researchers and engineers to develop the treatment of more realistic conditions by considering irregular waves in future works 
23189,in this work we present the inter comparison of wave hindcasts using third generation models wam and wavewatch wwiii for the north indian ocean at a 1 1 lat long grid resolutions and we show a first assessment of their relative performance by inter comparing the model results to observational data at selected points in the arabian sea and bay of bengal wam and wwiii inter comparison studies are carried out for the year 2000 and for the period june 2008 to june 2009 overall the inter comparison shows that both wave models are rather skillful in predicting the integral wave parameters with lesser pe of the range 8 9 26 7 using wam than wwiii it is also quite evident that the wwiii model has a tendency to overestimate mean wave periods while the opposite is true for wam model further the validation results using altimeter measurements are quite promising in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the study further suggests that it would be wise to use long term measurements both in deep and coastal waters of north indian ocean to validate and inter compare wam and wwiii further and they may also be coupled with swan for the nearshore waters keywords wam wwiii sea state prediction wave model inter comparisons era 40 blended winds 1 introduction the wind induced surface gravity waves in the ocean are important in the air sea interaction process of the coupled ocean atmosphere system the knowledge of the ocean waves and their temporal and spatial variabilities are essential for various defence as well as civilian applications swain 1997 richard et al 2002 umesh et al 2007 the ocean as such is a dynamic system where there are a number of processes which take place simultaneously so that it becomes too complex to predict them however our understanding of the ocean environment is constantly improving which enables us to predict its variability well in advance forecasting surface waves in the ocean is a problem of great practical interest as the sea state conditions influence virtually all most all aspects of naval operations at sea as well as a variety of commercial and maritime activities for example accurate ocean wave forecasting is a key prerequisite for enabling optimum tracking of ship routes and ensuring the safety of lives and property at sea onboard various fixed and floating platforms thus ocean wave forecasting has been a priority for all research and maritime organizations those who have pioneered the application of operational ocean wave models dating all the way back to the 1960s considering the variety of applications of sea state as mentioned above accurate and extended wave information including waves of extreme weather events is very essential for a wide range of research and engineering applications wave statistics derived from point measurements were considered for obtaining reliable local wave climate in the past however these measurements are not sufficient to describe the regional wave patterns over a long period of time this emphasizes the need to work on wave models driven by wind fields obtained from satellites measurements or and models the present day third generation wave models are capable of predicting the waves reasonably well and their accuracies can be still improved with appropriate representation of extremely complex physical processes of wind generated waves vledder 2001 polnikov et al 2007 the scientific community has developed a series of models called as third generation wave models such as wam wave modeling wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii wwiii tolman 2009 tolman et al 2002 and swan model simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 and ris et al 1999 which are being widely applied for global as well as regional ocean state forecasts up to the nearshore zone the components of source function are used without any prior restrictions on the spectral shape tolman and chalikov 1996 the shallow water or nearshore wave model swan swamp 1985 has been designed specifically for coastal wave prediction and it is utilized at several coastal regions around the world the state of the art and the prospects for improvement of wave models can be found in holthuijsen 2007 the wise group 2007 and komen et al 1994 like many other geophysical phenomena waves can be studied on very different space and temporal time scales lavrenov 2003 sea state belongs to large scales and it is mainly related to the processes of wind momentum transfer nonlinear transfer current refraction and turbulent dissipation of energy as the waves move toward shoreline other physical processes become important viz refraction induced by sudden variations in depth or by coastal currents and shoaling since the forcing become increasingly dependent on regional currents and local variations in bathymetry the scale of the problem becomes smaller in most situations the two types of waves can still be analyzed within the framework of the same theory as a result a third generation wave model like wam which efficiently solves the kinetic equation and the source functions in order to give global and regional forecasts can be combined with other nearshore wave models like swan that are more oriented towards propagation on the coastal scale we refer to komen et al 1994 and janssen 2008 for a complete description of wam and to booij et al 1999 and the swan team 2011 for information on swan recent advances in the availability of computer power it has become feasible to use chains of numerical models in order to connect the wave propagation from the large to the regional coastal scales the resulting system might provide not only large scale wave forecasts based on synoptic scale wind and satellite data assimilation but also a realistic ongoing description of the coastal waves in smaller regional areas with the increasing demand for modernization there is equally an increasing demand to forecast ocean waves rusu 2011 in open sea and coastal areas to aid marine applications many users and the scientific community depend on nowcasts and ocean state forecasts for marine related operations balakrishnan nair et al 2013 2014 and sandhya et al 2014 wave modeling studies for the north indian ocean using wam wwiii and swan have been carried by several researchers such as sabique et al 2012 nayak et al 2013 amrutha et al 2016 wave model inter comparison studies have been reported across the globe by various researchers till date tolman et al 2002 padilla hernandez et al 2007 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 hanson et al 2009 korres et al 2011 a systematic inter comparison of wam cycle 4 and wwiii wave model results has been reported for the mediterranean region by korres et al 2011 the inter comparison of the two wave models over the whole mediterranean basin showed that noticeable differences in terms of significant wave height hs and periods significant wave height rms differences of 0 5 0 7 m and wave period rms differences of 1 5 2 0s was seen along the track of the main cyclones over the basin where the swell contribution to the wave field was important in the geographic areas of the mediterranean sea where wind seas dominate the two models exhibit almost the same performance inter comparison of swan and wwiii with buoy observations was carried out by ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 the study tested the applicability of the swan model at oceanic scales although comparison between buoy observations and model outputs tend to favor wwiii over swan in deep waters it was stressed that the ease of using swan together with the simplification offered by just having to learn to use one model makes the swan model a good option for simulations all the way from deep waters up to the nearshore hanson et al 2009 evaluated the performance of three numerical wave models wam cycle 4 5 wwiii and wavad in the pacific basin the three models exhibited varied performance in the depiction of wind sea and young swells in their physical attributes wwiii hindcasts exhibited consistently higher performance scores than those from wam and wavad the prediction of mature swells in the winter months with elevated height errors in all three models was a noteworthy problem in another study three state of the art operational forecast wave models wam wwiii and swan were compared through simulations padilla hernandez et al 2007 of two severe winter storms in the northwest atlantic model performances were also evaluated through comparisons validations with field measurements the results revealed that although the models are comparable in terms of their overall performance and skill it was found that wwiii provides padilla hernandez et al 2007 a better statistical fit to the observed wave data compared with the other models and that swan gives slightly better results if nested within wwiii rather than within wam tolman et al 2002 reported that for japan the gulf of mexico and the nw atlantic nww3 noaa ww3 appears to be significantly better than wam primarily based on the regression slopes for the ne pacific and atlantic nww3 has much better correlation coefficients and smaller standard deviations and rms errors than wam however nww3 overestimates the slope of the regression line by 16 whereas wam underestimates the slope by a much smaller region a long term inter comparison of model computed wave parameters for the north indian ocean region is however missing the novelty of this work is the inter comparison of two modeling systems viz wam and wwiii to suggest the suitability and capabilities for their future utilization and exploitation in predicting the sea state information required for various practical applications in an operational scenario to verify the efficiency of model computed parameters systematic validation studies with long term observational data is an essential pre requisite to improve the prediction capability and enhancement of wave model performances the inter companion study gives reasonably good results with low rms error and high correlation coefficients the present study is going to be the first but initial attempt to inter compare each of the models such as wam c4 5 3 and wwiii v3 14 for the north indian ocean nio region by conducting a few carefully chosen case studies for selected years to project its usefulness on sea state information 2 composition of the modeling system the state of the art third generation wave prediction models evolved initially with the development of wam followed by wwiii and coastal wave model swan however the modeling system architecture employed here is comprised of wam and wwiii both these models are used in many operational centers worldwide for routine sea state forecasts 2 1 wam cycle 4 5 3 the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation describing the two dimensional wave spectrum in the following way 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x and time t and deep water group velocity c g c g f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and shifting of energy and the equation is valid for deep water with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerical approaches are kept in the new release the source function integration scheme adopted by hersbach and janssen 1999 and the its updates bidlot et al 2005 have been incorporated a number of additional options are also added in the new model release of wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method in wam 4 5 3 is semi implicit and it is based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function computed with the spectrum at time n and the wind speed at n 1 g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction during transition between wind sea and swell this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also necessary to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 in this study wam is implemented globally a well as regionally for the north indian ocean nio 2 2 wavewatch iii v3 14 as that of wam the wavewatch iii wave model version 3 14 used here in this investigation is also in global as well as regional implementation for nio wwiii is a wam type ocean surface wave model developed at noaa ncep tolman and chalikov 1996 tolman 2009 it has been successfully applied in global and regional scale studies in many areas including the north atlantic and has proven to be an effective tool to study wave spectral evaluation air sea interactions and nonlinear wave wave interactions wwiii is a discrete spectral and phase averaged wave model battjes 1994 for regional and global applications the directional wave spectrum is resolved at each model grid point in terms of wave number direction bands and the evolution of the wave field is found by numerically solving the spectral wave action balance equation which is usually written as 3 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave propagation direction k is wave number t is time σ is the intrinsic angular frequency wwiii evaluates the balance equation for the wave action spectrum n k θ x t which is usually expressed in spherical coordinates komen et al 1994 the derivatives in 2 are the propagation velocities in physical and spectral domains 4 φ c g cos θ u φ r λ c g sin θ u λ r cos φ θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where r is the radius of the earth and uφ and uλ are current components in φ and λ directions the left side of equation 2 represents the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variation in depth and current the net source term s consists of wind input s in white capping dissipation s ds nonlinear wave wave interactions s nl and bottom friction s bot ww3 uses an explicit scheme to solve the action balance equation 2 for n 3 data used 3 1 wind forcing for the model the sensitivity of waves to the quality of winds was confirmed by janssen 1998 who showed that random wind speed errors dominate the forecast wave height errors even after 48 h forecast further it has been shown in the tropics where sea state is dominated by swell quality of wave model outputs depend on the quality of the wind field in the extratropics where swells are generated janssen 2000 wave models are thus extremely sensitive to details of the input wind and a high quality winds only reproduce the real wave climate a high quality analyzed wind fields provided by ecmwf era 40 and blended winds such as quikscat ncep winds was used in the present study ecmwf janssen et al 1997 cavaleri and bertotti 2004 2006 caires and sterl 2005 ardhuin et al 2007 brenner et al 2007 moeini et al 2010 and quikscat ncep milliff et al 2004 li et al 2006 wu and chiang 2007 are the most commonly used wind fields in wave modeling studies ecmwf 40 year reanalysis era 40 is a reanalysis of meteorological observations from september 1957 to august 2002 45 years released by ecmwf uppala et al 2005 sterl and caires 2005 caires et al 2005 one of the products of era 40 consists of 6 hourly global fields of wind speed at 10 metres height u10 with a 1 5 1 5 grid resolution besides atmospheric variables it also includes wave parameters era 40 was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system and a three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme 3dvar observations of ocean wind speeds from voluntary observing ship vos buoys and satellite scatterometer were assimilated in the reanalysis process in this study the wind speed and the stresses τx and τy for the year 2000 was extracted from era 40 and the same was used to estimate wind direction and the winds were further interpolated to 1 1 grid resolution the processed six hourly winds for the period january to december 2000 were then used to force the wave models wam wwiii for the globe and nio quikscat ncep blended ocean winds from colorado research associates version 5 0 covers from july 1999 to july 2009 6 hourly with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 latitude longitude quikscat ncep blended wind products were derived through a spatial blending of the high resolution scatterometer quikscat wind observations with the ncep ncar reanalysis winds chin et al 1998 milliff et al 1999 the ncep ncar analysis fields are the products of the ncep climate data assimilation system cdas which was an operational system developed for the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 the quikscat ncep blended wind field contains the high wavenumber spatial information from quikscat measurements the blending scheme retains the quikscat wind measurements in its swath regions and enhances the ncep ncar fields in quikscat sampling gaps through imposition of high wavenumber content that is based on monthly local quikscat statistics quikscat ncep blended winds six hourly for the period june 2008 to june 2009 have been interpolated to 1 1 model grid resolution for the purpose of wave hindcasting 3 2 wave data in the indian ocean region several deep sea and shallow water moored buoys buoy type discus have been deployed by the national institute of ocean technology chennai since 1997 premkumar et al 2000 under the national data buoy program ndbp to measure several near surface meteorological and oceanic variables jossia et al 2010a 2010b the buoys are equipped with global positioning system beacon light and satellite transceiver these buoys are operable from 20 m water depths to full ocean depth excepting a few buoys which function in slightly lower depths the sensor used in the measurement of wave parameters is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the waves are measured in the buoy by a motion reference unit which measures absolute roll pitch yaw and relative heave these data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17min every three hours hence it measures the full spectrum of the waves for 17 min the hs is estimated as four times the square root of the area under the non directional wave spectrum it has an accuracy 10 cm for wave height up to 20 m and 5 for wave direction in this study wave data measured at locations such as ds1 off goa ds2 off lakshadweep sw1 off pipavav port sw4 off mangalore port ds3 off andaman and nicobar ds4 off paradip sw5 off tuticorin port sw6 off chennai port during the year 2000 and ob10 off chidambaram during january 2009 are utilized for the validation of wave model wam wwiii hindcasts the locations of these buoys are shown in fig 1 the details on deployment locations water depth and duration of data are listed in table 1 3 3 satellite altimeter data over the past decade satellite altimetry has become an indispensable tool for observing global ocean waves lefevre and cotton 2001 the data are routinely used in numerical wave prediction

hz and 12 directions constant increment to represent the wave spectra distribution similarly wwiii model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 0412 hz to 0 4056 hz with a logarithmic distribution with increment factor 1 1 and 24 directions constant increment in present study the analyzed wind fields such as era 40 and quikscat ncep blended products have been used for driving the wave models the surface current data required as input for wave models were obtained from the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar database bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the era interim daily fields from ecmwf

and wwiii the pe was 12 for both hs and hsw compared to tm 3 0 5 2 2 april 2000 the inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for nio on 10 april 2000 1200 h is as shown in fig 6 the statistical estimates of inter comparisons between wam and wwiii hs tm and hsw for the month of april 2000 pre monsoon period is shown in tables 3 5 respectively here the hindcast wave

hs and hsw for nio region by wam and wwiii have agreed considerably well during july 2000 compared with january 2000 and april 2000 using era 40 winds this is due to the fact that july being a rough weather season winds will be strong accurately reproduced by a weather prediction model but at the same time for fair weather seasons such as january or april comparatively experiences low wind conditions inaccurately driven by the input winds however wwiii predicted hsw seems to be relatively higher compared to wam in the range 1 7 3 0 m fig 9 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii

of 0 26s and pe of 4 6 between wam and wwiii inter comparison of hsw shows si of 0 02 m and pe of 15 1 the estimates of mpi are 0 97 for hs and tm and 0 98 for hsw which reveal a good agreement between wam and wwiii for nio region the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio ocean for 1 31 october 2000 is shown in fig 11 the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 98 0 98 and 0 97 respectively the comparisons for hs predicted by both models for nio reveals bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 05 m and pe of 16 5 similarly the comparison for tm shows si of 0 02 rmse of 0 22s and pe of 4 7 which reveal a very good agreement between both the models hsw varied from 0 1 to 3 0 m in the nio during october 2000 with si of 0 04 and bias of 0 19 m the rmse for hsw is 0 05 m and pe is 17 1 the value of mpi is same 0 98 for hs and tm and 0 96 for hsw which indicate a very good agreement between wam and wwiii in this case pe deviation is higher for both hs 16 5 and hsw 17 1 compared to tm 4 7 5 3 inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcasts using quikscat ncep blended winds in this study inter comparisons have been carried out for wam and wwiii using quikscat ncep blended winds for the period june 2008 to june 2009 and the inter comparison for selected months such as july 2008 and january 2009 representing the rough weather and fair weather seasons is only presented in the following discussions 5 3 1 july 2008 the scatter plots of wam and wwiii hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw for a selected day as well as for the month july 2008 1st to 31st are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively tables 3 5 shows the statistical estimates of the inter comparison between wam and wwiii hs tm and hsw during july 2008 fig 12 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters in the nio region for 10 july 2008 1200 h using quikscat ncep blended winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio show very high correlations of 0 99 0 99 and 0 98 respectively however the inter comparisons of hs for the nio reveal si of 0 02 rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 9 6 the hindcast tm mostly varied from 1 9 to 10 8s and reveal bias of 0 23s and pe of 3 5 between wam and wwiii hsw inter comparisons show si of 0 01 m and pe of 8 8 the estimated values of mpi are 0 98 for hs and tm and it is 0 99 for hsw which reveal very good agreement between wam and wwiii the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio region during 1 31 july 2008 using quikscat ncep blended winds is shown in fig 13 the hindcast wave parameters such as hs tm and hsw show strong correlations of 0 97 0 98 and 0 97 respectively between wam and wwiii the inter comparison for hs predicted by both models for the nio region reveals si of 0 01 and pe of 9 3 similarly the comparison for tm show bias of 0 14s rmse of 0 10s and pe of 3 3 which reveal a very good agreement between wam and wwiii hsw varied from 0 1 to 4 6 m in the nio during july 2008 and reveal si of 0 02 and bias of 0 02 m and pe of 9 5 the mpi is 0 98 for hs and hsw and 0 99 for tm which reveals a very strong agreement between wam and wwiii pe values are less than 10 for hs and hsw and about 3 for tm 5 3 2 january 2009 the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio on 10 january 2009 1200 h using quikscat ncep blended winds is shown in fig 14 here the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio reveal strong correlation of 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 respectively on 10 january 2009 1200 h hs varied from 0 1 to 2 4 m tm varied from 1 9 to 11 3s and hsw varied from 0 1 to 2 1 m tables 3 5 the inter comparison of hs predicted for the nio by wam and wwiii shows si of 0 01 and pe of 7 7 similarly comparison between predicted tm by both these models reveal bias of 0 11s rmse of 0 04s and pe of 2 0 in case of hsw bias is 0 08 m rmse is 0 01 m and pe is 6 6 the estimated values of mpi are same i e 0 99 for hs and hsw and 0 98 for tm which suggest very good agreement between the two models in the study region fig 15 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters hs tm and hsw for nio region during january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 97 0 99 and 0 96 respectively the inter comparison of hs between wam and wwiii for the same region reveals bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 10 6 in case of tm si is 0 03 and pe is 3 5 in the same way hsw reveal si of 0 02 bias of 0 12 m and pe 10 0 the value of mpi is 0 98 for hs and 0 97 both for tm and hsw which reveal a strong agreement between the two models wam and wwiii for the month of january 2009 in nio the above inter comparison studies using wam and wwiii for selected months during rough weather and fair weather seasons using er 40 and blended winds revealed sufficient confidence in the models as the model performances reflected fairly good correlation and scatter index in the north indian ocean moreover it is noted that both models gave better performances during rough weather seasons which is associated with the fact that wind fields are quite strong during this periods but at the same time the deviations observed during the fair weather seasons can be attributed to the low winds prevailing during this period january april which can be attributed to inaccurate input winds apart from wind forcing many other factors such as wave model physics numeric and model grid resolution can affect the model performance 5 4 validation of wam wwiii hindcasts using buoy measurements in the indian seas in this study the previous sections 5 2 5 3 attempted to compare the hindcasts from the deep water models wam and wwiii an important aspect in numerical wave prediction is the validation of significant wave parameters which forms an important step in the operational forecasting centers firstly we wanted to see how far the model simulations can be brought very close to the observations for this we have run the model for a complete year covering different seasons and analyzed the wave characteristics of the indian ocean to check the compatibility of the model the study utilized the available buoy data from the arabian sea and bay of bengal to validate the significant wave parameters it is to be noted that buoys with continuous data is only used in the analysis the wam and wwiii simulated hs and tm were compared for the year 2000 at eight moored buoy locations in the indian seas ds1 ds2 sw1 sw4 ds3 ds4 sw5 sw6 and ob10 during january 2009 as shown as shown in fig 1 the statistical estimates for the validation of wam and wwiii with buoy measurements in the arabian sea and bay of bengal during january to december 2000 is shown in table 6 fig 16 a d shows the comparison of simulated wam and wwiii hs with ds1 ds2 sw1 sw4 buoy measurements for the period january to december 2000 in the arabian sea at ds1 buoy location fig 16a the comparison of hs january to december 2000 indicated high correlations r 0 97 with low si 0 18 using wam the negative bias indicated an underestimation b 0 14 m of wave height at the ds1 buoy location at the same location wwiii simulated hs revealed correlations comparatively lower r 0 81 with high si 0 32 and rmse 0 39 m it is noted that both wam and wwiii performed fairly well during the period may to september pre monsoon and southwest monsoon periods while wwiii was seen to overestimate highly during the post monsoon and north east monsoon periods and this can be attributed to the quality of wind inputs and the physics driving the different representation of swell propagations in both the models the pe and mpi using wam were 12 7 and 0 98 while with wwiii it was 19 9 and 0 85 respectively similarly the comparison of hs at the ds2 fig 16b location may to december 2000 revealed correlations of 0 90 and 0 86 using wam and wwiii with pe 15 9 and 20 6 respectively both wam and wwiii underestimated hs at the ds2 location with biases 0 11 m and 0 25 m respectively with a better performance exhibited by wam fig 16c shows the comparison of wam and wwiii simulated hs with the sw1 buoy measurements both wam and wwiii have underestimated the hs for the period july to december 2000 with correlations of 0 81 and 0 73 respectively although the models followed the general trend of hs at the buoy location it could not accurately reproduce all higher hs at the buoy location the pe at the sw1 location is higher 22 6 and 29 9 respectively using wam and wwiii similar is the case at sw2 buoy location fig 16d wherein wam and wwiii demonstrated underestimation of hs with pe 21 5 and 25 3 respectively overall in the arabian sea wam and wwiii could fairly reproduce the hs at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 13 7 22 6 than wwiii 19 9 27 9 the comparisons at the ds1 location using wam were the best in the arabian sea among the four buoys considered in the bay of bengal hs comparisons were carried out at four buoy locations ds3 ds4 sw5 and sw6 respectively fig 17 shows the comparison of model derived hs with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal at the ds3 fig 17a buoy location may to december 2000 wam hs gave a good match with high correlation of 0 95 and pe 11 7 the si is very low 0 11 with rmse 0 15 m it is noted that during may to september 2000 at ds3 buoy location wwiii has underestimated the hs while during september to december 2000 wwiii has overestimated the hs with high si 0 46 and pe 18 4 at the ds4 buoy location fig 17b both wam and wwiii revealed underestimation of hs september to december 2000 with correlation of 0 96 and 0 93 and pe 10 8 and 14 8 respectively the underestimations can possibly be attributed to simplifications like the neglect of atmospheric stratification effects when converting wind speeds to the wind stress fields driving these models fig 17c shows the comparison of wam and wwiii hs with sw5 buoy measurements the wam model over predicts the hs with high si 0 54 high rmse 0 47 m while wwiii shows a fairly good match with slight underestimation b 0 19 m and lower pe 19 5 as compared with wam 24 8 further the comparison fig 17d at sw6 location march to august 2000 revealed correlations of 0 83 and 0 77 using wam and wwiii respectively it is noted that here wam showed slight underestimation b 0 18 m throughout with a pe 17 7 while wwiii equally under predicted and over predicted the hs at the buoy location with pe 23 8 overall in the bay of bengal wam and wwiii shared fairly good performance in simulating hs at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 10 8 23 8 than wwiii 14 8 25 6 the comparisons at the ds3 location using wam were the best in the bay of bengal among the four buoys considered the comparison of model simulated tm with buoy measurements were also executed for the above discussed locations the indian seas in the arabian sea the comparison of tm fig 18 a at the ds1 location january to december 2000 revealed correlations of 0 82 and 0 73 using wam and wwiii respectively the wam model overestimated the tm throughout the year with a pe 19 8 while wwiii also showed overestimations with significant underestimation of tm with a pe 21 4 during may to september 2000 at the ds1 location fig 18b shows the comparison of simulated wam wwiii tm with buoy measurements at the ds2 location for the period may to december 2000 it is noted that wwiii hs is overestimated with b 0 52s and pe 19 8 while a fairly good match is observed with wam having a correlation of 0 88 and pe 13 6 at the sw1 buoy location fig 18c for the period july to december 2000 both wam and wwiii has unpredicted tm with higher deviations exhibited by wwiii b 0 63s the comparison showed correlations 0 8 with pe 16 3 and 22 5 for wam and wwiii respectively further the comparison at sw4 location fig 18d for the period january to october 2000 shows significant overestimation by both models with pe 23 7 and 26 9 respectively overall in the arabian sea wam and wwiii revealed higher deviations in simulating tm at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 13 7 22 6 than wwiii 19 9 27 9 the comparison of tm at the ds2 location using wam were the best and promising in the arabian sea among the four buoys considered the above results are comparable with the results of mike 21 sw wam physics hindcast in the indian ocean for the year 2005 using quikscat blended ecmwf winds which revealed that the model performance was satisfactory with reasonable confidence remya et al 2012 further the model predicted parameters as shown in figs 16 and 17 reveal good match with the observations as reported by several other researchers such as raj kumar et al 2009 samiksha et al 2012 and sannasiraj et al 2014 in the bay of bengal the wam and wwiii tm hindcasts were also validated at four buoy locations fig 19 ds3 ds4 sw5 and sw6 for the period january to december 2000 fig 19a shows the comparison between the ds3 measurements and wam wwiii hindcast tm for may to december 2000 the wam model predicted tm as shown in fig 19a show higher correlation with the observations r 0 95 compared with wwiii r 0 89 it is noted that the wam model could fairly reproduce tm at the buoy location with low si 0 11 and low rmse 0 08s which also show a strong fit between the model and observations at the same time it is observed that wwiii underestimated the tm with si 0 32 and b 0 24s the pe is 8 9 and 16 4 respectively for the simulated tm using wam and wwiii respectively similarly the model predicted tm at ds4 buoy location for the period september to december 2000 as shown in fig 19b shows correlation 0 94 and 0 75 with the observations the values of bias are 0 19s and 0 53s for wam and wwiii respectively indicating slight underestimation and overestimation from the observed values the rmse values are of the order 0 51s for wam tm and 1 06s for wwiii tm which show a weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 12 2 and 21 8 respectively for wam and wwiii which show a higher deviation between the wwiii model and observations hence mpi is 0 95 and 0 77 indicating a good performance by wam and only a moderate performance using wwiii at the buoy location fig 19c shows the comparison between the observed sw5 and predicted tm for the period may to december 2000 the model predicted tm using wam and wwiii as shown in fig 19c reveal lower correlations with the sw5 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 68 and 0 59 for wam and wwiii respectively with si values 0 29 and 0 48 the values of bias are 0 81s and 0 90s respectively for wam and wwiii which reveals significant underestimation by both models the rmse is high such as 0 95s and 1 09s for wam and wwiii respectively which indicate a weak fit between the model and observations pe is 19 7 for wam and 28 8 for wwiii which reveals poor performance of the models with mpi 0 73 and 0 61 the wam and wwiii predicted tm as shown in fig 19d reveal correlations of the order r 0 7 with sw6 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 79 and 0 86 for wam and wwiii respectively with si values 0 71 and 0 48 the bias values are 1 47s and 1 16s for tm respectively as the predicted values are seen to be higher using wam indicating overestimation of hs and underestimation by wwiii the rmse values are also high such as 0 71s and 0 48s which suggests weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 26 7 and 21 6 respectively for wam and wwiii indicating deviations between the model and observations with mpi 0 67 and 0 75 respectively fig 20 shows the comparison between the buoy ob10 off chidambaram and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 january 2009 the estimated model predicted parameters as shown in fig 21 shows strong correlation with the observations the buoy and wam hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 97 and a si of 0 02 estimated bias and rmse are 0 01 m and 0 02 m respectively which reveal a good agreement between the model and observations with pe of 11 1 the mpi is high enough 0 98 indicating that the wam model could simulate hs very well at ob10 location similar comparison is made between buoy ob10 data and model mike 21 sw derived wave heights at one buoy location in bay of bengal ob10 for october 2008 to august 2009 by sabique et al 2012 the comparisons show that the model derived wave parameters agree well with the observed wave parameters the statistics gave a correlation of 0 93 rmse 0 30 bias 0 11 and si 0 19 for hs the wwiii model predicted parameters both hs and tm as shown in fig 20 show significant correlation with the observations the ob10 buoy versus wwiii hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 98 and si of 0 01 estimated bias and rmse are 0 01 m and 0 01 m respectively both revealing a better agreement between the model and observations with pe of 9 0 the mpi is also high enough 0 99 indicating that the model could simulate hs very well at ob10 location samiksha et al 2012 have reported the results of wwiii validation using niot buoy data ds5 for the period january to february 2006 which is located north of ob10 it indicates a satisfactory agreement between the model and buoy hs with the r value of 0 92 using ncep winds in another validation exercise involving a long term wwiii hindcast of 30 year period 1979 2009 using climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr winds of ncep has revealed that b rmse and si varied from 0 97 to 0 90 0 21 to 2 42 and 0 09 to 0 35 respectively between the model hs and the ndbc buoy measurements in the atlantic gulf of mexico buoys and pacific hawaii buoys oceans chawla et al 2013 in the comparisons of tm the results shows reasonably a good correlation r 0 85 between buoy and wam hindcast the si of 0 11 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and wam hindcast hindcast tm shows a considerable bias of 0 49s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 56s 8 7 and 0 89 respectively all of them estimated statistics reveal very good agreement between the model and buoy ob10 observations excepting for few observations as seen from fig 20b tm comparisons by sabique et al 2012 at buoy location in bay of bengal ob10 gave a correlation of 0 67 rmse 1 2s bias 0 81s and si 0 21 tm also show reasonably a better correlation r 0 89 between buoy measurements and wwiii hindcast the si of 0 11 for tm indicates a good fit between the observed and hindcast tm using wwiii the model hindcast and the observed tm show a bias of 0 51s which is within a well acceptable range the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 53s 8 9 and 0 92 respectively therefore all the above estimated statistics reveal a very good overall agreement between the model and buoy ob10 observations excepting for few observations as seen from fig 20 it was evident from both model and observations that there was an overall trend in wave heights showing a reasonable match with buoy observations the deviations can be attributed to the differences in the wind input parameterization in the models which shows varied response to relatively fast changes in wind speed the deviations in hs and tm at the buoy locations can be due to many reasons the quality of the wind forcing is essential for the good performance of the wave model it also determines to a large extent the evolution of the forecast errors janssen 1998 it is known that wave spectral directional spreads have a tendency to be too broad partly due to the limited number of directional bins used by the numerical models an increase in angular resolution has a positive impact on the quality of the modeled waves it also illustrates the benefit of an increase in angular resolution of the discretized wave spectrum the accuracy of swell propagation over large distances in models is critically controlled by angular resolution and hence it is likely that significant improvements can be produced when angular resolution is improved a systematic bias might be present in the wind analysis which in turn could explain some of the analyzed wave height underestimation in deep water models wam wwiii some of these underestimations when linked to local wave growth might in part be explained by this systematic negative bias in analyzed wind speed further the different parametrization of the source terms responsible for the wind input and dissipation in the wave energy balance equation of the wave models is also a major factor another feature noted is that there exits larger deviation in hs and tm at locations sw1 sw4 and sw5 and sw6 it is also to be pointed out that wam and wwiii are global deep water models which can predict waves accurately up to 30 m water depth since they include crude shallow water equations which does not satisfy nearshore wave transformations hence it provides poor correlation for shallow water waves however the deep water hindcasts have been compared with the buoy observations at 16 24 m in the absence of measurements at preferable locations where water depth is more than 30 m it was seen in most cases the pe values were greater than 20 excepting in few cases where it was lower it may be noted that sw1 sw4 sw5 and sw6 are shallow water buoys with depths less than 25 m and not deep water buoys and that is the reason for obtaining comparatively lesser correlation than deep water buoys therefore by considering the buoy data from such locations bordering 30 m of water depth were found to be useful to assess and evaluate the extent of agreement between the models and buoy at deeper than 15 m which is the limiting depth for near shore wave transformations further this shows the need of coupling a global or regional model with a shallow water or nearshore model for receiving accurate shallow water prediction 5 5 validation of wam wwiii hindcasts using satellite measurements in the indian seas apart from buoy measurements attempts were also made to validate the wam and wwiii hindcasts using satellite altimeter measurements in this study to validate the wam and wwiii simulated hs the jason 1 hs was used for a period june 2008 to june 2009 the wam and wwiii simulated hs was compared at 2 locations fig 1 such as w1 17 n 65 e in the arabian sea and e1 15 n 87 e in the bay of bengal with depths 3580 m and 2918 m respectively fig 21 shows the comparison of simulated wam wwiii hs with altimeter measurements for the selected locations w1 and e1 respectively comparison between jason 1 and model hs fig 21 shows that the modeled hs match fairly well with the remotely sensed observations jason 1 for larger waves an underestimation has been observed in the model significant wave heights the estimated statistics for the comparison of model hs with altimeter measurements during june 2008 to june 2009 is shown in table 7 in the arabian sea good correlation is found between the two models at the location w1 fig 21 a with correlation coefficients 0 91 and 0 85 respectively it is noted that there is an overestimation of 0 21 m hs by wam and an underestimation of 0 19 m using wwiii at w1 location in the arabian sea the rmse are of the order 0 37 m and 0 44 m respectively with si 0 24 and 0 59 overall both wam and wwiii performed fairly well with pe 14 2 and 19 6 and mpi 0 89 and 0 81 respectively again the statistical parameters show the reliability of the wave models used as well as the use of altimeter data for comparison validation the results in this study are comparable with the statistics of validation of wwiii using altimeter data ifremer cersat altimeter hs database in the north indian ocean as reported by samiksha et al 2012 further in a study by remya et al 2012 2014 it is indicated that mike 21 sw model derived hs are in good agreement with jason 1 altimeter hs in the southern as well as in the northern indian oceans fig 21b shows the comparison between jason 1 and model significant wave heights at e1 location in the bay of bengal comparison of model and altimeter hs shows good agreement corresponding r of 0 95 0 88 using wam wwiii during june 2008 to june 2009 it is noted an overestimation of the hs by the wam model in comparison to altimeter data during the period of study the altimeter data shows that the bias obtained indicates that the predicted wwiii outputs underestimates the hs compared with the altimeter the bias values obtained are 0 27 m and 0 21 m using wam and wwiii at the location e1 in bay of bengal a positive bias indicates overestimation of the hs by the wam model with respect to altimeter high values of rmse 0 32 m 0 43 m also indicate the deviation by the model in comparison to altimeter data the si values obtained are 0 31 and 0 46 using wam and wwiii respectively with pe 16 7 and 21 3 overall the model revealed high mpi of the order 0 92 and 0 87 respectively this shows that the model performs well at deep waters both in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal the results are in accordance with the findings by aboobacker 2010 in which it is reported that good correlation is found between the hs simulated by mike 21 sw model and jason 1 measurements at two locations off goa and off paradip in the arabian sea and bay of bengal respectively with correlation coefficients 0 96 and 0 90 respectively even though there is slight over estimation off goa and an under estimation off paradip the model performs well at deep waters both in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal it is indicated from fig 21 that in both locations wam proved to give a better performance as compared with wwiii the deviations in the model can be partly attributed to the quality of wind inputs physics numeric and model grid resolution apart from that the altimetry data is inherently noisy the jason measurements are also somewhat more prone to noise and outliers and the most problematic aspect of the jason 1 dataset is the dearth of measured small waves ray and beckley 2010 and also can be attributed to random errors in measurements and therefore not indicative of systematic errors in jason 1 data chelton et al 2001 6 conclusions in this study two state of the art third generation wave models wam cycle 4 5 3 and wwiii 3 14 have been successfully implemented globally for their inter comparisons and were applied in hindcast mode to simulate the wave regime in the north indian ocean for a two year period using era 40 and quikscat ncep blended winds and the results are validated with the measurements the modeled wave parameters show good correlation with the measured data this is an interesting exercise as a systematic inter comparison of wave model results is not often reported especially for the north indian ocean this is the first and one of the initial attempts to study the comparison of wave hindcasts using wam and wwiii in the north indian ocean wave parameters obtained from the hindcasts have been analyzed to understand the quality and variability associated with the individual model outputs based on the study in this paper the following summary and conclusions are presented in this inter comparison study we have implemented the models wam and wwiii globally and the global implementation of wam and wwiii 77 s to 77 n and 0 to 360 e over 1 1 resolution could successfully cater to the swells propagating from the southern ocean to the north indian ocean the simulations wave hindcasts were carried out successfully for the global domain regional domain north indian ocean for the period january to december 2000 using era 40 winds and june 2008 to june 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds in the cases considered for inter comparison in this investigation the hindcast outputs such as significant wave height hs mean wave period tm and swell wave height hsw have been inter compared for selected months january april july and october 2000 july 2008 and january 2009 in the north indian ocean the inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw in the north indian ocean showed percentage errors such as 2 5 12 3 4 5 18 3 3 0 10 8 and 4 7 17 1 for january april june july and october respectively by revealing a good agreement between wam and wwiii to summarize the inter comparisons of wam and wwiii in the north indian ocean the results of this study are highly encouraging for january june and july with percentage deviation mostly ranging from 3 0 to 12 3 except during april pre monsoon and october post monsoon months which can be attributed to the quality of the input winds further since wave growth and dispersion are determined by the actions of wind most of the wave model errors are attributed to inaccuracies in representing winds the validation of wam and wwiii hindcasts using moored buoy measurements proved promising enough in the arabian sea and bay of bengal during the study period the percentage error in the arabian sea for hs and tm for all buoys considered varied in the range 12 7 27 9 and 13 6 26 9 respectively similarly in the bay of bengal the pe ranged from 10 8 to 25 6 and 8 7 28 8 for hs and tm respectively it is noted that models gave best performances in the bay of bengal in simulating hs while tm was best simulated in the arabian sea although underestimation and overestimation of hs and tm were noted at the buoy locations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal it is demonstrated that hindcasts using wam were able to reproduce hs and tm at the buoy location with lesser pe of the order 8 9 26 7 as compared to wwiii 14 8 28 8 while using wam the performance of the model was much better in the arabian sea 13 6 23 7 wwiii performed similar in both arabian sea and bay of bengal but with slightly higher errors the comparison between the hs data from the jason 1 altimeter and the wam and wwiii hindcast at selected location in the arabian sea and bay of bengal shows that the altimeter data showed fairly good correlation of the order 0 85 to 0 95 the pe was lesser 14 2 16 7 in the arabian sea and bay of bengal using wam as compared with wwiii 19 6 21 3 the lower hs of altimeter observations in comparison with wam and wwiii hs observed during june 2008 to june 2009 in the arabian sea and bay of bengal may be due to the fact that the altimetry data is inherently noisy random errors in measurements and dearth of measured small waves based on both qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of the model results the present study clearly indicate that the models wam and wwiii performed well in their respective model domains using era 40 and quikscat ncep blended winds and they can be confidently used for long term hindcasting as well as operational forecasting for the north indian ocean all the validation results point to the fact that the performance of the models is quite satisfactory overall the inter comparisons and validation results of this study suggests that wam hindcasts can be considered better than wwiii model outputs it is also seen that the hindcast results of wam are found to be better by considering the cases presented in this paper whereas it must be taken into consideration and noted that wwiii being the latest model uses most superior recent physics of wave generation wave current interaction and air sea temperature difference as an additional input and its numerical approaches are much superior to wam hence it can be concluded with reasonable confidence that the model with this particular configuration can serve the purpose of reliable wave hindcasts in the indian ocean region therefore it would be wise to have long term measurements in the north indian ocean to validate using sea truth data and inter compare wam and wwiii

23189,in this work we present the inter comparison of wave hindcasts using third generation models wam and wavewatch wwiii for the north indian ocean at a 1 1 lat long grid resolutions and we show a first assessment of their relative performance by inter comparing the model results to observational data at selected points in the arabian sea and bay of bengal wam and wwiii inter comparison studies are carried out for the year 2000 and for the period june 2008 to june 2009 overall the inter comparison shows that both wave models are rather skillful in predicting the integral wave parameters with lesser pe of the range 8 9 26 7 using wam than wwiii it is also quite evident that the wwiii model has a tendency to overestimate mean wave periods while the opposite is true for wam model further the validation results using altimeter measurements are quite promising in the arabian sea and bay of bengal the study further suggests that it would be wise to use long term measurements both in deep and coastal waters of north indian ocean to validate and inter compare wam and wwiii further and they may also be coupled with swan for the nearshore waters keywords wam wwiii sea state prediction wave model inter comparisons era 40 blended winds 1 introduction the wind induced surface gravity waves in the ocean are important in the air sea interaction process of the coupled ocean atmosphere system the knowledge of the ocean waves and their temporal and spatial variabilities are essential for various defence as well as civilian applications swain 1997 richard et al 2002 umesh et al 2007 the ocean as such is a dynamic system where there are a number of processes which take place simultaneously so that it becomes too complex to predict them however our understanding of the ocean environment is constantly improving which enables us to predict its variability well in advance forecasting surface waves in the ocean is a problem of great practical interest as the sea state conditions influence virtually all most all aspects of naval operations at sea as well as a variety of commercial and maritime activities for example accurate ocean wave forecasting is a key prerequisite for enabling optimum tracking of ship routes and ensuring the safety of lives and property at sea onboard various fixed and floating platforms thus ocean wave forecasting has been a priority for all research and maritime organizations those who have pioneered the application of operational ocean wave models dating all the way back to the 1960s considering the variety of applications of sea state as mentioned above accurate and extended wave information including waves of extreme weather events is very essential for a wide range of research and engineering applications wave statistics derived from point measurements were considered for obtaining reliable local wave climate in the past however these measurements are not sufficient to describe the regional wave patterns over a long period of time this emphasizes the need to work on wave models driven by wind fields obtained from satellites measurements or and models the present day third generation wave models are capable of predicting the waves reasonably well and their accuracies can be still improved with appropriate representation of extremely complex physical processes of wind generated waves vledder 2001 polnikov et al 2007 the scientific community has developed a series of models called as third generation wave models such as wam wave modeling wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii wwiii tolman 2009 tolman et al 2002 and swan model simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 and ris et al 1999 which are being widely applied for global as well as regional ocean state forecasts up to the nearshore zone the components of source function are used without any prior restrictions on the spectral shape tolman and chalikov 1996 the shallow water or nearshore wave model swan swamp 1985 has been designed specifically for coastal wave prediction and it is utilized at several coastal regions around the world the state of the art and the prospects for improvement of wave models can be found in holthuijsen 2007 the wise group 2007 and komen et al 1994 like many other geophysical phenomena waves can be studied on very different space and temporal time scales lavrenov 2003 sea state belongs to large scales and it is mainly related to the processes of wind momentum transfer nonlinear transfer current refraction and turbulent dissipation of energy as the waves move toward shoreline other physical processes become important viz refraction induced by sudden variations in depth or by coastal currents and shoaling since the forcing become increasingly dependent on regional currents and local variations in bathymetry the scale of the problem becomes smaller in most situations the two types of waves can still be analyzed within the framework of the same theory as a result a third generation wave model like wam which efficiently solves the kinetic equation and the source functions in order to give global and regional forecasts can be combined with other nearshore wave models like swan that are more oriented towards propagation on the coastal scale we refer to komen et al 1994 and janssen 2008 for a complete description of wam and to booij et al 1999 and the swan team 2011 for information on swan recent advances in the availability of computer power it has become feasible to use chains of numerical models in order to connect the wave propagation from the large to the regional coastal scales the resulting system might provide not only large scale wave forecasts based on synoptic scale wind and satellite data assimilation but also a realistic ongoing description of the coastal waves in smaller regional areas with the increasing demand for modernization there is equally an increasing demand to forecast ocean waves rusu 2011 in open sea and coastal areas to aid marine applications many users and the scientific community depend on nowcasts and ocean state forecasts for marine related operations balakrishnan nair et al 2013 2014 and sandhya et al 2014 wave modeling studies for the north indian ocean using wam wwiii and swan have been carried by several researchers such as sabique et al 2012 nayak et al 2013 amrutha et al 2016 wave model inter comparison studies have been reported across the globe by various researchers till date tolman et al 2002 padilla hernandez et al 2007 ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 hanson et al 2009 korres et al 2011 a systematic inter comparison of wam cycle 4 and wwiii wave model results has been reported for the mediterranean region by korres et al 2011 the inter comparison of the two wave models over the whole mediterranean basin showed that noticeable differences in terms of significant wave height hs and periods significant wave height rms differences of 0 5 0 7 m and wave period rms differences of 1 5 2 0s was seen along the track of the main cyclones over the basin where the swell contribution to the wave field was important in the geographic areas of the mediterranean sea where wind seas dominate the two models exhibit almost the same performance inter comparison of swan and wwiii with buoy observations was carried out by ortiz royero and mercado irizarry 2008 the study tested the applicability of the swan model at oceanic scales although comparison between buoy observations and model outputs tend to favor wwiii over swan in deep waters it was stressed that the ease of using swan together with the simplification offered by just having to learn to use one model makes the swan model a good option for simulations all the way from deep waters up to the nearshore hanson et al 2009 evaluated the performance of three numerical wave models wam cycle 4 5 wwiii and wavad in the pacific basin the three models exhibited varied performance in the depiction of wind sea and young swells in their physical attributes wwiii hindcasts exhibited consistently higher performance scores than those from wam and wavad the prediction of mature swells in the winter months with elevated height errors in all three models was a noteworthy problem in another study three state of the art operational forecast wave models wam wwiii and swan were compared through simulations padilla hernandez et al 2007 of two severe winter storms in the northwest atlantic model performances were also evaluated through comparisons validations with field measurements the results revealed that although the models are comparable in terms of their overall performance and skill it was found that wwiii provides padilla hernandez et al 2007 a better statistical fit to the observed wave data compared with the other models and that swan gives slightly better results if nested within wwiii rather than within wam tolman et al 2002 reported that for japan the gulf of mexico and the nw atlantic nww3 noaa ww3 appears to be significantly better than wam primarily based on the regression slopes for the ne pacific and atlantic nww3 has much better correlation coefficients and smaller standard deviations and rms errors than wam however nww3 overestimates the slope of the regression line by 16 whereas wam underestimates the slope by a much smaller region a long term inter comparison of model computed wave parameters for the north indian ocean region is however missing the novelty of this work is the inter comparison of two modeling systems viz wam and wwiii to suggest the suitability and capabilities for their future utilization and exploitation in predicting the sea state information required for various practical applications in an operational scenario to verify the efficiency of model computed parameters systematic validation studies with long term observational data is an essential pre requisite to improve the prediction capability and enhancement of wave model performances the inter companion study gives reasonably good results with low rms error and high correlation coefficients the present study is going to be the first but initial attempt to inter compare each of the models such as wam c4 5 3 and wwiii v3 14 for the north indian ocean nio region by conducting a few carefully chosen case studies for selected years to project its usefulness on sea state information 2 composition of the modeling system the state of the art third generation wave prediction models evolved initially with the development of wam followed by wwiii and coastal wave model swan however the modeling system architecture employed here is comprised of wam and wwiii both these models are used in many operational centers worldwide for routine sea state forecasts 2 1 wam cycle 4 5 3 the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation describing the two dimensional wave spectrum in the following way 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x and time t and deep water group velocity c g c g f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and shifting of energy and the equation is valid for deep water with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerical approaches are kept in the new release the source function integration scheme adopted by hersbach and janssen 1999 and the its updates bidlot et al 2005 have been incorporated a number of additional options are also added in the new model release of wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method in wam 4 5 3 is semi implicit and it is based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function computed with the spectrum at time n and the wind speed at n 1 g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction during transition between wind sea and swell this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also necessary to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 in this study wam is implemented globally a well as regionally for the north indian ocean nio 2 2 wavewatch iii v3 14 as that of wam the wavewatch iii wave model version 3 14 used here in this investigation is also in global as well as regional implementation for nio wwiii is a wam type ocean surface wave model developed at noaa ncep tolman and chalikov 1996 tolman 2009 it has been successfully applied in global and regional scale studies in many areas including the north atlantic and has proven to be an effective tool to study wave spectral evaluation air sea interactions and nonlinear wave wave interactions wwiii is a discrete spectral and phase averaged wave model battjes 1994 for regional and global applications the directional wave spectrum is resolved at each model grid point in terms of wave number direction bands and the evolution of the wave field is found by numerically solving the spectral wave action balance equation which is usually written as 3 n t 1 cos φ φ φ n cos θ λ λ n k k n θ θ g n s σ where λ is longitude φ is latitude θ is wave propagation direction k is wave number t is time σ is the intrinsic angular frequency wwiii evaluates the balance equation for the wave action spectrum n k θ x t which is usually expressed in spherical coordinates komen et al 1994 the derivatives in 2 are the propagation velocities in physical and spectral domains 4 φ c g cos θ u φ r λ c g sin θ u λ r cos φ θ g θ c g tan φ cos θ r where r is the radius of the earth and uφ and uλ are current components in φ and λ directions the left side of equation 2 represents the local rate of change of wave action density propagation in physical space action density shifting in frequency and direction due to the spatial and temporal variation in depth and current the net source term s consists of wind input s in white capping dissipation s ds nonlinear wave wave interactions s nl and bottom friction s bot ww3 uses an explicit scheme to solve the action balance equation 2 for n 3 data used 3 1 wind forcing for the model the sensitivity of waves to the quality of winds was confirmed by janssen 1998 who showed that random wind speed errors dominate the forecast wave height errors even after 48 h forecast further it has been shown in the tropics where sea state is dominated by swell quality of wave model outputs depend on the quality of the wind field in the extratropics where swells are generated janssen 2000 wave models are thus extremely sensitive to details of the input wind and a high quality winds only reproduce the real wave climate a high quality analyzed wind fields provided by ecmwf era 40 and blended winds such as quikscat ncep winds was used in the present study ecmwf janssen et al 1997 cavaleri and bertotti 2004 2006 caires and sterl 2005 ardhuin et al 2007 brenner et al 2007 moeini et al 2010 and quikscat ncep milliff et al 2004 li et al 2006 wu and chiang 2007 are the most commonly used wind fields in wave modeling studies ecmwf 40 year reanalysis era 40 is a reanalysis of meteorological observations from september 1957 to august 2002 45 years released by ecmwf uppala et al 2005 sterl and caires 2005 caires et al 2005 one of the products of era 40 consists of 6 hourly global fields of wind speed at 10 metres height u10 with a 1 5 1 5 grid resolution besides atmospheric variables it also includes wave parameters era 40 was produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system a two way coupled atmosphere wave model system and a three dimensional variational data assimilation scheme 3dvar observations of ocean wind speeds from voluntary observing ship vos buoys and satellite scatterometer were assimilated in the reanalysis process in this study the wind speed and the stresses τx and τy for the year 2000 was extracted from era 40 and the same was used to estimate wind direction and the winds were further interpolated to 1 1 grid resolution the processed six hourly winds for the period january to december 2000 were then used to force the wave models wam wwiii for the globe and nio quikscat ncep blended ocean winds from colorado research associates version 5 0 covers from july 1999 to july 2009 6 hourly with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 latitude longitude quikscat ncep blended wind products were derived through a spatial blending of the high resolution scatterometer quikscat wind observations with the ncep ncar reanalysis winds chin et al 1998 milliff et al 1999 the ncep ncar analysis fields are the products of the ncep climate data assimilation system cdas which was an operational system developed for the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 the quikscat ncep blended wind field contains the high wavenumber spatial information from quikscat measurements the blending scheme retains the quikscat wind measurements in its swath regions and enhances the ncep ncar fields in quikscat sampling gaps through imposition of high wavenumber content that is based on monthly local quikscat statistics quikscat ncep blended winds six hourly for the period june 2008 to june 2009 have been interpolated to 1 1 model grid resolution for the purpose of wave hindcasting 3 2 wave data in the indian ocean region several deep sea and shallow water moored buoys buoy type discus have been deployed by the national institute of ocean technology chennai since 1997 premkumar et al 2000 under the national data buoy program ndbp to measure several near surface meteorological and oceanic variables jossia et al 2010a 2010b the buoys are equipped with global positioning system beacon light and satellite transceiver these buoys are operable from 20 m water depths to full ocean depth excepting a few buoys which function in slightly lower depths the sensor used in the measurement of wave parameters is an inertial altitude heading reference system with dynamic linear motion measurement capability the waves are measured in the buoy by a motion reference unit which measures absolute roll pitch yaw and relative heave these data are recorded at a rate of 1 hz for 17min every three hours hence it measures the full spectrum of the waves for 17 min the hs is estimated as four times the square root of the area under the non directional wave spectrum it has an accuracy 10 cm for wave height up to 20 m and 5 for wave direction in this study wave data measured at locations such as ds1 off goa ds2 off lakshadweep sw1 off pipavav port sw4 off mangalore port ds3 off andaman and nicobar ds4 off paradip sw5 off tuticorin port sw6 off chennai port during the year 2000 and ob10 off chidambaram during january 2009 are utilized for the validation of wave model wam wwiii hindcasts the locations of these buoys are shown in fig 1 the details on deployment locations water depth and duration of data are listed in table 1 3 3 satellite altimeter data over the past decade satellite altimetry has become an indispensable tool for observing global ocean waves lefevre and cotton 2001 the data are routinely used in numerical wave prediction

jason 1 measurements is indicated in table 2 4 methodology the third generation wave models wam cycle 4 5 3 and wwiii version 3 14 have been implemented for their inter comparisons in deep waters the global grid system for wam and wwiii covers the geographical extents 0 to 360 e and 77 s to 77 n with a resolution of 1 1 latitude longitude wam uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 04177 hz to 0 41145 hz and 12 directions constant increment to represent the wave spectra distribution similarly wwiii model uses 25 frequencies ranging from 0 0412 hz to 0 4056 hz with a logarithmic distribution with increment factor 1 1 and 24 directions constant increment in present study the analyzed wind fields such as era 40 and quikscat ncep blended products have been used for driving the wave models the surface current data required as input for wave models were obtained from the ocean surface current analyses real time oscar database bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the era interim daily fields from ecmwf were used for extracting the air sea temperature difference data used as input by wwiii model the global model bathymetries have been constructed from etopo2 data wam and wwiii inter comparison studies were carried out for the year 2000 january to december and for the period june 2008 to june 2009 based on the availability of quality wave measurements for prior validation calibration of the corresponding model outputs the significant wave parameters considered for this inter comparison study are significant wave height hs mean wave period tm and swell wave height hsw hindcasts have been carried out for the global ocean which includes the target study area such as the north indian ocean for the above selected periods using analyzed winds era 40 and quikscat ncep blended products as

the full month the most important statistical measures such as coefficient of correlation r scatter index si bias b mean deviation root mean square error rmse percentage error pe and model performance

fig 3c of wam and wwiii for tm on 15 january 2000 1200 h ranged from 0 4 0 8s wam wwiii magnitude of the anomaly being maximum in the bay of bengal the analysis reveals that wam versus wwiii hindcast for tm in the nio region shows a strong correlation of 0 98 with bias 0 03 by and large the pe is promising 0 42 considering all the data points in the nio over 1 resolution which reveal a good overall agreement between the simulated tm of wam and wwiii fig 3d shows wam predicted tm for 15 july 2000 1200 h which ranges between 5 0 and 9 0s while the corresponding hindcast tm of wwiii fig 3e

january 2000 with si of 0 02 and bias of 0 14 m the rmse for hsw is 0 03 m and pe is 12 3 the mpi is same 0 98 for all three parameters hs tm and hsw which indicate a very good agreement between wam and wwiii the pe was 12 for both hs and hsw compared to tm 3 0 5 2 2 april 2000 the inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for nio on 10 april 2000 1200 h is as shown in fig 6 the statistical estimates of inter comparisons between wam and wwiii hs tm and hsw for the month of april 2000 pre monsoon period is shown in tables 3 5 respectively here the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio reveal strong correlation of 0 99 0 97 and 0 98 respectively on 10 april 2000 1200 h hs varied from 0 2 to 2 2 m tm varied from 2 2 to 13 3s and hsw varied from 0 3 to 2 2 m the inter comparison of hs predicted for the nio by wam and wwiii shows si of 0 06 m and pe of 23 3 similarly comparison between hindcast tm reveals bias of 0 01s rmse of 0 19s and pe of 3 8 in case of hsw si is 0 06 bias is 0 28 m and pe is 22 7 the estimated values of mpi are 0 96 for hs 0 98 for tm and 0 95 for hsw which show a match between the two models in the nio region fig 7 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters hs tm and hsw for nio during april 2000 using era 40 winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 98 0 98 and 0 97 respectively the inter comparison of hs for the same region reveal si of 0 03 bias of 0 18 m and pe of 17 1 in case of tm si is 0 02 bias is 0 18s rmse is 0 19s and pe is 4 5 the same way hsw reveal si of 0 04 bias of 0 20 m rmse of 0 06 m and pe of 18 3 the value of mpi is 0 97 for all the wave parameters such as hs tm and hsw which reveal a strong agreement between the two models wam and wwiii for the month of april 2000 in nio 5 2 3 july 2000 the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters hs tm and hsw for nio region on 10 july 2000 1200 h using era 40 winds is as shown in fig 8 tables 3 5 presents the concerned statistical estimates of hs tm and hsw inter comparisons between wam and wwiii output parameters for the month of july 2000 south west monsoon period during which wind blows strong and steady over longer fetches in the nio region here the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio reveal strong correlations of 0 99 0 97 and 0 98 respectively on 10 july 2000 1200 h hs varied from 0 1 to 4 8 m tm varied from 3 8 to 8 4s and hsw varied from 0 1 to 3 6 m the inter comparison of hs predicted for the nio region by wam and wwiii shows si of 0 01 bias of 0 02 m and pe of 6 6 similarly comparison between tm of wam and wwiii reveals bias of 0 02s si of 0 01 rmse of 0 05s and pe of 2 3 in the case of hsw si is 0 03 rmse is 0 04 m and pe is 9 3 the estimated values of mpi are 0 99 in case of hs and tm and 0 97 in case of hsw which shows a very good agreement between the two models for the nio here the inter comparison reveals that the hindcast hs and hsw for nio region by wam and wwiii have agreed considerably well during july 2000 compared with january 2000 and april 2000 using era 40 winds this is due to the fact that july being a rough weather season winds will be strong accurately reproduced by a weather prediction model but at the same time for fair weather seasons such as january or april comparatively experiences low wind conditions inaccurately driven by the input winds however wwiii predicted hsw seems to be relatively higher compared to wam in the range 1 7 3 0 m fig 9 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio region during july 2000 using era 40 winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 97 0 98 and 0 96 respectively the inter comparison of hs reveals ias of 0 08 m rmse of 0 02 m and pe of 8 7 in case of tm bias is 0 02s rmse is 0 09s and pe is 3 3 similarly hsw reveal si of 0 02 and pe of 10 1 the value of mpi are 0 98 for hs 0 97 for tm and 0 98 for hsw which reveal a strong agreement between the two models wam and wwiii for the month of july 2000 in nio 5 2 4 october 2000 the scatter plots of wave hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw for a selected day as well as for the full month during october 2000 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively fig 11 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio region for the same day 10 october 2000 1200 h the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio region show significant correlations with correlation coefficients of 0 97 0 97 and 0 98 respectively however the inter comparisons of hs for the nio reveal si of 0 03 and pe of 17 7 it reveals that wam predicted hs are higher than wwiii by 18 the hindcast tm mostly varied from 2 9 to 12 2s with bias of 0 26s and pe of 4 6 between wam and wwiii inter comparison of hsw shows si of 0 02 m and pe of 15 1 the estimates of mpi are 0 97 for hs and tm and 0 98 for hsw which reveal a good agreement between wam and wwiii for nio region the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio ocean for 1 31 october 2000 is shown in fig 11 the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 98 0 98 and 0 97 respectively the comparisons for hs predicted by both models for nio reveals bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 05 m and pe of 16 5 similarly the comparison for tm shows si of 0 02 rmse of 0 22s and pe of 4 7 which reveal a very good agreement between both the models hsw varied from 0 1 to 3 0 m in the nio during october 2000 with si of 0 04 and bias of 0 19 m the rmse for hsw is 0 05 m and pe is 17 1 the value of mpi is same 0 98 for hs and tm and 0 96 for hsw which indicate a very good agreement between wam and wwiii in this case pe deviation is higher for both hs 16 5 and hsw 17 1 compared to tm 4 7 5 3 inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcasts using quikscat ncep blended winds in this study inter comparisons have been carried out for wam and wwiii using quikscat ncep blended winds for the period june 2008 to june 2009 and the inter comparison for selected months such as july 2008 and january 2009 representing the rough weather and fair weather seasons is only presented in the following discussions 5 3 1 july 2008 the scatter plots of wam and wwiii hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw for a selected day as well as for the month july 2008 1st to 31st are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively tables 3 5 shows the statistical estimates of the inter comparison between wam and wwiii hs tm and hsw during july 2008 fig 12 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters in the nio region for 10 july 2008 1200 h using quikscat ncep blended winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio show very high correlations of 0 99 0 99 and 0 98 respectively however the inter comparisons of hs for the nio reveal si of 0 02 rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 9 6 the hindcast tm mostly varied from 1 9 to 10 8s and reveal bias of 0 23s and pe of 3 5 between wam and wwiii hsw inter comparisons show si of 0 01 m and pe of 8 8 the estimated values of mpi are 0 98 for hs and tm and it is 0 99 for hsw which reveal very good agreement between wam and wwiii the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio region during 1 31 july 2008 using quikscat ncep blended winds is shown in fig 13 the hindcast wave parameters such as hs tm and hsw show strong correlations of 0 97 0 98 and 0 97 respectively between wam and wwiii the inter comparison for hs predicted by both models for the nio region reveals si of 0 01 and pe of 9 3 similarly the comparison for tm show bias of 0 14s rmse of 0 10s and pe of 3 3 which reveal a very good agreement between wam and wwiii hsw varied from 0 1 to 4 6 m in the nio during july 2008 and reveal si of 0 02 and bias of 0 02 m and pe of 9 5 the mpi is 0 98 for hs and hsw and 0 99 for tm which reveals a very strong agreement between wam and wwiii pe values are less than 10 for hs and hsw and about 3 for tm 5 3 2 january 2009 the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters for nio on 10 january 2009 1200 h using quikscat ncep blended winds is shown in fig 14 here the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw for the nio reveal strong correlation of 0 96 0 98 and 0 97 respectively on 10 january 2009 1200 h hs varied from 0 1 to 2 4 m tm varied from 1 9 to 11 3s and hsw varied from 0 1 to 2 1 m tables 3 5 the inter comparison of hs predicted for the nio by wam and wwiii shows si of 0 01 and pe of 7 7 similarly comparison between predicted tm by both these models reveal bias of 0 11s rmse of 0 04s and pe of 2 0 in case of hsw bias is 0 08 m rmse is 0 01 m and pe is 6 6 the estimated values of mpi are same i e 0 99 for hs and hsw and 0 98 for tm which suggest very good agreement between the two models in the study region fig 15 shows the inter comparison of wam and wwiii model parameters hs tm and hsw for nio region during january 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds the hindcast wave parameters hs tm and hsw show higher correlations of 0 97 0 99 and 0 96 respectively the inter comparison of hs between wam and wwiii for the same region reveals bias of 0 15 m rmse of 0 04 m and pe of 10 6 in case of tm si is 0 03 and pe is 3 5 in the same way hsw reveal si of 0 02 bias of 0 12 m and pe 10 0 the value of mpi is 0 98 for hs and 0 97 both for tm and hsw which reveal a strong agreement between the two models wam and wwiii for the month of january 2009 in nio the above inter comparison studies using wam and wwiii for selected months during rough weather and fair weather seasons using er 40 and blended winds revealed sufficient confidence in the models as the model performances reflected fairly good correlation and scatter index in the north indian ocean moreover it is noted that both models gave better performances during rough weather seasons which is associated with the fact that wind fields are quite strong during this periods but at the same time the deviations observed during the fair weather seasons can be attributed to the low winds prevailing during this period january april which can be attributed to inaccurate input winds apart from wind forcing many other factors such as wave model physics numeric and model grid resolution can affect the model performance 5 4 validation of wam wwiii hindcasts using buoy measurements in the indian seas in this study the previous sections 5 2 5 3 attempted to compare the hindcasts from the deep water models wam and wwiii an important aspect in numerical wave prediction is the validation of significant wave parameters which forms an important step in the operational forecasting centers firstly we wanted to see how far the model simulations can be brought very close to the observations for this we have run the model for a complete year covering different seasons and analyzed the wave characteristics of the indian ocean to check the compatibility of the model the study utilized the available buoy data from the arabian sea and bay of bengal to validate the significant wave parameters it is to be noted that buoys with continuous data is only used in the analysis the wam and wwiii simulated hs and tm were compared for the year 2000 at eight moored buoy locations in the indian seas ds1 ds2 sw1 sw4 ds3 ds4 sw5 sw6 and ob10 during january 2009 as shown as shown in fig 1 the statistical estimates for the validation of wam and wwiii with buoy measurements in the arabian sea and bay of bengal during january to december 2000 is shown in table 6 fig 16 a d shows the comparison of simulated wam and wwiii hs with ds1 ds2 sw1 sw4 buoy measurements for the period january to december 2000 in the arabian sea at ds1 buoy location fig 16a the comparison of hs january to december 2000 indicated high correlations r 0 97 with low si 0 18 using wam the negative bias indicated an underestimation b 0 14 m of wave height at the ds1 buoy location at the same location wwiii simulated hs revealed correlations comparatively lower r 0 81 with high si 0 32 and rmse 0 39 m it is noted that both wam and wwiii performed fairly well during the period may to september pre monsoon and southwest monsoon periods while wwiii was seen to overestimate highly during the post monsoon and north east monsoon periods and this can be attributed to the quality of wind inputs and the physics driving the different representation of swell propagations in both the models the pe and mpi using wam were 12 7 and 0 98 while with wwiii it was 19 9 and 0 85 respectively similarly the comparison of hs at the ds2 fig 16b location may to december 2000 revealed correlations of 0 90 and 0 86 using wam and wwiii with pe 15 9 and 20 6 respectively both wam and wwiii underestimated hs at the ds2 location with biases 0 11 m and 0 25 m respectively with a better performance exhibited by wam fig 16c shows the comparison of wam and wwiii simulated hs with the sw1 buoy measurements both wam and wwiii have underestimated the hs for the period july to december 2000 with correlations of 0 81 and 0 73 respectively although the models followed the general trend of hs at the buoy location it could not accurately reproduce all higher hs at the buoy location the pe at the sw1 location is higher 22 6 and 29 9 respectively using wam and wwiii similar is the case at sw2 buoy location fig 16d wherein wam and wwiii demonstrated underestimation of hs with pe 21 5 and 25 3 respectively overall in the arabian sea wam and wwiii could fairly reproduce the hs at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 13 7 22 6 than wwiii 19 9 27 9 the comparisons at the ds1 location using wam were the best in the arabian sea among the four buoys considered in the bay of bengal hs comparisons were carried out at four buoy locations ds3 ds4 sw5 and sw6 respectively fig 17 shows the comparison of model derived hs with buoy measurements in the bay of bengal at the ds3 fig 17a buoy location may to december 2000 wam hs gave a good match with high correlation of 0 95 and pe 11 7 the si is very low 0 11 with rmse 0 15 m it is noted that during may to september 2000 at ds3 buoy location wwiii has underestimated the hs while during september to december 2000 wwiii has overestimated the hs with high si 0 46 and pe 18 4 at the ds4 buoy location fig 17b both wam and wwiii revealed underestimation of hs september to december 2000 with correlation of 0 96 and 0 93 and pe 10 8 and 14 8 respectively the underestimations can possibly be attributed to simplifications like the neglect of atmospheric stratification effects when converting wind speeds to the wind stress fields driving these models fig 17c shows the comparison of wam and wwiii hs with sw5 buoy measurements the wam model over predicts the hs with high si 0 54 high rmse 0 47 m while wwiii shows a fairly good match with slight underestimation b 0 19 m and lower pe 19 5 as compared with wam 24 8 further the comparison fig 17d at sw6 location march to august 2000 revealed correlations of 0 83 and 0 77 using wam and wwiii respectively it is noted that here wam showed slight underestimation b 0 18 m throughout with a pe 17 7 while wwiii equally under predicted and over predicted the hs at the buoy location with pe 23 8 overall in the bay of bengal wam and wwiii shared fairly good performance in simulating hs at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 10 8 23 8 than wwiii 14 8 25 6 the comparisons at the ds3 location using wam were the best in the bay of bengal among the four buoys considered the comparison of model simulated tm with buoy measurements were also executed for the above discussed locations the indian seas in the arabian sea the comparison of tm fig 18 a at the ds1 location january to december 2000 revealed correlations of 0 82 and 0 73 using wam and wwiii respectively the wam model overestimated the tm throughout the year with a pe 19 8 while wwiii also showed overestimations with significant underestimation of tm with a pe 21 4 during may to september 2000 at the ds1 location fig 18b shows the comparison of simulated wam wwiii tm with buoy measurements at the ds2 location for the period may to december 2000 it is noted that wwiii hs is overestimated with b 0 52s and pe 19 8 while a fairly good match is observed with wam having a correlation of 0 88 and pe 13 6 at the sw1 buoy location fig 18c for the period july to december 2000 both wam and wwiii has unpredicted tm with higher deviations exhibited by wwiii b 0 63s the comparison showed correlations 0 8 with pe 16 3 and 22 5 for wam and wwiii respectively further the comparison at sw4 location fig 18d for the period january to october 2000 shows significant overestimation by both models with pe 23 7 and 26 9 respectively overall in the arabian sea wam and wwiii revealed higher deviations in simulating tm at the buoy location with lesser pe by wam 13 7 22 6 than wwiii 19 9 27 9 the comparison of tm at the ds2 location using wam were the best and promising in the arabian sea among the four buoys considered the above results are comparable with the results of mike 21 sw wam physics hindcast in the indian ocean for the year 2005 using quikscat blended ecmwf winds which revealed that the model performance was satisfactory with reasonable confidence remya et al 2012 further the model predicted parameters as shown in figs 16 and 17 reveal good match with the observations as reported by several other researchers such as raj kumar et al 2009 samiksha et al 2012 and sannasiraj et al 2014 in the bay of bengal the wam and wwiii tm hindcasts were also validated at four buoy locations fig 19 ds3 ds4 sw5 and sw6 for the period january to december 2000 fig 19a shows the comparison between the ds3 measurements and wam wwiii hindcast tm for may to december 2000 the wam model predicted tm as shown in fig 19a show higher correlation with the observations r 0 95 compared with wwiii r 0 89 it is noted that the wam model could fairly reproduce tm at the buoy location with low si 0 11 and low rmse 0 08s which also show a strong fit between the model and observations at the same time it is observed that wwiii underestimated the tm with si 0 32 and b 0 24s the pe is 8 9 and 16 4 respectively for the simulated tm using wam and wwiii respectively similarly the model predicted tm at ds4 buoy location for the period september to december 2000 as shown in fig 19b shows correlation 0 94 and 0 75 with the observations the values of bias are 0 19s and 0 53s for wam and wwiii respectively indicating slight underestimation and overestimation from the observed values the rmse values are of the order 0 51s for wam tm and 1 06s for wwiii tm which show a weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 12 2 and 21 8 respectively for wam and wwiii which show a higher deviation between the wwiii model and observations hence mpi is 0 95 and 0 77 indicating a good performance by wam and only a moderate performance using wwiii at the buoy location fig 19c shows the comparison between the observed sw5 and predicted tm for the period may to december 2000 the model predicted tm using wam and wwiii as shown in fig 19c reveal lower correlations with the sw5 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 68 and 0 59 for wam and wwiii respectively with si values 0 29 and 0 48 the values of bias are 0 81s and 0 90s respectively for wam and wwiii which reveals significant underestimation by both models the rmse is high such as 0 95s and 1 09s for wam and wwiii respectively which indicate a weak fit between the model and observations pe is 19 7 for wam and 28 8 for wwiii which reveals poor performance of the models with mpi 0 73 and 0 61 the wam and wwiii predicted tm as shown in fig 19d reveal correlations of the order r 0 7 with sw6 observations the correlation coefficients are 0 79 and 0 86 for wam and wwiii respectively with si values 0 71 and 0 48 the bias values are 1 47s and 1 16s for tm respectively as the predicted values are seen to be higher using wam indicating overestimation of hs and underestimation by wwiii the rmse values are also high such as 0 71s and 0 48s which suggests weak fit between the model and observations the pe is 26 7 and 21 6 respectively for wam and wwiii indicating deviations between the model and observations with mpi 0 67 and 0 75 respectively fig 20 shows the comparison between the buoy ob10 off chidambaram and predicted wave parameters hs and tm at 6 hourly intervals for the period 01 31 january 2009 the estimated model predicted parameters as shown in fig 21 shows strong correlation with the observations the buoy and wam hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 97 and a si of 0 02 estimated bias and rmse are 0 01 m and 0 02 m respectively which reveal a good agreement between the model and observations with pe of 11 1 the mpi is high enough 0 98 indicating that the wam model could simulate hs very well at ob10 location similar comparison is made between buoy ob10 data and model mike 21 sw derived wave heights at one buoy location in bay of bengal ob10 for october 2008 to august 2009 by sabique et al 2012 the comparisons show that the model derived wave parameters agree well with the observed wave parameters the statistics gave a correlation of 0 93 rmse 0 30 bias 0 11 and si 0 19 for hs the wwiii model predicted parameters both hs and tm as shown in fig 20 show significant correlation with the observations the ob10 buoy versus wwiii hindcast hs show a correlation coefficient of 0 98 and si of 0 01 estimated bias and rmse are 0 01 m and 0 01 m respectively both revealing a better agreement between the model and observations with pe of 9 0 the mpi is also high enough 0 99 indicating that the model could simulate hs very well at ob10 location samiksha et al 2012 have reported the results of wwiii validation using niot buoy data ds5 for the period january to february 2006 which is located north of ob10 it indicates a satisfactory agreement between the model and buoy hs with the r value of 0 92 using ncep winds in another validation exercise involving a long term wwiii hindcast of 30 year period 1979 2009 using climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr winds of ncep has revealed that b rmse and si varied from 0 97 to 0 90 0 21 to 2 42 and 0 09 to 0 35 respectively between the model hs and the ndbc buoy measurements in the atlantic gulf of mexico buoys and pacific hawaii buoys oceans chawla et al 2013 in the comparisons of tm the results shows reasonably a good correlation r 0 85 between buoy and wam hindcast the si of 0 11 indicates a good fit between the observed tm and wam hindcast hindcast tm shows a considerable bias of 0 49s the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 56s 8 7 and 0 89 respectively all of them estimated statistics reveal very good agreement between the model and buoy ob10 observations excepting for few observations as seen from fig 20b tm comparisons by sabique et al 2012 at buoy location in bay of bengal ob10 gave a correlation of 0 67 rmse 1 2s bias 0 81s and si 0 21 tm also show reasonably a better correlation r 0 89 between buoy measurements and wwiii hindcast the si of 0 11 for tm indicates a good fit between the observed and hindcast tm using wwiii the model hindcast and the observed tm show a bias of 0 51s which is within a well acceptable range the values of rmse pe and mpi are 0 53s 8 9 and 0 92 respectively therefore all the above estimated statistics reveal a very good overall agreement between the model and buoy ob10 observations excepting for few observations as seen from fig 20 it was evident from both model and observations that there was an overall trend in wave heights showing a reasonable match with buoy observations the deviations can be attributed to the differences in the wind input parameterization in the models which shows varied response to relatively fast changes in wind speed the deviations in hs and tm at the buoy locations can be due to many reasons the quality of the wind forcing is essential for the good performance of the wave model it also determines to a large extent the evolution of the forecast errors janssen 1998 it is known that wave spectral directional spreads have a tendency to be too broad partly due to the limited number of directional bins used by the numerical models an increase in angular resolution has a positive impact on the quality of the modeled waves it also illustrates the benefit of an increase in angular resolution of the discretized wave spectrum the accuracy of swell propagation over large distances in models is critically controlled by angular resolution and hence it is likely that significant improvements can be produced when angular resolution is improved a systematic bias might be present in the wind analysis which in turn could explain some of the analyzed wave height underestimation in deep water models wam wwiii some of these underestimations when linked to local wave growth might in part be explained by this systematic negative bias in analyzed wind speed further the different parametrization of the source terms responsible for the wind input and dissipation in the wave energy balance equation of the wave models is also a major factor another feature noted is that there exits larger deviation in hs and tm at locations sw1 sw4 and sw5 and sw6 it is also to be pointed out that wam and wwiii are global deep water models which can predict waves accurately up to 30 m water depth since they include crude shallow water equations which does not satisfy nearshore wave transformations hence it provides poor correlation for shallow water waves however the deep water hindcasts have been compared with the buoy observations at 16 24 m in the absence of measurements at preferable locations where water depth is more than 30 m it was seen in most cases the pe values were greater than 20 excepting in few cases where it was lower it may be noted that sw1 sw4 sw5 and sw6 are shallow water buoys with depths less than 25 m and not deep water buoys and that is the reason for obtaining comparatively lesser correlation than deep water buoys therefore by considering the buoy data from such locations bordering 30 m of water depth were found to be useful to assess and evaluate the extent of agreement between the models and buoy at deeper than 15 m which is the limiting depth for near shore wave transformations further this shows the need of coupling a global or regional model with a shallow water or nearshore model for receiving accurate shallow water prediction 5 5 validation of wam wwiii hindcasts using satellite measurements in the indian seas apart from buoy measurements attempts were also made to validate the wam and wwiii hindcasts using satellite altimeter measurements in this study to validate the wam and wwiii simulated hs the jason 1 hs was used for a period june 2008 to june 2009 the wam and wwiii simulated hs was compared at 2 locations fig 1 such as w1 17 n 65 e in the arabian sea and e1 15 n 87 e in the bay of bengal with depths 3580 m and 2918 m respectively fig 21 shows the comparison of simulated wam wwiii hs with altimeter measurements for the selected locations w1 and e1 respectively comparison between jason 1 and model hs fig 21 shows that the modeled hs match fairly well with the remotely sensed observations jason 1 for larger waves an underestimation has been observed in the model significant wave heights the estimated statistics for the comparison of model hs with altimeter measurements during june 2008 to june 2009 is shown in table 7 in the arabian sea good correlation is found between the two models at the location w1 fig 21 a with correlation coefficients 0 91 and 0 85 respectively it is noted that there is an overestimation of 0 21 m hs by wam and an underestimation of 0 19 m using wwiii at w1 location in the arabian sea the rmse are of the order 0 37 m and 0 44 m respectively with si 0 24 and 0 59 overall both wam and wwiii performed fairly well with pe 14 2 and 19 6 and mpi 0 89 and 0 81 respectively again the statistical parameters show the reliability of the wave models used as well as the use of altimeter data for comparison validation the results in this study are comparable with the statistics of validation of wwiii using altimeter data ifremer cersat altimeter hs database in the north indian ocean as reported by samiksha et al 2012 further in a study by remya et al 2012 2014 it is indicated that mike 21 sw model derived hs are in good agreement with jason 1 altimeter hs in the southern as well as in the northern indian oceans fig 21b shows the comparison between jason 1 and model significant wave heights at e1 location in the bay of bengal comparison of model and altimeter hs shows good agreement corresponding r of 0 95 0 88 using wam wwiii during june 2008 to june 2009 it is noted an overestimation of the hs by the wam model in comparison to altimeter data during the period of study the altimeter data shows that the bias obtained indicates that the predicted wwiii outputs underestimates the hs compared with the altimeter the bias values obtained are 0 27 m and 0 21 m using wam and wwiii at the location e1 in bay of bengal a positive bias indicates overestimation of the hs by the wam model with respect to altimeter high values of rmse 0 32 m 0 43 m also indicate the deviation by the model in comparison to altimeter data the si values obtained are 0 31 and 0 46 using wam and wwiii respectively with pe 16 7 and 21 3 overall the model revealed high mpi of the order 0 92 and 0 87 respectively this shows that the model performs well at deep waters both in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal the results are in accordance with the findings by aboobacker 2010 in which it is reported that good correlation is found between the hs simulated by mike 21 sw model and jason 1 measurements at two locations off goa and off paradip in the arabian sea and bay of bengal respectively with correlation coefficients 0 96 and 0 90 respectively even though there is slight over estimation off goa and an under estimation off paradip the model performs well at deep waters both in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal it is indicated from fig 21 that in both locations wam proved to give a better performance as compared with wwiii the deviations in the model can be partly attributed to the quality of wind inputs physics numeric and model grid resolution apart from that the altimetry data is inherently noisy the jason measurements are also somewhat more prone to noise and outliers and the most problematic aspect of the jason 1 dataset is the dearth of measured small waves ray and beckley 2010 and also can be attributed to random errors in measurements and therefore not indicative of systematic errors in jason 1 data chelton et al 2001 6 conclusions in this study two state of the art third generation wave models wam cycle 4 5 3 and wwiii 3 14 have been successfully implemented globally for their inter comparisons and were applied in hindcast mode to simulate the wave regime in the north indian ocean for a two year period using era 40 and quikscat ncep blended winds and the results are validated with the measurements the modeled wave parameters show good correlation with the measured data this is an interesting exercise as a systematic inter comparison of wave model results is not often reported especially for the north indian ocean this is the first and one of the initial attempts to study the comparison of wave hindcasts using wam and wwiii in the north indian ocean wave parameters obtained from the hindcasts have been analyzed to understand the quality and variability associated with the individual model outputs based on the study in this paper the following summary and conclusions are presented in this inter comparison study we have implemented the models wam and wwiii globally and the global implementation of wam and wwiii 77 s to 77 n and 0 to 360 e over 1 1 resolution could successfully cater to the swells propagating from the southern ocean to the north indian ocean the simulations wave hindcasts were carried out successfully for the global domain regional domain north indian ocean for the period january to december 2000 using era 40 winds and june 2008 to june 2009 using quikscat ncep blended winds in the cases considered for inter comparison in this investigation the hindcast outputs such as significant wave height hs mean wave period tm and swell wave height hsw have been inter compared for selected months january april july and october 2000 july 2008 and january 2009 in the north indian ocean the inter comparison of wam and wwiii hindcast parameters such as hs tm and hsw in the north indian ocean showed percentage errors such as 2 5 12 3 4 5 18 3 3 0 10 8 and 4 7 17 1 for january april june july and october respectively by revealing a good agreement between wam and wwiii to summarize the inter comparisons of wam and wwiii in the north indian ocean the results of this study are highly encouraging for january june and july with percentage deviation mostly ranging from 3 0 to 12 3 except during april pre monsoon and october post monsoon months which can be attributed to the quality of the input winds further since wave growth and dispersion are determined by the actions of wind most of the wave model errors are attributed to inaccuracies in representing winds the validation of wam and wwiii hindcasts using moored buoy measurements proved promising enough in the arabian sea and bay of bengal during the study period the percentage error in the arabian sea for hs and tm for all buoys considered varied in the range 12 7 27 9 and 13 6 26 9 respectively similarly in the bay of bengal the pe ranged from 10 8 to 25 6 and 8 7 28 8 for hs and tm respectively it is noted that models gave best performances in the bay of bengal in simulating hs while tm was best simulated in the arabian sea although underestimation and overestimation of hs and tm were noted at the buoy locations in the arabian sea and bay of bengal it is demonstrated that hindcasts using wam were able to reproduce hs and tm at the buoy location with lesser pe of the order 8 9 26 7 as compared to wwiii 14 8 28 8 while using wam the performance of the model was much better in the arabian sea 13 6 23 7 wwiii performed similar in both arabian sea and bay of bengal but with slightly higher errors the comparison between the hs data from the jason 1 altimeter and the wam and wwiii hindcast at selected location in the arabian sea and bay of bengal shows that the altimeter data showed fairly good correlation of the order 0 85 to 0 95 the pe was lesser 14 2 16 7 in the arabian sea and bay of bengal using wam as compared with wwiii 19 6 21 3 the lower hs of altimeter observations in comparison with wam and wwiii hs observed during june 2008 to june 2009 in the arabian sea and bay of bengal may be due to the fact that the altimetry data is inherently noisy random errors in measurements and dearth of measured small waves based on both qualitative as well as quantitative assessment of the model results the present study clearly indicate that the models wam and wwiii performed well in their respective model domains using era 40 and quikscat ncep blended winds and they can be confidently used for long term hindcasting as well as operational forecasting for the north indian ocean all the validation results point to the fact that the performance of the models is quite satisfactory overall the inter comparisons and validation results of this study suggests that wam hindcasts can be considered better than wwiii model outputs it is also seen that the hindcast results of wam are found to be better by considering the cases presented in this paper whereas it must be taken into consideration and noted that wwiii being the latest model uses most superior recent physics of wave generation wave current interaction and air sea temperature difference as an additional input and its numerical approaches are much superior to wam hence it can be concluded with reasonable confidence that the model with this particular configuration can serve the purpose of reliable wave hindcasts in the indian ocean region therefore it would be wise to have long term measurements in the north indian ocean to validate using sea truth data and inter compare wam and wwiii
