3225,although the northern laurentian great lakes region is projected to undergo major climate changes it has had a paucity of future groundwater recharge studies we used the state of minnesota usa as a testbed to understand how recharge will respond to changing climate in upper mid latitude low elevation temperate settings not only can this inform water resource management but it can help probe difficult to predict sign changes in recharge in temperate zones as well as the under studied land surface processes controlling them our study implemented the community land model with ensemble outputs from five climate models under two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 to investigate future changes in recharge for 2026 2055 relative to the baseline historical period of 1976 2005 we found that despite quite consistent projections of higher precipitation p and some local occurrences of increased recharge state average recharge will mostly decline or remain about the same due to warming induced evapotranspiration et increases however our simulations showed that several processes serve to buffer recharge decreases in drier ecoregions in the west soil moisture limitations start to constrain evapotranspiration thus curbing reductions in recharge these regions also include higher historical surface runoff due to its runoff prone soils and because much of future reductions in net atmospheric inputs p et are partitioned to lower this runoff instead of recharge decreases in recharge are further modulated statewide warming also lessens frozen ground coverage reapportioning early spring runoff of snowmelt to infiltration and recharge our results demonstrate that in addition to precipitation change and warming moisture feedbacks on et and the influence of hydrogeological properties and frozen ground dynamics on runoff must be considered when quantifying climate change impacts on recharge in temperate zones keywords groundwater recharge climate change hydrologic modeling evapotranspiration runoff 1 introduction predicting future recharge changes is important as climate change is imposing additional stresses on water resources taylor et al 2013 d√∂ll et al 2018 green et al 2011 recently amanambu et al 2020 presented a comprehensive review of groundwater modeling studies in the past 5 years that focused on climate impacts among the 40 local to global scale studies 33 looked at future trends of recharge highlighting the concerns about impacts on recharge however despite the growing number of studies amanambu et al 2020 pointed to persisting gaps in the understanding of complex physical processes and feedback mechanisms especially at regional scales which complicate our ability to predict climate driven changes in recharge in fact out of the 40 reviewed studies in amanambu et al 2020 only 5 studies were conducted at a regional scale that is important for many resource management decisions previous regional studies reveal that recharge responses to climate change can be highly uncertain because even the direction of change in recharge can widely differ among predictions although ubiquitous projections of warming and corresponding increases in et often lead to predictions of decreased recharge around the world atawneh et al 2021 this effect can be counteracted if precipitation will increase sufficiently within the global compilation by amanambu et al 2020 studies in the arid semi arid tropics showed the most consistent results of decreased recharge due to lower projected precipitation but recharge responses in temperate regions were harder to anticipate nearly half the temperate region studies cited in amanambu et al 2020 predicted increases in recharge because of higher precipitation yet other studies with predicted decreases in recharge also occurred under increased precipitation this demonstrates that recharge change direction cannot always be easily determined by precipitation change for example most european countries with a projected increase in precipitation are predicted to experience a decrease in recharge atawneh et al 2021 amanambu et al 2020 lists several sources of uncertainty in recharge estimation including under representing the range of future climate projections not accounting for anthropogenic influences like groundwater abstraction using baseline climate of less than 30 years and relying on overly simplified hydrological models to predict recharge while these factors may contribute to the highly variable sign predictions in temperate zone recharge complexities in hydrological processes are likely also responsible for the range in recharge responses to precipitation change for example although their study focused on a semi arid site in southeast spain pulido velazquez et al 2014 showed that recharge can increase even with a decrease in future precipitation due to more extreme rainfall events in the us regional studies on future climate change impacts on recharge have mostly focused on the western part of the country likely motivated by more intensive groundwater usage there compared to other parts of the country perrone and jasechko 2017 these western studies often showed decreases in recharge in southern areas alongside mostly lower projected precipitation and increases in northern areas together with mostly higher projected precipitation e g meixner et al 2016 niraula et al 2017 although some studies found increased recharge in the southwestern u s mckenna and sala 2018 the heavily exploited high plains ogallala aquifer has also received considerable attention with studies showing high vulnerability to precipitation changes ng et al 2010 as well as similar increasing south to north trends in recharge change direction crosbie et al 2013 as in many western studies the latitudinal trends in recharge change direction in the high plains mirror south to north increases in projected precipitation how groundwater recharge will react to changing climate in the northern laurentian great lakes upper great lakes region has remained under studied likely because groundwater availability in this region is currently considered to be minimally stressed reilly et al 2008 however the paucity of regional recharge studies there represents a societally critical gap because agriculture plays a major role in the economy pryor et al 2014 and it is becoming increasingly dependent on groundwater fed irrigation lark et al 2015 further several studies over the past decade have shown that climate around the upper great lakes will likely undergo major changes by the end of the 21st century e g byun and hamlet 2018 hayhoe et al 2010 pryor et al 2014 including some of the highest rates of warming in the country and projected wetter conditions in the cool season and drier conditions in the warm season thus far investigations of the hydrological impacts of this regional climate change focused on streamflow and found general decreases byun et al 2019 cherkauer and sinha 2010 demaria et al 2016 chien et al 2013 but changes in recharge were not discussed a review by larocque et al 2019 included six future recharge studies at the watershed scale from the great lakes region but found no agreement in their estimates of changes in future recharge conditions persaud et al 2020 further provided a watershed study in southwestern ontario that showed little climate change impact on future groundwater levels due to largely unchanged net surface subsurface water exchanges but it is unclear how well this represents other parts of the upper great lakes region walker et al 2008 simulated lake level changes with a coupled groundwater surface water model in a northern wisconsin watershed under different climate change scenarios but did not analyze changes in groundwater recharge recharge predictions in the upper great lakes region would not only inform groundwater resource management but they would also provide further understanding about highly variable and difficult to predict recharge change directions in temperate settings this includes addressing open questions particular to temperate settings about how future alterations to strongly seasonal temperature regimes can impact snowmelt driven recharge studies show that changing climate is significantly altering snow dynamics collados lara et al 2019 viviroli et al 2011 although climate change studies on runoff in the upper great lakes region have considered snowmelt change effects byun et al 2019 johnson and stefan 2006 chien et al 2013 little is known about how they will impact recharge there studies that looked at the future impact of changing snowmelt on recharge have focused on mountain catchments tague and peng 2013 chen et al 2018 lucianetti et al 2020 in an analysis of historical snowmelt data across the state of michigan usa in the great lakes region ford et al 2020 found warmer winters to have earlier and less snowmelt accompanied by decreased net recharge this suggests that future recharge may respond negatively to projected increases in winter temperatures although it is not known how this will be balanced by future changes in other climatic factors such as precipitation or warming during the rest of the year our study addresses the critical gap in future recharge studies in the upper great lakes region using a model that represents the range of land surface to subsurface processes needed to probe generally unresolved temperate zone responses to future climate change we use the state of minnesota usa as not only a case study in the upper great lakes region but also to explore a range of conditions found in upper mid latitude temperate settings minnesota provides a useful testbed because of its distinct west east precipitation gradient average of 50 to 90 cm yr and north south temperature gradient annual average of 2 3 to 8 c along with its varied vegetation cover cropland grassland and forest and hydrogeological properties lacustrine clay deposits to sandy outwash plains we build off our previous study anurag et al 2021 that leveraged statewide datasets to simulate groundwater recharge in the state over the historical period of 2000 2015 in the current study we implement the community land model clm oleson et al 2013 to assess future changes in recharge across the state and we identify processes driving these changes by analyzing gridded predictions across minnesota we are able to assess variability in the relative effects of precipitation and temperature changes on recharge as well as evaluate factors outside of atmospheric forcing changes that further complicate our ability to predict climate change impacts on recharge the specific aims of this study are to i predict recharge changes over a range of conditions found in the upper great lakes region ii determine the relative importance of precipitation change versus warming on both recharge change direction and magnitude and iii evaluate how land surface processes such as soil moisture feedbacks and seasonal runoff recharge partitioning further influence recharge changes our predictions of future recharge changes can also help guide management of water resources in the state where 78 of the population relies on groundwater for its drinking water and 88 of total irrigation withdrawal comes from groundwater kenny et al 2005 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area is the state of minnesota usa the state is home to about 5 6 million people 2010 census mostly concentrated in the urban center of the minneapolis st paul twin cities area about 40 of the state is cropland used to grow mainly corn and soybeans minnesota has a typical continental climate with hot summers and cold winters the state has a distinct precipitation gradient with the precipitation decreasing from east southeast to west northwest fig 1 a the precipitation is also seasonal with about 75 of it occurring during may to september the us environmental pollution agency epa divides minnesota into five major ecological provinces or ecoregions white 2020 fig 1b we refer to the province in the west and southwestern area as the great plains gp which includes 75 coverage of cropland the thick clayey sediment found in the northern part of gp further leads us to divide gp into the northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp the central hardwood forests chf extends diagonally from southeast to northwest and consists of temperate deciduous forests along with crops and grassland we refer to the northern and northeastern part of the state as northern forests nf and it consists mainly of mixed coniferous and deciduous temperate forests there is a vast stretch of peat on the former lake bed in the northern part of the state that we refer to as northern wetlands and lastly the driftless area in the southeast part of the state is a karst dominated region as in our previous work anurag et al 2021 we focus our current analysis on the four regions of ngp sgp chf and nf because of the well known limitations of common hydrological and land surface models in complex systems of wetland and karst regions hartmann et al 2017 ringeval et al 2012 in our previous study anurag et al 2021 we estimated lower historical recharge in the more arid western ecoregions compared to the more humid eastern ecoregions fig 1b 2 2 model description we implemented the community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 at a spatial resolution of 25 km for estimating groundwater recharge in minnesota clm provides the terrestrial component of the national center for atmospheric research s ncar larger community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 clm is a spatially distributed model that includes process based representations of land surface biogeophysics biogeochemistry hydrology and vegetation the one dimensional soil profile in clm is divided into 10 layers the thickness of each layer increases exponentially until a depth of 3 8 m the upper boundary condition is governed by infiltration and surface runoff while an unconfined aquifer makes up the lower boundary condition for the layered soil column the aquifer can exchange water with the layered soil column and the water table can extend up into the layered soil column if the aquifer reaches its maximum water holding capacity instead of explicitly representing lateral movement of water from the soil column clm uses a simplified subsurface drainage representation described below we consider this simplified parameterization to be an acceptable trade off for computational efficiency given the relatively low relief minimum of 183 m a s l and maximum of 701 m a s l across minnesota surface runoff is determined through 1 surface runoff f max exp 0 5 f over z q liq where f max is the potential or maximum value of fractional saturated area f over is a characteristic decay factor m 1 z is the water table depth m and q liq is the sum of liquid precipitation reaching the ground and meltwater from snow kg m 2 sec 1 the soil moisture dynamics of each layer in the upper soil column is calculated using a modified form of the 1d vertical richards equation zeng and decker 2009 following niu et al 2007 the water table depth and recharge are calculated based on the position of the water table when the water table is located within the discretized soil column less than 3 8 m darcy s law is applied across the water table 2 q recharge k aq œà œà jwt z z jwt where œà 0 is the matric potential at the water table at depth z subscript jwt denotes the index of the layer directly above the water table and k aq is the hydraulic conductivity of the layer containing the water table jwt 1 when the water table is located below the discretized soil column deeper than 3 8 m recharge is set to potential recharge or the net flux of water out of the last layer in the soil column this is calculated by using the modified 1d richards equation for an additional soil layer between the upper discretized soil column and the underlying unconfined aquifer assuming no vertical flux across the bottom the change in water content

decay factor parameter and q drai max depends on topography discharge of subsurface drainage into surface waters is explicitly simulated only with clm s optional river transport model which we did not invoke because surface water routing was not a focus of our study the default representation of vegetation in clm uses plant functional types pfts and climatological lai derived from modis satellite data over the years 2001 2003 and at a base resolution of 0 05 lawrence and chase 2007 for this study we replaced the default clm vegetation inputs with climatological monthly lai generated by anurag et al 2021 using an updated 16 year 2000 2015 dynamic dataset details about this climatological lai including the method used to convert total lai from the global land surface satellite glass product xiao et al 2014 into pft level lai can be found in anurag et al 2021 clm soil parameters including hydraulic parameters for the modified richards equation surface runoff parameters and subsurface drainage parameters were calibrated by anurag et al 2021 using the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 and statewide observations of water table depth from the minnesota department of natural resources s mndnr cooperative groundwater management cgm database www dnr state mn us waters cgm in this study we carried out historical and future model simulations with the posterior 100 member ensemble parameter estimates from anurag et al 2021 we took the ensemble median of these simulations as the final result 2 3 future climate data the climate data from an ensemble of general circulation models gcms were used as the atmospheric forcing to drive clm we used the statistically downscaled climate model dataset multivariate adaptive constructed analogs version 2 meteorological data macav2 metdata abatzoglou and brown 2012 for this study this data product contains daily downscaled meteorological variables for historical 1950 2005 conditions and future 2025 2099 experiments under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios at a spatial resolution of 4 km covering the continental usa rcp4 5 is an intermediate scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and then decline rcp8 5 is the more extreme scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century for our study we compared the climate predictions for a 30 year future spanning 2026 2055 with the historical period from 1976 2005 the macav2 metdata data product contains climate data from 20 gcms that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 to focus our analysis and reduce the computational cost we used data from five of the 20 gcms in macav2 metdata with the aim of capturing a roughly representative range in projected climate the full set of 20 gcms generally agree on a warmer future however there is notable variability in predictions of future precipitation to select our subset of five gcms table 1 we calculated the difference in precipitation between the rcp8 5 future and the 30 year average historical precipitation for all 20 gcms and then we chose the gcms with the lowest and with the greatest increase in future precipitation under rcp8 5 along with 25th 50th and 75th percentile change it should be noted that among these selected gcms the order of driest to wettest future for the rcp4 5 scenario differs from the rcp8 5 scenario indicating that rcp8 5 does not simply represent an intensification of rcp4 5 conditions in terms of precipitation for the rcp8 5 scenario the gcms predicting driest to wettest future are in order ccsm4 noresm gfdl csiro and canesm while for rcp4 5 they are csiro canesm noresm ccsm4 and gfdl 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate variables 3 1 1 statewide spatiotemporal average changes for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios we see significant climate shifts over minnesota changes in precipitation are depicted in fig 2 all other climate variables are shown in fig s1 as mentioned above gcms generally agree on increasing temperatures in the future the five gcms used in our study predict a future statewide average increase in temperature ranging from 1 5 to 2 9 c for the rcp8 5 scenario and 1 4 to 2 7 c for rcp4 5 all five of the selected gcms except csiro predict higher average temperatures under the more extreme rcp8 5 scenario compared to rcp4 5 there is more variability among gcms and emissions scenarios in the precipitation projections compared to temperature for both emissions scenarios four of the five selected gcms predict a slight to moderate average precipitation increase in minnesota and one of the five predicts slightly less precipitation for the rcp8 5 conditions the projected increase ranges from 2 to 9 1 while the single gcm ccsm4 with the drier future shows a decrease of 3 3 in precipitation for the rcp4 5 scenario the increase ranges from 0 4 to 6 9 with the one drier gcm csiro predicting a 2 6 decrease in precipitation for two gcms ccsm4 and csiro we see switches in sign in the precipitation change between the two emissions scenarios noresm and canesm predict a greater increase in precipitation in the rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 while gfdl predicts a lower increase in rcp8 5 overall the projected precipitation change varies more across the gcms under the rcp8 5 3 3 to 9 7 than the rcp4 5 2 6 to 6 9 scenario all five gcms predict a decrease in snowfall over the state under both the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios snowfall decreases range from 1 to 10 4 for the rcp8 5 scenario and 4 to 13 3 for the rcp4 5 scenario 3 1 2 seasonal changes seasonal trends appear in the projected changes in climatic variables under both the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios the majority of gcms predict an increase in precipitation during spring amj and fall on and a decrease in summer jas precipitation fig 3 a we also see a shift in the timing of snowmelt to earlier months for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 conditions specifically snowmelt occurring in march increases on average across the five gcm by 2 2 and 2 9 cm yr under the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 conditions respectively and there is a corresponding average decrease in snowmelt in april of 4 1 and 5 1 cm yr fig 3b notable seasonal changes in other climatic variables include winter and summer temperature increases full seasonal gcm results in fig s3 and fig s4 3 1 3 ecoregion specific changes spatial trends occur in climate projections across the state s ecoregions while temperature changes are quite homogeneous in space differences of 0 3 to 0 7 c relative to the range predicted across the gcms differences of 1 4 to 2 9 c precipitation changes exhibit far more spatial variability fig 4 and 5 for example the nf region most frequently experiences an increase in precipitation among various gcms while ngp and sgp most often have the least increase or greatest decrease in precipitation 3 2 changes in recharge 3 2 1 statewide spatiotemporal average changes the recharge predicted by clm under different gcm projections shows vulnerability to climate change with simulated future changes ranging from 45 to 26 compared to 3 3 to 9 7 change in precipitation fig 2 it is notable that even though most gcms predict a slight to moderate increase in future precipitation a majority of recharge predictions show at least a moderate decrease 15 specifically under the rcp8 5 scenario for the two gcms predicting either a decrease or only a slight increase in future precipitation ccsm4 and noresm the model projects a significant decrease in statewide 30 year average recharge of 45 and 37 respectively fig 2a for the three remaining gcms that predict a stronger increase in future precipitation ranging from 5 4 to 10 under rcp8 5 clm estimates just a small increase in statewide average recharge ranging from 1 9 to 3 8 under the rcp4 5 scenario we see clm predicting a decrease in statewide recharge ranging from 18 8 to 38 3 for four out of five gcms fig 2b only one gcm gfdl that also predicts the highest increase in future precipitation and the lowest increase in temperature results in an increase in recharge of 26 4 the overall seasonal future recharge trend is similar to historical recharge with the strongest peak in spring amj and a smaller peak in fall on but seasonal changes do appear fig 3c the peak spring recharge starts up to a month earlier moves from may to april and the peak decreases but broadens over time lasts two months instead of one under both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios 3 2 2 ecoregion specific changes for each ecoregion predictions include both increases and decreases in future recharge with decreases appearing more commonly similar to the statewide results fig 2 however the predicted recharge changes magnitude and sometimes sign vary across ecoregions within test cases the rcp8 5 scenario shows the strongest spatial recharge variabilities with its three wettest climate projections gfdl csiro and canesm although the average statewide change in recharge is very small in these three cases less than 5 positive and negative changes of up to 35 45 magnitude occur for individual ecoregions fig 2 for both emissions scenarios the largest range across models and magnitudes in relative recharge changes appeared for ngp 80 to 46 despite the somewhat smaller range and magnitudes in relative precipitation changes there 2 to 11 although it should be noted that the large relative recharge changes in np occur due to the small nominal recharge amounts in that drier ecoregion fig 1b and absolute recharge changes in ngp are in fact similar or even smaller compared to in the other ecoregions fig 4 and 5 unexpectedly there are some locations within western sgp and ngp that show measurable increases in recharge changes more than 4 cm yr under decreased precipitation conditions ccsm4 and noresm under rcp8 5 and csiro and canesm under rcp4 5 fig 4 and 5 this is further discussed below 4 discussion drivers of recharge changes 4 1 statewide analysis to evaluate how projected climate drives changes in recharge across the various test cases we compare absolute changes in recharge with changes in precipitation and et the major climate controlled inputs and outputs of water at the land surface we see that within each emissions scenario the trend in predicted recharge change across gcms approximately tracks the trend in precipitation changes but with a downward shift fig 6 this shows that although the sign change in precipitation and recharge do not always match future precipitation trends nonetheless drive trends in recharge changes across the test cases fig 6 also shows that et predicted by clm is consistently higher in the future and this accounts for the downward shift in recharge change relative to the precipitation change the downward shift in recharge is generally greater for the rcp8 5 cases compared to rcp4 5 because of the higher et increase in rcp8 5 with its warmer temperatures although et and precipitation changes are overall similar in magnitude recharge change more closely reflects the trend in precipitation change because precipitation change projections exhibit greater variability across gcms 1 8 to 6 8 cm yr than et changes 4 7 to 7 9 cm yr as expected the increase in et generally follows the trend in temperature change across gcms fig 6 which was previously noted to be more consistent across projections than precipitation visual examination of fig 6 indicates that changes in recharge do not always equate with the difference in precipitation change and et change indicating that other processes also contribute to the recharge response to evaluate how future changes in precipitation will be partitioned into recharge versus other hydrological components we evaluated the water balance for each of the five gcms and the two emissions scenarios 6 Œ¥ rain Œ¥ snow Œ¥ et Œ¥ runoff Œ¥ recharge where Œ¥ future 30 year 2026 2055 average historical 30 year 1976 2005 average and runoff here and elsewhere refers to surface runoff we compare the future and historical water balance components using waterfall charts which are also commonly used in financial analysis wickham 2011 in the waterfall charts fig 7 and 8 positive changes in precipitation variables rain and snowmelt on the left side are plotted in the upward direction while positive changes in the other hydrological variables into which precipitation is partitioned et runoff and recharge are plotted in the downward direction this way when the water balance is closed the final variable on the right side will end at zero upward bars are shown in green indicating an increase of water at the ground surface and downward bars are shown in red indicating a decrease of water at the ground surface note that in fig 7 and 8 the water balance is often not exactly closed at 0 because we are showing the median of the 100 member ensemble simulations for each variable which is not guaranteed to be mass conserving there may also be small soil water storage changes over the 30 years figs 7 and 8 demonstrate that of the hydrological variables into which precipitation is partitioned et almost always across test cases shows the largest future change figs 7 and 8 also make clear that consistently large et increases take up nearly all increases in precipitation when it occurs csiro and canesm under rcp8 5 and they result in substantially negative changes in net water inputs from the atmosphere p et in test cases with mostly unchanged or less precipitation this leads to the notable downshift in recharge change results relative to precipitation change that was previously noted the dominance of et changes highlights that although recharge change trends generally follow precipitation changes across gcms et plays a key role in actual recharge predictions which has also been shown in other temperate zone recharge studies in which high et counteracts the effects of increased precipitation taylor et al 2013 bellot and chirino 2013 wu et al 2020 the one gcm in our study with a relatively small increase in et change is gfdl 3 6 cm yr under rcp8 5 and 0 8 cm yr under rcp4 5 figs 7 and 8 which corresponds to much milder projected warming 1 5 c under rcp8 5 and 1 3 c under rcp4 5 compared to the other test cases fig s1b significantly figs 7 and 8 also demonstrate that when the net atmospheric water input p et change is substantially negative ccsm4 and noresm under rcp8 5 and all gcms apart from gfdl under rcp4 5 the deficit in water inputs is approximately evenly met by reductions in recharge and surface runoff this means that in cases with little change or lower precipitation decreases in recharge are less than what would be expected solely based on p et changes because runoff serves as a critical modulator of recharge response it is also noteworthy that simulated future runoff decreases across nearly all test cases in fact slight runoff reductions for cases with substantial increases in total precipitation and about zero or positive p et changes csiro and canesm under rcp8 5 help allow for positive changes in recharge in those cases although some of these runoff reductions are small in magnitude on an annual basis they could be important seasonally fig 3d shows that runoff is highly seasonal with its peak occurring in the late winter to early spring mam just following peak snowmelt and then tailing off in late spring into summer mjj the largest reductions in runoff occur during the peak time in early spring when snow melts ubiquitous decreases in snowfall and hence snowmelt across test cases likely account for some of the predicted decreases in runoff but it cannot for all compare snow and runoff bars in figs 7 and 8 additional reductions in spring runoff could occur because of increases in et that exceed excess spring rains another possibility is that earlier ground thaw in the future will shift the partitioning between runoff and recharge towards recharge as further explored next simulations show that march soil temperatures in the top 10 cm will warm from an average of 0 5 c across historical simulations to 0 3 c under rcp4 5 and 0 4 c under rcp8 5 in the future this warming to above freezing coincides with a major decrease in future april runoff and a moderate decrease in future april recharge fig 3c d water balance inferences reveal that some of the major reduction in spring runoff must correspond with shifts to recharge likely due to the earlier future ground thaw in fig 9 early spring Œ¥ runoff is often less than early spring Œ¥ p et falls below the 1 1 line in a scatter plot and it can even be negative for Œ¥ p et 0 where Œ¥ again indicates future minus historical averages this corresponds to runoff reducing more than net atmospheric inputs decrease when Œ¥ p et 0 and to runoff reducing despite net atmospheric inputs increasing when Œ¥ p et 0 because p et is partitioned into runoff versus infiltration and eventually recharge both cases of runoff reduction exceeding what can be explained by changes in atmospheric water inputs suggest that some amount of the net atmospheric water inputs that would have historically run off will instead infiltrate in the future likely because of the increased infiltration capacity of soils after thawing the tendency away from runoff toward infiltration and eventually recharge in the future is greater for the warmer rcp8 5 scenario than rcp4 5 symbols fall farther below the 1 1 in fig 9a compared to fig 9b supporting the idea that the shift occurs in response to more warming and thawing of frozen ground also compared to early spring summer results look very different with no ecoregion scale occurrences of negative Œ¥ runoff when Œ¥ p et 0 and smaller magnitude runoff reductions than decreases in net atmospheric water inputs when Œ¥ p et 0 fig 9 this indicates that in the summer when there are no frozen ground changes that can shift runoff to recharge runoff responds directly to changes in net atmospheric water inputs which are partitioned between runoff and recharge late spring and summer runoff mostly decrease because of overall lower projected summer precipitation and increased temperature which not only reduce net atmospheric water inputs but also generate drier ground conditions that limit saturation excess runoff as noted earlier predicted recharge also exhibits seasonal changes similar to runoff the lower and earlier spring recharge can be attributed to a decreased and shifted snowmelt peak figs 3b c the more sustained recharge peak may correspond to the increase in spring mam precipitation fig 3a as well as the possible thaw driven re partitioning of runoff to recharge as discussed above in the summer jas future recharge is predicted to become even lower to the point of slightly negative recharge indicating net water loss through et under both emission scenarios this corresponds to an overall decrease in summer precipitation and increase in et due to temperature increase 4 1 1 ecoregion specific analysis the differences in predicted recharge change among ecoregions could result from spatial variability in climate projections and or they could be due to distinct land surface properties with which climate interacts ecoregion based characteristics including vegetation and hydrogeology have been found to control historical recharge amounts across minnesota anurag et al 2021 in the model results the spatial distribution of recharge change strongly correlates with precipitation change for test cases with an overall positive change in future precipitation while it corresponds strongly with changes in et when there is less future precipitation fig s6 with temperature acting as an important driver of et temporal correlation of 0 65 between et and temperature averaged across models and scenarios these results show that under both wetter and drier gcm projections recharge change is directly influenced by the underlying spatial patterns of climatic change even though they can be by different climatic variables et depends on factors in addition to climate inputs however in fact regression tests reveal that ecoregion was a more important predictor of future et changes across space compared to temperature change average r2 of 0 35 to predict annual et using ecoregion versus 0 17 using temperature for rcp8 5 indicating that other ecoregion based characteristics also drive spatial variability in et change and consequently recharge change fig 4 and fig 5 show that for each gcm predicted increases in et are smallest in the more arid parts of the state including ngp western sgp and western chf as a result the downshift in recharge change relative to precipitation change is less for these regions as can be seen in fig s5 ecoregion differences in et can be attributed to water limitations in the more arid ecoregions that constrain how much et can increase in the future in np limitations in et increases can account for the smaller magnitude decreases in recharge there while less constrained et increase for the humid nf region can explain why recharge does not show particularly strong increases despite generally higher precipitation there compared to other ecoregions as previously noted in section 3 1 3 spatial correlations table s1 show that in the more humid nf et consistently exhibits negative correlations with soil moisture with statistical significance under cooler historical conditions that correspond to soil moisture responding to et while correlations move toward positive values for the other drier ecoregions more often with statistical significance for the warmest scenarios corresponding to soil moisture availability limiting et as a consequence while in higher precipitation test cases climatic variability across space largely controls ecoregion differences in recharge change in lower precipitation test cases in which et is the main driver a combination of climatic and land surface variabilities affects spatial patterns in recharge change as noted above in section 4 1 future changes in precipitation and et do not fully predict changes in recharge because some of the net change in atmospheric water inputs is also partitioned to runoff anurag et al 2021 showed strong spatial heterogeneity across minnesota in calibrated runoff parameters fig s13 in anurag et al 2021 prompting us to evaluate ecoregion based changes in runoff versus recharge in this study we investigated this through scatter plots of future net atmospheric water input change Œ¥ p et versus recharge change Œ¥ recharge in figs 10 and 11 such that symbols falling on the 1 1 line indicate full partitioning of net atmospheric water input changes to recharge and symbols falling on the horizontal Œ¥ recharge 0 line correspond to full partitioning to runoff scatter plots of gridcell results in figs 10 and 11 show a distinct behavior based on the climatic conditions as well as ecoregion most prominently when Œ¥ p et is greater than 0 Œ¥ p et versus Œ¥ recharge plot mostly around the 1 1 reference line with sometimes a slight bias toward lower Œ¥ recharge in contrast for Œ¥ p et less than 0 the values nearly always plot above the 1 1 line and sometimes extend to the above graph quadrant i e Œ¥ recharge 0 even though Œ¥ p et 0 and there is considerably more scatter than for the half plot with Œ¥ p et 0 when looking at ecoregions the deviations from the 1 1 line are greatest for the more arid ngp and sgp regions and least for the humid nf a number of conclusions can be drawn from these observations from figs 10 and 11 about how future p et changes transfer to recharge for most ecoregions when net atmospheric water inputs become higher in the future Œ¥ p et 0 much of those inputs go to recharge symbols along the 1 1 line although sometimes a part of the excess precipitation first becomes lost to runoff for symbols slightly below the 1 1 line nf experiences the least partitioning of increased p et to runoff which can be attributed to generally smaller surface runoff parameters and runoff fluxes there due to less runoff prone surface soil properties anurag et al 2021 in contrast when there is a future decrease in p et Œ¥ p et 0 partitioning to runoff has a notable influence on recharge change across the board there is nearly always at least some reduction in runoff which not only buffers the decrease in recharge symbols above 1 1 line but even allows for unchanged or even increased recharge in some instances symbols above 0 horizontal line these cases of future recharge increasing despite p et decreasing occur most often in ngp and sgp which can also be seen in figs 4 and 5 as noted above these areas in ngp and sgp include some of the highest surface runoff parameters and historical surface runoff fluxes due to more runoff prone soil properties anurag et al 2021 and so there are larger amounts of runoff that can be readily reduced when Œ¥ p et is very negative the high runoff reductions in ngp and sgp when Œ¥ p et 0 also impacted the statewide waterfall plots which showed large net decreases in atmospheric water inputs being partitioned quite evenly between runoff and recharge rather than preferentially toward reduced recharge the predicted occurrence of increased recharge even with decreased atmospheric water inputs further supports the above idea that some runoff is reapportioned to recharge due to the future reduction of frozen ground conditions runoff likely reduces under this warming driven process regardless of precipitation projection but its effect is clearest when it produces recharge that cannot be explained by increases in p et ubiquitous reduction in runoff independent of precipitation can explain why the reduction in recharge is nearly always lower magnitude than the decrease in p et it can also account for the apparently weak partitioning of future p et additions to runoff symbols around the 1 1 line for p et 0 in figs 10 and 11 some of the excess atmospheric water undoubtedly produces added runoff but that is at least partially offset by reductions in runoff due to the decrease in frozen ground in fact thaw induced runoff reduction under Œ¥ p et 0 likely produces the slight scatter above the 1 1 line in fig 10 the nf prediction for the gfdl projection under rcp4 5 is the only case in which very little net change in runoff appears symbols fall tightly around the 1 1 line in fig 11 this is likely because the very minor projected increase in temperature in that scenario fig 6b does not thaw the ground sufficiently to greatly influence runoff and the less runoff prone soil properties there facilitate infiltration of most of the p et increase interestingly widespread reduction of runoff and consequent preferred partitioning to recharge were evident from both the statewide waterfall plots as well as the ecoregion scatter plots but for different regimes for the statewide waterfall plots decreased runoff when Œ¥ p et 0 highlighted this effect while for ecoregion scatter plots increased recharge when Œ¥ p et 0 made this apparent 4 2 limitations of the study it is difficult to account for all the multiple interacting factors that affect recharge and so our assessment comes with limitations as noted above clm was not formulated to accurately capture the hydrological complexities of wetlands in north central minnesota and karst in southeast minnesota yet previous studies have shown recharge in these types of settings to be sensitive to climate change havril et al 2018 pardo ig√∫zquiza et al 2019 also this study focuses primarily on the effects of climate on recharge and does not consider future changes in land use including expanding crop coverage and agricultural tile drainage practices smith et al 2018 replacement of natural vegetation with crops can significantly alter recharge through changes in transpiration and infiltration scanlon et al 2005 ng et al 2009 and tile drainage substantially shifts hydrological partitioning toward increased runoff smith et al 2018 on the climate side statistically downscaled gcm climate projection data used in this study represent coarse spatiotemporal information future assessments with newly released dynamically downscaled climate data over minnesota liess et al 2022 can provide improved resolutions other considerations included in other future recharge studies but not incorporated here include the impact of higher atmospheric co2 concentrations via vegetation transpiration green et al 2007 and the use of model ensembles for representing model structural uncertainties taylor et al 2013 5 summary and conclusions this study uses clm to predict future changes in groundwater recharge in the state of minnesota as a test case for the upper great lakes region using climate projections from five gcms and two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 we compared the future changes in recharge for 2026 2055 relative to baseline historical conditions in 1976 2005 despite consistent projections of higher precipitation 8 out of 10 test cases across two emissions scenarios we predicted that future recharge across the state will likely decrease 6 out of 10 test cases with a 18 8 45 decrease or remain about the same 2 out of 10 test cases with 10 change the only case with notable increased recharge 26 4 corresponds to the least warm climate projection 1 4 c compared to mean of 2 2 c across test cases which also had among the greater increases in precipitation comparing areas in the state that have the highest groundwater usage based on water use permit locations https www dnr state mn us waters watermgmt section appropriations wateruse html with predicted future recharge changes fig 4c and 5c our study indicates that the chf ecoregion will be particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts with both its strong reliance on groundwater and the state s most consistent projection of recharge decrease especially under rcp4 5 like other temperate studies compiled in amanambu et al 2020 our results show that although it is possible for increases in precipitation to override the effects of higher et with ubiquitous warming the sign change of recharge does not simply correspond to that of precipitation because et often has the prevailing effect nonetheless we found that precipitation change serves as the main driver of differences in recharge predictions across test cases with the trend in recharge change tracking the trend in precipitation change trend but with a downward shift due to higher et this demonstrates that resolving uncertainties in precipitation change will be essential for producing accurate estimates of future recharge in the upper great lakes region we further showed that the balance of precipitation and et changes alone is insufficient for predicting recharge changes because of surface runoff on average across the state substantial reductions in net atmospheric water inputs p et are similarly partitioned between decreases in runoff and in recharge such that decreases in recharge are less than what would be expected solely based on p et changes importantly this demonstrates that even in low relief regions such as the upper great lakes region surface runoff serves as an important modulator of recharge response to climate change the effect of surface runoff has not been closely examined in previous recharge change studies which mostly have focused on climatic forcing changes finer spatial and temporal resolution analysis of predicted recharge changes further reveal land surface processes that influence recharge changes overall we found the main controllers to include soil moisture feedbacks hydrogeologic runoff properties and frost controlled runoff how these different factors affect recharge change depends on precipitation projections under moderate increases to decreases in precipitation we showed that soil moisture availability plays an important role in controlling et changes which in turn drive the spatial distribution of recharge changes across the state with warmer temperatures soil moisture limitations in the more arid western part of the state can curtail the increases in et and correspondingly the decreases in recharge this effect may explain why recharge studies in even more arid parts of the u s western u s and high plains meixner et al 2016 niraula et al 2017 show a simpler correspondence between recharge change direction and precipitation change direction because et changes can be muted due to moisture constraints for runoff effects areas with less runoff prone surface soils nf and parts of chf exhibit the least partitioning of atmospheric water input changes to runoff such that recharge changes most closely mirror p et changes for areas with soils properties that promote runoff ngp and western sgp and chf when atmospheric water inputs are predicted to decrease the buffering of recharge reductions by runoff reductions can be substantial underscoring the role of hydrogeologic properties in mediating the impact of climatic forcing changes on future recharge our predictions further provide new insights into how snowmelt and frost changes can influence hydrological responses to future climate change in temperate regions seasonal simulations indicate that major reductions in runoff and moderate reductions in recharge will occur in the future during the spring just following reduced snowmelt this is consistent with historical observations in the great lakes region of less runoff and recharge during warmer winters ford et al 2020 interestingly our analysis further showed that future decreases in snowmelt can account for some of the large reductions in peak runoff but not all it is likely that warmer temperatures will reduce the amount of frozen ground that drives peak runoff and instead allow greater amounts of infiltration and eventually recharge as a result there will be a thaw driven reapportioning of runoff to recharge which can also buffer recharge reductions in predictions when p et decreases ubiquitous decreases in frost driven runoff with warming can even allow for increased recharge despite lower atmospheric water inputs in areas with historically high runoff our work calls for further investigation into how climate change will impact frozen ground dynamics and its role in hydrological

3225,although the northern laurentian great lakes region is projected to undergo major climate changes it has had a paucity of future groundwater recharge studies we used the state of minnesota usa as a testbed to understand how recharge will respond to changing climate in upper mid latitude low elevation temperate settings not only can this inform water resource management but it can help probe difficult to predict sign changes in recharge in temperate zones as well as the under studied land surface processes controlling them our study implemented the community land model with ensemble outputs from five climate models under two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 to investigate future changes in recharge for 2026 2055 relative to the baseline historical period of 1976 2005 we found that despite quite consistent projections of higher precipitation p and some local occurrences of increased recharge state average recharge will mostly decline or remain about the same due to warming induced evapotranspiration et increases however our simulations showed that several processes serve to buffer recharge decreases in drier ecoregions in the west soil moisture limitations start to constrain evapotranspiration thus curbing reductions in recharge these regions also include higher historical surface runoff due to its runoff prone soils and because much of future reductions in net atmospheric inputs p et are partitioned to lower this runoff instead of recharge decreases in recharge are further modulated statewide warming also lessens frozen ground coverage reapportioning early spring runoff of snowmelt to infiltration and recharge our results demonstrate that in addition to precipitation change and warming moisture feedbacks on et and the influence of hydrogeological properties and frozen ground dynamics on runoff must be considered when quantifying climate change impacts on recharge in temperate zones keywords groundwater recharge climate change hydrologic modeling evapotranspiration runoff 1 introduction predicting future recharge changes is important as climate change is imposing additional stresses on water resources taylor et al 2013 d√∂ll et al 2018 green et al 2011 recently amanambu et al 2020 presented a comprehensive review of groundwater modeling studies in the past 5 years that focused on climate impacts among the 40 local to global scale studies 33 looked at future trends of recharge highlighting the concerns about impacts on recharge however despite the growing number of studies amanambu et al 2020 pointed to persisting gaps in the understanding of complex physical processes and feedback mechanisms especially at regional scales which complicate our ability to predict climate driven changes in recharge in fact out of the 40 reviewed studies in amanambu et al 2020 only 5 studies were conducted at a regional scale that is important for many resource management decisions previous regional studies reveal that recharge responses to climate change can be highly uncertain because even the direction of change in recharge can widely differ among predictions although ubiquitous projections of warming and corresponding increases in et often lead to predictions of decreased recharge around the world atawneh et al 2021 this effect can be counteracted if precipitation will increase sufficiently within the global compilation by amanambu et al 2020 studies in the arid semi arid tropics showed the most consistent results of decreased recharge due to lower projected precipitation but recharge responses in temperate regions were harder to anticipate nearly half the temperate region studies cited in amanambu et al 2020 predicted increases in recharge because of higher precipitation yet other studies with predicted decreases in recharge also occurred under increased precipitation this demonstrates that recharge change direction cannot always be easily determined by precipitation change for example most european countries with a projected increase in precipitation are predicted to experience a decrease in recharge atawneh et al 2021 amanambu et al 2020 lists several sources of uncertainty in recharge estimation including under representing the range of future climate projections not accounting for anthropogenic influences like groundwater abstraction using baseline climate of less than 30 years and relying on overly simplified hydrological models to predict recharge while these factors may contribute to the highly variable sign predictions in temperate zone recharge complexities in hydrological processes are likely also responsible for the range in recharge responses to precipitation change for example although their study focused on a semi arid site in southeast spain pulido velazquez et al 2014 showed that recharge can increase even with a decrease in future precipitation due to more extreme rainfall events in the us regional studies on future climate change impacts on recharge have mostly focused on the western part of the country likely motivated by more intensive groundwater usage there compared to other parts of the country perrone and jasechko 2017 these western studies often showed decreases in recharge in southern areas alongside mostly lower projected precipitation and increases in northern areas together with mostly higher projected precipitation e g meixner et al 2016 niraula et al 2017 although some studies found increased recharge in the southwestern u s mckenna and sala 2018 the heavily exploited high plains ogallala aquifer has also received considerable attention with studies showing high vulnerability to precipitation changes ng et al 2010 as well as similar increasing south to north trends in recharge change direction crosbie et al 2013 as in many western studies the latitudinal trends in recharge change direction in the high plains mirror south to north increases in projected precipitation how groundwater recharge will react to changing climate in the northern laurentian great lakes upper great lakes region has remained under studied likely because groundwater availability in this region is currently considered to be minimally stressed reilly et al 2008 however the paucity of regional recharge studies there represents a societally critical gap because agriculture plays a major role in the economy pryor et al 2014 and it is becoming increasingly dependent on groundwater fed irrigation lark et al 2015 further several studies over the past decade have shown that climate around the upper great lakes will likely undergo major changes by the end of the 21st century e g byun and hamlet 2018 hayhoe et al 2010 pryor et al 2014 including some of the highest rates of warming in the country and projected wetter conditions in the cool season and drier conditions in the warm season thus far investigations of the hydrological impacts of this regional climate change focused on streamflow and found general decreases byun et al 2019 cherkauer and sinha 2010 demaria et al 2016 chien et al 2013 but changes in recharge were not discussed a review by larocque et al 2019 included six future recharge studies at the watershed scale from the great lakes region but found no agreement in their estimates of changes in future recharge conditions persaud et al 2020 further provided a watershed study in southwestern ontario that showed little climate change impact on future groundwater levels due to largely unchanged net surface subsurface water exchanges but it is unclear how well this represents other parts of the upper great lakes region walker et al 2008 simulated lake level changes with a coupled groundwater surface water model in a northern wisconsin watershed under different climate change scenarios but did not analyze changes in groundwater recharge recharge predictions in the upper great lakes region would not only inform groundwater resource management but they would also provide further understanding about highly variable and difficult to predict recharge change directions in temperate settings this includes addressing open questions particular to temperate settings about how future alterations to strongly seasonal temperature regimes can impact snowmelt driven recharge studies show that changing climate is significantly altering snow dynamics collados lara et al 2019 viviroli et al 2011 although climate change studies on runoff in the upper great lakes region have considered snowmelt change effects byun et al 2019 johnson and stefan 2006 chien et al 2013 little is known about how they will impact recharge there studies that looked at the future impact of changing snowmelt on recharge have focused on mountain catchments tague and peng 2013 chen et al 2018 lucianetti et al 2020 in an analysis of historical snowmelt data across the state of michigan usa in the great lakes region ford et al 2020 found warmer winters to have earlier and less snowmelt accompanied by decreased net recharge this suggests that future recharge may respond negatively to projected increases in winter temperatures although it is not known how this will be balanced by future changes in other climatic factors such as precipitation or warming during the rest of the year our study addresses the critical gap in future recharge studies in the upper great lakes region using a model that represents the range of land surface to subsurface processes needed to probe generally unresolved temperate zone responses to future climate change we use the state of minnesota usa as not only a case study in the upper great lakes region but also to explore a range of conditions found in upper mid latitude temperate settings minnesota provides a useful testbed because of its distinct west east precipitation gradient average of 50 to 90 cm yr and north south temperature gradient annual average of 2 3 to 8 c along with its varied vegetation cover cropland grassland and forest and hydrogeological properties lacustrine clay deposits to sandy outwash plains we build off our previous study anurag et al 2021 that leveraged statewide datasets to simulate groundwater recharge in the state over the historical period of 2000 2015 in the current study we implement the community land model clm oleson et al 2013 to assess future changes in recharge across the state and we identify processes driving these changes by analyzing gridded predictions across minnesota we are able to assess variability in the relative effects of precipitation and temperature changes on recharge as well as evaluate factors outside of atmospheric forcing changes that further complicate our ability to predict climate change impacts on recharge the specific aims of this study are to i predict recharge changes over a range of conditions found in the upper great lakes region ii determine the relative importance of precipitation change versus warming on both recharge change direction and magnitude and iii evaluate how land surface processes such as soil moisture feedbacks and seasonal runoff recharge partitioning further influence recharge changes our predictions of future recharge changes can also help guide management of water resources in the state where 78 of the population relies on groundwater for its drinking water and 88 of total irrigation withdrawal comes from groundwater kenny et al 2005 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area is the state of minnesota usa the state is home to about 5 6 million people 2010 census mostly concentrated in the urban center of the minneapolis st paul twin cities area about 40 of the state is cropland used to grow mainly corn and soybeans minnesota has a typical continental climate with hot summers and cold winters the state has a distinct precipitation gradient with the precipitation decreasing from east southeast to west northwest fig 1 a the precipitation is also seasonal with about 75 of it occurring during may to september the us environmental pollution agency epa divides minnesota into five major ecological provinces or ecoregions white 2020 fig 1b we refer to the province in the west and southwestern area as the great plains gp which includes 75 coverage of cropland the thick clayey sediment found in the northern part of gp further leads us to divide gp into the northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp the central hardwood forests chf extends diagonally from southeast to northwest and consists of temperate deciduous forests along with crops and grassland we refer to the northern and northeastern part of the state as northern forests nf and it consists mainly of mixed coniferous and deciduous temperate forests there is a vast stretch of peat on the former lake bed in the northern part of the state that we refer to as northern wetlands and lastly the driftless area in the southeast part of the state is a karst dominated region as in our previous work anurag et al 2021 we focus our current analysis on the four regions of ngp sgp chf and nf because of the well known limitations of common hydrological and land surface models in complex systems of wetland and karst regions hartmann et al 2017 ringeval et al 2012 in our previous study anurag et al 2021 we estimated lower historical recharge in the more arid western ecoregions compared to the more humid eastern ecoregions fig 1b 2 2 model description we implemented the community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 at a spatial resolution of 25 km for estimating groundwater recharge in minnesota clm provides the terrestrial component of the national center for atmospheric research s ncar larger community earth system model cesm hurrell et al 2013 clm is a spatially distributed model that includes process based representations of land surface biogeophysics biogeochemistry hydrology and vegetation the one dimensional soil profile in clm is divided into 10 layers the thickness of each layer increases exponentially until a depth of 3 8 m the upper boundary condition is governed by infiltration and surface runoff while an unconfined aquifer makes up the lower boundary condition for the layered soil column the aquifer can exchange water with the layered soil column and the water table can extend up into the layered soil column if the aquifer reaches its maximum water holding capacity instead of explicitly representing lateral movement of water from the soil column clm uses a simplified subsurface drainage representation described below we consider this simplified parameterization to be an acceptable trade off for computational efficiency given the relatively low relief minimum of 183 m a s l and maximum of 701 m a s l across minnesota surface runoff is determined through 1 surface

the discretized soil column deeper than 3 8 m recharge is set to potential recharge or the net flux of water out of the last layer in the soil column this is calculated by using the modified 1d

invoke because surface water routing was not a focus of our study the default representation of vegetation in clm uses plant functional types pfts and climatological lai derived from modis satellite data over the years 2001 2003 and at a base resolution of 0 05 lawrence and chase 2007 for this study we replaced the default clm vegetation inputs with climatological monthly lai generated by anurag et al 2021 using an updated 16 year 2000 2015 dynamic dataset details about this climatological lai including the method used to convert total lai from the global land surface satellite glass product xiao et al 2014 into pft level lai can be found in anurag et al 2021 clm soil parameters including hydraulic parameters for the modified richards equation surface runoff parameters and subsurface drainage parameters were calibrated by anurag et al 2021 using the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 and statewide observations of water table depth from the minnesota department of natural resources s mndnr cooperative groundwater management cgm database www dnr state mn us waters cgm in this study we carried out historical and future model simulations with the posterior 100 member ensemble parameter estimates from anurag et al 2021 we took the ensemble median of these simulations as the final result 2 3 future climate data the climate data from an ensemble of general circulation models gcms were used as the atmospheric forcing to drive clm we used the statistically downscaled climate model dataset multivariate adaptive constructed analogs version 2 meteorological data macav2 metdata abatzoglou and brown 2012 for this study this data product contains daily downscaled meteorological variables for historical 1950 2005 conditions and future 2025 2099 experiments under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios at a spatial resolution of 4 km covering the continental usa rcp4 5 is an intermediate scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and then decline rcp8 5 is the more extreme scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century for our study we compared the climate predictions for a 30 year future spanning 2026 2055 with the historical period from 1976 2005 the macav2 metdata data product contains climate data from 20 gcms that participated in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 to focus our analysis and reduce the computational cost we used data from five of the 20 gcms in macav2 metdata with the aim of capturing a roughly representative range in projected climate the full set of 20 gcms generally agree on a warmer future however there is notable variability in predictions of future precipitation to select our subset of five gcms table 1 we calculated the difference in precipitation between the rcp8 5 future and the 30 year average historical precipitation for all 20 gcms and then we chose the gcms with the lowest and with the greatest increase in future precipitation under rcp8 5 along with 25th 50th and 75th percentile change it should be noted that among these selected gcms the order of driest to wettest future for the rcp4 5 scenario differs from the rcp8 5 scenario indicating that rcp8 5 does not simply represent an intensification of rcp4 5 conditions in terms of precipitation for the rcp8 5 scenario the gcms predicting driest to wettest future are in order ccsm4 noresm gfdl csiro and canesm while for rcp4 5 they are csiro canesm noresm ccsm4 and gfdl 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate variables 3 1 1 statewide spatiotemporal average changes for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios we see significant climate shifts over minnesota changes in precipitation are depicted in fig 2 all other climate variables are shown in fig s1 as mentioned above gcms generally agree on increasing temperatures in the future the five gcms used in our study predict a future statewide average increase in temperature ranging from 1 5 to 2 9 c for the rcp8 5 scenario and 1 4 to 2 7 c for rcp4 5 all five of the selected gcms except csiro predict higher average temperatures under the more extreme rcp8 5 scenario compared to rcp4 5 there is more variability among gcms and emissions scenarios in the precipitation projections compared to temperature for both emissions scenarios four of the five selected gcms predict a slight to moderate average precipitation increase in minnesota and one of the five predicts slightly less precipitation for the rcp8 5 conditions the projected increase ranges from 2 to 9 1 while the single gcm ccsm4 with the drier future shows a decrease of 3 3 in precipitation for the rcp4 5 scenario the increase ranges from 0 4 to 6 9 with the one drier gcm csiro predicting a 2 6 decrease in precipitation for two gcms ccsm4 and csiro we see switches in sign in the precipitation change between the two emissions scenarios noresm and canesm predict a greater increase in precipitation in the rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 while gfdl predicts a lower increase in rcp8 5 overall the projected precipitation change varies more across the gcms under the rcp8 5 3 3 to 9 7 than the rcp4 5 2 6 to 6 9 scenario all five gcms predict a decrease in snowfall over the state under both the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios snowfall decreases range from 1 to 10 4 for the rcp8 5 scenario and 4 to 13 3 for the rcp4 5 scenario 3 1 2 seasonal changes seasonal trends appear in the projected changes in climatic variables under both the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 scenarios the majority of gcms predict an increase in precipitation during spring amj and fall on and a decrease in summer jas precipitation fig 3 a we also see a shift in the timing of snowmelt to earlier months for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 conditions specifically snowmelt occurring in march increases on average across the five gcm by 2 2 and 2 9 cm yr under the rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 conditions respectively and there is a corresponding average decrease in snowmelt in april of 4 1 and 5 1 cm yr fig 3b notable seasonal changes in other climatic variables include winter and summer temperature increases full seasonal gcm results in fig s3 and fig s4 3 1 3 ecoregion specific changes spatial trends occur in climate projections across the state s ecoregions while temperature changes are quite homogeneous in space differences of 0 3 to 0 7 c relative to the range predicted across the gcms differences of 1 4 to 2 9 c precipitation changes exhibit far more spatial variability fig 4 and 5 for example the nf region most frequently experiences an increase in precipitation among various gcms while ngp and sgp most often have the least increase or greatest decrease in precipitation 3 2 changes in recharge 3 2 1 statewide spatiotemporal average changes the recharge predicted by clm under different gcm projections shows vulnerability to climate change with simulated future changes ranging from 45 to 26 compared to 3 3 to 9 7 change in precipitation fig 2 it is notable that even though most gcms predict a slight to moderate increase in future precipitation a majority of recharge predictions show at least a moderate decrease 15 specifically under the rcp8 5 scenario for the two gcms predicting either a decrease or only a slight increase in future precipitation ccsm4 and noresm the model projects a significant decrease in statewide 30 year average recharge of 45 and 37 respectively fig 2a for the three remaining gcms that predict a stronger increase in future precipitation ranging from 5 4 to 10 under rcp8 5 clm estimates just a small increase in statewide average recharge ranging from 1 9 to 3 8 under the rcp4 5 scenario we see clm predicting a decrease in statewide recharge ranging from 18 8 to 38 3 for four out of five gcms fig 2b only one gcm gfdl that also predicts the highest increase in future precipitation and the lowest increase in temperature results in an increase in recharge of 26 4 the overall seasonal future recharge trend is similar to historical recharge with the strongest peak in spring amj and a smaller peak in fall on but seasonal changes do appear fig 3c the peak spring recharge starts up to a month earlier moves from may to april and the peak decreases but broadens over time lasts two months instead of one under both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios 3 2 2 ecoregion specific changes for each ecoregion predictions include both increases and decreases in future recharge with decreases appearing more commonly similar to the statewide results fig 2 however the predicted recharge changes magnitude and sometimes sign vary across ecoregions within test cases the rcp8 5 scenario shows the strongest spatial recharge variabilities with its three wettest climate projections gfdl csiro and canesm although the average statewide change in recharge is very small in these three cases less than 5 positive and negative changes of up to 35 45 magnitude occur for individual ecoregions fig 2 for both emissions scenarios the largest range across models and magnitudes in relative recharge changes appeared for ngp 80 to 46 despite the somewhat smaller range and magnitudes in relative precipitation changes there 2 to 11 although it should be noted that the large relative recharge changes in np occur due to the small nominal recharge amounts in that drier ecoregion fig 1b and absolute recharge changes in ngp are in fact similar or even smaller compared to in the other ecoregions fig 4 and 5 unexpectedly there are some locations within western sgp and ngp that show measurable increases in recharge changes more than 4 cm yr under decreased precipitation conditions ccsm4 and noresm under rcp8 5 and csiro and canesm under rcp4 5 fig 4 and 5 this is further discussed below 4 discussion drivers of recharge changes 4 1 statewide analysis to evaluate how projected climate drives changes in recharge across the various test cases we compare absolute changes in recharge with changes in precipitation and et the major climate controlled inputs and outputs of water at the land surface we see that within each emissions scenario the trend in predicted recharge change across gcms approximately tracks the trend in precipitation changes but with a downward shift fig 6 this shows that although the sign change in precipitation and recharge do not always match future precipitation trends nonetheless drive trends in recharge changes across the test cases fig 6 also shows that et predicted by clm is consistently higher in the future and this accounts for the downward shift in recharge change relative to the precipitation change the downward shift in recharge is generally greater for the rcp8 5 cases compared to rcp4 5 because of the higher et increase in rcp8 5 with its warmer temperatures although et and precipitation changes are overall similar in magnitude recharge change more closely reflects the trend in precipitation change because precipitation change projections exhibit greater variability across gcms 1 8 to 6 8 cm yr than et changes 4 7 to 7 9 cm yr as expected the increase in et generally follows the trend in temperature change across gcms fig 6 which was previously noted to be more consistent across projections than precipitation visual examination of fig 6 indicates that changes in recharge do not always equate with the difference in precipitation change and et change indicating that other processes also contribute to the recharge response to evaluate how future changes in precipitation will be partitioned into recharge versus other hydrological components we evaluated the water balance for each of the five gcms and the two emissions scenarios 6 Œ¥ rain Œ¥ snow Œ¥ et Œ¥ runoff Œ¥ recharge where Œ¥ future 30 year 2026 2055 average historical 30 year 1976 2005 average and runoff here and elsewhere refers to surface runoff we compare the future and historical water balance components using waterfall charts which are also commonly used in financial analysis wickham 2011 in the waterfall charts fig 7 and 8 positive changes in precipitation variables rain and snowmelt on the left side are plotted in the upward direction while positive changes in the other hydrological variables into which precipitation is partitioned et runoff and recharge are plotted in the downward direction this way when the water balance is closed the final variable on the right side will end at zero upward bars are shown in green indicating an increase of water at the ground surface and downward bars are shown in red indicating a decrease of water at the ground surface note that in fig 7 and 8 the water balance is often not exactly closed at 0 because we are showing the median of the 100 member ensemble simulations for each variable which is not guaranteed to be mass conserving there may also be small soil water storage changes over the 30 years figs 7 and 8 demonstrate that of the hydrological variables into which precipitation is partitioned et almost always across test cases shows the largest future change figs 7 and 8 also make clear that consistently large et increases take up nearly all increases in precipitation when it occurs csiro and canesm under rcp8 5 and they result in substantially negative changes in net water inputs from the atmosphere p et in test cases with mostly unchanged or less precipitation this leads to the notable downshift in recharge change results relative to precipitation change that was previously noted the dominance of et changes highlights that although recharge change trends generally follow precipitation changes across gcms et plays a key role in actual recharge predictions which has also been shown in other temperate zone recharge studies in which high et counteracts the effects of increased precipitation taylor et al 2013 bellot and chirino 2013 wu et al 2020 the one gcm in our study with a relatively small increase in et change is gfdl 3 6 cm yr under rcp8 5 and 0 8 cm yr under rcp4 5 figs 7 and 8 which corresponds to much milder projected warming 1 5 c under rcp8 5 and 1 3 c under rcp4 5 compared to the other test cases fig s1b significantly figs 7 and 8 also demonstrate that when the net atmospheric water input p et change is substantially negative ccsm4 and noresm under rcp8 5 and all gcms apart from gfdl under rcp4 5 the deficit in water inputs is approximately evenly met by reductions in recharge and surface runoff this means that in cases with little change or lower precipitation decreases in recharge are less than what would be expected solely based on p et changes because runoff serves as a critical modulator of recharge response it is also noteworthy that simulated future runoff decreases across nearly all test cases in fact slight runoff reductions for cases with substantial increases in total precipitation and about zero or positive p et changes csiro and canesm under rcp8 5 help allow for positive changes in recharge in those cases although some of these runoff reductions are small in magnitude on an annual basis they could be important seasonally fig 3d shows that runoff is highly seasonal with its peak occurring in the late winter to early spring mam just following peak snowmelt and then tailing off in late spring into summer mjj the largest reductions in runoff occur during the peak time in early spring when snow melts ubiquitous decreases in snowfall and hence snowmelt across test cases likely account for some of the predicted decreases in runoff but it cannot for all compare snow and runoff bars in figs 7 and 8 additional reductions in spring runoff could occur because of increases in et that exceed excess spring rains another possibility is that earlier ground thaw in the future will shift the partitioning between runoff and recharge towards recharge as further explored next simulations show that march soil temperatures in the top 10 cm will warm from an average of 0 5 c across historical simulations to 0 3 c under rcp4 5 and 0 4 c under rcp8 5 in the future this warming to above freezing coincides with a major decrease in future april runoff and a moderate decrease in future april recharge fig 3c d water balance inferences reveal that some of the major reduction in spring runoff must correspond with shifts to recharge likely due to the earlier future ground thaw in fig 9 early spring Œ¥ runoff is often less than early spring Œ¥ p et falls below the 1 1 line in a scatter plot and it can even be negative for Œ¥ p et 0 where Œ¥ again indicates future minus historical averages this corresponds to runoff reducing more than net atmospheric inputs decrease when Œ¥ p et 0 and to runoff reducing despite net atmospheric inputs increasing when Œ¥ p et 0 because p et is partitioned into runoff versus infiltration and eventually recharge both cases of runoff reduction exceeding what can be explained by changes in atmospheric water inputs suggest that some amount of the net atmospheric water inputs that would have historically run off will instead infiltrate in the future likely because of the increased infiltration capacity of soils after thawing the tendency away from runoff toward infiltration and eventually recharge in the future is greater for the warmer rcp8 5 scenario than rcp4 5 symbols fall farther below the 1 1 in fig 9a compared to fig 9b supporting the idea that the shift occurs in response to more warming and thawing of frozen ground also compared to early spring summer results look very different with no ecoregion scale occurrences of negative Œ¥ runoff when Œ¥ p et 0 and smaller magnitude runoff reductions than decreases in net atmospheric water inputs when Œ¥ p et 0 fig 9 this indicates that in the summer when there are no frozen ground changes that can shift runoff to recharge runoff responds directly to changes in net atmospheric water inputs which are partitioned between runoff and recharge late spring and summer runoff mostly decrease because of overall lower projected summer precipitation and increased temperature which not only reduce net atmospheric water inputs but also generate drier ground conditions that limit saturation excess runoff as noted earlier predicted recharge also exhibits seasonal changes similar to runoff the lower and earlier spring recharge can be attributed to a decreased and shifted snowmelt peak figs 3b c the more sustained recharge peak may correspond to the increase in spring mam precipitation fig 3a as well as the possible thaw driven re partitioning of runoff to recharge as discussed above in the summer jas future recharge is predicted to become even lower to the point of slightly negative recharge indicating net water loss through et under both emission scenarios this corresponds to an overall decrease in summer precipitation and increase in et due to temperature increase 4 1 1 ecoregion specific analysis the differences in predicted recharge change among ecoregions could result from spatial variability in climate projections and or they could be due to distinct land surface properties with which climate interacts ecoregion based characteristics including vegetation and hydrogeology have been found to control historical recharge amounts across minnesota anurag et al 2021 in the model results the spatial distribution of recharge change strongly correlates with precipitation change for test cases with an overall positive change in future precipitation while it corresponds strongly with changes in et when there is less future precipitation fig s6 with temperature acting as an important driver of et temporal correlation of 0 65 between et and temperature averaged across models and scenarios these results show that under both wetter and drier gcm projections recharge change is directly influenced by the underlying spatial patterns of climatic change even though they can be by different climatic variables et depends on factors in addition to climate inputs however in fact regression tests reveal that ecoregion was a more important predictor of future et changes across space compared to temperature change average r2 of 0 35 to predict annual et using ecoregion versus 0 17 using temperature for rcp8 5 indicating that other ecoregion based characteristics also drive spatial variability in et change and consequently recharge change fig 4 and fig 5 show that for each gcm predicted increases in et are smallest in the more arid parts of the state including ngp western sgp and western chf as a result the downshift in recharge change relative to precipitation change is less for these regions as can be seen in fig s5 ecoregion differences in et can be attributed to water limitations in the more arid ecoregions that constrain how much et can increase in the future in np limitations in et increases can account for the smaller magnitude decreases in recharge there while less constrained et increase for the humid nf region can explain why recharge does not show particularly strong increases despite generally higher precipitation there compared to other ecoregions as previously noted in section 3 1 3 spatial correlations table s1 show that in the more humid nf et consistently exhibits negative correlations with soil moisture with statistical significance under cooler historical conditions that correspond to soil moisture responding to et while correlations move toward positive values for the other drier ecoregions more often with statistical significance for the warmest scenarios corresponding to soil moisture availability limiting et as a consequence while in higher precipitation test cases climatic variability across space largely controls ecoregion differences in recharge change in lower precipitation test cases in which et is the main driver a combination of climatic and land surface variabilities affects spatial patterns in recharge change as noted above in section 4 1 future changes in precipitation and et do not fully predict changes in recharge because some of the net change in atmospheric water inputs is also partitioned to runoff anurag et al 2021 showed strong spatial heterogeneity across minnesota in calibrated runoff parameters fig s13 in anurag et al 2021 prompting us to evaluate ecoregion based changes in runoff versus recharge in this study we investigated this through scatter plots of future net atmospheric water input change Œ¥ p et versus recharge change Œ¥ recharge in figs 10 and 11 such that symbols falling on the 1 1 line indicate full partitioning of net atmospheric water input changes to recharge and symbols falling on the horizontal Œ¥ recharge 0 line correspond to full partitioning to runoff scatter plots of gridcell results in figs 10 and 11 show a distinct behavior based on the climatic conditions as well as ecoregion most prominently when Œ¥ p et is greater than 0 Œ¥ p et versus Œ¥ recharge plot mostly around the 1 1 reference line with sometimes a slight bias toward lower Œ¥ recharge in contrast for Œ¥ p et less than 0 the values nearly always plot above the 1 1 line and sometimes extend to the above graph quadrant i e Œ¥ recharge 0 even though Œ¥ p et 0 and there is considerably more scatter than for the half plot with Œ¥ p et 0 when looking at ecoregions the deviations from the 1 1 line are greatest for the more arid ngp and sgp regions and least for the humid nf a number of conclusions can be drawn from these observations from figs 10 and 11 about how future p et changes transfer to recharge for most ecoregions when net atmospheric water inputs become higher in the future Œ¥ p et 0 much of those inputs go to recharge symbols along the 1 1 line although sometimes a part of the excess precipitation first becomes lost to runoff for symbols slightly below the 1 1 line nf experiences the least partitioning of increased p et to runoff which can be attributed to generally smaller surface runoff parameters and runoff fluxes there due to less runoff prone surface soil properties anurag et al 2021 in contrast when there is a future decrease in p et Œ¥ p et 0 partitioning to runoff has a notable influence on recharge change across the board there is nearly always at least some reduction in runoff which not only buffers the decrease in recharge symbols above 1 1 line but even allows for unchanged or even increased recharge in some instances symbols above 0 horizontal line these cases of future recharge increasing despite p et decreasing occur most often in ngp and sgp which can also be seen in figs 4 and 5 as noted above these areas in ngp and sgp include some of the highest surface runoff parameters and historical surface runoff fluxes due to more runoff prone soil properties anurag et al 2021 and so there are larger amounts of runoff that can be readily reduced when Œ¥ p et is very negative the high runoff reductions in ngp and sgp when Œ¥ p et 0 also impacted the statewide waterfall plots which showed large net decreases in atmospheric water inputs being partitioned quite evenly between runoff and recharge rather than preferentially toward reduced recharge the predicted occurrence of increased recharge even with decreased atmospheric water inputs further supports the above idea that some runoff is reapportioned to recharge due to the future reduction of frozen ground conditions runoff likely reduces under this warming driven process regardless of precipitation projection but its effect is clearest when it produces recharge that cannot be explained by increases in p et ubiquitous reduction in runoff independent of precipitation can explain why the reduction in recharge is nearly always lower magnitude than the decrease in p et it can also account for the apparently weak partitioning of future p et additions to runoff symbols around the 1 1 line for p et 0 in figs 10 and 11 some of the excess atmospheric water undoubtedly produces added runoff but that is at least partially offset by reductions in runoff due to the decrease in frozen ground in fact thaw induced runoff reduction under Œ¥ p et 0 likely produces the slight scatter above the 1 1 line in fig 10 the nf prediction for the gfdl projection under rcp4 5 is the only case in which very little net change in runoff appears symbols fall tightly around the 1 1 line in fig 11 this is likely because the very minor projected increase in temperature in that scenario fig 6b does not thaw the ground sufficiently to greatly influence runoff and the less runoff prone soil properties there facilitate infiltration of most of the p et increase interestingly widespread reduction of runoff and consequent preferred partitioning to recharge were evident from both the statewide waterfall plots as well as the ecoregion scatter plots but for different regimes for the statewide waterfall plots decreased runoff when Œ¥ p et 0 highlighted this effect while for ecoregion scatter plots increased recharge when Œ¥ p et 0 made this apparent 4 2 limitations of the study it is difficult to account for all the multiple interacting factors that affect recharge and so our assessment comes with limitations as noted above clm was not formulated to accurately capture the hydrological complexities of wetlands in north central minnesota and karst in southeast minnesota yet previous studies have shown recharge in these types of settings to be sensitive to climate change havril et al 2018 pardo ig√∫zquiza et al 2019 also this study focuses primarily on the effects of climate on recharge and does not consider future changes in land use including expanding crop coverage and agricultural tile drainage practices smith et al 2018 replacement of natural vegetation with crops can significantly alter recharge through changes in transpiration and infiltration scanlon et al 2005 ng et al 2009 and tile drainage substantially shifts hydrological partitioning toward increased runoff smith et al 2018 on the climate side statistically downscaled gcm climate projection data used in this study represent coarse spatiotemporal information future assessments with newly released dynamically downscaled climate data over minnesota liess et al 2022 can provide improved resolutions other considerations included in other future recharge studies but not incorporated here include the impact of higher atmospheric co2 concentrations via vegetation transpiration green et al 2007 and the use of model ensembles for representing model structural uncertainties taylor et al 2013 5 summary and conclusions this study uses clm to predict future changes in groundwater recharge in the state of minnesota as a test case for the upper great lakes region using climate projections from five gcms and two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 we compared the future changes in recharge for 2026 2055 relative to baseline historical conditions in 1976 2005 despite consistent projections of higher precipitation 8 out of 10 test cases across two emissions scenarios we predicted that future recharge across the state will likely decrease 6 out of 10 test cases with a 18 8 45 decrease or remain about the same 2 out of 10 test cases with 10 change the only case with notable increased recharge 26 4 corresponds to the least warm climate projection 1 4 c compared to mean of 2 2 c across test cases which also had among the greater increases in precipitation comparing areas in the state that have the highest groundwater usage based on water use permit locations https www dnr state mn us waters watermgmt section appropriations wateruse html with predicted future recharge changes fig 4c and 5c our study indicates that the chf ecoregion will be particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts with both its strong reliance on groundwater and the state s most consistent projection of recharge decrease especially under rcp4 5 like other temperate studies compiled in amanambu et al 2020 our results show that although it is possible for increases in precipitation to override the effects of higher et with ubiquitous warming the sign change of recharge does not simply correspond to that of precipitation because et often has the prevailing effect nonetheless we found that precipitation change serves as the main driver of differences in recharge predictions across test cases with the trend in recharge change tracking the trend in precipitation change trend but with a downward shift due to higher et this demonstrates that resolving uncertainties in precipitation change will be essential for producing accurate estimates of future recharge in the upper great lakes region we further showed that the balance of precipitation and et changes alone is insufficient for predicting recharge changes because of surface runoff on average across the state substantial reductions in net atmospheric water inputs p et are similarly partitioned between decreases in runoff and in recharge such that decreases in recharge are less than what would be expected solely based on p et changes importantly this demonstrates that even in low relief regions such as the upper great lakes region surface runoff serves as an important modulator of recharge response to climate change the effect of surface runoff has not been closely examined in previous recharge change studies which mostly have focused on climatic forcing changes finer spatial and temporal resolution analysis of predicted recharge changes further reveal land surface processes that influence recharge changes overall we found the main controllers to include soil moisture feedbacks hydrogeologic runoff properties and frost controlled runoff how these different factors affect recharge change depends on precipitation projections under moderate increases to decreases in precipitation we showed that soil moisture availability plays an important role in controlling et changes which in turn drive the spatial distribution of recharge changes across the state with warmer temperatures soil moisture limitations in the more arid western part of the state can curtail the increases in et and correspondingly the decreases in recharge this effect may explain why recharge studies in even more arid parts of the u s western u s and high plains meixner et al 2016 niraula et al 2017 show a simpler correspondence between recharge change direction and precipitation change direction because et changes can be muted due to moisture constraints for runoff effects areas with less runoff prone surface soils nf and parts of chf exhibit the least partitioning of atmospheric water input changes to runoff such that recharge changes most closely mirror p et changes for areas with soils properties that promote runoff ngp and western sgp and chf when atmospheric water inputs are predicted to decrease the buffering of recharge reductions by runoff reductions can be substantial underscoring the role of hydrogeologic properties in mediating the impact of climatic forcing changes on future recharge our predictions further provide new insights into how snowmelt and frost changes can influence hydrological responses to future climate change in temperate regions seasonal simulations indicate that major reductions in runoff and moderate reductions in recharge will occur in the future during the spring just following reduced snowmelt this is consistent with historical observations in the great lakes region of less runoff and recharge during warmer winters ford et al 2020 interestingly our analysis further showed that future decreases in snowmelt can account for some of the large reductions in peak runoff but not all it is likely that warmer temperatures will reduce the amount of frozen ground that drives peak runoff and instead allow greater amounts of infiltration and eventually recharge as a result there will be a thaw driven reapportioning of runoff to recharge which can also buffer recharge reductions in predictions when p et decreases ubiquitous decreases in frost driven runoff with warming can even allow for increased recharge despite lower atmospheric water inputs in areas with historically high runoff our work calls for further investigation into how climate change will impact frozen ground dynamics and its role in hydrological

3226,quantifying streambed water fluxes swfs is a prerequisite for studying the transport and fate of contaminants in the hyporheic zone one approach the heat tracing technique combined with analytical or numerical heat transport models has been widely used to quantify swfs however both analytical and numerical methods are limited for example analytical methods are built upon rarely met assumptions while the inversion performance of numerical methods can be impeded by uncertainties from different sources to overcome these limitations we introduce a new approach that combines convolutional neural networks cnns with the bayesian data worth analysis dwa framework for estimating swfs in this approach a synthetic dataset is first generated through numerical simulations of groundwater flow and heat transport in streambeds then high utility temperatures are chosen from the synthetic dataset through bayesian dwa and further used to train the cnn model we assess the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the swf estimation accuracy of cnn models through both numerical and sandbox experimental cases results show that the cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility generally gives more accurate swf estimations use of a few high utility temperature measurements can provide near similar constraint on the cnn model training and swf estimation as compared to the full time series furthermore a comparison to the iterative ensemble smoother algorithm shows the proposed inversion approach can estimate the flux field in the sandbox more accurately the proposed cnn based inversion approach considering dwa cnn dwa would be beneficial more broadly for other hydrological problems keywords bayesian data worth analysis streambed water flux quantification heat tracing method deep learning 1 introduction accurately quantifying the streambed water fluxes swfs is vital for the study of water flow and contaminant transport in the hyporheic zone cardenas 2015 hester et al 2017 various methods have been used to estimate swfs including seepage meters lee 1977 paulsen et al 2001 portable piezometers lee and cherry 1979 and tracer experiments colombani et al 2015 cook et al 2018 xie et al 2016 among these methods the heat tracing technique has become increasingly popular in the past decade as presented in reviews by anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 and irvine et al 2017 the principle behind the heat tracing technique is that groundwater flow induces heat advection and disturbs an expected conduction dominated subsurface temperature regime thus the recorded temperature information can be used to infer swfs anderson 2005 the advantage of using heat as a tracer lies in that temperature is environmentally friendly and can be measured easily and cheaply rau et al 2014 a widely used approach for inferring vertical swfs from multilevel streambed temperature signals is based on the analytic solution of the one dimensional 1 d heat transport equation hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 although efficient to implement limitations of the analytical solutions do exist for example they are restricted to specific assumptions that are rarely met in natural conditions such as purely vertical flow homogeneous hydraulic and thermal parameters sinusoidal temperature signal and so on irvine et al 2015 to overcome the limitations of the analytical solutions numerical approaches are introduced to estimate swfs in real world situations i e transient and heterogeneous flow fields the numerical code 1dtemppro voytek et al 2014 and its extension 1dtemppro v2 koch et al 2016 facilitate vertical swf estimations in complex situations by calibrating the coupled groundwater flow and heat transport model to observed temperature profiles munz and schmidt 2017 developed an inverse numerical computer program named flux bot to invert vertical swfs from observed temperature time series and perform corresponding uncertainty analysis in our previous work ju et al 2018 we inferred two dimensional 2 d water fluxes in a sandbox from hydraulic head and temperature measurements through a data assimilation method despite the popularity of numerical methods their inversion performance may be impeded by uncertainties resulting from model structural errors inaccurate observation data and assumptions underlying the inverse problem linde et al 2017 rajabi et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 recently deep learning dl has achieved increasing popularity in inverse modeling of hydrologic systems shen 2018 shen et al 2018 which provides an alternative tool for inferring swfs dl based inverse modeling in hydrology can be found in a number of recent studies for example sun 2018 proposed a state parameter identification generative adversarial neural network spid gan to learn the bidirectional mappings between the high dimensional model parameters and model states which can be further used for parameter inversion zhong et al 2020 built a cyclegan based inversion workflow to estimate reservoir fluid property changes by adopting seismic data kreyenberg et al 2019 trained a cnn with synthetic data that represent the physical process understanding and then applied it to derive the density driven flow velocities in real world experiments based on concentration measurements intuitively as a data driven approach the performance of dl models is heavily reliant upon the quality of data for model training to ensure the performance of dl models and optimize data collection it is beneficial to select the most informative data for dl training through implementing data worth analysis dwa in advance in recent years dwa has found widespread applications in groundwater related problems to guide data collection leube et al 2012 nowak et al 2012 w√∂hling et al 2016 many previous studies chose to address the dwa problem using the first order second moment fosm method glasgow et al 2003 within a linearized framework for example partington et al 2020 assessed the worth of hydraulic and water chemistry data in terms of predicting swfs using the fosm method knowling et al 2020 compared the worth of tritium derived mean residence time mrt observations relative to other observation data types in decision support contexts via the fosm analyses one alternative to the linearized dwa method is the bayesian dwa approach which can evaluate the data worth with an assumption free criterion e g the kullback leibler divergence lindley 1956 from the bayesian perspective due to the flexibility and rigorous theory such assumption free bayesian dwa methods have been increasingly applied in groundwater systems where most parameter to state maps are moderately to highly nonlinear lu et al 2018 lu et al 2012 man et al 2017 neuman et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there is no existing study about choosing highly informative data for training dl models to improve their performance in inverse modeling inspired by the recent progresses of dl models and dwa approaches we employ the bayesian dwa framework to choose the most informative temperature data for cnn training and then estimate swfs with the trained cnn models both numerical and sandbox experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed cnn dwa approach the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodologies the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through both numerical and sandbox experiments in section 3 comparisons of methods and potential applications of the proposed approach in real world situations are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodologies 2 1 forward models our focus in this study is on the heat transport problem in streambeds where the groundwater flow is assumed to be steady state the steady state groundwater flow process can be described as 1 k s h 0 subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h t 0 h 0 h Œ≥ 1 h 1 h Œ≥ 2 h 2 then the darcy flux q can be calculated as 3 q k s h where h denotes the hydraulic head k s denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity h 0 represents the initial hydraulic head h 1 and h 2 are the hydraulic heads fixed at dirichlet boundaries Œ≥ 1 and Œ≥ 2 respectively the propagation of heat through the saturated sediments can be described by the heat transport equation with the following form 4 t t k e 2 t q œÅ w c w œÅ c t where t denotes the temperature t is the time k e Œª œÅ c is the effective thermal diffusivity Œª Œª w Œ∏ Œª s 1 Œ∏ is the thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment Œª w and Œª s are the thermal conductivity of water and solids respectively Œ∏ is the effective porosity of the sediment œÅ c Œ∏ œÅ w c w 1 Œ∏ œÅ s c s is the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sediment œÅ w c w and œÅ s c s represent the volumetric heat capacity of water and solids respectively 2 2 bayesian dwa in this study a widely used bayesian experimental design criterion termed the relative entropy or the kullback leibler divergence lindley 1956 is employed to assess the data worth assuming that a measurement model has the following form 5 d f m Œµ where d denotes the measurement vector f denotes the forward model m represents the parameter vector and Œµ is the vector of measurement errors for a given data set d the relative entropy is taken as the utility function to measure the information gain from the prior distribution p m to the posterior distribution p m d the utility function u d is defined as lindley 1956 6 u d p m d ln p m d p m d m since the dwa is conducted before actually collecting any data we employ the expected utility u to quantify the information content of a possible data collection scheme the approach of calculating the expected relative entropy is also called the pre posterior analysis leube et al 2012 nowak and guthke 2016 which has been frequently adopted in groundwater monitoring designs ju et al 2019 man et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 here the expectation is taken over the considered parameter space and all possible observations huan and marzouk 2013 7 u u d p m d d m d d where d represents the simulated measurements with given parameter m the expected relative entropy is essentially the mutual information between model parameters of interest and future observations cover and thomas 1991 in this study to simplify the integrating process in eq 7 the approach proposed by huan and marzouk 2013 is adopted to numerically calculate the expected utility value 8 u 1 n out i 1 n out ln p d i m i ln p d i where n out denotes the number of monte carlo samples in the outer loop m i are parameter samples drawn from the prior

this study we aim at improving the swf estimation accuracy of a cnn model through selecting the most informative temperature data for the cnn training the workflow can be described as follows step 1 datasets generation we create a dataset containing multiple pairs of temperature time series and their underlying swfs through synthetic simulations of groundwater flow and heat transport in a streambed details of generating the dataset will be presented in the following case studies section 3 step 2 bayesian dwa determining the optimal sampling times and locations for temperatures through conducting the bayesian dwa step 3 training the cnn model using the selected dataset the selected temperatures i e temperatures with higher utility values and their underlying swfs are assembled to form the training dataset the cnn model takes temperature measurements as input and gives swfs as output step 4 estimating swfs the trained cnn is then used to estimate swfs based on temperature measurements it is worth noting that temperatures used for estimating swfs and those used for cnn model training in step 3 should be sampled from the same times and locations determined in step 2 since lots of studies have presented the mathematical foundation of cnn and its underlying theory is not the focus of our work we decide not to provide the details here interested readers are suggested to refer to lecun et al 2015 and gu et al 2018 2 4 estimation accuracy assessment the performance of the trained cnn in estimating swfs is evaluated based on two commonly used metrics the root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 which are defined as 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i r f i 2 11 r 2 i 1 n r f i rf e i e i 1 n r f i rf 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 here rf and e stand for reference values and estimated values respectively with i denoting their index n is the number of samples the overline denotes the mean operator if swfs are better estimated smaller rmse and r 2 values closer to 1 are expected to be obtained 3 case studies in this section the effectiveness of bayesian dwa in improving the swf estimation accuracy of cnn models is illustrated by both numerical and experimental cases 3 1 case 1 1 d numerical case the first 1 d numerical case aims at demonstrating the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the vertical swf estimation accuracy of cnn models through selecting training temperature data from the optimal sampling times when only 1 d vertical heat transport is considered eq 4 is simplified as stallman 1965 12 t t k e 2 t z 2 q z œÅ w c w œÅ c t z with certain assumptions i e sinusoidal temperature signal homogeneous hydraulic and thermal properties of the streambed the analytical solution to eq 12 is expressed as follows 13 t z

which p is the temperature variation period in this case only the vertical water flux q z is to be estimated while other parameters are given in table 1 3 1 1 1 d model settings the 1 d model domain is a vertical line with a length of 1 m constant heads are used as the dirichlet boundary for the flow field along the upper and lower sides of the model domain to simulate the heat transport in natural streambeds where the heat source is solar radiation the upper boundary of the temperature field is assumed to satisfy the following equation as suggested in previous studies irvine et al 2015 luce et al 2013 14 t t t ave a sin 2 œÄ t p where t ave 20 c a 5 c and p 1 d the lower boundary of the temperature field is an outflow boundary with this temperature amplitude the effect of heat transport on the groundwater flow is negligible hecht m√©ndez et al 2010 ma and zheng 2010 since our interest is to investigate the potential possibility of estimating swfs with as few data as possible we assume that only one observation point at the depth of 0 3 m is available for temperatures in this case the total simulation period is set as one day and the temperature is measured every 0 01 d resulting in 100 time steps temperature measurements we assume that the vertical swfs are uniformly distributed within the range of 0 5 10 md 1 which can cover most of the groundwater flux magnitudes angermann et al 2012 rau et al 2014 the positive and negative signs imply downward and upward flow respectively the limit of the upward flux 0 5 md 1 is chosen based on the following consideration the inferred upwelling vertical swfs using the amplitude ratio method hatch et al 2006 in most existing studies are less than 0 5 md 1 briggs et al 2013 daniluk et al 2013 gordon et al 2013 keery et al 2007 thus we set it as the upward flux limit in this study 3 1 2 temperature dwa in the 1 d case to test the effects of water flux on the temperature utility utility values of temperature measurements at 100 sampling times under different flux conditions i e 0 5 0 md 1 0 1 md 1 and 1 10 md 1 are respectively calculated using eq 6 for each flux condition there are 10 000 vertical swfs being drawn from the given flux range and then used to simulate the corresponding temperature time series through running the 1 d heat transport model i e eq 13 the measurement errors are assumed to follow independent gaussian distributions with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 1 we set nout in eq 8 as 10 000 which is the total number of temperature time series utility values of temperatures at 100 time steps under different flux conditions are shown in fig 1 it is observed that utility values of temperatures at 100 sampling times show different variation trends under different flux conditions for lower flux ranges i e 0 5 0 md 1 and 0 1 md 1 sampling times near the moments at which the minimum maximum temperatures appear lead to the highest temperature utility while the lowest temperature utility is given by the sampling times near the moments at which the average temperature tave 20 appears this occurs because a slight variation of the swf can bring about significant changes of the temperature amplitude under the lower flux conditions therefore temperatures near the minimum maximum values that reflect the amplitude information are more informative in terms of the swfs as the swf increases to a relatively high range of 1 10 md 1 temperatures near the average 20 possess higher utility compared to those far from it the underlying reason is that temperatures near the average are more sensitive to the variation of the relatively high swf compared to those near the minimum maximum values which hardly change as the high swf varies 3 1 3 cnn model training and vertical swf estimation a cnn architecture generally consists of a cascade of convolutional layers pooling layers and fully connected layers the cnn model used in this case includes four convolutional layers two pooling layers and one fully connected layer to stabilize and accelerate the training process batch normalization is imposed after each convolutional layer the training hyper parameters i e numbers of network layers channels and neurons in each layer are determined by random search technique goodfellow et al 2016 in this case the kernel sizes for the four convolutional layers are as follows 1 3 for the first two layers 1 2 for the third layer and 1 1 for the last layer in the pooling layers the average pooling function with kernel size 1 1 and stride 1 1 is adopted the last fully connected layer has one neuron aiming to gather the extracted information to output the details about the architecture of the deep neural network are illustrated in fig 2 in this section we respectively compare the vertical swf estimation accuracies of the cnn models trained on temperatures at different time steps under different flux conditions i e 0 5 0 md 1 0 1 md 1 and 1 10 md 1 for each flux condition temperatures at 100 time steps and their underlying swfs are firstly assembled to form 100 original datasets each containing 10 000 pairs of temperature flux input output input size 1 1 output size 1 1 arrays secondly through arbitrary separation 10 000 pairs of temperature flux arrays in each of the 100 original datasets are split into training validation and testing sets in the proportion of 7 2 1 lastly we train the cnn models using training datasets at different time steps respectively resulting in 100 cnn models under each flux condition each cnn model is trained for 100 epochs the learning rate is initially set to 0 001 and lowered after 20 epochs the mini batch size is 128 we choose adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimization method because it shows faster convergence than standard stochastic gradient descent with momentum a nvidia quadro p5000 gpu graphics processing unit is adopted to accelerate the model training estimation accuracies of these trained cnn models are tested with validation and testing datasets the vertical swfs estimated from the cnn models trained on temperatures at different time steps under the three flux conditions are respectively compared against the reference values using the predefined indicators of rmse and r 2 the comparison results for the validation and testing datasets are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that under different flux conditions cnn trained on temperatures with higher utility can always produce vertical swf estimations with lower rmse and higher r 2 indicating more accurate estimation results this occurs because temperatures with higher utility contain more swf information and the cnn models trained on more informative temperatures can learn the mappings between the temperature and flux better thus leading to more accurate swf estimations it is worth noting that the highest utility and r 2 values under the upwelling condition fig 3 a are much smaller than those under the downwelling condition fig 3 b and 3 c the occurs because the temperature signal can be strongly attenuated by the upward flow and will be hard to detect in the installation depth of the sensor thus leading to lower temperature utility and less accurate swf estimations 3 1 4 effects of temperature measurement errors this section will focus on the sensitivity of cnn models to temperature measurement errors cnn models under the flux condition of 1 10 md 1 are chosen for detailed analysis we denote the cnn model trained on temperatures with the highest utility and that trained on the full temperature time series as cnn op input size 1 1 output size 1 1 and cnn all input size 1 100 output size 1 1 respectively the performance of cnn all and cnn op in estimating vertical swfs under different measurement error levels i e Œµ 0 0 1 0 2 1 is compared using the same test set composed of 1 000 samples r 2 and rmse values for the estimated vertical swfs from cnn all and cnn op are compared in fig 4 a and b respectively as indicated by the performance indicators both cnn all and cnn op give less accurate vertical swf estimations with the increasing measurement error level the underlying reason is that increasing the measurement error level leads to lower training data quality and thus to less accurate cnn models it is worth noting that cnn op achieves comparable estimations to cnn all under the low measurement error levels i e Œµ 0 0 1 but it exhibits remarkably more excellent performance than cnn all as the temperature measurement error becomes larger this occurs because valuable information contained in low utility temperatures is relatively sparse and it is more easily corrupted by the noise compared with that contained in high utility temperatures as a result when temperatures whose information is covered up by large measurement noises are used for training the cnn model they can greatly mislead the training process and deteriorate the overall performance of cnn all in a word the superiority of choosing temperature data for cnn model training through dwa especially when the measurement error level is high can be demonstrated through this 1 d case 3 2 case 2 2 d sandbox experimental case to further test the validity of cnn dwa in real applications we apply it to estimate the 2 d water flux fields in a sandbox designed for modeling streambed water exchange processes 3 2 1 sandbox experiment the experimental setup fig 5 consists of a plexiglass sandbox 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m width height depth two constant head reservoirs one heater in reservoir 1 63 thermistors omega hsth 44000 series with an accuracy of 0 1 c and a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system the plexiglass sandbox height 0 05 0 85 m was filled layer by layer 0 2 m each with the same type of sieved quartz sand grain size 0 15 1 mm the upper and lower boundaries of the sandbox were respectively connected to reservoir 1 and reservoir 2 to create two constant head boundaries which drove the flow system in the sandbox during the experiment the rest of the boundaries were impermeable to simulate the heat transport the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 hour interval thus the water temperature varied almost sinusoidally from 23 c to 33 c with a period of 4 h 63 thermistors were installed in the reserved ports fig 5 a and connected to the data acquisition system to monitor the temperature changes in the sandbox the experiment lasted 350 min and temperatures were monitored at an interval of 5 min resulting in 70 time steps more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in our previous works ju et al 2021 ju et al 2018 ju et al 2019 the sandbox experimental process can be described by eqs 3 and 4 which are coupled and solved by comsol multiphysics in this case values of thermal parameters for the sand were previously determined by ju et al 2018 and are listed in table 2 3 2 2 generating required datasets in the 2 d case during the modeling process the sandbox is discretized into 4 000 40 100 finite elements although the sandbox was filled with the same type of sand we still model the hydraulic conductivity k s field in the sandbox as a gaussian random field to account for heterogeneity caused by the non uniform packing and the grain size separation a total of 24 000 ln k s realizations are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation sgsim tool in the open source geostatistical package sgems remy et al 2009 the mean of the ln k s field is set to 3 13 ln md 1 which is obtained from flow through tests as other statistical parameters e g variance correlation length and variogram model are inaccessible broad parameter spectrums are adopted to incorporate the true parameter values for example we estimate the variance œÉ ln k s 2 to be within the range of 0 1 corresponding to a weak to moderate level of heterogeneity the correlation ratio i e the ratio between correlation length and domain size in both the vertical and horizontal directions is estimated to vary from 0 2 to 1 thus values of the variance and correlation ratio are uniformly chosen from 0 1 and 0 2 1 respectively three kinds of variogram models exponential model spherical model and gaussian model are considered each making up one third of the ln k s realizations upon obtaining these ln k s fields we derive the water flux fields according to darcy s law i e eq 3 and then use them for heat transport simulation based on eq 4 the comsol multiphysics is employed to perform the simulations to generate the flux and temperature fields the initial and boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are exactly the same as those in the sandbox experiment 3 2 3 training data selection in the 2 d case to mitigate the boundary effects only the temperature measurements collected from the middle 300 min analysis period from the sixth to the 65th time step are analyzed for the analysis period temperatures collected from the first 40 time steps 63 40 training period are used to train the cnn model while the rest 63 20 validation period are used for validation purpose as pointed out in case 1 we always hope to estimate swfs with as few data as possible so we assume only n obs temperature measurements can be selected from the 63 40 observations to train the cnn model in the 2 d case we search for the n obs optimal measurements by maximizing eq 8 in which the nout value is set as 24 000 equaling to the total number of temperature fields the optimization is implemented using the matlab fminsearch function lagarias et al 1998 3 2 4 cnn model training in the 2 d experimental case the cnn model in this 2 d case also includes four convolutional layers two pooling layers and one fully connected layer the kernel size for the first two convolutional layers is 3 3 while that for the last two layers is 2 2 in the two pooling layers the average pooling function with kernel size 2 1 and stride 1 1 is adopted the fully connected layer has 8 000 neurons the details of the cnn architecture are displayed in fig 6 the n obs selected temperatures and their underlying water fluxes 4 000 2 horizontal and vertical are respectively assembled to form 24 000 pairs of temperature flux arrays through arbitrary separation these temperature flux arrays are split into training validation and testing sets in the proportion of 7 2 1 in this way training of the cnn model is done using 16 800 temperature flux input output input size n obs 1 output size 8 000 1 arrays different n obs values which increase from 4 to 48 with an equal interval as 4 are tested to determine the reasonable number of temperature measurements that can guarantee the water flux field estimation accuracy of the cnn model the cnn model is trained for 120 epochs we also choose adam optimizer with learning rate as 0 001 which will decay after 20 epochs the performance of cnn models with different n obs values in estimating water flux fields is assessed with validation and testing datasets using the previously defined performance indicators temperature utility values as a function of the n obs value are plotted in fig 7 a we can see that utility of the n obs optimal temperature measurements increases significantly when n obs is less than 28 and then keeps stable with n obs exceeding 28 r 2 and rmse values for the estimated water flux fields over the validation and testing datasets under different conditions of n obs value are plotted in fig 7 b and c respectively performance indicator values for the estimated water flux field from the cnn model trained on all temperature measurements during the training period cnn all input size 63 40 output size 8 000 1 are used as the benchmark red lines in fig 7 b and 7 c for accuracy comparison it can be seen that both r 2 and rmse get closer to the benchmarks as the n obs value increases from 4 to 28 and they reach the benchmarks and keep stable when n obs further increases beyond 28 this is because adding more temperature measurements brings more information but when enough measurements are collected further increasing the n obs value will result in information redundancy and cannot enhance the water flux field estimation accuracy anymore overall considering the tradeoff between the model accuracy and monitoring cost the cnn model performs well when n obs arrives at 28 thus 28 is chosen as the reasonable value for n obs in this case 3 2 5 water flux field estimation in the sandbox in this section we denote the cnn model trained on n obs optimal measurements and that trained on n obs randomly selected measurements as cnn op and cnn rand respectively to show the superiority of cnn op over cnn rand we compare their estimations over the validation and testing datasets to avoid accidental errors 10 cnn rand models are trained and used for comparison purpose for the chosen n obs value of 28 utility values of temperatures used to train cnn op and 10 cnn rand models as well as r 2 values for the estimated water flux fields from these models are compared in fig 8 it can be seen that temperature utility values and r 2 values for cnn op are higher than those for the 10 cnn rand models what s more temperature utility values are positively correlated with r 2 values for the estimated water flux fields again indicating that cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility can always produce more accurate water flux estimations to illustrate the estimation accuracy of cnn op two estimated flux fields fig 9 c and d randomly chosen from the validation and test realizations are compared with the ground truths fig 9 a and b we can see that cnn op captures the spatial patterns of the true flux fields well through comparing fig 9 a and c and fig 9 b and d respectively we then estimate the water flux field in the sandbox with cnn all cnn op and cnn rand r1 in fig 8 respectively the estimation results from different cnn models are demonstrated in fig 10 we can see that the estimated water flux fields from cnn all and cnn op still exhibit similar patterns however since the true distribution of water fluxes in the sandbox is inaccessible the estimation accuracy is assessed by the ability to predict temperatures during the validation period with the estimated water flux fields rmse values for temperature predictions rmset from different cnn models are listed in table 3 it can be seen that with the given temperature measurement error level 0 1 cnn all and cnn op give almost the same rmset values which are smaller than that given by cnn rand indicating the superiority of cnn op over cnn rand optimal sampling locations and times determined in the bayesian dwa process are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively it can be seen that the optimal sampling locations distribute over the whole sandbox which is helpful to collect highly valuable information from different parts of the sandbox it is worth noting that only 24 sampling locations can be detected as shown in fig 11 a the underlying reason is that we can collect temperature data from one location at different times as for the optimal sampling times most of them 20 28 are concentrated in the period when the temperatures are within the range of average 1 2 amplitude 28 2 5 between the two red lines which is determined by the relatively large mean flux 5 23 md 1 as pointed in section 3 1 2 4 discussion results from the numerical and sandbox experiments show that our proposed cnn dwa inversion approach achieves accurate swf estimations its applicability comes from the great capacity of the bayesian dwa framework in choosing high utility training data as well as the powerful ability of cnn in learning nonlinear relationships automatically from training data in fact the water flux fields in the sandbox have been inferred from the same temperature time series through a data assimilation method i e iterative ensemble smoother ies in our previous work ju et al 2018 compared with ies cnn dwa can give a smaller rmse value for temperature predictions during the validation period 0 069 for cnn dwa 0 0834 for ies indicating a higher water flux estimation accuracy there are two reasons accounting for the superior performance of cnn dwa on the one hand cnn dwa is assumption free and it estimates the water flux field through a data driven mapping between temperatures and water fluxes which is built upon forward model simulations on a broad parameter spectrum thus estimation uncertainties arising from the underlying assumptions of ies e g the gaussian assumption can be avoided in cnn dwa on the other hand only high utility temperatures are selected to ensure the accuracy of the inferred water flux field in cnn dwa while the performance of ies may be deteriorated by the assimilated data of low quality it should be pointed out that the large number of forward model simulations on a broad parameter spectrum in cnn dwa contribute to reliable estimation results but they also lead to a higher computational cost compared to ies although cnn dwa performs well in the two designed experiments its limitations do exist first of all the main limitations of the proposed approach originate from the limits of using heat as a tracer to quantify swfs which have been explored in numerous existing studies briggs et al 2014 glose et al 2019 gosselin et al 2016 xie and batlle aguilar 2017 xie et al 2015 for example as pointed out in section 3 1 3 the effectiveness of the heat tracing method may be impeded by the upwelling water flow to overcome the limits of heat as a tracer the strategy of combining temperature data with other data types can be adopted in future studies and it has been recommended and proven effective to improve the swf estimation accuracy in previous studies xie et al 2015 secondly as pointed out in section 3 implementation of the bayesian dwa requires the prior information about the swfs e g the mean flux and the streambed surface temperature time series however when considering a field application little prior information is available for swfs and the streambed surface temperature time series are also hard to acquire to overcome the challenges mentioned above we propose two possible strategies we can firstly resort to the existing stream water temperature prediction models caissie et al 2007 pike et al 2013 since they can be employed to forecast the streambed surface temperature under natural conditions according to meteorological conditions another solution is that we can adopt a flux range which is broad enough to include the true swfs in the dwa stage since the dwa results corresponding to the sufficiently broad flux range can accommodate each specific flux condition within it additionally estimation of the flux field in the sandbox through cnn dwa is based on the information transfer from synthetic data generated through numerical simulations to real world data therefore the estimation results may also suffer the uncertainties resulting from model structural errors of the numerical model to overcome this limitation physical information and some experimental data can be introduced into the neural network raissi et al 2019 xie et al 2022 to develop a physics informed and experimental data tuned cnn dwa framework in future studies finally we stress that the cnn dwa approach is tested with data produced with numerical and well controlled lab scale experiments that are easily reproducible in contrast field data are generally subject to multiple uncertainties which are hard to reproduce with a mathematical model however synthetic modeling with model simplification is a significant step forward for understanding complex systems further work is needed to test the applicability of the cnn dwa method in more complex systems e g water exchange processes in natural streambeds 5 conclusions in this study we combine cnn with the bayesian dwa framework for the estimation of swfs in the first step a synthetic dataset is generated through numerical simulations representing the coupled process of groundwater flow and heat transport in a streambed high utility temperatures are then chosen from the synthetic dataset through bayesian dwa to train the cnn model used for swf estimation a 1 d numerical case is first conducted to assess the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the vertical swf estimation accuracy of the cnn model results of the 1 d case indicate that cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility can give more accurate swf estimations with the increasing measurement error level the advantage of conducting temperature dwa becomes more obvious results of the 2 d sandbox case further validate that limited temperature observations chosen from the optimal sampling locations and times can provide similar amount of information for cnn model training and water flux field estimation as the full time series it is worth noting that the proposed approach achieves more accurate water flux field estimations compared to the ies method used in our previous studies the determination of the optimal sampling times mainly relies on the prior information of the swfs e g the mean flux in field applications where little prior information is available a flux range broad enough to include the true swfs can be adopted in the dwa stage as for the optimal sampling locations they are distributed over the whole sandbox to help collect useful information from different parts of the sandbox results of the bayesian dwa can provide guidance on temperature monitoring design in natural streambeds the proposed cnn dwa approach can bring an improvement in the swf estimation accuracy which is vital for water resource management and conservation credit authorship contribution statement lei ju conceptualization methodology writing original draft yutong hou data

3226,quantifying streambed water fluxes swfs is a prerequisite for studying the transport and fate of contaminants in the hyporheic zone one approach the heat tracing technique combined with analytical or numerical heat transport models has been widely used to quantify swfs however both analytical and numerical methods are limited for example analytical methods are built upon rarely met assumptions while the inversion performance of numerical methods can be impeded by uncertainties from different sources to overcome these limitations we introduce a new approach that combines convolutional neural networks cnns with the bayesian data worth analysis dwa framework for estimating swfs in this approach a synthetic dataset is first generated through numerical simulations of groundwater flow and heat transport in streambeds then high utility temperatures are chosen from the synthetic dataset through bayesian dwa and further used to train the cnn model we assess the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the swf estimation accuracy of cnn models through both numerical and sandbox experimental cases results show that the cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility generally gives more accurate swf estimations use of a few high utility temperature measurements can provide near similar constraint on the cnn model training and swf estimation as compared to the full time series furthermore a comparison to the iterative ensemble smoother algorithm shows the proposed inversion approach can estimate the flux field in the sandbox more accurately the proposed cnn based inversion approach considering dwa cnn dwa would be beneficial more broadly for other hydrological problems keywords bayesian data worth analysis streambed water flux quantification heat tracing method deep learning 1 introduction accurately quantifying the streambed water fluxes swfs is vital for the study of water flow and contaminant transport in the hyporheic zone cardenas 2015 hester et al 2017 various methods have been used to estimate swfs including seepage meters lee 1977 paulsen et al 2001 portable piezometers lee and cherry 1979 and tracer experiments colombani et al 2015 cook et al 2018 xie et al 2016 among these methods the heat tracing technique has become increasingly popular in the past decade as presented in reviews by anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 and irvine et al 2017 the principle behind the heat tracing technique is that groundwater flow induces heat advection and disturbs an expected conduction dominated subsurface temperature regime thus the recorded temperature information can be used to infer swfs anderson 2005 the advantage of using heat as a tracer lies in that temperature is environmentally friendly and can be measured easily and cheaply rau et al 2014 a widely used approach for inferring vertical swfs from multilevel streambed temperature signals is based on the analytic solution of the one dimensional 1 d heat transport equation hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 luce et al 2013 although efficient to implement limitations of the analytical solutions do exist for example they are restricted to specific assumptions that are rarely met in natural conditions such as purely vertical flow homogeneous hydraulic and thermal parameters sinusoidal temperature signal and so on irvine et al 2015 to overcome the limitations of the analytical solutions numerical approaches are introduced to estimate swfs in real world situations i e transient and heterogeneous flow fields the numerical code 1dtemppro voytek et al 2014 and its extension 1dtemppro v2 koch et al 2016 facilitate vertical swf estimations in complex situations by calibrating the coupled groundwater flow and heat transport model to observed temperature profiles munz and schmidt 2017 developed an inverse numerical computer program named flux bot to invert vertical swfs from observed temperature time series and perform corresponding uncertainty analysis in our previous work ju et al 2018 we inferred two dimensional 2 d water fluxes in a sandbox from hydraulic head and temperature measurements through a data assimilation method despite the popularity of numerical methods their inversion performance may be impeded by uncertainties resulting from model structural errors inaccurate observation data and assumptions underlying the inverse problem linde et al 2017 rajabi et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 recently deep learning dl has achieved increasing popularity in inverse modeling of hydrologic systems shen 2018 shen et al 2018 which provides an alternative tool for inferring swfs dl based inverse modeling in hydrology can be found in a number of recent studies for example sun 2018 proposed a state parameter identification generative adversarial neural network spid gan to learn the bidirectional mappings between the high dimensional model parameters and model states which can be further used for parameter inversion zhong et al 2020 built a cyclegan based inversion workflow to estimate reservoir fluid property changes by adopting seismic data kreyenberg et al 2019 trained a cnn with synthetic data that represent the physical process understanding and then applied it to derive the density driven flow velocities in real world experiments based on concentration measurements intuitively as a data driven approach the performance of dl models is heavily reliant upon the quality of data for model training to ensure the performance of dl models and optimize data collection it is beneficial to select the most informative data for dl training through implementing data worth analysis dwa in advance in recent years dwa has found widespread applications in groundwater related problems to guide data collection leube et al 2012 nowak et al 2012 w√∂hling et al 2016 many previous studies chose to address the dwa problem using the first order second moment fosm method glasgow et al 2003 within a linearized framework for example partington et al 2020 assessed the worth of hydraulic and water chemistry data in terms of predicting swfs using the fosm method knowling et al 2020 compared the worth of tritium derived mean residence time mrt observations relative to other observation data types in decision support contexts via the fosm analyses one alternative to the linearized dwa method is the bayesian dwa approach which can evaluate the data worth with an assumption free criterion e g the kullback leibler divergence lindley 1956 from the bayesian perspective due to the flexibility and rigorous theory such assumption free bayesian dwa methods have been increasingly applied in groundwater systems where most parameter to state maps are moderately to highly nonlinear lu et al 2018 lu et al 2012 man et al 2017 neuman et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge there is no existing study about choosing highly informative data for training dl models to improve their performance in inverse modeling inspired by the recent progresses of dl models and dwa approaches we employ the bayesian dwa framework to choose the most informative temperature data for cnn training and then estimate swfs with the trained cnn models both numerical and sandbox experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed cnn dwa approach the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodologies the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through both numerical and sandbox experiments in section 3 comparisons of methods and potential applications of the proposed approach in real world situations are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 methodologies 2 1 forward models our focus in this study is on the heat transport problem in streambeds where the groundwater flow is assumed to be steady state the steady state groundwater flow process can be described as 1 k s h 0 subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h t 0 h 0 h Œ≥ 1 h 1 h Œ≥ 2 h 2 then the darcy flux q can be calculated as 3 q k s h where h denotes the hydraulic head k s denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity h 0 represents the initial hydraulic head h 1 and h 2 are the hydraulic heads fixed at dirichlet boundaries Œ≥ 1 and Œ≥ 2 respectively the propagation of heat through the saturated sediments can be described by the heat transport equation with the following form 4 t t k e 2 t q œÅ w c w œÅ c t where t denotes the temperature t is the time k e Œª œÅ c is the effective thermal diffusivity Œª Œª w Œ∏ Œª s 1 Œ∏ is the thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment Œª w and Œª s are the thermal conductivity of water and solids respectively Œ∏ is the effective porosity of the sediment œÅ c Œ∏ œÅ w c w 1 Œ∏ œÅ s c s is the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sediment œÅ w c w and œÅ s c s represent the volumetric heat capacity of water and solids respectively 2 2 bayesian dwa in this study a widely used bayesian experimental design criterion termed the relative entropy or the kullback leibler divergence lindley 1956 is employed to assess the data worth assuming that a measurement model has the following form 5 d f m Œµ where d denotes the measurement vector f denotes the forward model m represents the parameter vector and Œµ is the vector of measurement errors for a given data set d the relative entropy is taken as the utility function to measure the information gain from the prior distribution p m to the posterior distribution p m d the utility function u d is defined as lindley 1956 6 u d p m d ln p m d p m d m since the dwa is conducted before actually collecting any data we employ the expected utility u to quantify the information content of a possible data collection scheme the approach of calculating the expected relative entropy is also called the pre posterior analysis leube et al 2012 nowak and guthke 2016 which has been frequently adopted in groundwater monitoring designs ju et al 2019 man et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 here the expectation is taken over the considered parameter space and all possible observations huan and marzouk 2013 7 u u d p m d d m d d where d represents the simulated measurements with given parameter m the expected relative entropy is essentially the mutual information between model parameters of interest and future observations cover and thomas 1991 in this study to simplify the integrating process in eq 7 the approach proposed by huan and marzouk 2013 is adopted to numerically calculate the expected utility value 8 u 1 n out i 1 n out ln p d i m i ln p d i where n out denotes the number of monte carlo samples in the outer loop m i are parameter samples drawn from the prior distribution p m d i are simulated measurements drawn from the likelihood p d m m i the evidence p d is also approximated by the monte carlo simulation 9 p d i p d i m p m d m 1 n in j 1 n in p d i m i j n in denotes the number of monte carlo samples in the inner loop so the system model needs to be evaluated n in n out times in total to alleviate the computational burden we use the same batch of prior realizations for monte carlo simulations in both the inner and outer summations thus reducing the number of total model simulations to n out 2 3 workflow for estimating swfs with a cnn model in this study we aim at improving the swf estimation accuracy of a cnn model through selecting the most informative temperature data for the cnn training the workflow can be described as follows step 1 datasets generation we create a dataset containing multiple pairs of temperature time series and their underlying swfs through synthetic simulations of groundwater flow and heat transport in a streambed details of generating the dataset will be presented in the following case studies section 3 step 2 bayesian dwa determining the optimal sampling times and locations for temperatures through conducting the bayesian dwa step 3 training the cnn model using the selected dataset the selected temperatures i e temperatures with higher utility values and their underlying swfs are assembled to form the training dataset the cnn model takes temperature measurements as input and gives swfs as output step 4 estimating swfs the trained cnn is then used to estimate swfs based on temperature measurements it is worth noting that temperatures used for estimating swfs and those used for cnn model training in step 3 should be sampled from the same times and locations determined in step 2 since lots of studies have presented the mathematical foundation of cnn and its underlying theory is not the focus of our work we decide not to provide the details here interested readers are suggested to refer to lecun et al 2015 and gu et al 2018 2 4 estimation accuracy assessment the performance of the trained cnn in estimating swfs is evaluated based on two commonly used metrics the root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 which are defined as 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i r f i 2 11 r 2 i 1 n r f i rf e i e i 1 n r f i rf 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 here rf and e stand for reference values and estimated values respectively with i denoting their index n is the number of samples the overline denotes the mean operator if swfs are better estimated smaller rmse and r 2 values closer to 1 are expected to be obtained 3 case studies in this section the effectiveness of bayesian dwa in improving the swf estimation accuracy of cnn models is illustrated by both numerical and experimental cases 3 1 case 1 1 d numerical case the first 1 d numerical case aims at demonstrating the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the vertical swf estimation accuracy of cnn models through selecting training temperature data from the optimal sampling times when only 1 d vertical heat transport is considered eq 4 is simplified as stallman 1965 12 t t k e 2 t z 2 q z œÅ w c w œÅ c t z with certain assumptions i e sinusoidal temperature signal homogeneous hydraulic and thermal properties of the streambed the analytical solution to eq 12 is expressed as follows 13 t z t a exp vz 2 k e z 2 k e Œ± v 2 2 cos 2 œÄ t p z 2 k e Œ± v 2 2 where a is the amplitude of the surface temperature variation v œÅ w c w q œÅ c is the thermal front velocity Œ± v 4 8 œÄ k e p 2 in which p is the temperature variation period in this case only the vertical water flux q z is to be estimated while other parameters are given in table 1 3 1 1 1 d model settings the 1 d model domain is a vertical line with a length of 1 m constant heads are used as the dirichlet boundary for the flow field along the upper and lower sides of the model domain to simulate the heat transport in natural streambeds where the heat source is solar radiation the upper boundary of the temperature field is assumed to satisfy the following equation as suggested in previous studies irvine et al 2015 luce et al 2013 14 t t t ave a sin 2 œÄ t p where t ave 20 c a 5 c and p 1 d the lower boundary of the temperature field is an outflow boundary with this temperature amplitude the effect of heat transport on the groundwater flow is negligible hecht m√©ndez et al 2010 ma and zheng 2010 since our interest is to investigate the potential possibility of estimating swfs with as few data as possible we assume that only one observation point at the depth of 0 3 m is available for temperatures in this case the total simulation period is set as one day and the temperature is measured every 0 01 d resulting in 100 time steps temperature measurements we assume that the vertical swfs are uniformly distributed within the range of 0 5 10 md 1 which can cover most of the groundwater flux magnitudes angermann et al 2012 rau et al 2014 the positive and negative signs imply downward and upward flow respectively the limit of the upward flux 0 5 md 1 is chosen based on the following consideration the inferred upwelling vertical swfs using the amplitude ratio method hatch et al 2006 in most existing studies are less than 0 5 md 1 briggs et al 2013 daniluk et al 2013 gordon et al 2013 keery et al 2007 thus we set it as the upward flux limit in this study 3 1 2 temperature dwa in the 1 d case to test the effects of water flux on the temperature utility utility values of temperature measurements at 100 sampling times under different flux conditions i e 0 5 0 md 1 0 1 md 1 and 1 10 md 1 are respectively calculated using eq 6 for each flux condition there are 10 000 vertical swfs being drawn from the given flux range and then used to simulate the corresponding temperature time series through running the 1 d heat transport model i e eq 13 the measurement errors are assumed to follow independent gaussian distributions with zero mean and standard deviation of 0 1 we set nout in eq 8 as 10 000 which is the total number of temperature time series utility values of temperatures at 100 time steps under different flux conditions are shown in fig 1 it is observed that utility values of temperatures at 100 sampling times show different variation trends under different flux conditions for lower flux ranges i e 0 5 0 md 1 and 0 1 md 1 sampling times near the moments at which the minimum maximum temperatures appear lead to the highest temperature utility while the lowest temperature utility is given by the sampling times near the moments at which the average temperature tave 20 appears this occurs because a slight variation of the swf can bring about significant changes of the temperature amplitude under the lower flux conditions therefore temperatures near the minimum maximum values that reflect the amplitude information are more informative in terms of the swfs as the swf increases to a relatively high range of 1 10 md 1 temperatures near the average 20 possess higher utility compared to those far from it the underlying reason is that temperatures near the average are more sensitive to the variation of the relatively high swf compared to those near the minimum maximum values which hardly change as the high swf varies 3 1 3 cnn model training and vertical swf estimation a cnn architecture generally consists of a cascade of convolutional layers pooling layers and fully connected layers the cnn model used in this case includes four convolutional layers two pooling layers and one fully connected layer to stabilize and accelerate the training process batch normalization is imposed after each convolutional layer the training hyper parameters i e numbers of network layers channels and neurons in each layer are determined by random search technique goodfellow et al 2016 in this case the kernel sizes for the four convolutional layers are as follows 1 3 for the first two layers 1 2 for the third layer and 1 1 for the last layer in the pooling layers the average pooling function with kernel size 1 1 and stride 1 1 is adopted the last fully connected layer has one neuron aiming to gather the extracted information to output the details about the architecture of the deep neural network are illustrated in fig 2 in this section we respectively compare the vertical swf estimation accuracies of the cnn models trained on temperatures at different time steps under different flux conditions i e 0 5 0 md 1 0 1 md 1 and 1 10 md 1 for each flux condition temperatures at 100 time steps and their underlying swfs are firstly assembled to form 100 original datasets each containing 10 000 pairs of temperature flux input output input size 1 1 output size 1 1 arrays secondly through arbitrary separation 10 000 pairs of temperature flux arrays in each of the 100 original datasets are split into training validation and testing sets in the proportion of 7 2 1 lastly we train the cnn models using training datasets at different time steps respectively resulting in 100 cnn models under each flux condition each cnn model is trained for 100 epochs the learning rate is initially set to 0 001 and lowered after 20 epochs the mini batch size is 128 we choose adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimization method because it shows faster convergence than standard stochastic gradient descent with momentum a nvidia quadro p5000 gpu graphics processing unit is adopted to accelerate the model training estimation accuracies of these trained cnn models are tested with validation and testing datasets the vertical swfs estimated from the cnn models trained on temperatures at different time steps under the three flux conditions are respectively compared against the reference values using the predefined indicators of rmse and r 2 the comparison results for the validation and testing datasets are shown in fig 3 it can be seen that under different flux conditions cnn trained on temperatures with higher utility can always produce vertical swf estimations with lower rmse and higher r 2 indicating more accurate estimation results this occurs because temperatures with higher utility contain more swf information and the cnn models trained on more informative temperatures can learn the mappings between the temperature and flux better thus leading to more accurate swf estimations it is worth noting that the highest utility and r 2 values under the upwelling condition fig 3 a are much smaller than those under the downwelling condition fig 3 b and 3 c the occurs because the temperature signal can be strongly attenuated by the upward flow and will be hard to detect in the installation depth of the sensor thus leading to lower temperature utility and less accurate swf estimations 3 1 4 effects of temperature measurement errors this section will focus on the sensitivity of cnn models to temperature measurement errors cnn models under the flux condition of 1 10 md 1 are chosen for detailed analysis we denote the cnn model trained on temperatures with the highest utility and that trained on the full temperature time series as cnn op input size 1 1 output size 1 1 and cnn all input size 1 100 output size 1 1 respectively the performance of cnn all and cnn op in estimating vertical swfs under different measurement error levels i e Œµ 0 0 1 0 2 1 is compared using the same test set composed of 1 000 samples r 2 and rmse values for the estimated vertical swfs from cnn all and cnn op are compared in fig 4 a and b respectively as indicated by the performance indicators both cnn all and cnn op give less accurate vertical swf estimations with the increasing measurement error level the underlying reason is that increasing the measurement error level leads to lower training data quality and thus to less accurate cnn models it is worth noting that cnn op achieves comparable estimations to cnn all under the low measurement error levels i e Œµ 0 0 1 but it exhibits remarkably more excellent performance than cnn all as the temperature measurement error becomes larger this occurs because valuable information contained in low utility temperatures is relatively sparse and it is more easily corrupted by the noise compared with that contained in high utility temperatures as a result when temperatures whose information is covered up by large measurement noises are used for training the cnn model they can greatly mislead the training process and deteriorate the overall performance of cnn all in a word the superiority of choosing temperature data for cnn model training through dwa especially when the measurement error level is high can be demonstrated through this 1 d case 3 2 case 2 2 d sandbox experimental case to further test the validity of cnn dwa in real applications we apply it to estimate the 2 d water flux fields in a sandbox designed for modeling streambed water exchange processes 3 2 1 sandbox experiment the experimental setup fig 5 consists of a plexiglass sandbox 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m width height depth two constant head reservoirs one heater in reservoir 1 63 thermistors omega hsth 44000 series with an accuracy of 0 1 c and a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system the plexiglass sandbox height 0 05 0 85 m was filled layer by layer 0 2 m each with the same type of sieved quartz sand grain size 0 15 1 mm the upper and lower boundaries of the sandbox were respectively connected to reservoir 1 and reservoir 2 to create two constant head boundaries which drove the flow system in the sandbox during the experiment the rest of the boundaries were impermeable to simulate the heat transport the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 hour interval thus the water temperature varied almost sinusoidally from 23 c to 33 c with a period of 4 h 63 thermistors were installed in the reserved ports fig 5 a and connected to the data acquisition system to monitor the temperature changes in the sandbox the experiment lasted 350 min and temperatures were monitored at an interval of 5 min resulting in 70 time steps more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in our previous works ju et al 2021 ju et al 2018 ju et al 2019 the sandbox experimental process can be described by eqs 3 and 4 which are coupled and solved by comsol multiphysics in this case values of thermal parameters for the sand were previously determined by ju et al 2018 and are listed in table 2 3 2 2 generating required datasets in the 2 d case during the modeling process the sandbox is discretized into 4 000 40 100 finite elements although the sandbox was filled with the same type of sand we still model the hydraulic conductivity k s field in the sandbox as a gaussian random field to account for heterogeneity caused by the non uniform packing and the grain size separation a total of 24 000 ln k s realizations are generated using the sequential gaussian simulation sgsim tool in the open source geostatistical package sgems remy et al 2009 the mean of the ln k s field is set to 3 13 ln md 1 which is obtained from flow through tests as other statistical parameters e g variance correlation length and variogram model are inaccessible broad parameter spectrums are adopted to incorporate the true parameter values for example we estimate the variance œÉ ln k s 2 to be within the range of 0 1 corresponding to a weak to moderate level of heterogeneity the correlation ratio i e the ratio between correlation length and domain size in both the vertical and horizontal directions is estimated to vary from 0 2 to 1 thus values of the variance and correlation ratio are uniformly chosen from 0 1 and 0 2 1 respectively three kinds of variogram models exponential model spherical model and gaussian model are considered each making up one third of the ln k s realizations upon obtaining these ln k s fields we derive the water flux fields according to darcy s law i e eq 3 and then use them for heat transport simulation based on eq 4 the comsol multiphysics is employed to perform the simulations to generate the flux and temperature fields the initial and boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are exactly the same as those in the sandbox experiment 3 2 3 training data selection in the 2 d case to mitigate the boundary effects only the temperature measurements collected from the middle 300 min analysis period from the sixth to the 65th time step are analyzed for the analysis period temperatures collected from the first 40 time steps 63 40 training period are used to train the cnn model while the rest 63 20 validation period are used for validation purpose as pointed out in case 1 we always hope to estimate swfs with as few data as possible so we assume only n obs temperature measurements can be selected from the 63 40 observations to train the cnn model in the 2 d case we search for the n obs optimal measurements by maximizing eq 8 in which the nout value is set as 24 000 equaling to the total number of temperature fields the optimization is implemented using the matlab fminsearch function lagarias et al 1998 3 2 4 cnn model training in the 2 d experimental case the cnn model in this 2 d case also includes four convolutional layers two pooling layers and one fully connected layer the kernel size for the first two convolutional layers is 3 3 while that for the last two layers is 2 2 in the two pooling layers the average pooling function with kernel size 2 1 and stride 1 1 is adopted the fully connected layer has 8 000 neurons the details of the cnn architecture are displayed in fig 6 the n obs selected temperatures and their underlying water fluxes 4 000 2 horizontal and vertical are respectively assembled to form 24 000 pairs of temperature flux arrays through arbitrary separation these temperature flux arrays are split into training validation and testing sets in the proportion of 7 2 1 in this way training of the cnn model is done using 16 800 temperature flux input output input size n obs 1 output size 8 000 1 arrays different n obs values which increase from 4 to 48 with an equal interval as 4 are tested to determine the reasonable number of temperature measurements that can guarantee the water flux field estimation accuracy of the cnn model the cnn model is trained for 120 epochs we also choose adam optimizer with learning rate as 0 001 which will decay after 20 epochs the performance of cnn models with different n obs values in estimating water flux fields is assessed with validation and testing datasets using the previously defined performance indicators temperature utility values as a function of the n obs value are plotted in fig 7 a we can see that utility of the n obs optimal temperature measurements increases significantly when n obs is less than 28 and then keeps stable with n obs exceeding 28 r 2 and rmse values for the estimated water flux fields over the validation and testing datasets under different conditions of n obs value are plotted in fig 7 b and c respectively performance indicator values for the estimated water flux field from the cnn model trained on all temperature measurements during the training period cnn all input size 63 40 output size 8 000 1 are used as the benchmark red lines in fig 7 b and 7 c for accuracy comparison it can be seen that both r 2 and rmse get closer to the benchmarks as the n obs value increases from 4 to 28 and they reach the benchmarks and keep stable when n obs further increases beyond 28 this is because adding more temperature measurements brings more information but when enough measurements are collected further increasing the n obs value will result in information redundancy and cannot enhance the water flux field estimation accuracy anymore overall considering the tradeoff between the model accuracy and monitoring cost the cnn model performs well when n obs arrives at 28 thus 28 is chosen as the reasonable value for n obs in this case 3 2 5 water flux field estimation in the sandbox in this section we denote the cnn model trained on n obs optimal measurements and that trained on n obs randomly selected measurements as cnn op and cnn rand respectively to show the superiority of cnn op over cnn rand we compare their estimations over the validation and testing datasets to avoid accidental errors 10 cnn rand models are trained and used for comparison purpose for the chosen n obs value of 28 utility values of temperatures used to train cnn op and 10 cnn rand models as well as r 2 values for the estimated water flux fields from these models are compared in fig 8 it can be seen that temperature utility values and r 2 values for cnn op are higher than those for the 10 cnn rand models what s more temperature utility values are positively correlated with r 2 values for the estimated water flux fields again indicating that cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility can always produce more accurate water flux estimations to illustrate the estimation accuracy of cnn op two estimated flux fields fig 9 c and d randomly chosen from the validation and test realizations are compared with the ground truths fig 9 a and b we can see that cnn op captures the spatial patterns of the true flux fields well through comparing fig 9 a and c and fig 9 b and d respectively we then estimate the water flux field in the sandbox with cnn all cnn op and cnn rand r1 in fig 8 respectively the estimation results from different cnn models are demonstrated in fig 10 we can see that the estimated water flux fields from cnn all and cnn op still exhibit similar patterns however since the true distribution of water fluxes in the sandbox is inaccessible the estimation accuracy is assessed by the ability to predict temperatures during the validation period with the estimated water flux fields rmse values for temperature predictions rmset from different cnn models are listed in table 3 it can be seen that with the given temperature measurement error level 0 1 cnn all and cnn op give almost the same rmset values which are smaller than that given by cnn rand indicating the superiority of cnn op over cnn rand optimal sampling locations and times determined in the bayesian dwa process are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively it can be seen that the optimal sampling locations distribute over the whole sandbox which is helpful to collect highly valuable information from different parts of the sandbox it is worth noting that only 24 sampling locations can be detected as shown in fig 11 a the underlying reason is that we can collect temperature data from one location at different times as for the optimal sampling times most of them 20 28 are concentrated in the period when the temperatures are within the range of average 1 2 amplitude 28 2 5 between the two red lines which is determined by the relatively large mean flux 5 23 md 1 as pointed in section 3 1 2 4 discussion results from the numerical and sandbox experiments show that our proposed cnn dwa inversion approach achieves accurate swf estimations its applicability comes from the great capacity of the bayesian dwa framework in choosing high utility training data as well as the powerful ability of cnn in learning nonlinear relationships automatically from training data in fact the water flux fields in the sandbox have been inferred from the same temperature time series through a data assimilation method i e iterative ensemble smoother ies in our previous work ju et al 2018 compared with ies cnn dwa can give a smaller rmse value for temperature predictions during the validation period 0 069 for cnn dwa 0 0834 for ies indicating a higher water flux estimation accuracy there are two reasons accounting for the superior performance of cnn dwa on the one hand cnn dwa is assumption free and it estimates the water flux field through a data driven mapping between temperatures and water fluxes which is built upon forward model simulations on a broad parameter spectrum thus estimation uncertainties arising from the underlying assumptions of ies e g the gaussian assumption can be avoided in cnn dwa on the other hand only high utility temperatures are selected to ensure the accuracy of the inferred water flux field in cnn dwa while the performance of ies may be deteriorated by the assimilated data of low quality it should be pointed out that the large number of forward model simulations on a broad parameter spectrum in cnn dwa contribute to reliable estimation results but they also lead to a higher computational cost compared to ies although cnn dwa performs well in the two designed experiments its limitations do exist first of all the main limitations of the proposed approach originate from the limits of using heat as a tracer to quantify swfs which have been explored in numerous existing studies briggs et al 2014 glose et al 2019 gosselin et al 2016 xie and batlle aguilar 2017 xie et al 2015 for example as pointed out in section 3 1 3 the effectiveness of the heat tracing method may be impeded by the upwelling water flow to overcome the limits of heat as a tracer the strategy of combining temperature data with other data types can be adopted in future studies and it has been recommended and proven effective to improve the swf estimation accuracy in previous studies xie et al 2015 secondly as pointed out in section 3 implementation of the bayesian dwa requires the prior information about the swfs e g the mean flux and the streambed surface temperature time series however when considering a field application little prior information is available for swfs and the streambed surface temperature time series are also hard to acquire to overcome the challenges mentioned above we propose two possible strategies we can firstly resort to the existing stream water temperature prediction models caissie et al 2007 pike et al 2013 since they can be employed to forecast the streambed surface temperature under natural conditions according to meteorological conditions another solution is that we can adopt a flux range which is broad enough to include the true swfs in the dwa stage since the dwa results corresponding to the sufficiently broad flux range can accommodate each specific flux condition within it additionally estimation of the flux field in the sandbox through cnn dwa is based on the information transfer from synthetic data generated through numerical simulations to real world data therefore the estimation results may also suffer the uncertainties resulting from model structural errors of the numerical model to overcome this limitation physical information and some experimental data can be introduced into the neural network raissi et al 2019 xie et al 2022 to develop a physics informed and experimental data tuned cnn dwa framework in future studies finally we stress that the cnn dwa approach is tested with data produced with numerical and well controlled lab scale experiments that are easily reproducible in contrast field data are generally subject to multiple uncertainties which are hard to reproduce with a mathematical model however synthetic modeling with model simplification is a significant step forward for understanding complex systems further work is needed to test the applicability of the cnn dwa method in more complex systems e g water exchange processes in natural streambeds 5 conclusions in this study we combine cnn with the bayesian dwa framework for the estimation of swfs in the first step a synthetic dataset is generated through numerical simulations representing the coupled process of groundwater flow and heat transport in a streambed high utility temperatures are then chosen from the synthetic dataset through bayesian dwa to train the cnn model used for swf estimation a 1 d numerical case is first conducted to assess the capability of bayesian dwa in improving the vertical swf estimation accuracy of the cnn model results of the 1 d case indicate that cnn model trained on temperatures with higher utility can give more accurate swf estimations with the increasing measurement error level the advantage of conducting temperature dwa becomes more obvious results of the 2 d sandbox case further validate that limited temperature observations chosen from the optimal sampling locations and times can provide similar amount of information for cnn model training and water flux field estimation as the full time series it is worth noting that the proposed approach achieves more accurate water flux field estimations compared to the ies method used in our previous studies the determination of the optimal sampling times mainly relies on the prior information of the swfs e g the mean flux in field applications where little prior information is available a flux range broad enough to include the true swfs can be adopted in the dwa stage as for the optimal sampling locations they are distributed over the whole sandbox to help collect useful information from different parts of the sandbox results of the bayesian dwa can provide guidance on temperature monitoring design in natural streambeds the proposed cnn dwa approach can bring an improvement in the swf estimation accuracy which is vital for water resource management and conservation credit authorship contribution statement lei ju conceptualization methodology writing original draft yutong hou data

3227,evapotranspiration et is one of the key elements linking earth s water carbon system accurate estimation of global land evapotranspiration is essential for understanding land atmosphere interactions under a changing climate however due to a lack of observations at the global scale inherent uncertainties limit the direct use of these data in this study we employed collocation analysis methods including single and double instrumental variable algorithms ivs ivd triple collocation tc quadruple collocation qc and extended double instrumental variable algorithms eivd to evaluate five widely used et products at 0 1 and 0 25 resolutions over daily and 8 day frequencies to validate the reliability of collocation methods the collocation analysis results were compared with evaluations based on in situ observations the results exhibited reasonably high accuracy with an average correlation of determination r 2 of 0 71 for all methods in addition ivd eivd and qc demonstrated better performances than other methods in general the era5 and gleam products showed lower uncertainty than the other products over 0 1 and 0 25 respectively although the error resulting from nonzero error cross correlation ecc should be considered the ecc results from eivd and qc revealed that this influence was acceptable in our study overall this study presented a comprehensive application and comparison of all collocation analysis methods for error characterization of et products the findings suggested that collocation analysis methods could be reliable tools to serve as alternatives for tower observations at the global scale which could be helpful for further data assimilation and merging keywords land evapotranspiration data evaluation collocation analysis 1 introduction land evapotranspiration et including transpiration soil evaporation and evaporation from canopy interception is the key component of the global terrestrial water and energy cycle jung et al 2010 lian et al 2018 it plays a central role in linking the energy water and carbon cycles migliavacca et al 2021 thus in a changing global environment accurate estimation of global land evapotranspiration is critical for understanding the hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interaction which is a prerequisite for water resource management and drought predictions gentine et al 2019 khan et al 2018 miralles et al 2019 wang et al 2012 conventional in situ techniques such as weighing lysimeters bowen ratios and eddy covariance systems are reliable for providing et measurements at point and local scales pastorello et al 2020 however such solutions are not proper for a global estimation due to its sparse coverage and questionable scaling issues to portray the spatial heterogeneity of et pokhrel et al 2021 tang and li 2017 continuous efforts have been made in past decades to produce multiyear global terrestrial et including combining conventional methods with remote sensing based models li et al 2019 miralles et al 2011 complex land surface models hersbach et al 2020 rodell et al 2004 and machine learning based attempts chen et al 2020 hossein kazemi et al 2020 jung et al 2019 among these products large discrepancies in quantifying the magnitude of global et are commonly found for example the global mean annual et from 1980 to 2012 estimated by different products ranged from approximately 400 to 700 mm yr 1 as illustrated in previous studies maes et al 2019 pan et al 2020a short gianotti et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 these uncertainties may originate from a lack of sufficient validation measurements bias in forcing input inconsistent spatial and temporal resolutions or imperfect calibration of model parameters cheng et al 2021 fuentes et al 2020 thus information on biases in various global et datasets is a prerequisite for diverse applications or further merging recently two types of accuracy investigations for et datasets have been proposed the first approach employs direct information from in situ observations or defines the average value of inputs as a more reliable true representation to compare the similarities and differences among inputs which are usually frequently used for calibration and validation purposes jim√©nez et al 2011 majozi et al 2017 pan et al 2020b sun et al 2020 another type which is based on the water balance equation focuses on comparing performances over a basin or a specific region such as the amazon plain or congo basin baker et al 2021 green et al 2021 liu et al 2016 restrepo coupe et al 2021 both types rely on the proper selection of a reference to compare the datasets in terms of correlation bias and root mean square error however for a geophysical variable with high spatial variability both et and high quality reference datasets are difficult to find especially over data scarce regions to address this limitation collocation analysis methods have emerged as promising techniques to estimate the random error standard deviation and data truth correlations for collocated datasets on a grid cell by grid cell basis for the entire globe dong et al 2020c gruber et al 2020 mccoll et al 2016 stoffelen 1998 these methods regard the errors associated with collocated datasets as a true representation of uncertainty without assuming that any of the datasets are free of errors mccoll et al 2014 the main advantage of collocation analysis is that no high quality reference dataset is required su et al 2014 wu et al 2021 an important prerequisite for applying collocation methods is the availability of many spatially and temporally corresponding datasets for each grid the input data are a combination of long term simulation or observation series from each collocated dataset the output is the standard deviation of the product random errors on each grid recently collocation analysis methods have been widely applied in the evaluation of estimates of geophysical variables including soil moisture chen et al 2018 dong et al 2020a precipitation dong et al 2020b li et al 2018 ocean wind speed ribal and young 2020 leaf area index jiang et al 2017 total water storage baik et al 2021 sea ice thickness and surface salinity hoareau et al 2018 and near surface air temperature sun et al 2021 although continuous adjustments have been addressed to improve the performance of collocation methods only a few studies have considered methods for analyzing et products khan et al 2018 therefore the main objectives of our study are described as follows 1 to investigate the reliability of collocation methods for the evaluation of et products and 2 to use these methods for the error characterization of five widely used global et datasets the information for inputs is provided in section 2 the methodology section describes the basic framework of collocation analysis and a more detailed description can be found in the appendix to validate collocation based results a site based comparison is described in section 4 five collocation methods were employed in our study error characterization results for each product over 0 1 8 day and 0 25 daily are presented in section 4 with additional attention given to some regions overall our results demonstrate that collocation based algorithms reveal promising potential for the evaluation of et datasets and may serve as a benchmark for data merging insights 2 data five widely used land et products were selected covering the period from 1980 to 2020 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the input datasets are shown in table 1 in addition in situ observations were employed for the evaluation of collocation methods 2 1 global land evapotranspiration products 1 era5 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf provides the era5 land global hourly reanalysis dataset at various resolutions covering the period 1981 to nearly the present era5 land was created by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis the atmospheric forcing data acted as an indirect influence by constraning the model based estimates hersbach et al 2020 actual evapotranspiration in the era5 land datasets is called total evaporation and is the sum of evaporation from bare soil evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans evaporation from the top of the canopy and evaporation from vegetation transpiration the dataset is freely available at the climate change service of the copernicus center http cds climate copernicus eu in this study the accumulated total evaporation was downloaded and aggregated from hourly to daily timesteps over 0 1 and 0 25 resolutions 2 gldasv2 1 noah the global land data assimilation system gldas product is a land surface simulation forced by a combination of model and observation datasets that incorporates advanced and sophisticated data assimilation methodologies rodell et al 2004 gldas runs multiple land surface models lsms including noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic and the community land model clm these combined models provide global estimations of evapotranspiration at both fine and coarse spatial 0 01 and 0 25 and temporal 3 hourly and monthly resolutions more detailed descriptions of the gldas products are available at nasa s hydrology data and information services center http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology in this study we employed the gldas 2 1 noah model over 0 25 resolution with 3 hourly frequency the 3 hourly data were then aggregated to daily timesteps to match the consistency with other products 3 pmlv2 the penman monteith leuning model version 2 global evaporation pmlv2 is based on the penman monteith leuning model zhang et al 2019 the pml model was first proposed by leuning et al 2008 and further improved by zhang et al 2010 pml version 1 pmlv1 is based on a biophysical model that considers canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation for the accurate estimation of surface conductance g s which is the focus of the pm based method it was further incorporated with a canopy conductance g c model that coupled vegetation transpiration with gross primary productivity resulting in pml version 2 pmlv2 gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 applied the pmlv2 model at the global scale the daily inputs include 1 leaf area index lai white sky shortwave albedo and emissivity from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and 2 temperature variables t max t min t avg instantaneous variables p surf p a u q and accumulated variables p rcp r ln r s from gldas evaporation is divided into direct evaporation from bare soil e s evaporation from solid water water body snow and ice e t water and vegetation transpiration e c the pmlv2 et is well calibrated against eddy covariance data from 95 global flux towers for ten land cover types kong et al 2020 pmlv2 products are standard features in the google earth engine gee and can be freely downloaded from gee https code earthengine google com asset projects pml evapotranspiration pml output pml v2 8day v014 in this study the data were interpolated to 0 1 using the matlab gaussian process regression package 4 fluxcom rs fluxcom is a machine learning based merging dataset of global land atmosphere energy fluxes which is a combination of remote sensing data and meteorological data jung et al 2019 fluxcom uses several machine learning based regression tools including tree based methods regression splines neural networks and kernel methods the outputs were designed following two complementary strategies 1 fluxcom rs merging exclusively remote sensing data to produce flux data with high spatial resolution and 2 fluxcom rs meteo merging meteorological observations with remote sensing data at daily temporal resolution the exclusive ensemble of rs data allows for generating 8 day flux products at 500 m resolution additionally the fluxcom rs data cover only the period after 2000 due to data availability the merging of meteorological data and remote sensing data extended the coverage since 1980 with the cost of a relatively coarse spatial resolution 0 5 more detailed descriptions of the fluxcom dataset are available on the fluxcom website http fluxcom org data are freely available by contacting the authors in this study we employed fluxcom rs energy flux data and converted the latent heat to evaporation using era5 land aggregated daily air temperature the conversion follows the equation 1 et le 30 60 2 501 0 002361 t 10 6 where et k g m 2 s 1 is evapotranspiration le w m 2 is the latent heat flux and t k is the air temperature furthermore the original evaporation data were interpolated to 0 1 using the matlab gaussian process regression package 5 gleam v3 3a in this study the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 3a gleam v3 3a dataset martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 at 0 25 is used this version of gleam provides daily estimations of actual evaporation e bare soil evaporation canopy interception transpiration from vegetation potential evaporation and snow sublimation for the period 1980 2018 the data are freely available on the gleam website https www gleam eu gleam is based on the priestley taylor framework priestley and taylor 1972 and employs reanalysis temperature and radiation to estimate potential et pet furthermore pet is reduced to actual et using remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation optical depth measurements the gleam data were validated at 43 fluxnet flux sites and have been proven to provide solid aet estimations majozi et al 2017 since both era5 land and gleamv3 3a employ ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis data they may be impacted by similar uncertainties however due to the indirect influence of atmospheric data used in era5 land we can still assume that these two products are independent 2 2 eddy covariance tower the fluxnet2015 tier 1 http fluxnet fluxdata org half hourly eddy covariance data of 82 flux sites are used in our study pastorello et al 2020 original hourly data are filtered following the process by li et al 2019 lin et al 2019 and original hourly data are selected first only the measured and good quality gap filled data are used for quality control second to reduce the impact of canopy interception knauer et al 2018 medlyn et al 2017 we excluded days with rainfall as well as one additional subsequent day after rainy events finally data records with negative gross primary production gpp vapor pressure deficit vpd and et were removed when the number of valid half hourly observations is higher than 38 approximately 80 per day the daily total et is calculated as 2 et i 1 n e i 48 n 3 e t i l e i 30 60 2 501 0 002361 t i 10 6 where n is the number of valid half hourly observations l e i is the half hourly observed latent heat flux and t i is the air temperature if the number of valid data is below 38 the daily value is set as a fill value additionally previous studies illustrated that fluxnet2015 data suffered from an energy balance closure problem thus following the method proposed by twine et al 2000 the measured et data are corrected the 82 flux sites are distributed globally and are mostly located in north america and europe as shown in fig 1 the international geosphere biosphere program igbp land cover classification system loveland et al 1999 is employed to distinguish the nine plant functional types pfts across sites including evergreen needleleaf forests enf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf deciduous broadleaf forests dbf croplands cro grasslands gra savannas sav woody savannas wsa closed shrublands csh and mixed forests mf the selected 82 flux towers cover the period from 2003 to 2017 and each has at least 3 years of reliable data information about the 82 eddy covariance sites is included in the appendix 3 methods 3 1 collocation analysis methods in collocation analysis independent products of a geophysical variable are typically assumed to be linearly related to the true signal mccoll et al 2016 stoffelen 1998 this linear model can be expressed as follows 4 x Œ≤ x p Œ± x Œµ x where x is the product p is the true signal Œ≤ x and Œ± x are the ordinary least squares intercept and slope respectively and Œµ x is the zero mean random error this model is referred to as the additive error structure model mccoll et al 2014 introduced the extended collocation algorithm and illustrated that the additive error model tends to overestimate the uncertainty which was further validated by li et al 2018 as an improvement a multiplicative error model is often used in practice with the equation described as follows 5 x a x p Œ≤ x e x following a log transformation x ln x Œ± x ln a x and Œµ x ln e x the basic assumptions adopted in collocation are as follows 1 error orthogonality assuming that the random error is independent of the true signal which can be expressed as c p Œµ p Œµ p Œµ 0 2 zero ecc requiring the independence of each two products which can be expressed as Œµ x Œµ y Œµ y Œµ z Œµ x Œµ z 0 and 3 the random error of each product is zero mean thus Œµ 0 based on these assumptions the covariances between two inputs are as follows 6 c ij c o v x i x j Œ≤ i Œ≤ j œÉ t 2 i j Œ≤ j 2 œÉ t 2 œÉ Œµ i 2 i j where œÉ t 2 v a r t taking the triple collocation method tc as an example the standard deviation of random error œÉ Œµ can be calculated as follows 7 œÉ Œµ x 2 c xx c xy c xz c yz œÉ Œµ y 2 c yy c xy c yz c xz œÉ Œµ z 2 c zz c xz c yz c xy the tc method requires a triplet of independent data sources gruber et al 2020 stoffelen 1998 the collocation analysis relies highly on the assumption that all datasets are mutually independent which means error cross correlation ecc is considered to be zero gruber et al 2020 as illustrated by yilmaz and crow 2014 the violation of the zero ecc assumption usually results in the underestimation of data errors however it is typically difficult to find three independent datasets in practice to address the problem su et al 2014 proposed the instrumental variable based approach by using a temporally lag 1 time series of one product as the third independent product which requires only double collocation and is referred to as the single instrumental variable algorithm or ivs dong et al 2019 achieved a more robust solution by introducing the lag 1 time series from both inputs and proposed the double instrumental variable algorithm or ivd gruber et al 2016 extended the original algorithm with arbitrary number of over three data sets and demonstrated the quadruple collocation i e qc with four data sets as an example in addition they partially addressed the independent assumption to calculate a part of eccs vogelzang and stoffelen 2021 to combine the benefits of both ivd and qc dong et al 2020c recently proposed the extended double instrumental eivd by which an ecc can be estimated using three datasets based on the number of inputs all the collocation based methods can be categorized as follows 1 dual inputs ivs ivd 2 triple inputs tc eivd and 3 quadruple inputs qc detailed descriptions of the five methods are included in the appendix 3 2 calculation combinations five collocation analysis methods were employed at 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day with pmlv2 and fluxcom resampled to 0 25 using kriging interpolation for dual input methods ivs required the selection of the product to derive the lag 1 series as the third input while ivd used the lag 1 variances in both products for triple input methods eivd required the identification of two products with nonzero error correlation covariance while tc assumed all three products were mutually independent for the quadruple input method the requirement of qc was the same as that of eivd since gleam uses meteorological data homologous to era5 the random errors of these two products do not satisfy the independence assumption the strong correlation between the two random errors would bring obvious deviations to the qc based results thus combinations involving these two ties are excluded from qc based analysis the number of total combination scenarios is listed in table 2 a detailed description of the combinations can be found in the appendix 3 3 design for method validation flux tower observation is the direct way to achieve the value of evapotranspiration which is commonly regarded as a reference for the assessments of products decker et al 2012 griebel et al 2020 due to the high cost for installation and maintenance of flux towers their distribution and data periods are scarce at the global scale thus to prove that collocation methods could be used as a reliable alternative when direct observations are not available we compared the collocation results against the results based on flux tower observations here our main goals were 1 to validate the reliability of the methods and 2 to compare the performance of the different methods as mentioned above direct observations from 82 fluxnet2015 tier 1 datasets were used after preprocessing the comparison results are presented in section 4 1 over three resolutions 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day two products were resampled from 0 1 to 0 25 using basic kriging interpolation including fluxcom and pmlv2 here we used three indices for comparison correlation of determination r 2 6 r 2 s i s r i r 2 s i s 2 r i r 2 root mean squared error rmse 7 rmse s i r i 2 n standard deviation sd 8 sd x i x 2 n where s is the evaluation results using collocation methods as simulation r refers to the results against flux tower observations as reference and n is the sample size 4 results and discussion in this section the results are presented in three steps 1 validation results of collocation methods 2 general comparisons of evaluation results over relative resolution and 3 analysis over regions with high discrepancies among products including the amazon basin and congo basin data for north africa sahara dessert and northwest china xinjiang and part of the tibetan plateau in the triple input method results were missing because fluxcom rs had no data in these areas which were excluded from the calculation here we show only the average evaluation result by evid further comparison of variance among different algorithms is covered in section 5 3 4 1 validation results of collocation methods fig 2 presents the comparison at 0 1 8 day for era5 the collocation analysis results fit well with the observation based results different methods showed similar performance with an average r 2 of 0 678 various combinations posed little impact on the outcomes however regarding the fluxcom and pmlv2 results tc and ivs uncertainties are higher than those of the other methods in particular the result of iv s 2 input fluxcom pmlv2 with fluxcom used for lag 1 variance was quite poor which was the same as pmlv2 this result may be due to the autocovariance error of fluxcom since the t 1 series was used for inner calibration during the calculation process in general over 0 1 8 day the comparison results illustrated that collocation methods could characterize the uncertainty of products in addition eivd and ivd outperformed tc and ivs with better fits over 0 25 eivd and ivd still showed better accuracy than ivs and tc fig 3 for all three products the assessments of collocation analysis methods were generally good except for the relatively poor performance of ivs the iv s 2 and iv s 4 combinations employed the lag 1 variance series from gleam and gldas respectively the results demonstrated that the error introduced by autocovariance may introduce inherent uncertainty to the ivs method this finding agreed with previous studies cammalleri et al 2017 khan et al 2018 in addition slight degradations of accuracy were found for all methods compared to the results over 0 1 resolution considering the increasing scaling uncertainties in the point scale observations collocation methods still performed well over 0 25 resolution fig 4 presents the comparisons over 0 25 8 day due to the high number of combinations we showed only the average value of each of the four combinations over this resolution the quadruple input qc was accessible in general all collocation results demonstrate a high fit of observation based results with average r 2 values of 0 761 era5 0 701 fluxcom 0 653 pmlv2 0 734 gleam and 0 758 gldas similar to the findings over the previous two resolutions eivd and ivd revealed better accuracy than ivs and tc the results using qc also expressed a high correlation which indicated the applicability of the qc method for the evaluation of evapotranspiration products gruber et al 2019 compared different collocation methods and illustrated that higher accuracy comes with more inputs in terms of the satisfaction of assumptions compared to the results over 0 25 daily the lower frequency seemed to have little impact on the performances of all methods in summary over 0 25 8 day eivd qc and tc were the three preferred and effectual methods for data evaluation table 3 presents the average value of r 2 for the five methods under all scenarios using the multiplicative error structure the results comparison demonstrated that the collocation framework was reliable for the evaluation of et products among the methods ivd eivd and qc were the three preferred methods for usage 4 2 global evaluation results fig 5 shows the evaluation results over 0 1 8 day overall the global performance of era5 is quite good with an average œÉ Œµ of 0 45 mm d followed by pmlv2 and fluxcom the accuracy of era5 is higher œÉ Œµ 1 50 mm d in areas with sufficient precipitation where evapotranspiration is also strong which supports the advantage of the era5 global land et product in capturing high values as revealed by previous studies martens et al 2020 pelosi and chirico 2021 however for the observations over arid and semiarid areas such as northwest china and the tibetan plateau the mean value of œÉ Œµ increases to 1 31 mm d with some parts over 2 10 mm d at 0 1 the degradation of accuracy over arid regions was also found for fluxcom and pmlv2 the performance of fluxcom was the poorest among the three products with a mean œÉ Œµ of 0 63 mm d especially over some temperate regions above 50 n where the distribution of ground based towers is scarce jung et al 2019 latent heat estimation by fluxcom is a machine learning based approach that may not perform well outside the range of training datasets although remote sensing observations have been employed as part of the training data the lack of sufficient long term field observations in northern temperate regions could still result in some biases granata and di nunno 2021 the uncertainty of pmlv2 increased in arid and semiarid regions with a global mean error of 0 78 mm d one possible reason for this phenomenon could be meteorological forcings the watch forcing data era5 interim wfdei and part of princeton global meteorological forcing pgf are used by pmlv2 as the key controlling factor of et in arid and semiarid regions yang et al 2021b the inherent bias in forcing precipitation datasets may be the main cause for the increasing uncertainty here fig 6 presents the results over 0 25 daily at the daily scale the mean values of œÉ Œµ were 1 44 1 83 and 1 24 mm d for era5 gldas and gleam respectively for era5 the bias was much larger than the former result at 0 1 one reason for the increasing uncertainty over coarser resolution may be the imperfect parameterization of complex land surface processes yang et al 2021a the land surface energy flux partitioning process in era5 is based on a changing ratio exported from the complex energy balance cycle over a higher resolution mainly 0 1 hersbach et al 2020 martens et al 2020 compared the performance of era5 and era1 and pointed out that although land surface models have advantages in projecting future changes their precision is limited over a larger scale due to an incomplete understanding of physical processes the uncertainty of gleam was generally lower than those of the other two products especially over arid and semiarid regions as a machine learning based dataset compared to fluxcom gleam explicitly accounts for the impact of soil moisture martens et al 2017 soil moisture is the dominant variable controlling soil evaporation and plant conductance under water stress medlyn et al 2017 the consideration of soil moisture could reduce the bias in et estimation gldas demonstrated the poorest general performance previous studies have already reported biases in gldas noah evaporation data including overestimations in iraq ramezani etedali and ahmadi 2021 underestimations of et changes in east asia khan et al 2018 and large biases in water balanced monthly et in china cui et al 2016 our results further validated the large uncertainty of gldas et estimation notably only the noah model was employed in our study further study could explore the comprehensive performance of other gldas models 4 3 regional investigation of product error due to the difference in algorithms discrepancies are commonly found among global et products ershadi et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 fig 7 fig 8 illustrate the large difference in the et change trend by different products the deviations were mainly located over high precipitation regions including south asia indonesia the caribbean coast the amazon plain and the congo river basin for example although era5 observed little variation over the amazon plain the estimation by pmlv2 revealed a significant increase in et the temperate decreasing trend in era5 and gleam is contrary to the obvious increase in gldas since these amazon plain and congo basin regions are of great concern to the science community we focused on the evaluation results over these areas and explored insights for further applications of different products the eivd based evaluation results over the amazon plain for different products are presented in fig 9 over 0 1 although the error of pmlv2 was generally slightly higher than era5 and fluxcom by 0 3 0 4 mm d the accumulation of errors may lead to larger deviations over a long period this finding was consistent with the opposite et trend revealed by era5 and pmlv2 over 0 25 gleam outperformed the others with a mean œÉ Œµ of approximately 0 88 mm d baker et al 2021 compared the spatial and seasonal variations among era5 gleam and other datasets by water balance analysis and found a high accuracy of gleam which may still be due to the assimilation of soil moisture martens et al 2017 here our results demonstrated the good performance of machine learning based products fluxcom and gleam which has also been covered in previous studies lu et al 2018 pan et al 2020a with sufficient long term field observations a suitable training dataset with good representativeness is available that could contribute to the accuracy of machine learning based algorithms the eivd based evaluation results over the congo river basin are shown in fig 10 the accuracy of fluxcom was the best followed by pmlv2 and gleam for gldas the bias in forcing temperature and radiation data could be a source of uncertainty ajjur and al ghamdi 2021 according to ensemble models temperature and radiation dominated et variations in northern eurasia southern china and the congo river basin burnett et al 2020 in addition the simulation process of canopy lai was highly simplified in the noah model which could also have resulted in a relatively large uncertainty since the vegetation dynamics are not well figs 11 14 reflected wang et al 2014 5 bias analysis 5 1 sources of method uncertainty as illustrated by our research and previous studies gruber et al 2020 khan et al 2018 yilmaz et al 2012 the possible uncertainties in collocation analysis results may come from three aspects 1 underestimation may be caused by the violation of the zero ecc assumption as mentioned in the methodology section this could be the main source for all collocation based evaluations to investigate the impact of nonzero ecc we present the ecc results from eivd and qc in the next section 2 random error may be introduced by changing combinations in terms of different combinations since all the collocation methods were used in our study each product was involved in several calculation scenarios mathematically this may result in random errors in the evaluation results previous studies have investigated this question and found that the variance over different combinations was much smaller than the calculated error li et al 2018 yilmaz and crow 2014 therefore we showed only the average value of error for each product 3 systematic error may be due to the selection of algorithms to explore this impact evaluation results for separate products based on different methods were compared in section 6 3 in addition the results of the same algorithm over different resolutions were presented 5 2 impact of error cross correlations here we present the results of ecc from eivd and qc at 0 1 the global error correlations of era5 fluxcom and era5 pmlv2 were quite low with a mean ecc value of 0 2 the error of era5 was positively correlated with that of fluxcom over north asia and the correlation of era5 pmlv2 was also found in south africa and australia for fluxcom and pmlv2 the errors were negatively correlated over north america at 0 25 resolution the input combination was era5 gldas gleam a high error correlation of era5 gleam was observed globally with a mean ecc value of 0 55 since the reanalysis meteorological information from era5 was used for both products hersbach et al 2020 martens et al 2017 it was predictable to find the error correlation at 0 25 we compared the ecc results from eivd and qc there was a general consistency between the qc and eivd estimated error correlation values however a large difference was found among the ecc results of gleam fluxcom with global mean differences of 6 91 although the quadruple input method can estimate the ecc information within the linear system the requirement of three independent products was more challenging than the triple input methods which may have resulted in larger uncertainties caused by the violation of the zero ecc assumption in addition a relatively high correlation of gleam fluxcom was observed which may explain the variation in œÉ Œµ our results demonstrated that the zero ecc assumption was likely violated over regions with nonzero ecc values mathematically when applying one triple combination a b c for example in eivd a negative ecc value of b c means that a is preferred as the better data compared to the others which may lead to the underestimation of errors dong et al 2019 gruber et al 2020 su et al 2014 at the same time it should be noted that the overall ecc value was quite small and the assumption could be considered valid over most regions thus this finding should not have a dramatic impact on the results the ecc information obtained through qc and eivd could be useful during optimal merging especially over regions where errors were found to be strongly correlated 5 3 difference by various algorithms here we present the evaluation results for era5 using different algorithms since the qc method required four independent inputs it was available only over 0 25 8 day for the results of era5 over the same resolution evaluations by different methods were spatially consistent especially for the results generated by algorithms with the same number of inputs the error estimated by the dual input algorithms ivs ivd was slightly higher than that of the triple input methods tc eivd for example ivs based patterns over 0 25 were higher than others in high latitude areas such as north america and north asia this kind of bias has been observed in previous studies dong and crow 2018 su et al 2014 and may cause the overestimation of product error kim et al 2020 the same situation was observed over the comparison at 0 25 as an improvement of ivs the ivd method employed lag 1 variances from both products that had been mathematically shown to effectively reduce the error by autocovariance dong et al 2019 in addition between the triple input methods the results from tc were smaller than those from eivd previous researchers have found that this may lead to an underestimation of error given that the impact of nonzero error cross correlation was not considered in tc gruber et al 2020 yilmaz and crow 2014 moreover comparing evaluations over two resolutions showed that the results demonstrated better performance of era5 at a coarser scale which was consistent with the assessments of era5 in previous studies jung et al 2020 ma et al 2020 in general our comparison results demonstrated that evaluations by different collocation methods shared a generally consistent spatial distribution with slight variation the possible systematic error introduced by the selection of algorithms could be considered to have little impact on our results 6 conclusion in this study we conducted a comprehensive validation and application of five collocation methods including ivs ivd tc qc and eivd the collocation based results were validated in comparison to evaluations based on flux tower observations furthermore all methods were employed for the error characterization of five widely used global et products over various resolutions in terms of error variance and ecc with additional comparisons over some regions in summary our conclusions are described as follows 1 the collocation analysis methods are effective in evaluating evapotranspiration products the comparisons between collocation based results and site based evaluations demonstrate high correlation and consistency with average r 2 values of 0 640 0 533 and 0 608 over 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day respectively among these methods ivd and eivd are the two preferred algorithms for dual input and triple input collocation analysis with relatively high accuracy for the dual input condition qc is a reliable choice 2 the performances of nearly all methods slightly degrade over coarser spatial resolution 0 1 to 0 25 while the lower frequency daily to 8 day seems to have little impact on our result since performances are based on comparisons against in situ observations the increasing scaling uncertainty of point scale data should also be considered which may contribute to the decreasing performance of collocation methods for regional analysis collocation could be a better selection than ground based evaluation since it calculates the variance based on only the statistical relationship between collocations 3 the evaluation results of global et products reveal generally good performance of era5 with average errors of 0 45 and 1 44 mm d over 0 1 8 day and 0 25 daily respectively among all products era5 and gleam outperform the others with relatively low uncertainties over 0 1 pmlv2 is detected with slightly higher biases over east america and northwest china over 0 25 the uncertainty of gldas is generally higher than era5 and gleam especially over south asia and east america for some regions around the equators in addition there is an obvious increase in uncertainty over arid regions compared with humid regions for all products future studies may consider the improvement of et estimation over drier areas 4 due to the large discrepancies among different products special attention is given to the evaluation results over the amazon plain and congo basin machine learning based products including fluxcom and gleam are revealed to have generally high accuracy with large biases found in gldas the availability of a well represented training dataset could reduce uncertainty for machine learning algorithms and the imperfect parameterization of land processes could result in large bias for model based estimation our study is the first to conduct a comprehensive validation and application of collocation methods for the evaluation of global et products the findings illustrate the promising future for collocation methods to serve as a reliable error characterization tool for et datasets the error evaluation results of five widely used et products show that the uncertainties may be induced by the parametrization of model processes meteorological forcings or the lack of benchmarks model development and

3227,evapotranspiration et is one of the key elements linking earth s water carbon system accurate estimation of global land evapotranspiration is essential for understanding land atmosphere interactions under a changing climate however due to a lack of observations at the global scale inherent uncertainties limit the direct use of these data in this study we employed collocation analysis methods including single and double instrumental variable algorithms ivs ivd triple collocation tc quadruple collocation qc and extended double instrumental variable algorithms eivd to evaluate five widely used et products at 0 1 and 0 25 resolutions over daily and 8 day frequencies to validate the reliability of collocation methods the collocation analysis results were compared with evaluations based on in situ observations the results exhibited reasonably high accuracy with an average correlation of determination r 2 of 0 71 for all methods in addition ivd eivd and qc demonstrated better performances than other methods in general the era5 and gleam products showed lower uncertainty than the other products over 0 1 and 0 25 respectively although the error resulting from nonzero error cross correlation ecc should be considered the ecc results from eivd and qc revealed that this influence was acceptable in our study overall this study presented a comprehensive application and comparison of all collocation analysis methods for error characterization of et products the findings suggested that collocation analysis methods could be reliable tools to serve as alternatives for tower observations at the global scale which could be helpful for further data assimilation and merging keywords land evapotranspiration data evaluation collocation analysis 1 introduction land evapotranspiration et including transpiration soil evaporation and evaporation from canopy interception is the key component of the global terrestrial water and energy cycle jung et al 2010 lian et al 2018 it plays a central role in linking the energy water and carbon cycles migliavacca et al 2021 thus in a changing global environment accurate estimation of global land evapotranspiration is critical for understanding the hydrological cycle and land atmosphere interaction which is a prerequisite for water resource management and drought predictions gentine et al 2019 khan et al 2018 miralles et al 2019 wang et al 2012 conventional in situ techniques such as weighing lysimeters bowen ratios and eddy covariance systems are reliable for providing et measurements at point and local scales pastorello et al 2020 however such solutions are not proper for a global estimation due to its sparse coverage and questionable scaling issues to portray the spatial heterogeneity of et pokhrel et al 2021 tang and li 2017 continuous efforts have been made in past decades to produce multiyear global terrestrial et including combining conventional methods with remote sensing based models li et al 2019 miralles et al 2011 complex land surface models hersbach et al 2020 rodell et al 2004 and machine learning based attempts chen et al 2020 hossein kazemi et al 2020 jung et al 2019 among these products large discrepancies in quantifying the magnitude of global et are commonly found for example the global mean annual et from 1980 to 2012 estimated by different products ranged from approximately 400 to 700 mm yr 1 as illustrated in previous studies maes et al 2019 pan et al 2020a short gianotti et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 these uncertainties may originate from a lack of sufficient validation measurements bias in forcing input inconsistent spatial and temporal resolutions or imperfect calibration of model parameters cheng et al 2021 fuentes et al 2020 thus information on biases in various global et datasets is a prerequisite for diverse applications or further merging recently two types of accuracy investigations for et datasets have been proposed the first approach employs direct information from in situ observations or defines the average value of inputs as a more reliable true representation to compare the similarities and differences among inputs which are usually frequently used for calibration and validation purposes jim√©nez et al 2011 majozi et al 2017 pan et al 2020b sun et al 2020 another type which is based on the water balance equation focuses on comparing performances over a basin or a specific region such as the amazon plain or congo basin baker et al 2021 green et al 2021 liu et al 2016 restrepo coupe et al 2021 both types rely on the proper selection of a reference to compare the datasets in terms of correlation bias and root mean square error however for a geophysical variable with high spatial variability both et and high quality reference datasets are difficult to find especially over data scarce regions to address this limitation collocation analysis methods have emerged as promising techniques to estimate the random error standard deviation and data truth correlations for collocated datasets on a grid cell by grid cell basis for the entire globe dong et al 2020c gruber et al 2020 mccoll et al 2016 stoffelen 1998 these methods regard the errors associated with collocated datasets as a true representation of uncertainty without assuming that any of the datasets are free of errors mccoll et al 2014 the main advantage of collocation analysis is that no high quality reference dataset is required su et al 2014 wu et al 2021 an important prerequisite for applying collocation methods is the availability of many spatially and temporally corresponding datasets for each grid the input data are a combination of long term simulation or observation series from each collocated dataset the output is the standard deviation of the product random errors on each grid recently collocation analysis methods have been widely applied in the evaluation of estimates of geophysical variables including soil moisture chen et al 2018 dong et al 2020a precipitation dong et al 2020b li et al 2018 ocean wind speed ribal and young 2020 leaf area index jiang et al 2017 total water storage baik et al 2021 sea ice thickness and surface salinity hoareau et al 2018 and near surface air temperature sun et al 2021 although continuous adjustments have been addressed to improve the performance of collocation methods only a few studies have considered methods for analyzing et products khan et al 2018 therefore the main objectives of our study are described as follows 1 to investigate the reliability of collocation methods for the evaluation of et products and 2 to use these methods for the error characterization of five widely used global et datasets the information for inputs is provided in section 2 the methodology section describes the basic framework of collocation analysis and a more detailed description can be found in the appendix to validate collocation based results a site based comparison is described in section 4 five collocation methods were employed in our study error characterization results for each product over 0 1 8 day and 0 25 daily are presented in section 4 with additional attention given to some regions overall our results demonstrate that collocation based algorithms reveal promising potential for the evaluation of et datasets and may serve as a benchmark for data merging insights 2 data five widely used land et products were selected covering the period from 1980 to 2020 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the input datasets are shown in table 1 in addition in situ observations were employed for the evaluation of collocation methods 2 1 global land evapotranspiration products 1 era5 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf provides the era5 land global hourly reanalysis dataset at various resolutions covering the period 1981 to nearly the present era5 land was created by replaying the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis the atmospheric forcing data acted as an indirect influence by constraning the model based estimates hersbach et al 2020 actual evapotranspiration in the era5 land datasets is called total evaporation and is the sum of evaporation from bare soil evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans evaporation from the top of the canopy and evaporation from vegetation transpiration the dataset is freely available at the climate change service of the copernicus center http cds climate copernicus eu in this study the accumulated total evaporation was downloaded and aggregated from hourly to daily timesteps over 0 1 and 0 25 resolutions 2 gldasv2 1 noah the global land data assimilation system gldas product is a land surface simulation forced by a combination of model and observation datasets that incorporates advanced and sophisticated data assimilation methodologies rodell et al 2004 gldas runs multiple land surface models lsms including noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic and the community land model clm these combined models provide global estimations of evapotranspiration at both fine and coarse spatial 0 01 and 0 25 and temporal 3 hourly and monthly resolutions more detailed descriptions of the gldas products are available at nasa s hydrology data and information services center http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology in this study we employed the gldas 2 1 noah model over 0 25 resolution with 3 hourly frequency the 3 hourly data were then aggregated to daily timesteps to match the consistency with other products 3 pmlv2 the penman monteith leuning model version 2 global evaporation pmlv2 is based on the penman monteith leuning model zhang et al 2019 the pml model was first proposed by leuning et al 2008 and further improved by zhang et al 2010 pml version 1 pmlv1 is based on a biophysical model that considers canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation for the accurate estimation of surface conductance g s which is the focus of the pm based method it was further incorporated with a canopy conductance g c model that coupled vegetation transpiration with gross primary productivity resulting in pml version 2 pmlv2 gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 applied the pmlv2 model at the global scale the daily inputs include 1 leaf area index lai white sky shortwave albedo and emissivity from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and 2 temperature variables t max t min t avg instantaneous variables p surf p a u q and accumulated variables p rcp r ln r s from gldas evaporation is divided into direct evaporation from bare soil e s evaporation from solid water water body snow and ice e t water and vegetation transpiration e c the pmlv2 et is well calibrated against eddy covariance data from 95 global flux towers for ten land cover types kong et al 2020 pmlv2 products are standard features in the google earth engine gee and can be freely downloaded from gee https code earthengine google com asset projects pml evapotranspiration pml output pml v2 8day v014 in this study the data were interpolated to 0 1 using the matlab gaussian process regression package 4 fluxcom rs fluxcom is a machine learning based merging dataset of global land atmosphere energy fluxes which is a combination of remote sensing data and meteorological data jung et al 2019 fluxcom uses several machine learning based regression tools including tree based methods regression splines neural networks and kernel methods the outputs were designed following two complementary strategies 1 fluxcom rs merging exclusively remote sensing data to produce flux data with high spatial resolution and 2 fluxcom rs meteo merging meteorological observations with remote sensing data at daily temporal resolution the exclusive ensemble of rs data allows for generating 8 day flux products at 500 m resolution additionally the fluxcom rs data cover only the period after 2000 due to data availability the merging of meteorological data and remote sensing data extended the coverage since 1980 with the cost of a relatively coarse spatial resolution 0 5 more detailed descriptions of the fluxcom dataset are available on the fluxcom website http fluxcom org data are freely available by contacting the authors in this study we employed fluxcom rs energy flux data and converted the latent heat to evaporation using era5 land aggregated daily air temperature the conversion follows the equation 1 et le 30 60 2 501 0 002361 t 10 6 where et k g m 2 s 1 is evapotranspiration le w m 2 is the latent heat flux and t k is the air temperature furthermore the original evaporation data were interpolated to 0 1 using the matlab gaussian process regression package 5 gleam v3 3a in this study the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3 3a gleam v3 3a dataset martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 at 0 25 is used this version of gleam provides daily estimations of actual evaporation e bare soil evaporation canopy interception transpiration from vegetation potential evaporation and snow sublimation for the period 1980 2018 the data are freely available on the gleam website https www gleam eu gleam is based on the priestley taylor framework priestley and taylor 1972 and employs reanalysis temperature and radiation to estimate potential et pet furthermore pet is reduced to actual et using remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation optical depth measurements the gleam data were validated at 43 fluxnet flux sites and have been proven to provide solid aet estimations majozi et al 2017 since both era5 land and gleamv3 3a employ ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis data they may be impacted by similar uncertainties however due to the indirect influence of atmospheric data used in era5 land we can still assume that these two products are independent 2 2 eddy covariance tower the fluxnet2015 tier 1 http fluxnet fluxdata org half hourly eddy covariance data of 82 flux sites are used in our study pastorello et al 2020 original hourly data are filtered following the process by li et al 2019 lin et al 2019 and original hourly data are selected first only the measured and good quality gap filled data are used for quality control second to reduce the impact of canopy interception knauer et al 2018 medlyn et al 2017 we excluded days with rainfall as well as one additional subsequent day after rainy events finally data records with negative gross primary production gpp vapor pressure deficit vpd and et were removed when the number of valid half hourly observations is higher than 38 approximately 80 per day the daily total et is calculated as 2 et i 1 n e i 48 n 3 e t i l e i 30 60 2 501 0 002361 t i 10 6 where n is the number of valid half hourly observations l e i is the half hourly observed latent heat flux and t i is the air temperature if the number of valid data is below 38 the daily value is set as a fill value additionally previous studies illustrated that fluxnet2015 data suffered from an energy balance closure problem thus following the method proposed by twine et al 2000 the measured et data are corrected the 82 flux sites are distributed globally and are mostly located in north america and europe as shown in fig 1 the international geosphere biosphere program igbp land cover classification system loveland et al 1999 is employed to distinguish the nine plant functional types pfts across sites including evergreen needleleaf forests enf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf deciduous broadleaf forests dbf croplands cro grasslands gra savannas sav woody savannas wsa closed shrublands csh and mixed forests mf the selected 82 flux towers cover the period from 2003 to 2017 and each has at least 3 years of reliable data information about the 82 eddy covariance sites is included in the appendix 3 methods 3 1 collocation analysis methods in collocation analysis independent products of a geophysical variable are typically assumed to be linearly related to the true signal mccoll et al 2016 stoffelen 1998 this linear model can be expressed as follows 4 x Œ≤ x p Œ± x Œµ x where x is the product p is the true signal Œ≤ x and Œ± x are the ordinary least squares intercept and slope respectively and Œµ x is the zero mean random error this model is referred to as the additive error structure model mccoll et al 2014 introduced the extended collocation algorithm and illustrated that the additive error model tends to overestimate the uncertainty which was further validated by li et al 2018 as an improvement a multiplicative error model is often used in practice with the equation described as follows 5 x a x p Œ≤ x e x following a log transformation x ln x Œ± x ln a x and Œµ x ln e x the basic assumptions adopted in collocation are as follows 1 error orthogonality assuming that the random error is independent of the true signal which can be expressed as c p Œµ p Œµ p Œµ 0 2 zero ecc requiring the independence of each two products which can be expressed as Œµ x Œµ y Œµ y Œµ z Œµ x Œµ z 0 and 3 the random error of each product is zero mean thus Œµ 0 based on these assumptions the covariances between two inputs are as follows 6 c ij c o v x i x j Œ≤ i Œ≤ j œÉ t 2 i j Œ≤ j 2 œÉ t 2 œÉ Œµ i 2 i j where œÉ t 2 v a r t taking the triple collocation method tc as an example the standard deviation of random error œÉ Œµ can be calculated as follows 7 œÉ Œµ x 2 c xx c xy c xz c yz œÉ Œµ y 2 c yy c xy c yz c xz œÉ Œµ z 2 c zz c xz c yz c xy the tc method requires a triplet of independent data sources gruber et al 2020 stoffelen 1998 the collocation analysis relies highly on the assumption that all datasets are mutually independent which means error cross correlation ecc is considered to be zero gruber et al 2020 as illustrated by yilmaz and crow 2014 the violation of the zero ecc assumption usually results in the underestimation of data errors however it is typically difficult to find three independent datasets in practice to address the problem su et al 2014 proposed the instrumental variable based approach by using a temporally lag 1 time series of one product as the third independent product which requires only double collocation and is referred to as the single instrumental variable algorithm or ivs dong et al 2019 achieved a more robust solution by introducing the lag 1 time series from both inputs and proposed the double instrumental variable algorithm or ivd gruber et al 2016 extended the original algorithm with arbitrary number of over three data sets and demonstrated the quadruple collocation i e qc with four data sets as an example in addition they partially addressed the independent assumption to calculate a part of eccs vogelzang and stoffelen 2021 to combine the benefits of both ivd and qc dong et al 2020c recently proposed the extended double instrumental eivd by which an ecc can be estimated using three datasets based on the number of inputs all the collocation based methods can be categorized as follows 1 dual inputs ivs ivd 2 triple inputs tc eivd and 3 quadruple inputs qc detailed descriptions of the five methods are included in the appendix 3 2 calculation combinations five collocation analysis methods were employed at 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day with pmlv2 and fluxcom resampled to 0 25 using kriging interpolation for dual input methods ivs required the selection of the product to derive the lag 1 series as the third input while ivd used the lag 1 variances in both products for triple input methods eivd required the identification of two products with nonzero error correlation covariance while tc assumed all three products were mutually independent for the quadruple input method the requirement of qc was the same as that of eivd since gleam uses meteorological data homologous to era5 the random errors of these two products do not satisfy the independence assumption the strong correlation between the two random errors would bring obvious deviations to the qc based results thus combinations involving these two ties are excluded from qc based analysis the number of total combination scenarios is listed in table 2 a detailed description of the combinations can be found in the appendix 3 3 design for method validation flux tower observation is the direct way to achieve the value of evapotranspiration which is commonly regarded as a reference for the assessments of products decker et al 2012 griebel et al 2020 due to the high cost for installation and maintenance of flux towers their distribution and data periods are scarce at the global scale thus to prove that collocation methods could be used as a reliable alternative when direct observations are not available we compared the collocation results against the results based on flux tower observations here our main goals were 1 to validate the reliability of the methods and 2 to compare the performance of the different methods as mentioned above direct observations from 82 fluxnet2015 tier 1 datasets were used after preprocessing the comparison results are presented in section 4 1 over three resolutions 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day two products were resampled from 0 1 to 0 25 using basic kriging interpolation including fluxcom and pmlv2 here we used three indices for comparison correlation of determination r 2 6 r 2 s i s r i r 2 s i s 2 r i r 2 root mean squared error rmse 7 rmse s i r i 2 n standard deviation sd 8 sd x i x 2 n where s is the evaluation results using collocation methods as simulation r refers to the results against flux tower observations as reference and n is the sample size 4 results and discussion in this section the results are presented in three steps 1 validation results of collocation methods 2 general comparisons of evaluation results over relative resolution and 3 analysis over regions with high discrepancies among products including the amazon basin and congo basin data for north africa sahara dessert and northwest china xinjiang and part of the tibetan plateau in the triple input method results were missing because fluxcom rs had no data in these areas which were excluded from the calculation here we show only the average evaluation result by evid further comparison of variance among different algorithms is covered in section 5 3 4 1 validation results of collocation methods fig 2 presents the comparison at 0 1 8 day for era5 the collocation analysis results fit well with the observation based results different methods showed similar performance with an average r 2 of 0 678 various combinations posed little impact on the outcomes however regarding the fluxcom and pmlv2 results tc and ivs uncertainties are higher than those of the other methods in particular the result of iv s 2 input fluxcom pmlv2 with fluxcom used for lag 1 variance was quite poor which was the same as pmlv2 this result may be due to the autocovariance error of fluxcom since the t 1 series was used for inner calibration during the calculation process in general over 0 1 8 day the comparison results illustrated that collocation methods could characterize the uncertainty of products in addition eivd and ivd outperformed tc and ivs with better fits over 0 25 eivd and ivd still showed better accuracy than ivs and tc fig 3 for all three products the assessments of collocation analysis methods were generally good except for the relatively poor performance of ivs the iv s 2 and iv s 4 combinations employed the lag 1 variance series from gleam and gldas respectively the results demonstrated that the error introduced by autocovariance may introduce inherent uncertainty to the ivs method this finding agreed with previous studies cammalleri et al 2017 khan et al 2018 in addition slight degradations of accuracy were found for all methods compared to the results over 0 1 resolution considering the increasing scaling uncertainties in the point scale observations collocation methods still performed well over 0 25 resolution fig 4 presents the comparisons over 0 25 8 day due to the high number of combinations we showed only the average value of each of the four combinations over this resolution the quadruple input qc was accessible in general all collocation results demonstrate a high fit of observation based results with average r 2 values of 0 761 era5 0 701 fluxcom 0 653 pmlv2 0 734 gleam and 0 758 gldas similar to the findings over the previous two resolutions eivd and ivd revealed better accuracy than ivs and tc the results using qc also expressed a high correlation which indicated the applicability of the qc method for the evaluation of evapotranspiration products gruber et al 2019 compared different collocation methods and illustrated that higher accuracy comes with more inputs in terms of the satisfaction of assumptions compared to the results over 0 25 daily the lower frequency seemed to have little impact on the performances of all methods in summary over 0 25 8 day eivd qc and tc were the three preferred and effectual methods for data evaluation table 3 presents the average value of r 2 for the five methods under all scenarios using the multiplicative error structure the results comparison demonstrated that the collocation framework was reliable for the evaluation of et products among the methods ivd eivd and qc were the three preferred methods for usage 4 2 global evaluation results fig 5 shows the evaluation results over 0 1 8 day overall the global performance of era5 is quite good with an average œÉ Œµ of 0 45 mm d followed by pmlv2 and fluxcom the accuracy of era5 is higher œÉ Œµ 1 50 mm d in areas with sufficient precipitation where evapotranspiration is also strong which supports the advantage of the era5 global land et product in capturing high values as revealed by previous studies martens et al 2020 pelosi and chirico 2021 however for the observations over arid and semiarid areas such as northwest china and the tibetan plateau the mean value of œÉ Œµ increases to 1 31 mm d with some parts over 2 10 mm d at 0 1 the degradation of accuracy over arid regions was also found for fluxcom and pmlv2 the performance of fluxcom was the poorest among the three products with a mean œÉ Œµ of 0 63 mm d especially over some temperate regions above 50 n where the distribution of ground based towers is scarce jung et al 2019 latent heat estimation by fluxcom is a machine learning based approach that may not perform well outside the range of training datasets although remote sensing observations have been employed as part of the training data the lack of sufficient long term field observations in northern temperate regions could still result in some biases granata and di nunno 2021 the uncertainty of pmlv2 increased in arid and semiarid regions with a global mean error of 0 78 mm d one possible reason for this phenomenon could be meteorological forcings the watch forcing data era5 interim wfdei and part of princeton global meteorological forcing pgf are used by pmlv2 as the key controlling factor of et in arid and semiarid regions yang et al 2021b the inherent bias in forcing precipitation datasets may be the main cause for the increasing uncertainty here fig 6 presents the results over 0 25 daily at the daily scale the mean values of œÉ Œµ were 1 44 1 83 and 1 24 mm d for era5 gldas and gleam respectively for era5 the bias was much larger than the former result at 0 1 one reason for the increasing uncertainty over coarser resolution may be the imperfect parameterization of complex land surface processes yang et al 2021a the land surface energy flux partitioning process in era5 is based on a changing ratio exported from the complex energy balance cycle over a higher resolution mainly 0 1 hersbach et al 2020 martens et al 2020 compared the performance of era5 and era1 and pointed out that although land surface models have advantages in projecting future changes their precision is limited over a larger scale due to an incomplete understanding of physical processes the uncertainty of gleam was generally lower than those of the other two products especially over arid and semiarid regions as a machine learning based dataset compared to fluxcom gleam explicitly accounts for the impact of soil moisture martens et al 2017 soil moisture is the dominant variable controlling soil evaporation and plant conductance under water stress medlyn et al 2017 the consideration of soil moisture could reduce the bias in et estimation gldas demonstrated the poorest general performance previous studies have already reported biases in gldas noah evaporation data including overestimations in iraq ramezani etedali and ahmadi 2021 underestimations of et changes in east asia khan et al 2018 and large biases in water balanced monthly et in china cui et al 2016 our results further validated the large uncertainty of gldas et estimation notably only the noah model was employed in our study further study could explore the comprehensive performance of other gldas models 4 3 regional investigation of product error due to the difference in algorithms discrepancies are commonly found among global et products ershadi et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 fig 7 fig 8 illustrate the large difference in the et change trend by different products the deviations were mainly located over high precipitation regions including south asia indonesia the caribbean coast the amazon plain and the congo river basin for example although era5 observed little variation over the amazon plain the estimation by pmlv2 revealed a significant increase in et the temperate decreasing trend in era5 and gleam is contrary to the obvious increase in gldas since these amazon plain and congo basin regions are of great concern to the science community we focused on the evaluation results over these areas and explored insights for further applications of different products the eivd based evaluation results over the amazon plain for different products are presented in fig 9 over 0 1 although the error of pmlv2 was generally slightly higher than era5 and fluxcom by 0 3 0 4 mm d the accumulation of errors may lead to larger deviations over a long period this finding was consistent with the opposite et trend revealed by era5 and pmlv2 over 0 25 gleam outperformed the others with a mean œÉ Œµ of approximately 0 88 mm d baker et al 2021 compared the spatial and seasonal variations among era5 gleam and other datasets by water balance analysis and found a high accuracy of gleam which may still be due to the assimilation of soil moisture martens et al 2017 here our results demonstrated the good performance of machine learning based products fluxcom and gleam which has also been covered in previous studies lu et al 2018 pan et al 2020a with sufficient long term field observations a suitable training dataset with good representativeness is available that could contribute to the accuracy of machine learning based algorithms the eivd based evaluation results over the congo river basin are shown in fig 10 the accuracy of fluxcom was the best followed by pmlv2 and gleam for gldas the bias in forcing temperature and radiation data could be a source of uncertainty ajjur and al ghamdi 2021 according to ensemble models temperature and radiation dominated et variations in northern eurasia southern china and the congo river basin burnett et al 2020 in addition the simulation process of canopy lai was highly simplified in the noah model which could also have resulted in a relatively large uncertainty since the vegetation dynamics are not well figs 11 14 reflected wang et al 2014 5 bias analysis 5 1 sources of method uncertainty as illustrated by our research and previous studies gruber et al 2020 khan et al 2018 yilmaz et al 2012 the possible uncertainties in collocation analysis results may come from three aspects 1 underestimation may be caused by the violation of the zero ecc assumption as mentioned in the methodology section this could be the main source for all collocation based evaluations to investigate the impact of nonzero ecc we present the ecc results from eivd and qc in the next section 2 random error may be introduced by changing combinations in terms of different combinations since all the collocation methods were used in our study each product was involved in several calculation scenarios mathematically this may result in random errors in the evaluation results previous studies have investigated this question and found that the variance over different combinations was much smaller than the calculated error li et al 2018 yilmaz and crow 2014 therefore we showed only the average value of error for each product 3 systematic error may be due to the selection of algorithms to explore this impact evaluation results for separate products based on different methods were compared in section 6 3 in addition the results of the same algorithm over different resolutions were presented 5 2 impact of error cross correlations here we present the results of ecc from eivd and qc at 0 1 the global error correlations of era5 fluxcom and era5 pmlv2 were quite low with a mean ecc value of 0 2 the error of era5 was positively correlated with that of fluxcom over north asia and the correlation of era5 pmlv2 was also found in south africa and australia for fluxcom and pmlv2 the errors were negatively correlated over north america at 0 25 resolution the input combination was era5 gldas gleam a high error correlation of era5 gleam was observed globally with a mean ecc value of 0 55 since the reanalysis meteorological information from era5 was used for both products hersbach et al 2020 martens et al 2017 it was predictable to find the error correlation at 0 25 we compared the ecc results from eivd and qc there was a general consistency between the qc and eivd estimated error correlation values however a large difference was found among the ecc results of gleam fluxcom with global mean differences of 6 91 although the quadruple input method can estimate the ecc information within the linear system the requirement of three independent products was more challenging than the triple input methods which may have resulted in larger uncertainties caused by the violation of the zero ecc assumption in addition a relatively high correlation of gleam fluxcom was observed which may explain the variation in œÉ Œµ our results demonstrated that the zero ecc assumption was likely violated over regions with nonzero ecc values mathematically when applying one triple combination a b c for example in eivd a negative ecc value of b c means that a is preferred as the better data compared to the others which may lead to the underestimation of errors dong et al 2019 gruber et al 2020 su et al 2014 at the same time it should be noted that the overall ecc value was quite small and the assumption could be considered valid over most regions thus this finding should not have a dramatic impact on the results the ecc information obtained through qc and eivd could be useful during optimal merging especially over regions where errors were found to be strongly correlated 5 3 difference by various algorithms here we present the evaluation results for era5 using different algorithms since the qc method required four independent inputs it was available only over 0 25 8 day for the results of era5 over the same resolution evaluations by different methods were spatially consistent especially for the results generated by algorithms with the same number of inputs the error estimated by the dual input algorithms ivs ivd was slightly higher than that of the triple input methods tc eivd for example ivs based patterns over 0 25 were higher than others in high latitude areas such as north america and north asia this kind of bias has been observed in previous studies dong and crow 2018 su et al 2014 and may cause the overestimation of product error kim et al 2020 the same situation was observed over the comparison at 0 25 as an improvement of ivs the ivd method employed lag 1 variances from both products that had been mathematically shown to effectively reduce the error by autocovariance dong et al 2019 in addition between the triple input methods the results from tc were smaller than those from eivd previous researchers have found that this may lead to an underestimation of error given that the impact of nonzero error cross correlation was not considered in tc gruber et al 2020 yilmaz and crow 2014 moreover comparing evaluations over two resolutions showed that the results demonstrated better performance of era5 at a coarser scale which was consistent with the assessments of era5 in previous studies jung et al 2020 ma et al 2020 in general our comparison results demonstrated that evaluations by different collocation methods shared a generally consistent spatial distribution with slight variation the possible systematic error introduced by the selection of algorithms could be considered to have little impact on our results 6 conclusion in this study we conducted a comprehensive validation and application of five collocation methods including ivs ivd tc qc and eivd the collocation based results were validated in comparison to evaluations based on flux tower observations furthermore all methods were employed for the error characterization of five widely used global et products over various resolutions in terms of error variance and ecc with additional comparisons over some regions in summary our conclusions are described as follows 1 the collocation analysis methods are effective in evaluating evapotranspiration products the comparisons between collocation based results and site based evaluations demonstrate high correlation and consistency with average r 2 values of 0 640 0 533 and 0 608 over 0 1 8 day 0 25 daily and 0 25 8 day respectively among these methods ivd and eivd are the two preferred algorithms for dual input and triple input collocation analysis with relatively high accuracy for the dual input condition qc is a reliable choice 2 the performances of nearly all methods slightly degrade over coarser spatial resolution 0 1 to 0 25 while the lower frequency daily to 8 day seems to have little impact on our result since performances are based on comparisons against in situ observations the increasing scaling uncertainty of point scale data should also be considered which may contribute to the decreasing performance of collocation methods for regional analysis collocation could be a better selection than ground based evaluation since it calculates the variance based on only the statistical relationship between collocations 3 the evaluation results of global et products reveal generally good performance of era5 with average errors of 0 45 and 1 44 mm d over 0 1 8 day and 0 25 daily respectively among all products era5 and gleam outperform the others with relatively low uncertainties over 0 1 pmlv2 is detected with slightly higher biases over east america and northwest china over 0 25 the uncertainty of gldas is generally higher than era5 and gleam especially over south asia and east america for some regions around the equators in addition there is an obvious increase in uncertainty over arid regions compared with humid regions for all products future studies may consider the improvement of et estimation over drier areas 4 due to the large discrepancies among different products special attention is given to the evaluation results over the amazon plain and congo basin machine learning based products including fluxcom and gleam are revealed to have generally high accuracy with large biases found in gldas the availability of a well represented training dataset could reduce uncertainty for machine learning algorithms and the imperfect parameterization of land processes could result in large bias for model based estimation our study is the first to conduct a comprehensive validation and application of collocation methods for the evaluation of global et products the findings illustrate the promising future for collocation methods to serve as a reliable error characterization tool for et datasets the error evaluation results of five widely used et products show that the uncertainties may be induced by the parametrization of model processes meteorological forcings or the lack of benchmarks model development and

3228,tile drains are important water flow paths in agricultural catchments and must be included in hydrological models however their locations are rarely known and the explicit incorporation of tile drains in hydrological models requires refined meshes around the drains which can significantly increase computational times although seepage nodes have been used to represent tile drains with satisfactory performance they have never been applied to represent all tile drainage systems in a catchment the goal of this study is to compare different conceptual models for tile drains and soil heterogeneity for the numerical simulation of tile drainage in an agricultural catchment in denmark the first conceptual model for tile drains uses seepage nodes to represent only the main collector drains in the catchment and the second model uses seepage nodes distributed over all the agricultural areas without considering the specific locations of tile drains a third conceptual model labelled the benchmark model represent all tile drains at their known locations with seepage nodes and a fourth conceptual model implicitly represents tile drains as a high permeability layer the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the observed outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably the simulation of the water table depth was very satisfactory compared to modeling studies with similar mesh resolution 50 m results indicated that the three models using seepage nodes i simulated similar monthly discharges and cumulative discharge volumes for most of the studied tile drained areas and ii simulated surface water flow in tile drained fields without runoff or ponding water the shorter simulation times around 35 faster of the model representing the main drains and the distributed seepage node model suggest that they are suitable for model calibration compared to the benchmark model whenever the location of tile drains is unavailable using seepage node to represent drains in agricultural areas may satisfactorily simulate catchment scale stream and drainage discharges four alternative soil models were developed to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations our results suggest that at smaller scales drainage area soil heterogeneity is more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect keywords hydrogeosphere tile drainage catchment scale soil heterogeneity hydrological modelling coupled surface water and groundwater flow model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the degree of saturation in fine textured agricultural soils is often controlled by subsurface drainage systems consisting of tile drains to improve root development and crop yield by controlling the elevation of the groundwater table tile drains alter both the hydrologic flow pathways in agricultural catchments hansen et al 2013 king et al 2014 thomas et al 2016 werner et al 2016 and the rates of nutrient transport from croplands to surface water bodies amado et al 2017 radcliffe et al 2015 rozemeijer et al 2010b stamm et al 2002 the inclusion of tile drainage in numerical models is therefore necessary for the proper simulation of hydrological processes in highly managed agricultural areas for example kiesel et al 2010 found that the incorporation of tile drains improved the ability of a hydrologic model to simulate summer rainfall events winter flows and the hydrograph recession for a catchment in northern germany to evaluate the response of changes in agricultural practices on water quality in aquatic receptors reliable estimates on travel times from the fields to the surface water system is essential vervloet et al 2018 meals et al 2010 as drains provide a fast flow pathway between the agricultural fields and downstream recipients it is thus crucial that hydrological models can describe fast drain flow with sufficient accuracy an adequate performance when simulating tile drainage dynamics is also necessary to establish regulations for nitrogen applications to reduce groundwater and surface water contamination refsgaard et al 2014 artificial drainage must also be considered in modeling studies to provide a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that affect runoff generation o connell et al 2007 a variety of numerical models have been used to model tile drains ranging from one dimensional 1d models such as rzwqm ma et al 2007 walker et al 2000 and drainmod sammons et al 2005 wang et al 2006 to two dimensional 2d models such as mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 catflow klaus and zehe 2011 maurer 1997 and anthropog carluer and de marsily 2004 and to three dimensional 3d models such as mike she hansen et al 2013 catchy muma et al 2014 muma et al 2016 flush nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 turunen et al 2013 and hydrogeosphere amado et al 2017 de schepper et al 2015 de schepper et al 2017 frey et al 2016 rozemeijer et al 2010a thomas et al 2016 tile drainage was also modelled using swat modflow frederiksen et al 2021 molina navarro et al 2019 and swat bieger et al 2017 which was modified to include tile drainage flow bailey et al 2022 modeling tile drains at the catchment scale using 3d hydrological models is challenging specifically the exact location of tile drains is generally unknown and difficult to estimate with satellite imagery and geophysical methods particularly at the catchment scale de schepper et al 2015 hansen et al 2013 prinds et al 2019 schilling et al 2019 furthermore when information on drain locations is available mesh refinement around individual drains is necessary for accurate drainage discharge simulations which increases the mesh size and the computational burden as a result there is a need to adapt and improve current methodologies for including agricultural tile drains in numerical models such that they can be used in large scale applications when data on tile drain properties and locations are incomplete or absent while there are several methods currently used for including tile drains in catchment scale models these methods all possess limitations regarding their usefulness when extensive data on tile properties and locations are not available one of the most widely used methods represents tile drains as a high permeability high k layer also called equivalent medium allowing for the simulation of lateral preferential flow from tile drained catchments without explicitly representing the drains rozemeijer et al 2010a carluer and de marsily 2004 de schepper et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 the high k layer approach allows for a simple discretization of the domain because of the absence of internal boundary conditions on the drainage pipes carlier et al 2007 de schepper et al 2015 and thomas et al 2016 obtained consistent simulated drainage discharges for a 5 km2 catchment in denmark and a 42 km2 catchment in the usa respectively when applying the high k layer concept however the approach used in these previous studies has three distinct limitations i drainage water cannot be routed to the drainage system outlet at the surface of the domain ii the simulation output does not clearly distinguish discharge from the individual drain networks present within the catchment and iii there is no clear distinction between groundwater and drainage water together these limitations compromise the spatial distribution of simulated hydraulic heads and saturation and a specific location for the outlet discharge cannot be specified alternatively some studies implemented head dependent sinks in specific grid cells at the drain level to simulate tile drainage at the catchment scale bailey et al 2022 hansen et al 2013 frederiksen et al 2021 molina navarro et al 2019 in their model drainage water is routed either to the drainage outlet the stream or the boundary of the domain both high k layer and head dependent sink concepts can be applied when the location of the tile drains is not available however neglecting the tile drain location can affect the simulation of local water flow and solute transport in catchments with large non drained areas explicitly representing tile drains in 3d models as 1d lines is prone to convergence issues in hilly terrains de schepper et al 2017 and often too complex and time consuming to be used at large scales de schepper et al 2015 evaluated different configurations of tile drains using discrete line elements to represent 1d water flow they showed that by representing the main collector drains in a model the drainage system can be simplified for large scale simulations and drainage discharge is simulated correctly once the model is calibrated in a following study de schepper et al 2017 represented tile drains as seepage nodes to reduce computational times the seepage nodes were used for the main collector drains in two drained fields 28 and 34 ha within the fensholt catchment 6 km2 in denmark results of this study indicated that the seepage nodes were able to successfully recreate drainage discharge and the flow dynamics around the drains this conceptualization of drains however was only applied to two drainage areas with similar sizes and there was no attempt to represent an entire tile drainage system in a catchment scale model hydrological models in the same catchment were developed with one single conceptual model for tile drains focusing on the effect of seasonal variations topography deep geology and specific hydrological models hydrogeosphere and mike she on simulated tile drainage de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019a hansen et al 2019b furthermore only one soil model was evaluated despite the uncertainty on the soil structure and hydraulic properties the goal of the present study is to compare four conceptual representations or models of tile drains for the numerical simulation of tile drainage in agricultural catchments the first model the main drain model uses seepage nodes to explicitly represent only the main collector drain paths expanding the tile drainage representation from the two fields considered in de schepper et al 2017 to all tile drained fields in the fensholt catchment in the second model the distributed model seepage nodes are regularly distributed within all agricultural areas at the drain depth without considering the locations of specific tile drains this second model represents a refinement of that presented in hansen et al 2013 by considering that only agricultural areas are subject to tile drainage such as done in molina navarro et al 2017 molina navarro et al 2019 and thodsen et al 2015 and should thus allow for a better representation of local groundwater flow outside the managed agricultural zones the third model the high k layer model replaces drains by a high permeability layer that implicitly simulates the fast flow in the tile drainage systems the distributed model and the high k layer models can reduce the mesh complexity and computational times since they do not require the representation of the exact location of all tile drains of the drainage system all three models listed above were compared to a fourth more complex model labelled the benchmark model that explicitly represents all mapped tile drains with seepage nodes the models were compared in terms of error performance data availability mesh refinement and simulation times a secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations a homogeneous soil model a homogeneous soil layers model and two heterogeneous soil models were implemented using the four conceptual models for tile drains the drainage discharge stream generation and heads were simulated with the 3d fully coupled surface water and groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs hgs has been used for the simulation of complex sw gw systems at the catchment scale e g schilling et al 2012 ala aho et al 2017 chow et al 2016 tile drains considerably affect the sw gw exchange flux patterns reducing surface runoff lowering the groundwater table level and shortening periods of surface ponding konyha et al 1992 skaggs et al 1994 carluer and de marsily 2004 which justify the choice of a fully integrated surface subsurface model recent 3d hydrological models including tile drainage using hgs were published by de schepper et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 and hwang et al 2019 the simulations presented here are to the author s knowledge the first attempt to compare conceptual models based on seepage nodes to represent all tile drainage areas within a catchment with a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model the methods presented here also expand on the work from de schepper et al 2017 by allowing the water removed from a drainage system using seepage nodes to be routed to the surface water flow domain instead of removing it from the model completely thereby improving the representation of surface water groundwater interaction 2 method and data 2 1 site description the fensholt catchment covers a 6 km2 area located about 15 km south of the city of aarhus in the eastern part of the jutland peninsula denmark fig 1 a land use in the catchment is dominated by intensive agriculture around 78 of the total area fig 1b with the main crop types being winter wheat and spring barley the climate is temperate and humid with average temperatures ranging from 0 c in winter to 16 c in the summer with considerable variation danish meteorological institute dmi the average annual precipitation in the fensholt catchment for the 1990 2015 period was 856 mm with annual values ranging from 601 to 1137 mm the surficial geology consists of a 20 50 m thick cover of quaternary glacial deposits overlain by 2 3 m of post glacial freshwater peat in some areas around the main stream valley neogene and paleogene marine sediments underlie the quaternary cover the neogene layers are composed of a clayey formation from the miocene with interbedded sandy units while the paleogene layers are largely composed of impermeable marl and clay the groundwater system in the quaternary cover is unconfined and the groundwater table is generally close to the ground surface the geology and hydrogeology of the fensholt catchment have been extensively characterized and conceptualized by he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 varvaris et al 2018 and hansen et al 2019a the surficial material within the catchment is predominantly composed of poorly drained clayey till soils with a clay content of 12 35 hansen et al 2019a due to the poor natural drainage of the soils the agricultural areas within the catchment are intensively drained as shown by the mapped tile drainage systems fig 1b information about the actual location of tile drains is typically hard and sometimes almost impossible to obtain although in denmark information about the location of subsurface drained fields must be entered into a national database by contractors some records are lost and drain maps are often incorrect therefore knowledge of the spatial distribution of tile drains at the local scale is often uncertain frederiksen et al 2021 m√∏ller et al 2018 the tile drain spacing in the catchment is typically around 20 m though spacing of less than 10 m has been observed within some fields the outlets of the drainage systems discharge in the riparian lowlands or into tributaries of the main river the stampem√∏lle b√¶k whose flow predominantly consists of tile drainage effluent a comparison of stream flow rate and drainage discharges suggested that about 74 of the fensholt catchment discharge originates from tile drains de schepper et al 2017 for this study the catchment was subdivided into four subcatchments fig 1c s1 to s4 to evaluate the stream discharge generated 1 downstream from a large wetland s1 2 in the central part of the catchment where a subcatchment station is located s2 3 from a tributary stream located near the forested area s3 and 4 from a tributary stream located near tile drained agricultural areas s4 subcatchments s1 s3 and s4 have not been monitored and are herein denominated artificial stations 2 2 hydrologic data the models presented in the next section are forced with daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for a 12 year period starting in january 2004 precipitation data for the period of january 2004 to december 2013 was extracted from 10 km gridded data sets provided by the danish meteorological institute dmi precipitation data from january 2014 to december 2015 were taken from the precipitation station fillerup 55 57 n 10 5 e around 2 km south from fensholt catchment potential evapotranspiration was estimated with the penman monteith equation using data from a meteorological station in foulum denmark 56 29 n 9 35 e around 62 km from the study area discharge from eight tile drainage areas fig 1b d1 to d8 the subcatchment and the catchment outlets fig 1c s2 and outlet were monitored daily as part of the idr√¶n project of aarhus university https www idraen dk drainage discharge was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter khrone optiflux 3070 flow meter khrone messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany continuous stream discharge data was obtained from the two gauging stations fig 1c by using water level loggers ott orpheus mini water level logger ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany and a stable stage discharge h q relation was computed from 2 years of biweekly discharge measurements using an ott c2 current meter ovesen and poulsen 2016 additionally water levels were manually measured once or twice a month in two meter deep piezometers fig 1c p1 to p19 precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and measured stream discharge during the 2 year period of 2014 2015 are presented in fig 2 over that period the cumulative volumes of precipitation pet and the catchment and the subcatchment outlet discharges were 2048 mm 1171 mm 836 mm and 658 mm respectively these values are expressed as equivalent height over the contributing area 3 model application 3 1 numerical model the fensholt basin hydrological models were developed with the hydrologic modeling software hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2017 therrien et al 2010 hgs is a finite element control volume model that simulates fully coupled 3d variably saturated groundwater flow and 2d overland flow the primary model input is precipitation which is then partitioned into other components of the water cycle such as overland flow evapotranspiration and infiltration in the subsurface domain hydraulic heads and saturations are calculated for every node in the model mesh in the surface domain the water flux and depth are calculated for each node in the 2d mesh interception and actual evapotranspiration aet are simulated as mechanistic processes as described in panday and huyakorn 2004 and aquanty 2017 table 1 shows the evapotranspiration properties of winter wheat used in the models hgs uses the richards equation to solve variably saturated flow in porous media the van genuchten parameterization to represent unsaturated flow properties of the subsurface and the diffuse wave approximation of the saint venant equations to calculate surface water flow the newton raphson technique is used to solve non linear equations the reader is referred to aquanty et al 2017 and therrien et al 2010 for more information on the model and equations 3 2 soil and geological model we used the same geological and soil structure as de schepper et al 2017 who developed a 3d hydrological model using hydrogeosphere for the fensholt catchment based on a stochastic geological realization from he et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 three soil horizons and a clayey till layer overly the geological units in the entire model area the a b and c horizons and the clayey till layer were defined for depths equal to 0 to 0 3 m 0 3 to 0 7 m 0 7 to 1 5 m and 1 5 to 3 0 m respectively the geological units correspond to the miocene and quaternary deposits where the quaternary units are divided in two groups of glacial and tectonic origin four different conceptualizations of the a b and c soil horizons were also considered the first one represents the soil horizons as three distinct homogeneous soil layers the second one represents them as a single homogeneous soil layer the third and fourth conceptualizations represent each soil layer as being heterogeneous with the hydraulic conductivity field generated based on geostatistical properties more detail is given later 3 3 surface domain the overland flow properties were assigned to the surface domain to represent the predominant agricultural use of the fensholt catchment table 2 the rill storage height is applied at the surface of the model to reproduce the effect of the micro topography on hydrological processes that cannot be represented at the catchment scale in a physically based model frei and fleckenstein 2014 values for the rill and obstruction storage height and the coupling length lc between the surface and the subsurface domains are equal to values used by hwang et al 2019 because winters are mild with average temperatures above freezing snowmelt and accumulation were not included in the models 3 4 numerical discretization the two dimensional unstructured finite element meshes were created using the software algomesh merrick and merrick 2015 the triangular meshes conform to the catchment boundary stream centerlines main collector drains and piezometer locations a maximum edge length for triangles equal to 100 m was specified when generating the meshes the maximum edge length was reduced to 35 m in highly steep terrain wetlands and near streams to improve the simulation of runoff and surface water groundwater interactions at those locations the 2d mesh developed for three of the four models contains 5685 nodes and 11 049 triangular elements the 2d mesh of the benchmark model contains 8175 triangular nodes and 15 986 elements the 3d subsurface mesh was constructed by superimposing the 2d surface triangular mesh from the soil surface downward to a depth of 20 m to generate 3d triangular prism elements the top of the 3d mesh therefore corresponds to ground surface and a uniform vertical thickness of 20 m was used a total of 19 layers of 3d triangular prism elements with uniform thickness for the whole domain were generated the upper soil horizons cover the entire catchment from the surface down to a depth of 3 0 m fig 3 this top 3 m was discretized using 10 layers with a thickness of 0 05 m above the tile drain level and 0 1 m below fig 3 subsurface geological formations were discretized using 9 finite element layers between depths of 3 m to 20 m 3 5 boundary conditions daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were evenly applied on the surface domain of the model for the transient flow simulations the surface nodes corresponding to the catchment outlet were assigned a critical depth boundary condition the catchment water divide was delineated based on topography and the lateral boundaries are assumed impermeable a constant outflow flux of 9 8 10 10 m s was assigned to the bottom of the subsurface domain this flux value corresponds to the average of 16 years simulation results 2000 2015 from a mike she hydrological model hansen et al 2014 3 6 tile drains represented as seepage nodes the seepage nodes function as a specified hydraulic head dirichlet boundary condition set to the elevation of the node however unlike a specified head boundary condition this head remains in effect only if the groundwater level is above the elevation of the node for a given seepage node i the drain flow rate q l3 t 1 is given by qi c hi hd when hi hd and qi 0 when hi hd where c l2 t 1 is an equivalent conductance for the seepage node hi l is the hydraulic head at the node and hd l is the drain specified hydraulic head in hgs c is set to a large value to constrain the specified hydraulic head at the elevation of the node as soon as the head rises above the drain position in the model developed by de schepper et al 2017 for the fensholt catchment the water extracted from seepage nodes was not routed to streams but summed up for comparison to observed drainage in the present study the extracted water from seepage nodes was injected to the outlet of the drainage systems using a boundary condition linking scheme hwang et al 2019 the drain nodes represent sinks installed at 1 m below the ground while the linked nodes represent sources of water to the streams or the riparian lowland fig 4 the water flow at each discharge node was specified as the sum of the water extracted from the seepage nodes within the contributing drained areas because of convergence problems when developing the mesh some drains were removed from the models such as those too close from each other or those located near the streams or the catchment boundary removing drains reduced the mesh resolution and size thus allowing faster simulation times three models were developed using the seepage node concept to represent tile drains the benchmark the main drain and the distributed models the benchmark model was developed to explicitly represent as many tile drains as possible in the hydrological model fig 4a we assume that the benchmark model is the best suited conceptual model for simulating the water flow in tile drained catchments in the benchmark model the mesh was refined to explicitly incorporate the main and lateral drains so the mesh was refined in drainage areas to a maximum cell length of 30 m contrary to 100 m for the other models fig 5 to avoid mesh elements length smaller than 5 m the design of some tile drainage networks was simplified if the individual drains were located too close together in the resulting mesh in the main drain model the geometry of the drainage networks in the fensholt catchment was simplified by only considering the main collector drains and neglecting most of the lateral drains seepage nodes were applied along the path of the main collector drains of all tile drainage networks within the catchment fig 4b thereby expanding the tile drainage representation in the two fields studied by de schepper et al 2017 this conceptualization was applied to reduce computational times de schepper et al 2017 and is considered suitable for the application at the catchment scale de schepper et al 2015 in the distributed model we assumed the tile drains are distributed over all agricultural areas in the fensholt catchment all nodes beneath the agricultural areas located at 1 m below ground surface were set as seepage nodes without consideration of the exact drain locations fig 4c although a coarser mesh could be applied since the drain locations are not represented directly the same mesh resolution as that of the main drain model was applied 3 7 tile drains represented as an equivalent high permeability layer in the high k layer model the tile drainage is implicitly simulated as a high permeability layer located at the average depth of the drains over the entire catchment with that conceptual model the distinction between groundwater and drainage water can be only coarsely estimated the high permeability layer was isotropic and homogeneous with the hydraulic conductivity defined by the tile drains density according to the method developed by thomas et al 2016 other hydraulic parameters were equal to those used for the c horizon table 3 the representation of tile drains using a high permeability layer also allows for a simple discretization of the domain because there are no internal boundary conditions and there is no need to refine the mesh around the tile drains paths nonetheless we used for the high k layer model the same mesh as used for the main drain and distributed models to allow for a more direct comparison of the effects of the alternative representations of drains 3 8 simulation strategy and performance metrics the simulations target a two year period 2014 and 2015 for which measurements of stream discharge drainage discharge and hydraulic head are available a prior model spin up is recommended for coupled surface and subsurface hydrologic models ajami et al 2014 for the spin up we simulated a 10 year period transient model by using daily precipitation data from january 2004 to december 2013 the simulated hydraulic heads and surface water depths at the end of this 10 year period were then used as initial hydraulic heads and water depths for the simulation period from 1st january 2014 to 1st january 2016 the dual node approach was used for surface subsurface flow coupling a maximum saturation variation of 0 05 between successive time steps was specified for the variable time stepping procedure in hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 and time steps were limited to a maximum of 1 day the ability of the models to reproduce observed stream discharge was assessed by computing the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the nse is highly sensitive to discharge peaks as it is calculated from squared differences between observed and simulated data krause et al 2022 the metric was therefore calculated from weekly averaged discharge values the kge metric is based on nse components and was also calculated on a weekly basis the reproduction of depths to groundwater table was assessed with the mae and the root mean square error rmse the simulated drainage discharges were evaluated using the mae nse and kge refer to knoben et al 2019 for a comprehensive analysis of the nse and kge scores on modeling water discharge models were run on a 32 0 gb ram computer with 4 cpu cores at 3 70 ghz without a parallel computational framework simulation times for the distributed and main drain models were 1 7 and 2 1 days respectively for the 2 year simulation period of 2014 2015 the high k layer and benchmark models had longer simulation times equal to 2 9 and 3 1 days respectively for the same period 3 9 parameter estimation we initially attributed hydraulic properties to the soil and geological units defined by de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 for all models using these properties resulted in conditions that are too dry in summer without stream generation and too wet in winter one reason for this unsuccessful history matching is that de schepper et al 2017 only included tile drains from two drainage areas in their model while we included all tile drains in fensholt the main drain model was then chosen for manual calibration because of its simplicity and shorter simulation times than the benchmark model hydraulic conductivities specific storage and manning coefficient were calibrated against daily stream discharges for the 2014 2015 period and the nse mae and kge were evaluated the initial and calibrated values of the geological and soil units are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the manning coefficient was calibrated to 0 05 s m1 3 which is within the range of values reported in hwang et al 2019 and li and zhang 2001 the hydraulic conductivity of the high permeability layer representing tile drainage in the high k layer model was varied from the value calculated with the method of thomas et al 2016 without considerably improving the model so the calculated values were maintained 3 10 alternative soil models as mentioned previously four alternative conceptualizations or models of the soils were developed to evaluate the effect of the heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity from the ground surface down to 1 5 m which corresponds to soil horizons a b and c below a depth of 1 5 m the hydraulic properties were similar for all models the four soil models were implemented to the four conceptual models for tile drains resulting in 16 model configurations the first soil model represents each soil horizon as a distinct geological unit with uniform hydraulic conductivity with values taken from de schepper et al 2017 in the second model all three soil horizons are lumped into a single homogeneous soil unit the third and fourth soil models assume that the soil is heterogeneous and 3d hydraulic conductivity fields for the soil were generated with the fgen package robin et al 1993 fgen produces cross correlated three dimensional random fields on a regular grid based on dimensions and geostatistical parameters the geostatistical properties were inferred from soil hydraulic conductivity values obtained from other studies in the fensholt catchment boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019a he et al 2015 petersen et al 2020 the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity values were 6 3e 05 and 2 3e 08 respectively the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous soil model was set to the mean of the hydraulic conductivity values and other hydraulic parameters were equal to the calibrated values for the c horizon table 4 the mean and variance were used to generate the heterogeneous soil models the random hydraulic conductivity fields were generated with fgen assuming a lognormal distribution of the hydraulic conductivity a correlation length of 0 1 and then mapped onto the 3d mesh elements 4 results the same precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data sets were applied to all models during the simulated period 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2015 fig 2 calibration of the main drain model improved the simulation of the observed outlet stream discharge generated reasonable water saturation at the streambed and wetlands and reproduced shallow hydraulic heads within 2 m depth of the piezometers we applied the parameters calibrated for the main drain model to the other models and obtained a comparable fit to the observations therefore the distributed high k layer and benchmark models were not calibrated the water balance input rainfall and output stream discharge at the outlet actual evapotranspiration and storage variation during the simulation period are presented in fig 6 the cumulative volumes in equivalent depth for the fensholt catchment of the simulated stream discharge are similar for all models ranging from 988 mm in the benchmark to 1030 in the high k layer model those values are however from 18 to 23 above the measured stream discharge volume of 836 mm for the same period this overestimation may be caused by the misrepresentation of the boundary conditions such as lateral boundaries that are impermeable and do not allow for water to exit the model as subsurface flow nse for the outlet stream discharge for the four conceptual model for tile drains were between 0 51 and 0 82 indicating satisfactory to very good results koch et al 2013 moriasi et al 2007 therefore we considered the hydrological models suitable for analysis of stream and drainage discharges depth to groundwater table below ground and surface water depth using the different conceptual models for tile drains 4 1 stream discharge the stream discharge dynamics at the outlet were well simulated for all models reproducing the transition between low and high discharges fig 7 however all models overestimated most of the discharge peaks at the outlet when compared to measured data particularly in the second half of 2015 fig 7 the lowest mae 0 45 mm d was obtained with the benchmark model and the highest 0 66 mm d with the distributed model the nse and kge were best for the benchmark model 0 82 and 0 83 respectively followed by the main drain model 0 61 and 0 71 the high k model 0 61 and 0 71 and finally the distributed model 0 51 and 0 64 the overall good nse for the main drain model was expected since the model was calibrated against outlet stream discharges the same overall good behavior of the benchmark model was not observed in the subcatchment station s2 where the stream discharge was overestimated during the two years of simulation with mae 0 62 mm d nse 0 16 and kge 0 11 fig 8 and table 5 the main drain and high k layer models showed less variation than the benchmark model at station s2 for the former models low stream discharges were rarely reproduced and the peaks were less overestimated fig 8 although the main drain and high k layer models overestimated the subcatchment low stream discharges they showed better performance than the other models with nse and kge varying from 0 62 to 0 72 table 5 the distributed model simulated low stream discharges close to the measurements at station s2 fig 8 however the peaks were also overestimated at s2 resulting in poor performance for nse and kge compared to the main drain and high k layer models table 5 4 2 drainage discharge the cumulative volumes of the simulated drainage discharge for the 2014 2015 period are underestimated compared to measured discharge for all drainage areas except for d1 fig 9 all models simulated cumulative volumes at least 50 lower than measured for drainage areas d4 d6 d7 and d8 which have small areas compared to the others simulated volumes close to the measured ones were obtained for d3 representing the entire drainage areas with tile drains in the distributed model contributed to the higher simulated volumes for d1 d2 d5 and d8 when compared to the benchmark and main drain models despite some differences in simulated discharge volumes between the models their performance to reproduce measured discharge volumes is generally similar fig 9 the simulated daily drainage discharge using the different conceptual models for tile drains resulted in similar mae and nse for all drainage areas except for d1 and d2 where the distributed and benchmark model respectively produce worse results compared to the main drain model fig 10 on average the mae is around 1 mm d for all models table 5 the nse for all models ranged from 0 26 to 0 75 fig 10b except for the distributed model in d1 where the nse was 1 19 the main drain model had the best nse performance 0 30 followed by the benchmark 0 27 and the distributed 0 11 models when excluding the drainage area d1 the average nse were similar for all models ranging from 0 27 benchmark to 0 34 main drain these results indicate that the main drain model performed better than the other models to simulate drainage discharges at the field scale the calibration of the main drain model against stream discharge may have contributed to the better performance observed and simulated monthly drainage discharges in the 2014 2015 period were plotted for drainage areas d1 to d8 in fig 11 the drainage discharges are frequently underestimated for drainage areas d2 to d8 especially in 2014 and for the first half of 2015 and overestimated for d1 misrepresentation of drainage discharges may be attributed to the lack of soil heterogeneity representation the overestimation of the drainage discharges in d1 may be largely affected by tile drains included in the maps but never installed in the field as observed during field work by hansen et al 2019a furthermore the installation of tile drains started as early as 1940 and many tile drains represented in the model may actually be damaged or disconnected from the gauging station we investigated the simulation of the drainage discharges using the alternative soil models presented in section 3 10 we observed that a homogeneous soil composed by one single layer and the heterogeneous soil model 1 performed worse than the homogenous soil layers model to simulate drainage discharges table 5 the heterogeneous soil model 2 however had comparable performance than the layered model with a little improvement of the mae nse and kge table 5 for the main drain model when the homogeneous soil was applied the drainage discharge was better simulated in d1 nse 0 61 compared to the homogeneous soil layers model and the heterogeneous soil model 2 nse around 0 for both models when the homogeneous soil layers model and the heterogeneous soil model 2 where applied better results were obtained in d5 nse higher than 0 70 compared to the other soil models nse 0 16 for the homogeneous soil model and nse 0 51 for the heterogeneous soil model 1 4 3 surface water depth the surface water depth simulated by the four conceptual models for tile drains was evaluated in terms of the expected behavior for tile drained catchments since no measured data was available for an error performance analysis all models simulated realistic spatial and temporal patterns for the surface water depth for most of the 2014 2015 period with dry surface conditions in the drainage areas and higher surface water levels in the stream paths however the water flow connection was better simulated for the main stream than for the tributaries during the summer of 2014 and 2015 the simulated surface water depths were near zero for all models except in some stream stretches and in the wetland western part of the catchment for dryer days such as 15th june 2014 no model simulated the water flow connection along all the streams when low precipitation during the summer results in much less simulated runoff fig 7 and tile drainage fig 11 fig 12 presents the simulated surface water depth for a wet day during the winter 15th december 2015 the stream tributaries were dry for most of the simulation period the simulated surface water depths were generally lower than the obstruction storage height of 0 01 m in the agricultural areas for all models where no runoff was generated except in some areas for the high k layer model fig 12d values greater than 0 1 m were simulated around the streams on 15th december 2015 with higher water depth in the wetlands and near the outlet for all models contrary to the other models the main drain paths can be identified in the main drain model as locations with water depths below 0 001 in fig 12b the distributed model resulted in the driest conditions with surface water depths generally lower than 0 001 m on 15th december 2015 in the agricultural areas these results indicate that implementing seepage nodes in all agricultural areas may limit surface water flow because the tile drains are overrepresented the surface water depth simulated by the high k layer model was generally higher than for the other models fig 12d the high k layer model shows the largest areas of surface water depths higher than 1 m in the wetland areas and 0 01 m in some tile drained agricultural areas on 15th december 2015 during the entire 2014 2015 period the high k layer model simulated surface water depths higher than 1 m in the wetland areas 4 4 depth to groundwater table below ground observed versus simulated depths to the groundwater table from ground surface for 9 piezometers are presented in fig 13 around 32 measurements were available for each piezometer for the 2014 2015 period in piezometers p1 p7 p8 p11 p12 p14 p15 p17 and p19 the depths were overestimated generally more than 2 m below ground surface and they are not included in the figure the main drain and high k layer models simulated lower depths to groundwater table compared to the benchmark and distributed models most of the simulated depth to groundwater table values were zero with the water table reaching ground surface in p10 and p18 for the main drain model fig 13b and in p2 p3 p9 and p10 for the high k layer model fig 13d where the piezometers are filled with water and interaction with the soil surface may occur fully saturated piezometers and higher surface water depths where piezometers p2 and p3 are located is unlikely because of the large number if tile drains in that region fig 1c the error analysis indicates that the depth to the groundwater table was slightly better simulated using the benchmark model compared to the other models table 5 the average mae and rmse were above 0 79 and 0 93 for all models table 5 these values are relatively high considering that depths to groundwater table are around the drains level 1 m below ground surface field scale models within the fensholt catchment developed with finer grid resolution than our models simulated better mae and rmse boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019a however our results are very satisfactory compared to modeling studies with similar mesh resolution 50 m koch et al 2019 simulated the depth to the shallow water table in a regional model in denmark koch et al 2019 and obtained a mae of 0 76 m and a rmse of 1 13 m which are very similar than the errors calculated in our study hansen et al 2013 calculated mae and rmse equal to 1 03 m and 1 25 m respectively for a model calibrated with both stream discharges and hydraulic heads observations these values are higher than the calculated for our models the alternative soil models showed that low improvement was achieved using a single homogeneous soil layer and two different heterogeneous soil models to simulate the depth to groundwater table table 5 therefore we conclude the performance of our models was satisfactory for simulating the depth to groundwater table from 0 to 2 m below ground surface no conclusion can be reached for depths to groundwater table greater than 2 m since it is the lower limit for piezometer measurements 4 5 effect of soil heterogeneity in the simulations the stream discharge at the outlet simulated using the four conceptual model for tile drains was similarly or slightly better simulated with the alternative soil models the highest difference in the error performance was observed for the distributed model with the heterogeneous soil 1 where mae nse and kge improved by 0 09 mm d 0 20 and 0 18 respectively table 5 the four conceptual models had similar performance relative to each other regardless of the soil model with the benchmark model performing better than the others to simulate the outlet stream discharge the main drain and high k layer models showed better performance than the benchmark and distributed models to simulate the subcatchment stream discharge with the alternative soil models simulation of subcatchment discharge were only mildly affected by the soil models except for the benchmark model that was improved when simulated with the heterogeneous soil 2 with mae nse and kge varying from 0 62 mm d 0 16 and 0 11 to 0 45 mm d 0 60 and 0 45 an improvement was generally observed for all conceptual models based on the heterogeneous soil model 2 where nse was higher than 0 51 for all simulations two of the alternative soil parameters showed worse performance to simulate the drainage discharges table 5 the error analysis suggests that nse and kge used to evaluate the performance of the discharge dynamics are more sensitive to the alternative soils and the conceptual models for tile drains than the mae little variation in the error analysis was observed for the depth to water table with mae varying from 0 77 to 0 97 m and rmse varying from 0 91 to 1 11 m the drainage discharge dynamic was more sensitive to the soil heterogeneity than the tile drainage conceptualization however the subcatchment stream discharge was more sensitive to the tile drainage conceptualization the drainage conceptualization and soil heterogeneity effect on the outlet stream discharge are comparable this suggests that at smaller scales drainage area heterogeneity was more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect we highlight that this analysis comprises only 3 alternative soil models and is limited to the studied catchment 5 discussion 5 1 drainage discharge we expected the best simulation performance for the main drain model with calibrated hydraulic parameters and the benchmark model where the location of all mapped tile drains was explicitly represented and the mesh was more refined the error analysis showed that the performance of the benchmark and distributed models when simulating drainage discharge was generally similar or worse than the performance of the main drain model table 5 fig 10 the mae of daily drainage discharge for the drainage areas in the period of 2014 2015 indicated that the models performed equally well fig 10a despite some relevant differences in the nse results fig 10b with the distributed and benchmark models showing worse performance for drainage areas d1 and d2 respectively the cumulative drainage discharge volumes simulated from all models were generally similar fig 9 these results suggest that more accurately representing the locations of the individual tile drains does not necessarily improve the simulation of drainage discharge at the catchment scale improvements in the drainage discharge simulation may be obtained by a better representation of the spatial variability of the structure and hydraulic properties of the subsurface in the catchment in a hydrological model study developed for drainage area d5 fig 1b boico et al 2022 concluded that including average soil hydraulic properties are suitable for simulating tile drainage discharges for a heterogeneous tile drainage area however tile drainage discharges may greatly vary due to different soil textures from one tile drained field to another within the same catchment eastman et al 2010 some authors identified that tile drainage is controlled by the hydrogeological properties of the surficial geology bednorz et al 2016 hansen et al 2019b de schepper et al 2017 the homogeneous soil layers model as included in our models may have hindered the local tile drainage simulation since homogeneous soil layers are unlikely in danish clayey till catchments we evaluated drainage discharges simulations using four alternative soil models section 3 10 with the four conceptual models for tile drains a total of 16 models we concluded that drainage discharges are sensitive to soil heterogeneity in the first 1 5 m from surface regardless of which tile drainage conceptualization was adopted table 5 suggesting that specific soil properties are relevant to simulate drainage discharges the heterogeneous soil models consist of random k fields developed based on the mean and variance of hydraulic conductivity values resulting in inaccurate discharges for some drainage areas soil zonation can be specified in the catchment based on borehole and geophysical data to reduce parameter uncertainty however this information is rarely available and field scale heterogeneity is difficult to implement in the model at the catchment scale we argue this is the main reason why the models were not able to reproduce the spatial dynamics of hydraulic heads which influences the accuracy of the drainage discharge simulations hansen et al 2019b evaluated drainage discharges simulations varying the geological model below 3 m in their study the weekly nse varied from 0 47 to 0 92 using different geological models indicating that geological units located below 3 m also affect the simulated drainage discharges our simulations suggest that drainage discharges are more sensitive to the spatial variability of the soil parameters than the stream discharges in this regard a better representation of the tile drainage systems and the implementation of a drain conductance term may not overcome the lack of heterogeneity representation within the catchment 5 2 surface water the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably simulated stream discharges at the outlet were less impacted by the conceptualization of tile drain than the depth to groundwater table drainage discharges and surface water depth in agricultural areas one possible reason is that the outlet discharges represent the cumulative effect of hydrological processes taking place upstream while piezometers subcatchment stations and drainage areas are more sensitive to local conditions such as the mesh refinement the number of tile drains soil properties and topography greater discrepancies were observed for the simulated subcatchment stream discharges the main drain model had a performance comparable to that of the high k layer model but the benchmark and distributed models simulated distinct subcatchment stream discharge dynamics the low stream discharges at the subcatchment station s2 were better simulated by the distributed model followed by the benchmark while the peaks were overestimated in all models one possible reason that the distributed model simulated realistic low discharge in the station s2 is that areas near the gauging station may include more tile drains than are shown in fig 1b in that case representing tile drains in all agricultural areas may include tile drains omitted in the main drain and benchmark models the high k layer model creates preferential horizontal flow paths at the drain depth all over the catchment area however differently than the other models it does not limit the groundwater table rise above the drains level and water resurgence may occur near the station s2 despite the presence of tile drains actually simulations revealed that for wet conditions in winter the surface water depth simulated by the high k layer model was unexpectedly higher than 0 1 m in some tile drained areas which is not the case in the other models also simulated depths to groundwater table were often equal to zero near the tile drains indicating that the groundwater table is not adequately controlled by the drains simulations suggest that applying a high permeability layer is not the best suited concept to simulate the surface water depth conditions in tile drained agricultural areas the cumulative stream discharge for the subcatchments is presented in fig 9 for the entire 2014 2015 period the tributary streams simulated different behavior between the four conceptualizations for tile drains specially for the benchmark model that simulated lower cumulated discharge volumes than the other models since the tributary streams were often dry during the 2 year simulation period the simulated stream flow in stations s3 and s4 do not represent the continuous water flow coming from upstream but water exfiltrated from the subsurface generating surface runoff near the stream station surface subsurface water exchange and surface runoff generation are affected by the difference in the cell areas between the more refined mesh of the benchmark model and the coarser mesh of the other models fig 5 the larger cell elements of the coarser mesh have flatter topography which reduces the representation of plan curvatures and local slopes implying greater overland flow sulis et al 2011 and possibly increasing the stream discharges at s3 and s4 when using the coarser mesh 5 3 depth to groundwater the difficulty in simulating the groundwater table behavior could be caused by specifying homogeneous soil layers for the entire catchment in a hydrological model study developed for drainage area d5 boico et al 2022 stated that including local soil heterogeneity in drainage area d5 results in a markedly different spatial resolution in hydraulic heads compared to the homogeneous approach analogous to the previous study the piezometers in our studied catchment are installed from ground surface to a depth of 2 m and the groundwater table is expected to vary around 1 m below the ground hence the soil properties may have great influence on the measured depths to groundwater table we demonstrated however that similar error performance was obtained with the implementation of three different soil models one homogeneous and two heterogeneous one of the reasons of the similar results is the coarser resolution of the model that may not capture the water table fluctuation compared to the field scale model developed by boico et al 2022 furthermore in a modeling study in a clayey till catchment in denmark hansen et al 2013 argued that the misrepresentation of heterogeneity in the geological model was the main reason why their model was not able to reproduce the spatial dynamics in hydraulic heads in this study we applied the geological model developed in a larger scale model of approximately 101 km2 area he et al 2015 which may provide coarse information for our catchment scale model the high k layer model underestimates the depths to groundwater table in many piezometers probably due to the saturation of the high permeability layer along with the groundwater table rise above the level of tile drains as mentioned in section 5 2 in the models that used seepage nodes fully saturated conditions only occur below the tile drains nodes hence models with many seepage nodes such as the distributed model and the benchmark fig 4 simulated higher depths to groundwater table below ground in the agricultural areas fig 13a and c 5 4 limitations of the model application the time lag between the transfer of water from the soil to the drain and the release of water from the drain to the outlet cannot be simulated using seepage nodes however typical drain water velocities from 0 05 to 1 5 m s szejba and bajkowski 2019 sammons et al 2005 are relatively high and the time lag of drainage flow may be short which justifies our assumption to neglect this time lag we assumed that using the sum of discharge at all active seepage nodes into a drainage area was a suitable approximation to represent the cumulative drainage discharge however tile drain flow lag time may be a crucial parameter to calibrate a model to tile drainage discharge du et al 2006 we considered that the simulation times of the models were too long around 2 to 3 days for a 2 year simulation for automatic calibration using a parameter estimation software such as pest doherty 1994 2018 a manual trial and error calibration was therefore adopted resulting in realistic simulations for the surface water discharge and saturation we acknowledge however that automatic calibration including soft knowledge is more likely to result in a unique solution and enhance the forecast of the model hunt et al 2020 and that the application of cloud computing can be used for rapid calibration of highly parameterized models berg et al 2019 in an integrated surface subsurface flow model of a 4 2 km2 catchment with similar mesh configuration than in our study partington et al 2013 stated that a better spatial discretization in the wetlands and streams would enhance the simulation of the surface subsurface water exchange such as the groundwater discharges and rainfall infiltration in the wetlands the fensholt catchment contains large wetland areas and the stream widths are less than 3 m requiring extreme refined meshes here the mesh had a maximum 10 m length around the streams and it is rarely smaller than 5 m so we expect some discrepancy in the simulation of wetlands and streams for a hydrologic year the current version of hydrogeosphere cannot simultaneously implement the return flow from the drainage system to the surface and an equivalent conductance term for tile drains over time many tile drains will become clogged with roots or sediment and the drain walls will become less permeable including a tile drain conductance term would certainly lower the drainage discharge estimation and generate more flooding conditions in the winter as stated by colombani et al 2016 new releases may allow a more comprehensive application of the present study where the drain resistance to flow is also implemented in the model the simulation times for the high k and benchmark models were around 1 day longer than the main drain and distributed models table 5 an explanation for the longer simulation times is the mesh refinement of the benchmark model and the numerical challenges due to high groundwater table fluctuation and surface subsurface water exchange in some areas of the catchment when using the high k model however the simulation times may be reduced for the high k layer and distributed models by further simplifying the numerical mesh since no refinement is necessary around the tile drains paths the number of alternative soil conceptualizations in our study is very limited and only useful as a reference to evaluate the parameters uncertainty in tile drainage modeling at catchment scale we suggest the implementation of different conceptual models to better represent the space of plausible heterogeneity structures and the variability of hydraulic parameter values however non uniqueness is inherent to highly parameterized models refsgaard et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 hill 2006 delottier et al 2017 aster et al 2018 and may arise even with improvements in the model structure and parameter values 6 conclusion we investigated two novel conceptual models for tile drains where seepage nodes are implemented for the main collector drains and are distributed all over the agricultural areas at the drain depth for an agricultural catchment in denmark these conceptualizations were compared to a complex model representing all tile drain paths with seepage nodes and a commonly used model with a high permeability layer the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably results indicated that the three models using the seepage nodes concept i simulated similar monthly discharges and cumulative discharge volumes for most of the studied tile drained areas and ii simulated surface water depths in tile drained fields with no runoff or ponding water when seepage nodes were applied over all agricultural areas in the model the simulated stream low discharge was in very good agreement with measured data this model and the model with seepage nodes representing the main drain paths run around 35 faster than the model explicitly representing all tile drains for the same period they are therefore better candidates for use in automated model calibration satisfactory results were obtained for the depth to groundwater table below ground for the mesh resolution of our model study 50 m specially for the models using the seepage nodes concept to simulate tile drains a better reproduction of the shallow water table fluctuation may be necessary for a proper simulation of drainage discharges since tile drains are installed to lower the shallow water table level around 1 m below ground surface however all models had deficiencies to simulate drainage discharges and the shallow depth to groundwater table at the tile drain level highlighting the difficulty to use such a catchment model to accurately simulate the depth to water table at specific locations four alternative soil models were developed to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations our results suggest that at smaller scales drainage area soil heterogeneity is more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect when maps of the drain locations are available but the modeling study is time constrained the inclusion of only the main collector drains proposed by de schepper et al 2015 and de schepper et al 2017 for an entire catchment proved suitable for simulating stream and drainage discharges despite the availability of tile drain maps including seepage nodes distributed over all agricultural areas is also a suitable approach we suggest future research on artificial drainage systems in agricultural environments to focus on model calibration with a parameter estimation software

3228,tile drains are important water flow paths in agricultural catchments and must be included in hydrological models however their locations are rarely known and the explicit incorporation of tile drains in hydrological models requires refined meshes around the drains which can significantly increase computational times although seepage nodes have been used to represent tile drains with satisfactory performance they have never been applied to represent all tile drainage systems in a catchment the goal of this study is to compare different conceptual models for tile drains and soil heterogeneity for the numerical simulation of tile drainage in an agricultural catchment in denmark the first conceptual model for tile drains uses seepage nodes to represent only the main collector drains in the catchment and the second model uses seepage nodes distributed over all the agricultural areas without considering the specific locations of tile drains a third conceptual model labelled the benchmark model represent all tile drains at their known locations with seepage nodes and a fourth conceptual model implicitly represents tile drains as a high permeability layer the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the observed outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably the simulation of the water table depth was very satisfactory compared to modeling studies with similar mesh resolution 50 m results indicated that the three models using seepage nodes i simulated similar monthly discharges and cumulative discharge volumes for most of the studied tile drained areas and ii simulated surface water flow in tile drained fields without runoff or ponding water the shorter simulation times around 35 faster of the model representing the main drains and the distributed seepage node model suggest that they are suitable for model calibration compared to the benchmark model whenever the location of tile drains is unavailable using seepage node to represent drains in agricultural areas may satisfactorily simulate catchment scale stream and drainage discharges four alternative soil models were developed to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations our results suggest that at smaller scales drainage area soil heterogeneity is more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect keywords hydrogeosphere tile drainage catchment scale soil heterogeneity hydrological modelling coupled surface water and groundwater flow model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the degree of saturation in fine textured agricultural soils is often controlled by subsurface drainage systems consisting of tile drains to improve root development and crop yield by controlling the elevation of the groundwater table tile drains alter both the hydrologic flow pathways in agricultural catchments hansen et al 2013 king et al 2014 thomas et al 2016 werner et al 2016 and the rates of nutrient transport from croplands to surface water bodies amado et al 2017 radcliffe et al 2015 rozemeijer et al 2010b stamm et al 2002 the inclusion of tile drainage in numerical models is therefore necessary for the proper simulation of hydrological processes in highly managed agricultural areas for example kiesel et al 2010 found that the incorporation of tile drains improved the ability of a hydrologic model to simulate summer rainfall events winter flows and the hydrograph recession for a catchment in northern germany to evaluate the response of changes in agricultural practices on water quality in aquatic receptors reliable estimates on travel times from the fields to the surface water system is essential vervloet et al 2018 meals et al 2010 as drains provide a fast flow pathway between the agricultural fields and downstream recipients it is thus crucial that hydrological models can describe fast drain flow with sufficient accuracy an adequate performance when simulating tile drainage dynamics is also necessary to establish regulations for nitrogen applications to reduce groundwater and surface water contamination refsgaard et al 2014 artificial drainage must also be considered in modeling studies to provide a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that affect runoff generation o connell et al 2007 a variety of numerical models have been used to model tile drains ranging from one dimensional 1d models such as rzwqm ma et al 2007 walker et al 2000 and drainmod sammons et al 2005 wang et al 2006 to two dimensional 2d models such as mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 catflow klaus and zehe 2011 maurer 1997 and anthropog carluer and de marsily 2004 and to three dimensional 3d models such as mike she hansen et al 2013 catchy muma et al 2014 muma et al 2016 flush nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 turunen et al 2013 and hydrogeosphere amado et al 2017 de schepper et al 2015 de schepper et al 2017 frey et al 2016 rozemeijer et al 2010a thomas et al 2016 tile drainage was also modelled using swat modflow frederiksen et al 2021 molina navarro et al 2019 and swat bieger et al 2017 which was modified to include tile drainage flow bailey et al 2022 modeling tile drains at the catchment scale using 3d hydrological models is challenging specifically the exact location of tile drains is generally unknown and difficult to estimate with satellite imagery and geophysical methods particularly at the catchment scale de schepper et al 2015 hansen et al 2013 prinds et al 2019 schilling et al 2019 furthermore when information on drain locations is available mesh refinement around individual drains is necessary for accurate drainage discharge simulations which increases the mesh size and the computational burden as a result there is a need to adapt and improve current methodologies for including agricultural tile drains in numerical models such that they can be used in large scale applications when data on tile drain properties and locations are incomplete or absent while there are several methods currently used for including tile drains in catchment scale models these methods all possess limitations regarding their usefulness when extensive data on tile properties and locations are not available one of the most widely used methods represents tile drains as a high permeability high k layer also called equivalent medium allowing for the simulation of lateral preferential flow from tile drained catchments without explicitly representing the drains rozemeijer et al 2010a carluer and de marsily 2004 de schepper et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 the high k layer approach allows for a simple discretization of the domain because of the absence of internal boundary conditions on the drainage pipes carlier et al 2007 de schepper et al 2015 and thomas et al 2016 obtained consistent simulated drainage discharges for a 5 km2 catchment in denmark and a 42 km2 catchment in the usa respectively when applying the high k layer concept however the approach used in these previous studies has three distinct limitations i drainage water cannot be routed to the drainage system outlet at the surface of the domain ii the simulation output does not clearly distinguish discharge from the individual drain networks present within the catchment and iii there is no clear distinction between groundwater and drainage water together these limitations compromise the spatial distribution of simulated hydraulic heads and saturation and a specific location for the outlet discharge cannot be specified alternatively some studies implemented head dependent sinks in specific grid cells at the drain level to simulate tile drainage at the catchment scale bailey et al 2022 hansen et al 2013 frederiksen et al 2021 molina navarro et al 2019 in their model drainage water is routed either to the drainage outlet the stream or the boundary of the domain both high k layer and head dependent sink concepts can be applied when the location of the tile drains is not available however neglecting the tile drain location can affect the simulation of local water flow and solute transport in catchments with large non drained areas explicitly representing tile drains in 3d models as 1d lines is prone to convergence issues in hilly terrains de schepper et al 2017 and often too complex and time consuming to be used at large scales de schepper et al 2015 evaluated different configurations of tile drains using discrete line elements to represent 1d water flow they showed that by representing the main collector drains in a model the drainage system can be simplified for large scale simulations and drainage discharge is simulated correctly once the model is calibrated in a following study de schepper et al 2017 represented tile drains as seepage nodes to reduce computational times the seepage nodes were used for the main collector drains in two drained fields 28 and 34 ha within the fensholt catchment 6 km2 in denmark results of this study indicated that the seepage nodes were able to successfully recreate drainage discharge and the flow dynamics around the drains this conceptualization of drains however was only applied to two drainage areas with similar sizes and there was no attempt to represent an entire tile drainage system in a catchment scale model hydrological models in the same catchment were developed with one single conceptual model for tile drains focusing on the effect of seasonal variations topography deep geology and specific hydrological models hydrogeosphere and mike she on simulated tile drainage de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019a hansen et al 2019b furthermore only one soil model was evaluated despite the uncertainty on the soil structure and hydraulic properties the goal of the present study is to compare four conceptual representations or models of tile drains for the numerical simulation of tile drainage in agricultural catchments the first model the main drain model uses seepage nodes to explicitly represent only the main collector drain paths expanding the tile drainage representation from the two fields considered in de schepper et al 2017 to all tile drained fields in the fensholt catchment in the second model the distributed model seepage nodes are regularly distributed within all agricultural areas at the drain depth without considering the locations of specific tile drains this second model represents a refinement of that presented in hansen et al 2013 by considering that only agricultural areas are subject to tile drainage such as done in molina navarro et al 2017 molina navarro et al 2019 and thodsen et al 2015 and should thus allow for a better representation of local groundwater flow outside the managed agricultural zones the third model the high k layer model replaces drains by a high permeability layer that implicitly simulates the fast flow in the tile drainage systems the distributed model and the high k layer models can reduce the mesh complexity and computational times since they do not require the representation of the exact location of all tile drains of the drainage system all three models listed above were compared to a fourth more complex model labelled the benchmark model that explicitly represents all mapped tile drains with seepage nodes the models were compared in terms of error performance data availability mesh refinement and simulation times a secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations a homogeneous soil model a homogeneous soil layers model and two heterogeneous soil models were implemented using the four conceptual models for tile drains the drainage discharge stream generation and heads were simulated with the 3d fully coupled surface water and groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs hgs has been used for the simulation of complex sw gw systems at the catchment scale e g schilling et al 2012 ala aho et al 2017 chow et al 2016 tile drains considerably affect the sw gw exchange flux patterns reducing surface runoff lowering the groundwater table level and shortening periods of surface ponding konyha et al 1992 skaggs et al 1994 carluer and de marsily 2004 which justify the choice of a fully integrated surface subsurface model recent 3d hydrological models including tile drainage using hgs were published by de schepper et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 and hwang et al 2019 the simulations presented here are to the author s knowledge the first attempt to compare conceptual models based on seepage nodes to represent all tile drainage areas within a catchment with a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model the methods presented here also expand on the work from de schepper et al 2017 by allowing the water removed from a drainage system using seepage nodes to be routed to the surface water flow domain instead of removing it from the model completely thereby improving the representation of surface water groundwater interaction 2 method and data 2 1 site description the fensholt catchment covers a 6 km2 area located about 15 km south of the city of aarhus in the eastern part of the jutland peninsula denmark fig 1 a land use in the catchment is dominated by intensive agriculture around 78 of the total area fig 1b with the main crop types being winter wheat and spring barley the climate is temperate and humid with average temperatures ranging from 0 c in winter to 16 c in the summer with considerable variation danish meteorological institute dmi the average annual precipitation in the fensholt catchment for the 1990 2015 period was 856 mm with annual values ranging from 601 to 1137 mm the surficial geology consists of a 20 50 m thick cover of quaternary glacial deposits overlain by 2 3 m of post glacial freshwater peat in some areas around the main stream valley neogene and paleogene marine sediments underlie the quaternary cover the neogene layers are composed of a clayey formation from the miocene with interbedded sandy units while the paleogene layers are largely composed of impermeable marl and clay the groundwater system in the quaternary cover is unconfined and the groundwater table is generally close to the ground surface the geology and hydrogeology of the fensholt catchment have been extensively characterized and conceptualized by he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 varvaris et al 2018 and hansen et al 2019a the surficial material within the catchment is predominantly composed of poorly drained clayey till soils with a clay content of 12 35 hansen et al 2019a due to the poor natural drainage of the soils the agricultural areas within the catchment are intensively drained as shown by the mapped tile drainage systems fig 1b information about the actual location of tile drains is typically hard and sometimes almost impossible to obtain although in denmark information about the location of subsurface drained fields must be entered into a national database by contractors some records are lost and drain maps are often incorrect therefore knowledge of the spatial distribution of tile drains at the local scale is often uncertain frederiksen et al 2021 m√∏ller et al 2018 the tile drain spacing in the catchment is typically around 20 m though spacing of less than 10 m has been observed within some fields the outlets of the drainage systems discharge in the riparian lowlands or into tributaries of the main river the stampem√∏lle b√¶k whose flow predominantly consists of tile drainage effluent a comparison of stream flow rate and drainage discharges suggested that about 74 of the fensholt catchment discharge originates from tile drains de schepper et al 2017 for this study the catchment was subdivided into four subcatchments fig 1c s1 to s4 to evaluate the stream discharge generated 1 downstream from a large wetland s1 2 in the central part of the catchment where a subcatchment station is located s2 3 from a tributary stream located near the forested area s3 and 4 from a tributary stream located near tile drained agricultural areas s4 subcatchments s1 s3 and s4 have not been monitored and are herein denominated artificial stations 2 2 hydrologic data the models presented in the next section are forced with daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for a 12 year period starting in january 2004 precipitation data for the period of january 2004 to december 2013 was extracted from 10 km gridded data sets provided by the danish meteorological institute dmi precipitation data from january 2014 to december 2015 were taken from the precipitation station fillerup 55 57 n 10 5 e around 2 km south from fensholt catchment potential evapotranspiration was estimated with the penman monteith equation using data from a meteorological station in foulum denmark 56 29 n 9 35 e around 62 km from the study area discharge from eight tile drainage areas fig 1b d1 to d8 the subcatchment and the catchment outlets fig 1c s2 and outlet were monitored daily as part of the idr√¶n project of aarhus university https www idraen dk drainage discharge was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter khrone optiflux 3070 flow meter khrone messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany continuous stream discharge data was obtained from the two gauging stations fig 1c by using water level loggers ott orpheus mini water level logger ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany and a stable stage discharge h q relation was computed from 2 years of biweekly discharge measurements using an ott c2 current meter ovesen and poulsen 2016 additionally water levels were manually measured once or twice a month in two meter deep piezometers fig 1c p1 to p19 precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and measured stream discharge during the 2 year period of 2014 2015 are presented in fig 2 over that period the cumulative volumes of precipitation pet and the catchment and the subcatchment outlet discharges were 2048 mm 1171 mm 836 mm and 658 mm respectively these values are expressed as equivalent height over the contributing area 3 model application 3 1 numerical model the fensholt basin hydrological models were developed with the hydrologic modeling software hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2017 therrien et al 2010 hgs is a finite element control volume model that simulates fully coupled 3d variably saturated groundwater flow and 2d overland flow the primary model input is precipitation which is then partitioned into other components of the water cycle such as overland flow evapotranspiration and infiltration in the subsurface domain hydraulic heads and saturations are calculated for every node in the model mesh in the surface domain the water flux and depth are calculated for each node in the 2d mesh interception and actual evapotranspiration aet are simulated as mechanistic processes as described in panday and huyakorn 2004 and aquanty 2017 table 1 shows the evapotranspiration properties of winter wheat used in the models hgs uses the richards equation to solve variably saturated flow in porous media the van genuchten parameterization to represent unsaturated flow properties of the subsurface and the diffuse wave approximation of the saint venant equations to calculate surface water flow the newton raphson technique is used to solve non linear equations the reader is referred to aquanty et al 2017 and therrien et al 2010 for more information on the model and equations 3 2 soil and geological model we used the same geological and soil structure as de schepper et al 2017 who developed a 3d hydrological model using hydrogeosphere for the fensholt catchment based on a stochastic geological realization from he et al 2014 as shown in fig 3 three soil horizons and a clayey till layer overly the geological units in the entire model area the a b and c horizons and the clayey till layer were defined for depths equal to 0 to 0 3 m 0 3 to 0 7 m 0 7 to 1 5 m and 1 5 to 3 0 m respectively the geological units correspond to the miocene and quaternary deposits where the quaternary units are divided in two groups of glacial and tectonic origin four different conceptualizations of the a b and c soil horizons were also considered the first one represents the soil horizons as three distinct homogeneous soil layers the second one represents them as a single homogeneous soil layer the third and fourth conceptualizations represent each soil layer as being heterogeneous with the hydraulic conductivity field generated based on geostatistical properties more detail is given later 3 3 surface domain the overland flow properties were assigned to the surface domain to represent the predominant agricultural use of the fensholt catchment table 2 the rill storage height is applied at the surface of the model to reproduce the effect of the micro topography on hydrological processes that cannot be represented at the catchment scale in a physically based model frei and fleckenstein 2014 values for the rill and obstruction storage height and the coupling length lc between the surface and the subsurface domains are equal to values used by hwang et al 2019 because winters are mild with average temperatures above freezing snowmelt and accumulation were not included in the models 3 4 numerical discretization the two dimensional unstructured finite element meshes were created using the software algomesh merrick and merrick 2015 the triangular meshes conform to the catchment boundary stream centerlines main collector drains and piezometer locations a maximum edge length for triangles equal to 100 m was specified when generating the meshes the maximum edge length was reduced to 35 m in highly steep terrain wetlands and near streams to improve the simulation of runoff and surface water groundwater interactions at those locations the 2d mesh developed for three of the four models contains 5685 nodes and 11 049 triangular elements the 2d mesh of the benchmark model contains 8175 triangular nodes and 15 986 elements the 3d subsurface mesh was constructed by superimposing the 2d surface triangular mesh from the soil surface downward to a depth of 20 m to generate 3d triangular prism elements the top of the 3d mesh therefore corresponds to ground surface and a uniform vertical thickness of 20 m was used a total of 19 layers of 3d triangular prism elements with uniform thickness for the whole domain were generated the upper soil horizons cover the entire catchment from the surface down to a depth of 3 0 m fig 3 this top 3 m was discretized using 10 layers with a thickness of 0 05 m above the tile drain level and 0 1 m below fig 3 subsurface geological formations were discretized using 9 finite element layers between depths of 3 m to 20 m 3 5 boundary conditions daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration were evenly applied on the surface domain of the model for the transient flow simulations the surface nodes corresponding to the catchment outlet were assigned a critical depth boundary condition the catchment water divide was delineated based on topography and the lateral boundaries are assumed impermeable a constant outflow flux of 9 8 10 10 m s was assigned to the bottom of the subsurface domain this flux value corresponds to the average of 16 years simulation results 2000 2015 from a mike she hydrological model hansen et al 2014 3 6 tile drains represented as seepage nodes the seepage nodes function as a specified hydraulic head dirichlet boundary condition set to the elevation of the node however unlike a specified head boundary condition this head remains in effect only if the groundwater level is above the elevation of the node for a given seepage node i the drain flow rate q l3 t 1 is given by qi c hi hd when hi hd and qi 0 when hi hd where c l2 t 1 is an equivalent conductance for the seepage node hi l is the hydraulic head at the node and hd l is the drain specified hydraulic head in hgs c is set to a large value to constrain the specified hydraulic head at the elevation of the node as soon as the head rises above the drain position in the model developed by de schepper et al 2017 for the fensholt catchment the water extracted from seepage nodes was not routed to streams but summed up for comparison to observed drainage in the present study the extracted water from seepage nodes was injected to the outlet of the drainage systems using a boundary condition linking scheme hwang et al 2019 the drain nodes represent sinks installed at 1 m below the ground while the linked nodes represent sources of water to the streams or the riparian lowland fig 4 the water flow at each discharge node was specified as the sum of the water extracted from the seepage nodes within the contributing drained areas because of convergence problems when developing the mesh some drains were removed from the models such as those too close from each other or those located near the streams or the catchment boundary removing drains reduced the mesh resolution and size thus allowing faster simulation times three models were developed using the seepage node concept to represent tile drains the benchmark the main drain and the distributed models the benchmark model was developed to explicitly represent as many tile drains as possible in the hydrological model fig 4a we assume that the benchmark model is the best suited conceptual model for simulating the water flow in tile drained catchments in the benchmark model the mesh was refined to explicitly incorporate the main and lateral drains so the mesh was refined in drainage areas to a maximum cell length of 30 m contrary to 100 m for the other models fig 5 to avoid mesh elements length smaller than 5 m the design of some tile drainage networks was simplified if the individual drains were located too close together in the resulting mesh in the main drain model the geometry of the drainage networks in the fensholt catchment was simplified by only considering the main collector drains and neglecting most of the lateral drains seepage nodes were applied along the path of the main collector drains of all tile drainage networks within the catchment fig 4b thereby expanding the tile drainage representation in the two fields studied by de schepper et al 2017 this conceptualization was applied to reduce computational times de schepper et al 2017 and is considered suitable for the application at the catchment scale de schepper et al 2015 in the distributed model we assumed the tile drains are distributed over all agricultural areas in the fensholt catchment all nodes beneath the agricultural areas located at 1 m below ground surface were set as seepage nodes without consideration of the exact drain locations fig 4c although a coarser mesh could be applied since the drain locations are not represented directly the same mesh resolution as that of the main drain model was applied 3 7 tile drains represented as an equivalent high permeability layer in the high k layer model the tile drainage is implicitly simulated as a high permeability layer located at the average depth of the drains over the entire catchment with that conceptual model the distinction between groundwater and drainage water can be only coarsely estimated the high permeability layer was isotropic and homogeneous with the hydraulic conductivity defined by the tile drains density according to the method developed by thomas et al 2016 other hydraulic parameters were equal to those used for the c horizon table 3 the representation of tile drains using a high permeability layer also allows for a simple discretization of the domain because there are no internal boundary conditions and there is no need to refine the mesh around the tile drains paths nonetheless we used for the high k layer model the same mesh as used for the main drain and distributed models to allow for a more direct comparison of the effects of the alternative representations of drains 3 8 simulation strategy and performance metrics the simulations target a two year period 2014 and 2015 for which measurements of stream discharge drainage discharge and hydraulic head are available a prior model spin up is recommended for coupled surface and subsurface hydrologic models ajami et al 2014 for the spin up we simulated a 10 year period transient model by using daily precipitation data from january 2004 to december 2013 the simulated hydraulic heads and surface water depths at the end of this 10 year period were then used as initial hydraulic heads and water depths for the simulation period from 1st january 2014 to 1st january 2016 the dual node approach was used for surface subsurface flow coupling a maximum saturation variation of 0 05 between successive time steps was specified for the variable time stepping procedure in hydrogeosphere aquanty 2017 and time steps were limited to a maximum of 1 day the ability of the models to reproduce observed stream discharge was assessed by computing the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the nse is highly sensitive to discharge peaks as it is calculated from squared differences between observed and simulated data krause et al 2022 the metric was therefore calculated from weekly averaged discharge values the kge metric is based on nse components and was also calculated on a weekly basis the reproduction of depths to groundwater table was assessed with the mae and the root mean square error rmse the simulated drainage discharges were evaluated using the mae nse and kge refer to knoben et al 2019 for a comprehensive analysis of the nse and kge scores on modeling water discharge models were run on a 32 0 gb ram computer with 4 cpu cores at 3 70 ghz without a parallel computational framework simulation times for the distributed and main drain models were 1 7 and 2 1 days respectively for the 2 year simulation period of 2014 2015 the high k layer and benchmark models had longer simulation times equal to 2 9 and 3 1 days respectively for the same period 3 9 parameter estimation we initially attributed hydraulic properties to the soil and geological units defined by de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 for all models using these properties resulted in conditions that are too dry in summer without stream generation and too wet in winter one reason for this unsuccessful history matching is that de schepper et al 2017 only included tile drains from two drainage areas in their model while we included all tile drains in fensholt the main drain model was then chosen for manual calibration because of its simplicity and shorter simulation times than the benchmark model hydraulic conductivities specific storage and manning coefficient were calibrated against daily stream discharges for the 2014 2015 period and the nse mae and kge were evaluated the initial and calibrated values of the geological and soil units are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the manning coefficient was calibrated to 0 05 s m1 3 which is within the range of values reported in hwang et al 2019 and li and zhang 2001 the hydraulic conductivity of the high permeability layer representing tile drainage in the high k layer model was varied from the value calculated with the method of thomas et al 2016 without considerably improving the model so the calculated values were maintained 3 10 alternative soil models as mentioned previously four alternative conceptualizations or models of the soils were developed to evaluate the effect of the heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity from the ground surface down to 1 5 m which corresponds to soil horizons a b and c below a depth of 1 5 m the hydraulic properties were similar for all models the four soil models were implemented to the four conceptual models for tile drains resulting in 16 model configurations the first soil model represents each soil horizon as a distinct geological unit with uniform hydraulic conductivity with values taken from de schepper et al 2017 in the second model all three soil horizons are lumped into a single homogeneous soil unit the third and fourth soil models assume that the soil is heterogeneous and 3d hydraulic conductivity fields for the soil were generated with the fgen package robin et al 1993 fgen produces cross correlated three dimensional random fields on a regular grid based on dimensions and geostatistical parameters the geostatistical properties were inferred from soil hydraulic conductivity values obtained from other studies in the fensholt catchment boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019a he et al 2015 petersen et al 2020 the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity values were 6 3e 05 and 2 3e 08 respectively the hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous soil model was set to the mean of the hydraulic conductivity values and other hydraulic parameters were equal to the calibrated values for the c horizon table 4 the mean and variance were used to generate the heterogeneous soil models the random hydraulic conductivity fields were generated with fgen assuming a lognormal distribution of the hydraulic conductivity a correlation length of 0 1 and then mapped onto the 3d mesh elements 4 results the same precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data sets were applied to all models during the simulated period 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2015 fig 2 calibration of the main drain model improved the simulation of the observed outlet stream discharge generated reasonable water saturation at the streambed and wetlands and reproduced shallow hydraulic heads within 2 m depth of the piezometers we applied the parameters calibrated for the main drain model to the other models and obtained a comparable fit to the observations therefore the distributed high k layer and benchmark models were not calibrated the water balance input rainfall and output stream discharge at the outlet actual evapotranspiration and storage variation during the simulation period are presented in fig 6 the cumulative volumes in equivalent depth for the fensholt catchment of the simulated stream discharge are similar for all models ranging from 988 mm in the benchmark to 1030 in the high k layer model those values are however from 18 to 23 above the measured stream discharge volume of 836 mm for the same period this overestimation may be caused by the misrepresentation of the boundary conditions such as lateral boundaries that are impermeable and do not allow for water to exit the model as subsurface flow nse for the outlet stream discharge for the four conceptual model for tile drains were between 0 51 and 0 82 indicating satisfactory to very good results koch et al 2013 moriasi et al 2007 therefore we considered the hydrological models suitable for analysis of stream and drainage discharges depth to groundwater table below ground and surface water depth using the different conceptual models for tile drains 4 1 stream discharge the stream discharge dynamics at the outlet were well simulated for all models reproducing the transition between low and high discharges fig 7 however all models overestimated most of the discharge peaks at the outlet when compared to measured data particularly in the second half of 2015 fig 7 the lowest mae 0 45 mm d was obtained with the benchmark model and the highest 0 66 mm d with the distributed model the nse and kge were best for the benchmark model 0 82 and 0 83 respectively followed by the main drain model 0 61 and 0 71 the high k model 0 61 and 0 71 and finally the distributed model 0 51 and 0 64 the overall good nse for the main drain model was expected since the model was calibrated against outlet stream discharges the same overall good behavior of the benchmark model was not observed in the subcatchment station s2 where the stream discharge was overestimated during the two years of simulation with mae 0 62 mm d nse 0 16 and kge 0 11 fig 8 and table 5 the main drain and high k layer models showed less variation than the benchmark model at station s2 for the former models low stream discharges were rarely reproduced and the peaks were less overestimated fig 8 although the main drain and high k layer models overestimated the subcatchment low stream discharges they showed better performance than the other models with nse and kge varying from 0 62 to 0 72 table 5 the distributed model simulated low stream discharges close to the measurements at station s2 fig 8 however the peaks were also overestimated at s2 resulting in poor performance for nse and kge compared to the main drain and high k layer models table 5 4 2 drainage discharge the cumulative volumes of the simulated drainage discharge for the 2014 2015 period are underestimated compared to measured discharge for all drainage areas except for d1 fig 9 all models simulated cumulative volumes at least 50 lower than measured for drainage areas d4 d6 d7 and d8 which have small areas compared to the others simulated volumes close to the measured ones were obtained for d3 representing the entire drainage areas with tile drains in the distributed model contributed to the higher simulated volumes for d1 d2 d5 and d8 when compared to the benchmark and main drain models despite some differences in simulated discharge volumes between the models their performance to reproduce measured discharge volumes is generally similar fig 9 the simulated daily drainage discharge using the different conceptual models for tile drains resulted in similar mae and nse for all drainage areas except for d1 and d2 where the distributed and benchmark model respectively produce worse results compared to the main drain model fig 10 on average the mae is around 1 mm d for all models table 5 the nse for all models ranged from 0 26 to 0 75 fig 10b except for the distributed model in d1 where the nse was 1 19 the main drain model had the best nse performance 0 30 followed by the benchmark 0 27 and the distributed 0 11 models when excluding the drainage area d1 the average nse were similar for all models ranging from 0 27 benchmark to 0 34 main drain these results indicate that the main drain model performed better than the other models to simulate drainage discharges at the field scale the calibration of the main drain model against stream discharge may have contributed to the better performance observed and simulated monthly drainage discharges in the 2014 2015 period were plotted for drainage areas d1 to d8 in fig 11 the drainage discharges are frequently underestimated for drainage areas d2 to d8 especially in 2014 and for the first half of 2015 and overestimated for d1 misrepresentation of drainage discharges may be attributed to the lack of soil heterogeneity representation the overestimation of the drainage discharges in d1 may be largely affected by tile drains included in the maps but never installed in the field as observed during field work by hansen et al 2019a furthermore the installation of tile drains started as early as 1940 and many tile drains represented in the model may actually be damaged or disconnected from the gauging station we investigated the simulation of the drainage discharges using the alternative soil models presented in section 3 10 we observed that a homogeneous soil composed by one single layer and the heterogeneous soil model 1 performed worse than the homogenous soil layers model to simulate drainage discharges table 5 the heterogeneous soil model 2 however had comparable performance than the layered model with a little improvement of the mae nse and kge table 5 for the main drain model when the homogeneous soil was applied the drainage discharge was better simulated in d1 nse 0 61 compared to the homogeneous soil layers model and the heterogeneous soil model 2 nse around 0 for both models when the homogeneous soil layers model and the heterogeneous soil model 2 where applied better results were obtained in d5 nse higher than 0 70 compared to the other soil models nse 0 16 for the homogeneous soil model and nse 0 51 for the heterogeneous soil model 1 4 3 surface water depth the surface water depth simulated by the four conceptual models for tile drains was evaluated in terms of the expected behavior for tile drained catchments since no measured data was available for an error performance analysis all models simulated realistic spatial and temporal patterns for the surface water depth for most of the 2014 2015 period with dry surface conditions in the drainage areas and higher surface water levels in the stream paths however the water flow connection was better simulated for the main stream than for the tributaries during the summer of 2014 and 2015 the simulated surface water depths were near zero for all models except in some stream stretches and in the wetland western part of the catchment for dryer days such as 15th june 2014 no model simulated the water flow connection along all the streams when low precipitation during the summer results in much less simulated runoff fig 7 and tile drainage fig 11 fig 12 presents the simulated surface water depth for a wet day during the winter 15th december 2015 the stream tributaries were dry for most of the simulation period the simulated surface water depths were generally lower than the obstruction storage height of 0 01 m in the agricultural areas for all models where no runoff was generated except in some areas for the high k layer model fig 12d values greater than 0 1 m were simulated around the streams on 15th december 2015 with higher water depth in the wetlands and near the outlet for all models contrary to the other models the main drain paths can be identified in the main drain model as locations with water depths below 0 001 in fig 12b the distributed model resulted in the driest conditions with surface water depths generally lower than 0 001 m on 15th december 2015 in the agricultural areas these results indicate that implementing seepage nodes in all agricultural areas may limit surface water flow because the tile drains are overrepresented the surface water depth simulated by the high k layer model was generally higher than for the other models fig 12d the high k layer model shows the largest areas of surface water depths higher than 1 m in the wetland areas and 0 01 m in some tile drained agricultural areas on 15th december 2015 during the entire 2014 2015 period the high k layer model simulated surface water depths higher than 1 m in the wetland areas 4 4 depth to groundwater table below ground observed versus simulated depths to the groundwater table from ground surface for 9 piezometers are presented in fig 13 around 32 measurements were available for each piezometer for the 2014 2015 period in piezometers p1 p7 p8 p11 p12 p14 p15 p17 and p19 the depths were overestimated generally more than 2 m below ground surface and they are not included in the figure the main drain and high k layer models simulated lower depths to groundwater table compared to the benchmark and distributed models most of the simulated depth to groundwater table values were zero with the water table reaching ground surface in p10 and p18 for the main drain model fig 13b and in p2 p3 p9 and p10 for the high k layer model fig 13d where the piezometers are filled with water and interaction with the soil surface may occur fully saturated piezometers and higher surface water depths where piezometers p2 and p3 are located is unlikely because of the large number if tile drains in that region fig 1c the error analysis indicates that the depth to the groundwater table was slightly better simulated using the benchmark model compared to the other models table 5 the average mae and rmse were above 0 79 and 0 93 for all models table 5 these values are relatively high considering that depths to groundwater table are around the drains level 1 m below ground surface field scale models within the fensholt catchment developed with finer grid resolution than our models simulated better mae and rmse boico et al 2022 hansen et al 2019a however our results are very satisfactory compared to modeling studies with similar mesh resolution 50 m koch et al 2019 simulated the depth to the shallow water table in a regional model in denmark koch et al 2019 and obtained a mae of 0 76 m and a rmse of 1 13 m which are very similar than the errors calculated in our study hansen et al 2013 calculated mae and rmse equal to 1 03 m and 1 25 m respectively for a model calibrated with both stream discharges and hydraulic heads observations these values are higher than the calculated for our models the alternative soil models showed that low improvement was achieved using a single homogeneous soil layer and two different heterogeneous soil models to simulate the depth to groundwater table table 5 therefore we conclude the performance of our models was satisfactory for simulating the depth to groundwater table from 0 to 2 m below ground surface no conclusion can be reached for depths to groundwater table greater than 2 m since it is the lower limit for piezometer measurements 4 5 effect of soil heterogeneity in the simulations the stream discharge at the outlet simulated using the four conceptual model for tile drains was similarly or slightly better simulated with the alternative soil models the highest difference in the error performance was observed for the distributed model with the heterogeneous soil 1 where mae nse and kge improved by 0 09 mm d 0 20 and 0 18 respectively table 5 the four conceptual models had similar performance relative to each other regardless of the soil model with the benchmark model performing better than the others to simulate the outlet stream discharge the main drain and high k layer models showed better performance than the benchmark and distributed models to simulate the subcatchment stream discharge with the alternative soil models simulation of subcatchment discharge were only mildly affected by the soil models except for the benchmark model that was improved when simulated with the heterogeneous soil 2 with mae nse and kge varying from 0 62 mm d 0 16 and 0 11 to 0 45 mm d 0 60 and 0 45 an improvement was generally observed for all conceptual models based on the heterogeneous soil model 2 where nse was higher than 0 51 for all simulations two of the alternative soil parameters showed worse performance to simulate the drainage discharges table 5 the error analysis suggests that nse and kge used to evaluate the performance of the discharge dynamics are more sensitive to the alternative soils and the conceptual models for tile drains than the mae little variation in the error analysis was observed for the depth to water table with mae varying from 0 77 to 0 97 m and rmse varying from 0 91 to 1 11 m the drainage discharge dynamic was more sensitive to the soil heterogeneity than the tile drainage conceptualization however the subcatchment stream discharge was more sensitive to the tile drainage conceptualization the drainage conceptualization and soil heterogeneity effect on the outlet stream discharge are comparable this suggests that at smaller scales drainage area heterogeneity was more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect we highlight that this analysis comprises only 3 alternative soil models and is limited to the studied catchment 5 discussion 5 1 drainage discharge we expected the best simulation performance for the main drain model with calibrated hydraulic parameters and the benchmark model where the location of all mapped tile drains was explicitly represented and the mesh was more refined the error analysis showed that the performance of the benchmark and distributed models when simulating drainage discharge was generally similar or worse than the performance of the main drain model table 5 fig 10 the mae of daily drainage discharge for the drainage areas in the period of 2014 2015 indicated that the models performed equally well fig 10a despite some relevant differences in the nse results fig 10b with the distributed and benchmark models showing worse performance for drainage areas d1 and d2 respectively the cumulative drainage discharge volumes simulated from all models were generally similar fig 9 these results suggest that more accurately representing the locations of the individual tile drains does not necessarily improve the simulation of drainage discharge at the catchment scale improvements in the drainage discharge simulation may be obtained by a better representation of the spatial variability of the structure and hydraulic properties of the subsurface in the catchment in a hydrological model study developed for drainage area d5 fig 1b boico et al 2022 concluded that including average soil hydraulic properties are suitable for simulating tile drainage discharges for a heterogeneous tile drainage area however tile drainage discharges may greatly vary due to different soil textures from one tile drained field to another within the same catchment eastman et al 2010 some authors identified that tile drainage is controlled by the hydrogeological properties of the surficial geology bednorz et al 2016 hansen et al 2019b de schepper et al 2017 the homogeneous soil layers model as included in our models may have hindered the local tile drainage simulation since homogeneous soil layers are unlikely in danish clayey till catchments we evaluated drainage discharges simulations using four alternative soil models section 3 10 with the four conceptual models for tile drains a total of 16 models we concluded that drainage discharges are sensitive to soil heterogeneity in the first 1 5 m from surface regardless of which tile drainage conceptualization was adopted table 5 suggesting that specific soil properties are relevant to simulate drainage discharges the heterogeneous soil models consist of random k fields developed based on the mean and variance of hydraulic conductivity values resulting in inaccurate discharges for some drainage areas soil zonation can be specified in the catchment based on borehole and geophysical data to reduce parameter uncertainty however this information is rarely available and field scale heterogeneity is difficult to implement in the model at the catchment scale we argue this is the main reason why the models were not able to reproduce the spatial dynamics of hydraulic heads which influences the accuracy of the drainage discharge simulations hansen et al 2019b evaluated drainage discharges simulations varying the geological model below 3 m in their study the weekly nse varied from 0 47 to 0 92 using different geological models indicating that geological units located below 3 m also affect the simulated drainage discharges our simulations suggest that drainage discharges are more sensitive to the spatial variability of the soil parameters than the stream discharges in this regard a better representation of the tile drainage systems and the implementation of a drain conductance term may not overcome the lack of heterogeneity representation within the catchment 5 2 surface water the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably simulated stream discharges at the outlet were less impacted by the conceptualization of tile drain than the depth to groundwater table drainage discharges and surface water depth in agricultural areas one possible reason is that the outlet discharges represent the cumulative effect of hydrological processes taking place upstream while piezometers subcatchment stations and drainage areas are more sensitive to local conditions such as the mesh refinement the number of tile drains soil properties and topography greater discrepancies were observed for the simulated subcatchment stream discharges the main drain model had a performance comparable to that of the high k layer model but the benchmark and distributed models simulated distinct subcatchment stream discharge dynamics the low stream discharges at the subcatchment station s2 were better simulated by the distributed model followed by the benchmark while the peaks were overestimated in all models one possible reason that the distributed model simulated realistic low discharge in the station s2 is that areas near the gauging station may include more tile drains than are shown in fig 1b in that case representing tile drains in all agricultural areas may include tile drains omitted in the main drain and benchmark models the high k layer model creates preferential horizontal flow paths at the drain depth all over the catchment area however differently than the other models it does not limit the groundwater table rise above the drains level and water resurgence may occur near the station s2 despite the presence of tile drains actually simulations revealed that for wet conditions in winter the surface water depth simulated by the high k layer model was unexpectedly higher than 0 1 m in some tile drained areas which is not the case in the other models also simulated depths to groundwater table were often equal to zero near the tile drains indicating that the groundwater table is not adequately controlled by the drains simulations suggest that applying a high permeability layer is not the best suited concept to simulate the surface water depth conditions in tile drained agricultural areas the cumulative stream discharge for the subcatchments is presented in fig 9 for the entire 2014 2015 period the tributary streams simulated different behavior between the four conceptualizations for tile drains specially for the benchmark model that simulated lower cumulated discharge volumes than the other models since the tributary streams were often dry during the 2 year simulation period the simulated stream flow in stations s3 and s4 do not represent the continuous water flow coming from upstream but water exfiltrated from the subsurface generating surface runoff near the stream station surface subsurface water exchange and surface runoff generation are affected by the difference in the cell areas between the more refined mesh of the benchmark model and the coarser mesh of the other models fig 5 the larger cell elements of the coarser mesh have flatter topography which reduces the representation of plan curvatures and local slopes implying greater overland flow sulis et al 2011 and possibly increasing the stream discharges at s3 and s4 when using the coarser mesh 5 3 depth to groundwater the difficulty in simulating the groundwater table behavior could be caused by specifying homogeneous soil layers for the entire catchment in a hydrological model study developed for drainage area d5 boico et al 2022 stated that including local soil heterogeneity in drainage area d5 results in a markedly different spatial resolution in hydraulic heads compared to the homogeneous approach analogous to the previous study the piezometers in our studied catchment are installed from ground surface to a depth of 2 m and the groundwater table is expected to vary around 1 m below the ground hence the soil properties may have great influence on the measured depths to groundwater table we demonstrated however that similar error performance was obtained with the implementation of three different soil models one homogeneous and two heterogeneous one of the reasons of the similar results is the coarser resolution of the model that may not capture the water table fluctuation compared to the field scale model developed by boico et al 2022 furthermore in a modeling study in a clayey till catchment in denmark hansen et al 2013 argued that the misrepresentation of heterogeneity in the geological model was the main reason why their model was not able to reproduce the spatial dynamics in hydraulic heads in this study we applied the geological model developed in a larger scale model of approximately 101 km2 area he et al 2015 which may provide coarse information for our catchment scale model the high k layer model underestimates the depths to groundwater table in many piezometers probably due to the saturation of the high permeability layer along with the groundwater table rise above the level of tile drains as mentioned in section 5 2 in the models that used seepage nodes fully saturated conditions only occur below the tile drains nodes hence models with many seepage nodes such as the distributed model and the benchmark fig 4 simulated higher depths to groundwater table below ground in the agricultural areas fig 13a and c 5 4 limitations of the model application the time lag between the transfer of water from the soil to the drain and the release of water from the drain to the outlet cannot be simulated using seepage nodes however typical drain water velocities from 0 05 to 1 5 m s szejba and bajkowski 2019 sammons et al 2005 are relatively high and the time lag of drainage flow may be short which justifies our assumption to neglect this time lag we assumed that using the sum of discharge at all active seepage nodes into a drainage area was a suitable approximation to represent the cumulative drainage discharge however tile drain flow lag time may be a crucial parameter to calibrate a model to tile drainage discharge du et al 2006 we considered that the simulation times of the models were too long around 2 to 3 days for a 2 year simulation for automatic calibration using a parameter estimation software such as pest doherty 1994 2018 a manual trial and error calibration was therefore adopted resulting in realistic simulations for the surface water discharge and saturation we acknowledge however that automatic calibration including soft knowledge is more likely to result in a unique solution and enhance the forecast of the model hunt et al 2020 and that the application of cloud computing can be used for rapid calibration of highly parameterized models berg et al 2019 in an integrated surface subsurface flow model of a 4 2 km2 catchment with similar mesh configuration than in our study partington et al 2013 stated that a better spatial discretization in the wetlands and streams would enhance the simulation of the surface subsurface water exchange such as the groundwater discharges and rainfall infiltration in the wetlands the fensholt catchment contains large wetland areas and the stream widths are less than 3 m requiring extreme refined meshes here the mesh had a maximum 10 m length around the streams and it is rarely smaller than 5 m so we expect some discrepancy in the simulation of wetlands and streams for a hydrologic year the current version of hydrogeosphere cannot simultaneously implement the return flow from the drainage system to the surface and an equivalent conductance term for tile drains over time many tile drains will become clogged with roots or sediment and the drain walls will become less permeable including a tile drain conductance term would certainly lower the drainage discharge estimation and generate more flooding conditions in the winter as stated by colombani et al 2016 new releases may allow a more comprehensive application of the present study where the drain resistance to flow is also implemented in the model the simulation times for the high k and benchmark models were around 1 day longer than the main drain and distributed models table 5 an explanation for the longer simulation times is the mesh refinement of the benchmark model and the numerical challenges due to high groundwater table fluctuation and surface subsurface water exchange in some areas of the catchment when using the high k model however the simulation times may be reduced for the high k layer and distributed models by further simplifying the numerical mesh since no refinement is necessary around the tile drains paths the number of alternative soil conceptualizations in our study is very limited and only useful as a reference to evaluate the parameters uncertainty in tile drainage modeling at catchment scale we suggest the implementation of different conceptual models to better represent the space of plausible heterogeneity structures and the variability of hydraulic parameter values however non uniqueness is inherent to highly parameterized models refsgaard et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 hill 2006 delottier et al 2017 aster et al 2018 and may arise even with improvements in the model structure and parameter values 6 conclusion we investigated two novel conceptual models for tile drains where seepage nodes are implemented for the main collector drains and are distributed all over the agricultural areas at the drain depth for an agricultural catchment in denmark these conceptualizations were compared to a complex model representing all tile drain paths with seepage nodes and a commonly used model with a high permeability layer the four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably results indicated that the three models using the seepage nodes concept i simulated similar monthly discharges and cumulative discharge volumes for most of the studied tile drained areas and ii simulated surface water depths in tile drained fields with no runoff or ponding water when seepage nodes were applied over all agricultural areas in the model the simulated stream low discharge was in very good agreement with measured data this model and the model with seepage nodes representing the main drain paths run around 35 faster than the model explicitly representing all tile drains for the same period they are therefore better candidates for use in automated model calibration satisfactory results were obtained for the depth to groundwater table below ground for the mesh resolution of our model study 50 m specially for the models using the seepage nodes concept to simulate tile drains a better reproduction of the shallow water table fluctuation may be necessary for a proper simulation of drainage discharges since tile drains are installed to lower the shallow water table level around 1 m below ground surface however all models had deficiencies to simulate drainage discharges and the shallow depth to groundwater table at the tile drain level highlighting the difficulty to use such a catchment model to accurately simulate the depth to water table at specific locations four alternative soil models were developed to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations our results suggest that at smaller scales drainage area soil heterogeneity is more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results however at the subcatchment scale the opposite was observed and at the catchment scale both criteria had a comparable effect when maps of the drain locations are available but the modeling study is time constrained the inclusion of only the main collector drains proposed by de schepper et al 2015 and de schepper et al 2017 for an entire catchment proved suitable for simulating stream and drainage discharges despite the availability of tile drain maps including seepage nodes distributed over all agricultural areas is also a suitable approach we suggest future research on artificial drainage systems in agricultural environments to focus on model calibration with a parameter estimation software

3229,this paper introduces a new index identified as composite water quality index cwqi for assessing water quality the novelty of cwqi is rooted in the practical significance of the methodological approach that is developed for its computation the cwqi is computed within an inclusive framework that integrates data envelopment analysis dea cross efficiency ce and the ordered weighted averaging owa operator using optimistic closeness values ocvs as input variables the ocv which measures the potential of a water quality parameter to reach its best quality status sets a solid preliminary ground for the assessment process the dea ce approach enables a collective evaluation of the water quality which bestows more inclusiveness on the quality assessment process and hence more robustness of the cwqi the owa operator extends the standard role of cwqi as solely a water quality measurement device to incorporate the practical conditions of water treatment for future decision plans the new methodology has been applied on a sample of 47 dams described with 10 physicochemical parameters located in northern algeria adopting a wide range of water treatment conditions the results reveal kissir and bougara as the best and the worst water sources respectively meanwhile the ranking patterns of the dams are found almost the same the k means clustering identified the oranie chott chergui

on a continuous basis abba et al 2020 kumar et al 2015 water quality index wqi has emerged as the most potent tool for depicting a set of water physicochemical parameters into a concise value that can serve as an effective ground for decision making asadollah et al 2021 lobato et al 2015 nong et al 2020 following the introduction of the wqi concept horton 1965 new indices have appeared including us national sanitation foundation s wqi nsf wqi and canadian council ministers of the environments 2001 wqi ccme wqi among others nevertheless these indices known as conventional wqis have been criticized for 1 considering an arbitrary number of physicochemical parameters depending on experts opinion as the case of horton s index that uses a list of 10 parameters liou et al 2004 2 discarding toxic substances heavy metals from the water assessment and 3 allocating weights subjectively to parameters based on area experts judgments through rating curves and deterministic equations nikoo and mahjouri 2013 as a result these indices are often exposed to a lot of vagueness and biasedness over the last two decades considerable research has been conducted to overcome such defficiencies using advanced statistics and machine learning techniques like genetic algorithms wen et al 2015 fuzzy logic hosseini moghari et al 2015 oladipo et al 2021 tiri et al 2018 vadiati et al 2016 stochastic

applied mcdm approaches for water quality assessment include the analytical hierarchy process ahp e g sarkar and majumder 2021 ncibi et al 2020 deb et al 2021 sutadian et al 2017 tallar and suen 2016

2017 and yousefi et al 2018 nonetheless it is worth noting that these techniques do also necessitate experts opinions to elicit a priori the relative weights of the physicochemical parameters reliance on subjective weights affects undeniably the consistency of the evaluation process indeed the produced wqis may vary if different panels of experts are consulted heedless of their degree of expertise oukil et al 2021 each time the experts are changed different wqis are likely to be produced yang and wang 2020 zhu et al 2019 the advent of data envelopment analysis dea into the water resources

management lo storto 2020 quantification of water and flood vulnerability and resilience assessment yang et al 2021 yao et al 2020 to mention just a few relevant studies in the water quality assessment field kavurmaci and √ºst√ºn 2016 developed a wqi based on a hybrid ahp dea approach where the dea model employs as inputs the weights that are generated from an ahp the ahp weights depending on experts judgments the uniqueness of the resulting wqis is obviously altered to overcome the above dearth soltani et al 2021b proposed a dea methodology that is entirely data driven al mezeini et al 2020 where the input variables identified as optimistic closeness values ocvs are derived directly from the measured values of the water quality parameters in the approach of soltani et al 2021b the wqis are the efficiency scores of a standard dea model namely ccr charnes cooper and rhodes 1978 whose values are either equal or 100 nevertheless the most striking flaw of such a wqi is certainly the possible occurrence of multiple water sources having a ccr wqi of 100 practically such a scenario which is common to the ccr model prevents full ranking as well as comprehensive categorization of the water sources in other words none of the water sources can be declared explicitly as the best while many of these water sources are hypothetically categorized excellent the specification of the best water source with sound categorization is essential for professionals businesses and general public as a critical issue for the decision process the practical usefulness of the ccr wqi is definitely undermined to remedy such deficiency we propose a new water quality index called composite water quality index cwqi the key feature of cwqi resides in its ability to fully discriminate the water sources unlike ccr wqi while circumventing the ccr wqi s multi 100 weakness the best water source is duly identified through the highest cwqi value on top of an unambiguous categorization of the quality of all the water sources furthermore the novelty of cwqi is rooted in the practical significance of the methodological procedure that is developed for its computation cwqi is computed within a framework that integrates dea cross efficiency ce sexton et al 1986 and the ordered weighted averaging owa operator yager 1988 using the ocvs as input variables the proposed integration process is fundamentally important owing to the following practical aspects 1 using the ocvs as input variables enables setting a priori a reliable ground for the water quality assessment in practical words each ocv is the distance between the current value of the physicochemical parameter and the closest bound of its best quality range i e its benchmark as such each ocv reflects the potential of related water quality parameter to reach its best status 2 under a dea ce framework each water source is entitled to assess its peers in lieu of only itself as the case of the ccr wqi per se each dea ce score exemplifies a wqi assigned by a water source to one of its peers hence cwqi reflects the quality of water from a collective perspective rather than a single view within a relative assessment context the more views the more inclusive is the evaluation and hence the more robust is the outcome i e the cwqi 3 each cwqi is the result of an aggregation process involving dea ce scores with owa weights each set of owa weights corresponds to an optimism level that reflects the attitude of the decision maker dm towards specific water treatment operating conditions consequently cwqi becomes a more realistic reference for future water treatment plans the required improvement rate per quality factor is the complement to 100 of cwqi known as slack value to the authors best knowledge no previous study has ever attempted to develop a wqi that integrates many practical features of water quality assessment under the same methodological framework besides instead of using preset boundaries for the categorization of water quality the water quality ranges of our study are worked out via k means cluster analysis the new methodology is implemented on water samples collected from 47 dams located in northern algeria described with 10 physicochemical parameters and in the remainder of the paper section 2 presents a detailed description of the proposed ranking methodology section 3 is concerned with the application of the new ranking methodology as well as an in depth discussion of its diverse outcomes section 4 is dedicated to the application of k means clustering for a sound categorization of the water sources the spatial distribution of the cwqis on the map is provided in section 5 in section 6 the sensitivity of the cwqis to seasonal variations is duly discussed finally we conclude with a digest of the most salient findings together with research venues for future investigations 2 composite water quality index generation the proposed methodology generates a composite water quality index cwqi for each dam over five steps as illustrated in fig 1 step 1 input generation consider a selection of k dams a water sample is collected from each dam ‚Ñì and each water sample ‚Ñì is fully defined with the measured values n of its water quality parameter as explained in appendix b the values of the input variables p i ‚Ñì which represent the ocvs must be calculated for each parameter i i 1 n and dam ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k the number of input variables is a decisive factor for the discriminatory power of a standard dea model like ccr appendix c if the number of such inputs is relatively high compared to the number of dams under evaluation there is a lot of chance for the occurrence of several efficient dams as a result full discrimination among the dams is almost impossible through ccr and the recourse to a ce methodology is necessary to address this weakness step 2 water quality self evaluation model ccr presented in appendix c is solved k times to produce the water quality self efficiency scores wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì for all dams ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k although very unlikely under the contextual settings of water quality assessment wq i ‚Ñì can be enough to fully rank the dams if only a single dam is identified as efficient otherwise moving to the cross evaluation is a must step 3 water quality cross evaluation the construction of ce matrix Œ¥ entails k 1 evaluations performed for each dam ‚Ñì by its peers m through model mra presented in appendix d with m 1 k and m ‚Ñì thus Œ¥ e 11 e 12 e 1 k e 21 e 22 e 2 k e k 1 e k 2 e kk each column e m of Œ¥ includes the ce scores of dam m produced over its evaluation by its peers ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k in spite of embodying perfectly the collective evaluation of dam m s water quality e m cannot be used for ranking the dams under its current form as a size k array a more compact form can be worked out through an aggregating vector e m into an ultimate efficiency score œï m which is practically the cwqi associated to dam m the arithmetic average e m ‚Ñì 1 k e ‚Ñì m k is the most common aggregation device however e m applies equal weights to each efficiency score e ‚Ñì m which might not be realistic mainly in a decision making context where the magnitude of a ce score is a determining factor of the relative importance of related dam as an alternative dissimilar weights may be assigned to the sorted set of scores through an owa operator see e g amin and oukil 2019 oukil and amin 2015 oukil and el bouri 2021 oukil et al 2022 oukil and govindaluri 2017 wang and chin 2011 step 4 subjectivity quantification an owa operator yager 1988 with a weigh vector œñ 0 1 k is a function g e m œñ ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì œë ‚Ñì m where œë ‚Ñì m is the ‚Ñì th largest factor of the argument e m e 1 m e 2 m e km and œñ ‚Ñì is the assigned owa weight ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì 1 in other words œë m is the vector of ce scores e ‚Ñì m sorted in a descending order so that more importance is attached to higher scores the owa weights can be generated with different techniques emrouznejad and marra 2014 yager et al 2011 but the most frequently used are definitely the minimax disparity models saeidi et al 2015 which enable integrating the subjectivity level of the dm into the aggregation process the minimax disparity model wp presented below is commonly applied wang and parkan 2005 wp min Œ¥ s t ‚Ñì 1 k 1 k ‚Ñì k 1 œñ

constraints 9 in constraint 7 the parameter quantifies the dm s degree of optimism yager 1995 which is basically a subjective measure the extreme levels of are 0 and 1 which refer to pure pessimistic and optimistic attitudes respectively while 0 5 marks the neutral attitude it is worth noting that 0 5 1 and 0 0 5 depict respectively optimism and pessimism ranges as such enables the dm to reflect multiple operating scenarios through selecting different values of and investigate the potential effect of each scenario on the water quality categorization this is further explained in the application section step 5 water quality index generation let œñ œñ 1 œñ k 1 œñ k be the vector of owa weights generated through model wp for a specified dm s subjectivity level using the vector of sorted ce scores œë m œë 1 m œë 2 m œë km the ultimate efficiency score œï m associated to dam m can be calculated as follows 10 œï m ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì œë ‚Ñì m œï m is a fusion of efficiency scores resulting from a collective evaluation process of the water quality of dam m accordingly œï m is the composite water quality index of dam m i e cwq i m œï m which is irrefutably more representative of the water quality but also more discerning than wq i m yield by ccr model high values of œï m infer that many peer dams have assigned high scores to dam m electing it to occupy leading positions consequently sorting the elements of vector œï œï 1 œï k from the highest to the lowest produces a possible ranking of the dams that is likely to be sufficiently robust as will be shown in the application section 3 application and results discussion 3 1 study area in order to illustrate the new approach we collect water samples from 47 different dams situated in the tellian region algeria each water sample is defined with 10 physicochemical parameters whose measured values x i ‚Ñì are presented in table 1 for i 1 10 and ‚Ñì 1 47 the studied dams are sited at the four big algerian

48 w and 8 40 12 e and latitudes 37 7 12 n and 32 44 24 n fig 2 rainfall in this region varies and relatively increases in the east and north sides rainfall generally reaches the threshold of 400 mm in the west 700 mm in the center and 1000 mm in the east while the rainfall rate varies between 600 and 1000 mm in the coastal part between 400 and 600 mm in the highlands and is 100 mm in the sahara the impact of the rainfall on the dams operating conditions is shown in table e1 3 2 computation of cwqis all computations are conducted via a c module embedding the proposed algorithm with all related dea and owa linear programming models besides required libraries from ibm ilog cplex 12 4 using formulae 1 3 in appendix b we compute the values of the input variables p i ‚Ñì which are provided in table 2 the first step of the evaluation process consists of solving model ccr to calculate wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì for each dam ‚Ñì the results are presented in table 3 the average self efficiency based wqi is wqi 60 51 with almost 75 of the dams are inefficient with d16 apparently the worst besides among the twelve dams that scored wqi 100 only 10 dams are strongly efficient nevertheless the occurrence of multiple efficient dams signifies that model ccr fails to achieve full ranking of the dams as none of the strongly efficient dams can be declared best the recourse to ce evaluation of the dams is one of the best ways to address the latter insufficiency model mra is solved 46 times for each dam ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 4 7 to produce the matrix of ce scores Œ¥ which due to space is presented in table e2 using the model wp we generate owa weights for dm s subjectivity levels selected between 0 55 and 0 67 the vectors of owa weights are given in table 4 using the formula 10 the composite water quality indices cwq i m œï m are calculated for all dams m under different subjectivity levels table 5 shows the values of cwq i m œï m along the corresponding rank positions œÅ m for m 1 47 the results in table 5 reveal that the average cwqis vary between 42 96 and 49 06 which appear much lower than wqi 60 51 found using ccr model the higher value of wqi is mainly due to the lack of discrimination reflected through a high number of strongly efficient dams 10 dams conversely the cwqi enables discerning a single dam namely kissir d45 as the best in addition kissir is the only dam among the former 10 dams that preserves its status of strongly efficient dam even under the ce framework with cwq i 45 1 no matters the dm s subjectivity level as shown in table 2 the values of the input variables associated to kissir s water quality parameters reach 0 which supports the latter results subsequently full ranking is accomplished for all dams without any tight rank with bougara d16 declared worst water quality dam moreover it is visible through the highlighted rows in table 5 that 9 out of 10 strongly efficient dams do effectively occupy all the leading positions regardless of the value of as such the proposed approach is not only able to fully rank the dams but also upholds intimately their efficiency status meanwhile the rankings of nearly 77 of the dams seem indifferent to while the remaining dams swap positions within close ranges accordingly the variation of the subjectivity level does not affect the structure of the ranking patterns which advocates strongly in favour of the robustness of the cwqi 3 3 comparison of cwqi to related wqis an important issue that needs to be examined is how the proposed cwqi compares to other existing metrics the cwqi being a data driven index its outcomes can only be compared to indices that share at least a similar data background thus approaches that may require experts opinions such as ahp topsis and ahp dea cannot be adopted for the evaluation of the cwqi in addition to the ccr wqi of soltani et al 2021b two more data driven wqis are calculated by using ccme 2001 and weighted arithmetic wa cude 2001 the results are presented in table 6 with the last column showing the ranking pattern associated to cwqi since the wqis produced by these methods are based on different dimensions the comparison of related results is restricted to the ranking patterns looking at these patterns it is visible that ccme wa and ccr wqi all rank d45 and d46 as leading dams and hence agree with cwqi to declare these dams water quality as the best a similar agreement among these approaches can be observed for the worst water quality found in dams d14 and d16 in 36 of the cases ccme s rank positions are very close to cwqi s with gaps of 3 positions or less this proportion is approximately 32 for wa and it does exceed 53 for the ccr wqi the latter proportion is not surprising given that ccr wqi and cwqi use similar input variables and share dea modeling background the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae shown in table 7 are used for the overall evaluation in a data sample of 47 dams rmse ccme 11 46 and rmse wa 12 26 may suggest that cwqi s ranking patterns are overall unlike those of the conventional methods though there are close ranks for almost one third of the dams again such a conclusion is rather obvious due to methodological backgrounds that are completely different however no plausible conclusion can be stated before conducting an appropriate statistical test with m refereeing to method ccme wa or ccr we need to answer the question do the ranking patterns of the 47 dams indicate that cwqi and the wqi produced by method m are significantly different to substantiate the significance of such a difference we conduct a wilcoxon signed rank test for each pair of ranking patterns cwqi m for the following nil hypothesis ho cwqi and method m produce identical ranking patterns the results of the statistical tests are displayed in table 8 the large p values shown in the last row of the table suggest that at a significance level Œ± 0 05 p Œ± i e there is not enough evidence to reject ho regardless of which method m is used as a reference consequently we can conclude that statistically there is not a significant difference between the ranking patterns produced by cwqi and any method m such a result aligns cwqi with known data driven indices 3 4 estimation of required improvement in addition to its discriminatory potential cwqi is also a powerful tool for measuring the required water quality improvement per factor at a given dam consider dam ‚Ñì defined with physicochemical parameters x i ‚Ñì i 1 10 with cwq i ‚Ñì its water quality index computed under the water treatment conditions that are duly reflected by the dm s optimism level Œ± to improve the quality of dam ‚Ñì s water to the level of the benchmark i e d45 its physicochemical parameters x i ‚Ñì must be altered by the corresponding slack values s i ‚Ñì 1 c w q i ‚Ñì p i ‚Ñì for i 1 10 table 9 shows these values for all dams at an optimism level Œ± 0 67 consider for instance gargar dam d4 the concentration of parameter ts viz may require a reduction of 86 17 mg l to enable the water quality of d4 to be comparable to the benchmark i e d45 similarly reductions of 0 02 0 05 0 06 1 46 8 62 and 0 17 mg l respectively are required from x 54 x 64 x 74 x 84 x 94 and x 10 4 on the other hand x 3 4 e dissolved oxygen should be increased by 7 5 under such improvement settings the water quality of gargar dam becomes as good as the benchmark d45 4 water quality ranges instead of adopting the traditional method which assigns the dams to water quality ranges that are preset arbitrarily we suggest deriving these ranges through k means clustering analysis macqueen 1967 this approach incorporates all the cwqis obtained for different optimism levels in order to distinguish five rank categories namely excellent good medium marginal and poor given a set of k 47 dams where each dam ‚Ñì is represented with a vector of cwqis that are computed for different optimism levels the implementation of the k means algorithm yields the clusters depicted in 2d plot fig 3 the clustering process is performed under r environment although the cwqi dataset is 4 dimensional the function fviz cluster factoextra package is used to easily visualize k means clusters in a 2d plot the dams are represented according to the coordinates of the first two principal components dim1 and dim2 which result from a principal component analysis pca on the original cwqi dataset fig 3 shows that the latent variables dim1 and dim2 explain together all the variations in the data set i e 98 2 100 table 10 provides the water quality categorization of 47 selected dams where dams listed in the 2nd 5th 1st 4th and 3rd clusters are ranked excellent good medium marginal and poor water quality respectively the 2nd cluster contains d45 and d46 selected as excellent dams with cwqi 45 100 100 100 100 and cwqi 46 92 74 95 04 97 35 98 27 the 5th cluster involves dams d22 d23 d26 d27 d29 d31 and d34 that have a good water quality with cwqis ranging between 66 26 and 91 22 the 1st cluster includes medium water quality dams i e d04 d07 d10 d13 d15 d17 d18 d20 d28 d32 d38 d40 d41 d42 d43 and d44 the marginal category comprises dams that are listed in 4th cluster viz d02 d03 d08 d09 d21 d24 d25 d30 d35 d37 d39 and d47 whose cwqis range from 25 91 to 45 58 the remaining dams such as d01 d05 d06 d11 d12 d14 d16 d19 d33 and d36 are grouped in the 3rd cluster which corresponds to poor water quality category interestingly the excellent group is represented by only two dams because of the enhanced discrimination conferred to the ranking process by the dea ce approach as such the proposed water quality ranges appear more robust due certainly to 1 the discriminatory power brought by the ce evaluation to the cwqis allowing full ranking of the dams besides 2 the flexibility of k means analysis which enables more than one ranking pattern to be integrated under the same clustering framework 5 spatial distribution of the cwqis the spatial distribution of the cwqis on the map of the current study s area shown in fig 4 is important to depict the water quality variations over the hydrographic basins and identify the most vulnerable sites at the regional level the cwqi averages per watershed are cwqi occ 25 47 cwqi cz 52 66 cwqi csm 53 66 and cwqi ahs 58 99 with occ basin revealed as the poorest water quality zone and ahs basin as the best fig 4 shows that the dams which are classified under the good water quality range spread over the center of the study area with 57 located in ahs watershed and 43 in cz watershed meanwhile the best water quality dams namely boussiaba and kissir are located in the eastern part of the country specifically in the csm watershed the majority of dams with the lowest cwqis are located in the western zone where natural processes and anthropogenic activities are known sources of pollution and subsequently poor water quality soltani et al 2021b for instance fergoug d01 bouhanifia d02 cheurfa d05 and sarno d11 are dams located in the macta sub basin with limited water capacity which recorded the lowest cwqis in the sub basin inhabitants of peripheral big cities such as sa√Øda mascara and sidi bel abbes may therefore not only experience a water scarcity problem but also a serious double crisis of quantity quality as there is simply no other reservoir in the sub basin with acceptable water quality that can compensate for perceived shortcomings 6 sensitivity of cwqi to seasonal variations in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the cwqis to potential water changes that may result from seasonal fluctuations seasonal indices have been calculated for each dam over the study period 11 months considering three possible scenarios 1 the favourable scenario which corresponds to the optimism level 0 67 where the dm expects the operating conditions to be the best for achieving water quality improvement 2 the unfavourable scenario which reflects the most pessimistic attitude of the dm with 0 33 here the minimum requirements for water treatment are not met 3 the neutral scenario that portrays decision making under an indifferent stance 0 50 using the proposed methodology a cwqi is computed for each month under each of the latter operating conditions four seasons i e winter w spring sp summer su and fall f are duly considered starting from january to november with each season involving three months except fall assuming that the monthly cwqis are equally likely within each season the seasonal cwqi can be derived by averaging that season s monthly cwqis the results are presented in table e3 the average seasonal cwqis vary between 23 32 and 32 25 regardless of the season or the operating scenario moreover the number of dams whose seasonal cwqis fall over 50 does not exceed 12 25 53 11 23 40 8 17 02 and 9 19 15 depending on whether it is winter spring summer and fall season respectively these values unveil that poor quality is the predominating characteristic of the tellian region s water in algeria fig 5 provides a closer illustration of the average seasonal indices on a regional scale the regional distribution of the dams is as follows west d01 d17 centre d18 d35 and east d36 d47 fig 5 shows that the best water quality is concentrated in the central region with average seasonal cwqis ranging between 28 04 in winter and 46 04 in spring under unfavourable and favourable operating conditions respectively although the average values in fig 5 may also suggest that the worst water quality is found in the western region it is important to note that the water of gargar d04 is definitely the best in both spring and summer marking seasonal picks of 99 72 and 100 respectively interestingly gargar is the only dam that achieves a steady value of 100 for all its summer seasonal cwqis meanwhile taksebt d29 and meurad d32 two dams of the central region are declared the best in winter and fall with seasonal cwqis hitting 96 26 and 98 22 respectively regardless of the operating scenario in contrast the water quality of dahmouni d14 is classified the poorest throughout the year apart from the fall season where the water of bougara d16 becomes definitely the most vulnerable the ranking patterns of the dams over the four seasons are given in table e4 overall the seasonal cwqis do not necessarily exhibit uniform ranking patterns for the dams over different seasons and regions fig 6 presents the average deviation of a dam s rank position between successive seasons here it appears that the ranking gap is much deeper when shifting from and to the winter season with an average gap of approximately 9 positions which may reach a maximum of 29 rank positions as the case of deurdeur d24 in addition no more than six dams do preserve the previous season s rank no matters the operating scenario on the other hand the ranking patterns look more stable for shifts occurring from and to the summer season where the ranking gap does not exceed 3 positions for almost 66 of the dams under both favourable and unfavourable scenarios thus there is no doubt that cwqi is sensitive to seasonal variability which revolves around winter and summer in the study area these two seasons are rainy and sunny respectively with most of the rains occurring in fall and winter per se the amount of seasonal rainfall seems determinant for water quality as it largely affects water inflows to dams such a correlation is more emphasized in the regional distribution of average seasonal cwqis discussed above see fig 5 in fact the rains are scarcer in the western region ranging between 330 and 400 mm year which may justify the poor water quality in the central and eastern regions the rains are more abundant falling in the range of 600 to 800 mm year and often lead to a better water quality to better assess the influence of water inflow to dams on the dam s water quality the filling rate of each dam is calculated see table e5 based on the dam s capacity and filling rate presented in table e5 boukourdane d23 dam has definitely low filling rates all over the study period not exceeding 43 84 in the best case however boukourdane is constantly ranked among the top ten dams for its water quality during all seasons on the other hand beni haroun d43 is considered the largest dam in algeria with a nominal capacity that is always exceeded through the phenomenon of spillage soltani et al 2021a even though beni haroun ranks from 21st to 33rd these two examples provide enough evidence that the quality of the water sources that feed the dams plays a key role in identifying its quality regardless of the quantity of water 7 conclusion the assessment process of water quality using large sets of physicochemical parameters has long been a major challenge for water resource management specialists thus a substantial effort has been dedicated to develop managerial tools that are not only sufficiently encompassing but also robust enough to ensure regular and reliable monitoring of water quality tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 wqi is universally acknowledged as one of these tools this study introduced a new wqi termed as cwqi which enables to fully discern the quality of a set of water sources and subsequently identify the best water the cwqis are ingeniously computed through a methodological approach that combines dea ce paradigm with the aggregation features of owa the dea model uses as input variables which are duly derived from the observed physicochemical parameters using 10 physicochemical parameters the proposed methodology was applied on 47 water samples distributed among the most important algerian hydrographic basins i e occ cz ahs and csm as a result kissir emerges as the best water quality source as opposed to bougara which is the worst meanwhile the occ basin has been identified as the poorest water quality zone and ahs basin as the best the results have revealed that the water quality ranking patterns are indifferent to the level of subjectivity of the dms which supports the robustness of the cwqis as benchmarking tools although the sensitivity analysis has shown possible relation between the cwqi and seasonal variations further investigations may be necessary to better identify the most significant factors that may influence this relationship including dam s capacity and filling rate multi period indices moghaddas et al 2022 could be considered as new alternatives for water quality assessment credit authorship contribution

appendix a water quality standards water quality standards wqs describe the ideal concentration ranges of physicochemical and biological parameters that define a water sample soltani et al 2020 the values of these standards also known as guidelines vary depending on the parameters as well as the water usage tiyasha et al 2020 for example guidelines for drinking water are not the same as those for irrigation water recreational purpose water e g swimming and so on protecting human health and aquatic life from waterborne diseases and possible contamination remains the ultimate reason that motivated world organizations like who food and agriculture organization fao and european commission ec to establishing wqs accordingly if the analysis of a water sample exposes parameter values that do not fullfill the assigned wqs water treatment must be carried out following the degree of deviation the wqs adopted for the present study cluster physicochemical parameters into four 04 quality categories i e excellent acceptable poor and unsuitable conforming with the standards of who 2017 ec 2014 and agence nationale des resources hydrauliques anrh 2009 as shown in table a the excellent range represents the best quality of water which can be consumed securely while simple advanced and very advanced treatment processes are necessary for acceptable poor and unsuitable ranges respectively to meet the required water quality appendix b input variables under a standard dea based water evaluation framework it is convenient to regard a dam ‚Ñì as a dmu that employs n resources i in quantities x i ‚Ñì for i 1 n per se each value x i ‚Ñì becomes formally one the dmu s n input variables and hence it must conform to the axiomatic rule less is better cook et al 2014 meanwhile it is well established that the desirable values of x i ‚Ñì adhere to water quality standards see table a that are specific to the water quality factor i as examples let s look at the rows total solid ts and dissolved oxygen do in table a there is no doubt that ts can be seen as an input provided that its desirable values fulfil the less is better rule nonetheless the standard ranges of do reveal that the higher the values of do the better which definitely violates the latter rule thus x i ‚Ñì cannot be adopted as input of a standard dea model for all n water quality factors such inconvenience is rather complicated by the fact that the preferences for x i ‚Ñì per category unsuitable poor good excellent are set into different ranges preventing the adoption of a unified preference context the category range associated to any water quality factor i is necessarily embodied in one of the intervals Œª i Œª i Œº i or Œº i with Œª i and Œº i the interval s lower and upper limits respectively in practice managers do usually set targets in the light of the on hand resources the more resources the more ambitious the target in a water treatment facility targets are related to the quality level of the after treatment water assuming that there are no resource limitations excellent water quality should certainly be the normal target which cannot be achieved unless the measured values x i ‚Ñì of all water quality factors do fall simultaneously within the corresponding excellent category ranges œâ i for i 1 n though such a scenario is likely to occur for a limited number of water quality factors the x i ‚Ñì values of most factors will probably fall away here we define a new input variable p i ‚Ñì that measures the potential of the treatment process to shift the x i ‚Ñì value of water quality factor i inside œâ i for i 1 n with the assumption that x i ‚Ñì œâ i it is obvious that the nearer x i ‚Ñì to one of œâ i s limits the more potential for a better water quality depending on the current value of x i ‚Ñì the input variable p i ‚Ñì can be computed as follows œâ i Œª i and x i ‚Ñì Œª i p i ‚Ñì Œª i x i ‚Ñì Œµ 1 œâ i Œª i Œº i i and x i ‚Ñì Œª i p i ‚Ñì Œª i x i ‚Ñì Œµ x i ‚Ñì Œº i p i ‚Ñì x i ‚Ñì Œº i Œµ 2 œâ i Œº i and x i ‚Ñì Œº i p i ‚Ñì x i ‚Ñì Œº i Œµ 3 p i ‚Ñì Œµ defines the situation where x i ‚Ñì œâ i no matters the water quality parameter the most striking feature of the variable p i ‚Ñì is that it satisfies perfectly the axiomatic rule less is better of a standard dea input variable appendix c self efficiency dea model regardless of the preference features of the original water quality factors a dam ‚Ñì can be treated as a dmu that consumes inputs p i ‚Ñì for i 1 n and ‚Ñì 1 k the natural objective of each dam ‚Ñì being the minimization of its inputs the following ccr model charnes cooper and rhodes 1978 is implemented to estimate e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì ccr e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì max Œ≤ subject to i 1 n p i ‚Ñì Œ± i ‚Ñì 1 4 Œ≤ i 1 n p ik Œ± i ‚Ñì 0 k 1 k 5 Œ± i ‚Ñì 0 i 1 n e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì is the self efficiency score of dam ‚Ñì while Œ± i ‚Ñì denotes the weights that dam ‚Ñì allocates to its input factors p i ‚Ñì i 1 n towards achieving ‚Ñì s best self evaluation score e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì oral et al 2014 oukil et al 2016 sow et al 2016 dam ‚Ñì is confirmed efficient if e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 else it is inefficient for e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 oukil and zekri 2021 at this level of the methodological reasoning the water quality self efficiency index of dam ‚Ñì is denoted wq i ‚Ñì so that wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì in the advent of several dams ‚Ñì with wq i ‚Ñì 100 e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì may not be an appropriate wqi as full discrimination among the dams becomes practically impossible i e none of the efficient water samples can be qualified as best although such a categorization is required for benchmarking purposes in other words the results do not inform practitioners businesses and the general public regarding the best water i e the benchmark such a phenomenon is typical to standard models like ccr surprisingly none of the former dea based studies has mentioned this issue in spite of its severe occurrence in all pertaining cases for instance the proportions of efficient wells reported in kavurmaci and √ºst√ºn 2016 is 39 22 suggesting that all related waters can be considered as valid benchmarks which is rather unrealistic although the water assessment process gains more objectivity with the introduction of the new input variable the lack of discrimination between the water sources may undermine the usefulness of the wqis that are produced via ccr model oukil et al 2021 per se potential occurrence of multiple efficient dams is definitely a critical issue for the decision process which has not been discussed yet in the water management literature to alleviate such an insufficiency the best recourse is undeniably dea ce sexton et al 1986 appendix d cross efficiency dea model under a dea cross efficiency setting each dam is able to assess its peers m with its own optimal vector of weights Œ± ‚Ñì Œ± 1 ‚Ñì Œ± 2 ‚Ñì Œ± n ‚Ñì oukil and govindaluri 2020 nonetheless as a linear program ccr may have alternative optimal solutions i e different weights Œ± ‚Ñì

3229,this paper introduces a new index identified as composite water quality index cwqi for assessing water quality the novelty of cwqi is rooted in the practical significance of the methodological approach that is developed for its computation the cwqi is computed within an inclusive framework that integrates data envelopment analysis dea cross efficiency ce and the ordered weighted averaging owa operator using optimistic closeness values ocvs as input variables the ocv which measures the potential of a water quality parameter to reach its best quality status sets a solid preliminary ground for the assessment process the dea ce approach enables a collective evaluation of the water quality which bestows more inclusiveness on the quality assessment process and hence more robustness of the cwqi the owa operator extends the standard role of cwqi as solely a water quality measurement device to incorporate the practical conditions of water treatment for future decision plans the new methodology has been applied on a sample of 47 dams described with 10 physicochemical parameters located in northern algeria adopting a wide range of water treatment conditions the results reveal kissir and bougara as the best and the worst water sources respectively meanwhile the ranking patterns of the dams are found almost the same the k means clustering identified the oranie chott chergui

access to drinking water osseiran and lufadeju 2019 under these constraining conditions one of the most challenging tasks of water resource managers is incontestably securing water that satisfies quality standards for the benefit of human health and the ecosystem qu et al 2020 silva et al 2021 meeting such a challenge entails assessment tools that are robust enough for monitoring water quality on a continuous basis abba et al 2020 kumar et al 2015 water quality index wqi has emerged as the most potent tool for depicting a set of water physicochemical parameters into a concise value that can serve as an effective ground for decision making asadollah et al 2021 lobato et al 2015 nong et al 2020 following the introduction of the wqi concept horton 1965 new indices have appeared including us national sanitation foundation s wqi nsf wqi and canadian council ministers of the environments 2001 wqi ccme wqi among others nevertheless these indices known as conventional wqis have been criticized for 1 considering an arbitrary number of physicochemical parameters depending on experts opinion as the case of horton s index that uses a list of 10 parameters liou et al 2004 2 discarding toxic substances heavy metals from the water assessment and 3 allocating weights subjectively to parameters based on area experts judgments through rating curves and deterministic equations nikoo and mahjouri 2013 as a result these indices are often exposed to a lot of vagueness and biasedness over the last two decades considerable research has been conducted to overcome such defficiencies using advanced statistics and machine learning techniques like genetic algorithms wen et al 2015 fuzzy logic hosseini moghari et al 2015 oladipo et al 2021 tiri et al 2018 vadiati et al 2016 stochastic

decision making mcdm techniques have also emerged recently enhancing the robustness of the wqis through a conspicuous improvement of the weights computation process li et al 2010 the most frequently applied mcdm approaches for water quality assessment include the analytical hierarchy process ahp e g sarkar and majumder 2021 ncibi et al 2020 deb et al 2021 sutadian et al 2017 tallar and suen 2016

2017 and yousefi et al 2018 nonetheless it is worth noting that these techniques do also necessitate experts opinions to elicit a priori the relative weights of the physicochemical parameters reliance on subjective weights affects undeniably the consistency of the evaluation process indeed the produced wqis may vary if different panels of experts are consulted heedless of their degree of expertise oukil et al 2021 each time the experts are changed different wqis are likely to be produced yang and wang 2020 zhu et al 2019 the advent of data envelopment analysis dea into the water resources management field has marked its potential for assessing multi inputs multi outputs decision making units dmus without necessitating a priori subjective weights oukil and al zidi 2018 recent

management lo storto 2020 quantification of water and flood vulnerability and resilience assessment yang et al 2021 yao et al 2020 to mention just a few relevant studies in the water quality assessment field kavurmaci and √ºst√ºn 2016 developed a wqi based on a hybrid ahp dea approach where the dea model employs as inputs the weights that are generated from an ahp the ahp weights depending on experts judgments the uniqueness of the resulting wqis is obviously altered to overcome the above dearth soltani et al 2021b proposed a dea methodology that is entirely data driven al mezeini et al 2020 where the input variables identified as optimistic closeness values ocvs are derived directly from the measured values of the water quality parameters in the approach of soltani et al 2021b the wqis are the efficiency scores of a standard dea model namely ccr charnes cooper and rhodes 1978 whose values are either equal or 100 nevertheless the most striking flaw of such a wqi is certainly the possible occurrence of multiple water sources having a ccr wqi of 100 practically such a scenario which is common to the ccr model prevents full ranking as well as comprehensive categorization of the water sources in other words none of the water sources can be declared explicitly as the best while many of these water sources are hypothetically categorized excellent the specification of the best water source with sound categorization is essential for professionals businesses and general public as a critical issue for the decision process the practical usefulness of the ccr wqi is definitely undermined to remedy such deficiency we propose a new water quality index called composite water quality index cwqi the key feature of cwqi resides in its ability to fully discriminate the water sources unlike ccr wqi while circumventing the ccr wqi s multi 100 weakness the best water source is duly identified through the highest cwqi value on top of an unambiguous categorization of the quality of all the water sources furthermore the novelty of cwqi is rooted in the practical significance of the methodological procedure that is developed for its computation cwqi is computed within a framework that integrates dea cross efficiency ce sexton et al 1986 and the ordered weighted averaging owa operator yager 1988 using the ocvs as input variables the proposed integration process is fundamentally important owing to the following practical aspects 1 using the ocvs as input variables enables setting a priori a reliable ground for the water quality assessment in practical words each ocv is the distance between the current value of the physicochemical parameter and the closest bound of its best quality range i e its benchmark as such each ocv reflects the potential of related water quality parameter to reach its best status 2 under a dea ce framework each water source is entitled to assess its peers in lieu of only itself as the case of the ccr wqi per se each dea ce score exemplifies a wqi assigned by a water source to one of its peers hence cwqi reflects the quality of water from a collective perspective rather than a single view within a relative assessment context the more views the more inclusive is the evaluation and hence the more robust is the outcome i e the cwqi 3 each cwqi is the result of an aggregation process involving dea ce scores with owa weights each set of owa weights corresponds to an optimism level that reflects the attitude of the decision maker dm towards specific water treatment operating conditions consequently cwqi becomes a more realistic reference for future water treatment plans the required improvement rate per quality factor is the complement to 100 of cwqi known as slack value to the authors best knowledge no previous study has ever attempted to develop a wqi that integrates many practical features of water quality assessment under the same methodological framework besides instead of using preset boundaries for the categorization of water quality the water quality ranges of our study are worked out via k means cluster analysis the new methodology is implemented on water samples collected from 47 dams located in northern algeria described with 10 physicochemical parameters and in the remainder of the paper section 2 presents a detailed description of the proposed ranking methodology section 3 is concerned with the application of the new ranking methodology as well as an in depth discussion of its diverse outcomes section 4 is dedicated to the application of k means clustering for a sound categorization of the water sources the spatial distribution of the cwqis on the map is provided in section 5 in section 6 the sensitivity of the cwqis to seasonal variations is duly discussed finally we conclude with a digest of the most salient findings together with research venues for future investigations 2 composite water quality index generation the proposed methodology generates a composite water quality index cwqi for each dam over five steps as illustrated in fig 1 step 1 input generation consider a selection of k dams a water sample is collected from each dam ‚Ñì and each water sample ‚Ñì is fully defined with the measured values n of its water quality parameter as explained in appendix b the values of the input variables p i ‚Ñì which represent the ocvs must be calculated for each parameter i i 1 n and dam ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k the number of input variables is a decisive factor for the discriminatory power of a standard dea model like ccr appendix c if the number of such inputs is relatively high compared to the number of dams under evaluation there is a lot of chance for the occurrence of several efficient dams as a result full discrimination among the dams is almost impossible through ccr and the recourse to a ce methodology is necessary to address this weakness step 2 water quality self evaluation model ccr presented in appendix c is solved k times to produce the water quality self efficiency scores wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì for all dams ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k although very unlikely under the contextual settings of water quality assessment wq i ‚Ñì can be enough to fully rank the dams if only a single dam is identified as efficient otherwise moving to the cross evaluation is a must step 3 water quality cross evaluation the construction of ce matrix Œ¥ entails k 1 evaluations performed for each dam ‚Ñì by its peers m through model mra presented in appendix d with m 1 k and m ‚Ñì thus Œ¥ e 11 e 12 e 1 k e 21 e 22 e 2 k e k 1 e k 2 e kk each column e m of Œ¥ includes the ce scores of dam m produced over its evaluation by its peers ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 k in spite of embodying perfectly the collective evaluation of dam m s water quality e m cannot be used for ranking the dams under its current form as a size k array a more compact form can be worked out through an aggregating vector e m into an ultimate efficiency score œï m which is practically the cwqi associated to dam m the arithmetic average e m ‚Ñì 1 k e ‚Ñì m k is the most common aggregation device however e m applies equal weights to each efficiency score e ‚Ñì m which might not be realistic mainly in a decision making context where the magnitude of a ce score is a determining factor of the relative importance of related dam as an alternative dissimilar weights may be assigned to the sorted set of scores through an owa operator see e g amin and oukil 2019 oukil and amin 2015 oukil and el bouri 2021 oukil et al 2022 oukil and govindaluri 2017 wang and chin 2011 step 4 subjectivity quantification an owa operator yager 1988 with a weigh vector œñ 0 1 k is a function g e m œñ ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì œë ‚Ñì m where œë ‚Ñì m is the ‚Ñì th largest factor of the argument e m e 1 m e 2 m e km and œñ ‚Ñì is the assigned owa weight ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì 1 in other words œë m is the vector of ce scores e ‚Ñì m sorted in a descending order so that more importance is attached to higher scores the owa weights can be generated with different techniques emrouznejad and marra 2014 yager et al 2011 but the most frequently used are definitely the minimax disparity models saeidi et al 2015 which enable integrating the subjectivity level of the dm into the aggregation process the minimax disparity model wp presented below is commonly applied wang and parkan 2005 wp min Œ¥ s t ‚Ñì 1 k 1 k ‚Ñì k 1 œñ ‚Ñì 0 1 7 ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì 1 8 Œ¥ œñ ‚Ñì œñ ‚Ñì 1 Œ¥ ‚Ñì 1 k 1 9 œñ ‚Ñì 0 ‚Ñì 1 k model wp minimizes the deviation Œ¥ between successive weights œñ ‚Ñì and œñ ‚Ñì 1 ‚Ñì 1 k which is reflected in constraints 9 in constraint 7 the parameter quantifies the dm s degree of optimism yager 1995 which is basically a subjective measure the extreme levels of are 0 and 1 which refer to pure pessimistic and optimistic attitudes respectively while 0 5 marks the neutral attitude it is worth noting that 0 5 1 and 0 0 5 depict respectively optimism and pessimism ranges as such enables the dm to reflect multiple operating scenarios through selecting different values of and investigate the potential effect of each scenario on the water quality categorization this is further explained in the application section step 5 water quality index generation let œñ œñ 1 œñ k 1 œñ k be the vector of owa weights generated through model wp for a specified dm s subjectivity level using the vector of sorted ce scores œë m œë 1 m œë 2 m œë km the ultimate efficiency score œï m associated to dam m can be calculated as follows 10 œï m ‚Ñì 1 k œñ ‚Ñì œë ‚Ñì m œï m is a fusion of efficiency scores resulting from a collective evaluation process of the water quality of dam m accordingly œï m is the composite water quality index of dam m i e cwq i m œï m which is irrefutably more representative of the water quality but also more discerning than wq i m yield by ccr model high values of œï m infer that many peer dams have assigned high scores to dam m electing it to occupy leading positions consequently sorting the elements of vector œï œï 1 œï k from the highest to the lowest produces a possible ranking of the dams that is likely to be sufficiently robust as will be shown in the application section 3 application and results discussion 3 1 study area in order to illustrate the new approach we collect water samples from 47 different dams situated in the tellian region algeria each water sample is defined with 10 physicochemical parameters whose measured values x i ‚Ñì are presented in table 1 for i 1 10 and ‚Ñì 1 47 the studied dams are sited at the four big algerian watersheds viz 1 oranie chott chergui occ 2 cheliff zahrez cz 3 algerois hodna sommam ahs and 4 constantinois seybousse mellegue csm with a global area of 225 105 km2 extending between longitudes 2 13 48 w and 8 40 12 e and latitudes 37 7 12 n and 32 44 24 n fig 2 rainfall in this region varies and relatively increases in the east and north sides rainfall generally reaches the threshold of 400 mm in the west 700 mm in the center and 1000 mm in the east while the rainfall rate varies between 600 and 1000 mm in the coastal part between 400 and 600 mm in the highlands and is 100 mm in the sahara the impact of the rainfall on the dams operating conditions is shown in table e1 3 2 computation of cwqis all computations are conducted via a c module embedding the proposed algorithm with all related dea and owa linear programming models besides required libraries from ibm ilog cplex 12 4 using formulae 1 3 in appendix b we compute the values of the input variables p i ‚Ñì which are provided in table 2 the first step of the evaluation process consists of solving model ccr to calculate wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì for each dam ‚Ñì the results are presented in table 3 the average self efficiency based wqi is wqi 60 51 with almost 75 of the dams are inefficient with d16 apparently the worst besides among the twelve dams that scored wqi 100 only 10 dams are strongly efficient nevertheless the occurrence of multiple efficient dams signifies that model ccr fails to achieve full ranking of the dams as none of the strongly efficient dams can be declared best the recourse to ce evaluation of the dams is one of the best ways to address the latter insufficiency model mra is solved 46 times for each dam ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 4 7 to produce the matrix of ce scores Œ¥ which due to space is presented in table e2 using the model wp we generate owa weights for dm s subjectivity levels selected between 0 55 and 0 67 the vectors of owa weights are given in table 4 using the formula 10 the composite water quality indices cwq i m œï m are calculated for all dams m under different subjectivity levels table 5 shows the values of cwq i m œï m along the corresponding rank positions œÅ m for m 1 47 the results in table 5 reveal that the average cwqis vary between 42 96 and 49 06 which appear much lower than wqi 60 51 found using ccr model the higher value of wqi is mainly due to the lack of discrimination reflected through a high number of strongly efficient dams 10 dams conversely the cwqi enables discerning a single dam namely kissir d45 as the best in addition kissir is the only dam among the former 10 dams that preserves its status of strongly efficient dam even under the ce framework with cwq i 45 1 no matters the dm s subjectivity level as shown in table 2 the values of the input variables associated to kissir s water quality parameters reach 0 which supports the latter results subsequently full ranking is accomplished for all dams without any tight rank with bougara d16 declared worst water quality dam moreover it is visible through the highlighted rows in table 5 that 9 out of 10 strongly efficient dams do effectively occupy all the leading positions regardless of the value of as such the proposed approach is not only able to fully rank the dams but also upholds intimately their efficiency status meanwhile the rankings of nearly 77 of the dams seem indifferent to while the remaining dams swap positions within close ranges accordingly the variation of the subjectivity level does not affect the structure of the ranking patterns which advocates strongly in favour of the robustness of the cwqi 3 3 comparison of cwqi to related wqis an important issue that needs to be examined is how the proposed cwqi compares to other existing metrics the cwqi being a data driven index its outcomes can only be compared to indices that share at least a similar data background thus approaches that may require experts opinions such as ahp topsis and ahp dea cannot be adopted for the evaluation of the cwqi in addition to the ccr wqi of soltani et al 2021b two more data driven wqis are calculated by using ccme 2001 and weighted arithmetic wa cude 2001 the results are presented in table 6 with the last column showing the ranking pattern associated to cwqi since the wqis produced by these methods are based on different dimensions the comparison of related results is restricted to the ranking patterns looking at these patterns it is visible that ccme wa and ccr wqi all rank d45 and d46 as leading dams and hence agree with cwqi to declare these dams water quality as the best a similar agreement among these approaches can be observed for the worst water quality found in dams d14 and d16 in 36 of the cases ccme s rank positions are very close to cwqi s with gaps of 3 positions or less this proportion is approximately 32 for wa and it does exceed 53 for the ccr wqi the latter proportion is not surprising given that ccr wqi and cwqi use similar input variables and share dea modeling background the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae shown in table 7 are used for the overall evaluation in a data sample of 47 dams rmse ccme 11 46 and rmse wa 12 26 may suggest that cwqi s ranking patterns are overall unlike those of the conventional methods though there are close ranks for almost one third of the dams again such a conclusion is rather obvious due to methodological backgrounds that are completely different however no plausible conclusion can be stated before conducting an appropriate statistical test with m refereeing to method ccme wa or ccr we need to answer the question do the ranking patterns of the 47 dams indicate that cwqi and the wqi produced by method m are significantly different to substantiate the significance of such a difference we conduct a wilcoxon signed rank test for each pair of ranking patterns cwqi m for the following nil hypothesis ho cwqi and method m produce identical ranking patterns the results of the statistical tests are displayed in table 8 the large p values shown in the last row of the table suggest that at a significance level Œ± 0 05 p Œ± i e there is not enough evidence to reject ho regardless of which method m is used as a reference consequently we can conclude that statistically there is not a significant difference between the ranking patterns produced by cwqi and any method m such a result aligns cwqi with known data driven indices 3 4 estimation of required improvement in addition to its discriminatory potential cwqi is also a powerful tool for measuring the required water quality improvement per factor at a given dam consider dam ‚Ñì defined with physicochemical parameters x i ‚Ñì i 1 10 with cwq i ‚Ñì its water quality index computed under the water treatment conditions that are duly reflected by the dm s optimism level Œ± to improve the quality of dam ‚Ñì s water to the level of the benchmark i e d45 its physicochemical parameters x i ‚Ñì must be altered by the corresponding slack values s i ‚Ñì 1 c w q i ‚Ñì p i ‚Ñì for i 1 10 table 9 shows these values for all dams at an optimism level Œ± 0 67 consider for instance gargar dam d4 the concentration of parameter ts viz may require a reduction of 86 17 mg l to enable the water quality of d4 to be comparable to the benchmark i e d45 similarly reductions of 0 02 0 05 0 06 1 46 8 62 and 0 17 mg l respectively are required from x 54 x 64 x 74 x 84 x 94 and x 10 4 on the other hand x 3 4 e dissolved oxygen should be increased by 7 5 under such improvement settings the water quality of gargar dam becomes as good as the benchmark d45 4 water quality ranges instead of adopting the traditional method which assigns the dams to water quality ranges that are preset arbitrarily we suggest deriving these ranges through k means clustering analysis macqueen 1967 this approach incorporates all the cwqis obtained for different optimism levels in order to distinguish five rank categories namely excellent good medium marginal and poor given a set of k 47 dams where each dam ‚Ñì is represented with a vector of cwqis that are computed for different optimism levels the implementation of the k means algorithm yields the clusters depicted in 2d plot fig 3 the clustering process is performed under r environment although the cwqi dataset is 4 dimensional the function fviz cluster factoextra package is used to easily visualize k means clusters in a 2d plot the dams are represented according to the coordinates of the first two principal components dim1 and dim2 which result from a principal component analysis pca on the original cwqi dataset fig 3 shows that the latent variables dim1 and dim2 explain together all the variations in the data set i e 98 2 100 table 10 provides the water quality categorization of 47 selected dams where dams listed in the 2nd 5th 1st 4th and 3rd clusters are ranked excellent good medium marginal and poor water quality respectively the 2nd cluster contains d45 and d46 selected as excellent dams with cwqi 45 100 100 100 100 and cwqi 46 92 74 95 04 97 35 98 27 the 5th cluster involves dams d22 d23 d26 d27 d29 d31 and d34 that have a good water quality with cwqis ranging between 66 26 and 91 22 the 1st cluster includes medium water quality dams i e d04 d07 d10 d13 d15 d17 d18 d20 d28 d32 d38 d40 d41 d42 d43 and d44 the marginal category comprises dams that are listed in 4th cluster viz d02 d03 d08 d09 d21 d24 d25 d30 d35 d37 d39 and d47 whose cwqis range from 25 91 to 45 58 the remaining dams such as d01 d05 d06 d11 d12 d14 d16 d19 d33 and d36 are grouped in the 3rd cluster which corresponds to poor water quality category interestingly the excellent group is represented by only two dams because of the enhanced discrimination conferred to the ranking process by the dea ce approach as such the proposed water quality ranges appear more robust due certainly to 1 the discriminatory power brought by the ce evaluation to the cwqis allowing full ranking of the dams besides 2 the flexibility of k means analysis which enables more than one ranking pattern to be integrated under the same clustering framework 5 spatial distribution of the cwqis the spatial distribution of the cwqis on the map of the current study s area shown in fig 4 is important to depict the water quality variations over the hydrographic basins and identify the most vulnerable sites at the regional level the cwqi averages per watershed are cwqi occ 25 47 cwqi cz 52 66 cwqi csm 53 66 and cwqi ahs 58 99 with occ basin revealed as the poorest water quality zone and ahs basin as the best fig 4 shows that the dams which are classified under the good water quality range spread over the center of the study area with 57 located in ahs watershed and 43 in cz watershed meanwhile the best water quality dams namely boussiaba and kissir are located in the eastern part of the country specifically in the csm watershed the majority of dams with the lowest cwqis are located in the western zone where natural processes and anthropogenic activities are known sources of pollution and subsequently poor water quality soltani et al 2021b for instance fergoug d01 bouhanifia d02 cheurfa d05 and sarno d11 are dams located in the macta sub basin with limited water capacity which recorded the lowest cwqis in the sub basin inhabitants of peripheral big cities such as sa√Øda mascara and sidi bel abbes may therefore not only experience a water scarcity problem but also a serious double crisis of quantity quality as there is simply no other reservoir in the sub basin with acceptable water quality that can compensate for perceived shortcomings 6 sensitivity of cwqi to seasonal variations in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the cwqis to potential water changes that may result from seasonal fluctuations seasonal indices have been calculated for each dam over the study period 11 months considering three possible scenarios 1 the favourable scenario which corresponds to the optimism level 0 67 where the dm expects the operating conditions to be the best for achieving water quality improvement 2 the unfavourable scenario which reflects the most pessimistic attitude of the dm with 0 33 here the minimum requirements for water treatment are not met 3 the neutral scenario that portrays decision making under an indifferent stance 0 50 using the proposed methodology a cwqi is computed for each month under each of the latter operating conditions four seasons i e winter w spring sp summer su and fall f are duly considered starting from january to november with each season involving three months except fall assuming that the monthly cwqis are equally likely within each season the seasonal cwqi can be derived by averaging that season s monthly cwqis the results are presented in table e3 the average seasonal cwqis vary between 23 32 and 32 25 regardless of the season or the operating scenario moreover the number of dams whose seasonal cwqis fall over 50 does not exceed 12 25 53 11 23 40 8 17 02 and 9 19 15 depending on whether it is winter spring summer and fall season respectively these values unveil that poor quality is the predominating characteristic of the tellian region s water in algeria fig 5 provides a closer illustration of the average seasonal indices on a regional scale the regional distribution of the dams is as follows west d01 d17 centre d18 d35 and east d36 d47 fig 5 shows that the best water quality is concentrated in the central region with average seasonal cwqis ranging between 28 04 in winter and 46 04 in spring under unfavourable and favourable operating conditions respectively although the average values in fig 5 may also suggest that the worst water quality is found in the western region it is important to note that the water of gargar d04 is definitely the best in both spring and summer marking seasonal picks of 99 72 and 100 respectively interestingly gargar is the only dam that achieves a steady value of 100 for all its summer seasonal cwqis meanwhile taksebt d29 and meurad d32 two dams of the central region are declared the best in winter and fall with seasonal cwqis hitting 96 26 and 98 22 respectively regardless of the operating scenario in contrast the water quality of dahmouni d14 is classified the poorest throughout the year apart from the fall season where the water of bougara d16 becomes definitely the most vulnerable the ranking patterns of the dams over the four seasons are given in table e4 overall the seasonal cwqis do not necessarily exhibit uniform ranking patterns for the dams over different seasons and regions fig 6 presents the average deviation of a dam s rank position between successive seasons here it appears that the ranking gap is much deeper when shifting from and to the winter season with an average gap of approximately 9 positions which may reach a maximum of 29 rank positions as the case of deurdeur d24 in addition no more than six dams do preserve the previous season s rank no matters the operating scenario on the other hand the ranking patterns look more stable for shifts occurring from and to the summer season where the ranking gap does not exceed 3 positions for almost 66 of the dams under both favourable and unfavourable scenarios thus there is no doubt that cwqi is sensitive to seasonal variability which revolves around winter and summer in the study area these two seasons are rainy and sunny respectively with most of the rains occurring in fall and winter per se the amount of seasonal rainfall seems determinant for water quality as it largely affects water inflows to dams such a correlation is more emphasized in the regional distribution of average seasonal cwqis discussed above see fig 5 in fact the rains are scarcer in the western region ranging between 330 and 400 mm year which may justify the poor water quality in the central and eastern regions the rains are more abundant falling in the range of 600 to 800 mm year and often lead to a better water quality to better assess the influence of water inflow to dams on the dam s water quality the filling rate of each dam is calculated see table e5 based on the dam s capacity and filling rate presented in table e5 boukourdane d23 dam has definitely low filling rates all over the study period not exceeding 43 84 in the best case however boukourdane is constantly ranked among the top ten dams for its water quality during all seasons on the other hand beni haroun d43 is considered the largest dam in algeria with a nominal capacity that is always exceeded through the phenomenon of spillage soltani et al 2021a even though beni haroun ranks from 21st to 33rd these two examples provide enough evidence that the quality of the water sources that feed the dams plays a key role in identifying its quality regardless of the quantity of water 7 conclusion the assessment process of water quality using large sets of physicochemical parameters has long been a major challenge for water resource management specialists thus a substantial effort has been dedicated to develop managerial tools that are not only sufficiently encompassing but also robust enough to ensure regular and reliable monitoring of water quality tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 wqi is universally acknowledged as one of these tools this study introduced a new wqi termed as cwqi which enables to fully discern the quality of a set of water sources and subsequently identify the best water the cwqis are ingeniously computed through a methodological approach that combines dea ce paradigm with the aggregation features of owa the dea model uses as input variables which are duly derived from the observed physicochemical parameters using 10 physicochemical parameters the proposed methodology was applied on 47 water samples distributed among the most important algerian hydrographic basins i e occ cz ahs and csm as a result kissir emerges as the best water quality source as opposed to bougara which is the worst meanwhile the occ basin has been identified as the poorest water quality zone and ahs basin as the best the results have revealed that the water quality ranking patterns are indifferent to the level of subjectivity of the dms which supports the robustness of the cwqis as benchmarking tools although the sensitivity analysis has shown possible relation between the cwqi and seasonal variations further investigations may be necessary to better identify the most significant factors that may influence this relationship including dam s capacity and filling rate multi period indices moghaddas et al 2022 could be considered as new alternatives for water quality assessment credit authorship contribution

appendix a water quality standards water quality standards wqs describe the ideal concentration ranges of physicochemical and biological parameters that define a water sample soltani et al 2020 the values of these standards also known as guidelines vary depending on the parameters as well as the water usage tiyasha et al 2020 for example guidelines for drinking water are not the same as those for irrigation water recreational purpose water e g swimming and so on protecting human health and aquatic life from waterborne diseases and possible contamination remains the ultimate reason that motivated world organizations like who food and agriculture organization fao and european commission ec to establishing wqs accordingly if the analysis of a water sample exposes parameter values that do not fullfill the assigned wqs water treatment must be carried out following the degree of deviation the wqs adopted for the present study cluster physicochemical parameters into four 04 quality categories i e excellent acceptable poor and unsuitable conforming with the standards of who 2017 ec 2014 and agence nationale des resources hydrauliques anrh 2009 as shown in table a the excellent range represents the best quality of water which can be consumed securely while simple advanced and very advanced treatment processes are necessary for acceptable poor and unsuitable ranges respectively to meet the required water quality appendix b input variables under a standard dea based water evaluation framework it is convenient to regard a dam ‚Ñì as a dmu that employs n resources i in quantities x i ‚Ñì for i 1 n per se each value x i ‚Ñì becomes formally one the dmu s n input variables and hence it must conform to the axiomatic rule less is better cook et al 2014 meanwhile it is well established that the desirable values of x i ‚Ñì adhere to water quality standards see table a that are specific to the water quality factor i as examples let s look at the rows total solid ts and dissolved oxygen do in table a there is no doubt that ts can be seen as an input provided that its desirable values fulfil the less is better rule nonetheless the standard ranges of do reveal that the higher the values of do the better which definitely violates the latter rule thus x i ‚Ñì cannot be adopted as input of a standard dea model for all n water quality factors such inconvenience is rather complicated by the fact that the preferences for x i ‚Ñì per category unsuitable poor good excellent are set into different ranges preventing the adoption of a unified preference context the category range associated to any water quality factor i is necessarily embodied in one of the intervals Œª i Œª i Œº i or Œº i with Œª i and Œº i the interval s lower and upper limits respectively in practice managers do usually set targets in the light of the on hand resources the more resources the more ambitious the target in a water treatment facility targets are related to the quality level of the after treatment water assuming that there are no resource limitations excellent water quality should certainly be the normal target which cannot be achieved unless the measured values x i ‚Ñì of all water quality factors do fall simultaneously within the corresponding excellent category ranges œâ i for i 1 n though such a scenario is likely to occur for a limited number of water quality factors the x i ‚Ñì values of most factors will probably fall away here we define a new input variable p i ‚Ñì that measures the potential of the treatment process to shift the x i ‚Ñì value of water quality factor i inside œâ i for i 1 n with the assumption that x i ‚Ñì œâ i it is obvious that the nearer x i ‚Ñì to one of œâ i s limits the more potential for a better water quality depending on the current value of x i ‚Ñì the input variable p i ‚Ñì can be computed as follows œâ i Œª i and x i ‚Ñì Œª i p i ‚Ñì Œª i x i ‚Ñì Œµ 1 œâ i Œª i Œº i i and x i ‚Ñì Œª i p i ‚Ñì Œª i x i ‚Ñì Œµ x i ‚Ñì Œº i p i ‚Ñì x i ‚Ñì Œº i Œµ 2 œâ i Œº i and x i ‚Ñì Œº i p i ‚Ñì x i ‚Ñì Œº i Œµ 3 p i ‚Ñì Œµ defines the situation where x i ‚Ñì œâ i no matters the water quality parameter the most striking feature of the variable p i ‚Ñì is that it satisfies perfectly the axiomatic rule less is better of a standard dea input variable appendix c self efficiency dea model regardless of the preference features of the original water quality factors a dam ‚Ñì can be treated as a dmu that consumes inputs p i ‚Ñì for i 1 n and ‚Ñì 1 k the natural objective of each dam ‚Ñì being the minimization of its inputs the following ccr model charnes cooper and rhodes 1978 is implemented to estimate e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì ccr e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì max Œ≤ subject to i 1 n p i ‚Ñì Œ± i ‚Ñì 1 4 Œ≤ i 1 n p ik Œ± i ‚Ñì 0 k 1 k 5 Œ± i ‚Ñì 0 i 1 n e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì is the self efficiency score of dam ‚Ñì while Œ± i ‚Ñì denotes the weights that dam ‚Ñì allocates to its input factors p i ‚Ñì i 1 n towards achieving ‚Ñì s best self evaluation score e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì oral et al 2014 oukil et al 2016 sow et al 2016 dam ‚Ñì is confirmed efficient if e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 else it is inefficient for e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì 1 oukil and zekri 2021 at this level of the methodological reasoning the water quality self efficiency index of dam ‚Ñì is denoted wq i ‚Ñì so that wq i ‚Ñì e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì in the advent of several dams ‚Ñì with wq i ‚Ñì 100 e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì may not be an appropriate wqi as full discrimination among the dams becomes practically impossible i e none of the efficient water samples can be qualified as best although such a categorization is required for benchmarking purposes in other words the results do not inform practitioners businesses and the general public regarding the best water i e the benchmark such a phenomenon is typical to standard models like ccr surprisingly none of the former dea based studies has mentioned this issue in spite of its severe occurrence in all pertaining cases for instance the proportions of efficient wells reported in kavurmaci and √ºst√ºn 2016 is 39 22 suggesting that all related waters can be considered as valid benchmarks which is rather unrealistic although the water assessment process gains more objectivity with the introduction of the new input variable the lack of discrimination between the water sources may undermine the usefulness of the wqis that are produced via ccr model oukil et al 2021 per se potential occurrence of multiple efficient dams is definitely a critical issue for the decision process which has not been discussed yet in the water management literature to alleviate such an insufficiency the best recourse is undeniably dea ce sexton et al 1986 appendix d cross efficiency dea model under a dea cross efficiency setting each dam is able to assess its peers m with its own optimal vector of weights Œ± ‚Ñì Œ± 1 ‚Ñì Œ± 2 ‚Ñì Œ± n ‚Ñì oukil and govindaluri 2020 nonetheless as a linear program ccr may have alternative optimal solutions i e different weights Œ± ‚Ñì can be produced for the same objective e ‚Ñì ‚Ñì as a result many ce scores are possible for each peer evaluation leading to more than one ranking pattern to tackle such a drawback secondary goal models have been devised e g doyle and green 1994 jahanshahloo et al 2011 liang et al 2008a liang et al 2008b ram√≥n et al 2010 ruiz and sirvent 2012 wang and chin 2010a wang and chin 2010b wang and

resonated appreciative mra model oral et al 2015 is one of these models particularly known for enabling peer evaluation with separate sets of weights whenever possible the mra model writes as follows
