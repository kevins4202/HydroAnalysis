broth at 37 c ph 8 under sequential aerobic microaerophilic conditions for 72 h docking by biosolve it software was used to calculate docking score identify active site residues and molecular interactions between laccase and azoreductase of both bacteria with dye docking score and decolorization percentage were assessed comparatively uv vis spectroscopy hplc ftir and gc ms were performed for biodegradation analysis laccase veratryl alcohol oxidase and azoreductase enzymes were assayed docking score of 31 9921 18 1289 and 27 2792 2 5185 kj mol for laccase and azoreductase while 91 96

with decolorization percentage biodegradation analysis supported biotransformation of dye into simpler products enzyme studies revealed high expression of dye degrading enzymes in both non acclimatized bacteria on exposure to azo dyes compared to controls it was suggested that a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 can be used for efficient decolorization and biodegradation of azo dye containing textile wastewater thus an advanced approach consisting of an in silico preliminary screening and subsequent bacterial dye degradation is validated for an ecofriendly economical and time efficient bioremediation to reuse treated water keywords decolorization biodegradation non adapted bacteria azo dye docking gc ms 1 introduction azo dyes contain one or more azo bonds nn along with aromatic groups and can be classified as acidic basic direct disperse mordant reactive and solvent dyes they are widely used in textile cosmetics food and paper printing industries 1 textile industry is one of the oldest and largest employers in india commercially azo dyes are majorly used in these textile industries as they are cost effective versatile with broad range of colours easy to manufacture and resistant to damage these dyes are stable at different ph range high temperature and light conditions 2 but they harm aquatic plants animals crops and humans as they are highly toxic mutagenic and recalcitrant 3 colour removal and treatment of harmful by products is significant for reuse of treated water bioremediation techniques intend to use natural processes to recycle water a precious resource and prevent pollution by destroying the contaminants of anthropogenic activities permanently 4 biological decolorization and degradation of azo dyes is advantageous as it is an eco friendly efficient and cheaper option with lower sludge and higher efficiency for a wide range of azo dyes 5 use of bacterial systems for degradation is of particular interest due to their ease of synthesis maintenance and an inherent capacity to survive in stressful conditions and break down the dyes into non toxic products attributed to the presence of various oxidative and reductive enzymes for biotransformation a hydrophila and l sphaericus have been isolated from the soil and water exposed to textile industry wastewaters in various studies 6 7 bacteria mediated degradation of azo dyes is generally non specific and faster 8 the recalcitrant textile dyes which remain stable in the environment can be decolorized by strains with high degradation and tolerance capacity 9 the use of pure cultures ensures reproducibility and efficient interpretation of experimental data compared to consortium cell growth takes place under higher aeration due to shaking while bacterial decolorization is reported to occur in microaerophilic or static conditions often initiated by enzymatic reduction of azo bonds 10 microaerophilic state provides the benefits of both aerobic and anaerobic process and aromatic amines obtained by dye decolorization are further degraded and mineralized in microaerophilic phase 11 remazole brilliant violet 5r degraded in microaerophilic conditions due to bacterial respiration linked to electron transport chain reducing the azo bond by azoreductase followed by desulfonation and deamination by lignin peroxidase and laccase into non harmful metabolites 12 use of single bacterial cultures for azo dye degradation in anoxic conditions has revealed promising outcomes 13 azo dye decolorization was reported by some non adapted microorganisms which did not originate in textile effluent polluted soil and water thereby indicating that dye degrading enzymatic genes may exist innately and over express in presence of toxicants causing their degradation 14 15 hence well studied and easily available non adapted microbes with inherent dye degrading capability are suitable contenders for prospective treatment of textile dye containing wastewater to identify ecologically sustainable strains for application at field level scientists worldwide are focusing on the use of in silico methods prior to in situ or ex situ biodegradation of toxicants 16 the systems biology approach for microbial bioremediation aids in reducing the time and cost incurred in the preliminary screening for identifying feasible strains for effective treatment of textile effluents molecular docking is applicable to optimize and understand the significance and interaction between protein and ligands 17 amino acid residues interacting between enzymes and dyes can be predicted by docking dynamic simulation predicted interaction of azrc of bacillus sp b29 with some azo dyes 18 important residues in active site of fmn dependent nadh azoreductase of e coli were predicted by studying enzyme dye affinity through docking 19 azrc mutants with high dye affinity were created by docking and could be verified real time for their dye degrading ability 20 recently a combinatorial approach of in silico enzyme dye docking studies followed by biodegradation of textile azo dyes by a hydrophila sk16 was positively validated 21 22 the main objective of the present study was to validate a novel approach of amalgamating bioinformatics and bacterial remediation using non native strains for decolorization and degradation of azo dyes it was focused on the application of two bacteria aeromonas hydrophila and lysinibacillus sphaericus for decolorization of a textile azo dye drimaren red cl 5b commonly known as reactive red 195 in silico study viz molecular docking and active site residue analysis were performed to investigate the interaction of dye with oxidoreductive enzymes like laccase and azoreductase present in the bacteria which are responsible for dye degradation and identifying the amino acid residues involved in enzyme dye binding this was followed by actual biodegradation of the dye by the textile effluent non adapted bacterial strains a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 respectively the dock scores were comparatively correlated with the wetlab studies viz percentage of decolorization enzymatic analysis was performed to compare the presence of the oxidoreductive enzymes before and after decolorization biodegradation and biotransformation of dye by these cultures was further confirmed by uv vis analysis uv vis high performance liquid chromatography hplc fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms based on the gc ms mass spectral data degradation pathways were proposed for the breakdown of drimaren red cl 5b by both the non autochthonous bacteria thus an advanced and cost effective in silico cum in vivo approach was validated for treatment of azo dye containing textile wastewater using non adapted strains eliminating the need for time consuming and cumbersome preliminary screening for future bioremediation

1 8 was used to perform docking to calculate docking score and identify best docking poses for interactions between ligand and target proteins the docked ligand target complexes were analyzed carefully to identify the interactions and binding affinities the interactions between laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus and the dye molecule were analyzed using poseview of leadit 2 4 comparative study between docking and decolorization the docking analysis of drimaren red cl 5b with laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus in terms of dock score was compared with percentage of decolorization obtained by uv vis spectroscopy to corroborate that in silico outcome was comparative with in vivo studies further hplc ftir and gc ms confirmed

docking and study of ligand receptor interactions of drimaren red cl 5b with laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus the binding mode molecular interaction with active site residues docking scores and amino acid residues in the binding pocket were investigated drimaren red cl 5b docked within the active site of laccase of a hydrophila with binding energies of 31 9921 kj mol interactions were favoured by electrostatic and hydrogen bonds between his38 his70 glu162 arg229 arg236 residues of the enzyme and these dye molecules the hydrophobic interactions were contributed by his38 gln68 his70 asp105 cys106 trp126 phe161 tyr228 and arg229 docking between these dyes with azoreductase of a hydrophila yielded docking score of 18 1289 kj mol electrostatic and hydrogen bonds

score of 27 2792 kj mol electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions by his32 cys34 cys110 ala242 arg244 and non bonded hydrophobic interactions by his32 thr33 cys34 his65 met84 asp109 cys110 gly129 trp130 leu164 phe169 tyr236 arg244 with drimaren red cl 5b lastly azoreductase of l sphaericus illustrated binding energy of 2 5185 kj mol electrostatic and hydrogen bonds by arg11 ile15 lys18 trp93 and the dyes and hydrophobic interaction by arg11 gly14 ile15 lys18 pro91 trp93 his178 asn179 ile189 were observed table 3 in silico analysis viz homology modeling docking and active site analysis for laccase and azoreductase with various xenobiotics including toxic dyes has been performed in earlier studies 20 31 3 2 enzyme analysis degradation of dyes in bacterial cells occurs in the presence of certain biotransformation enzymes these enzymes indicate the extent of biodegradation of target xenobiotics 32 the specific enzymes involved an increase or decrease in their activities as well as the dye structure affects the rate of decolorization table 4 depicted that the enzymatic activities of veratryl alcohol oxidase laccase and azoreductase were significantly increased after 24 h for a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 respectively relative to the pure cultures thus the enzyme activities of oxidative as well as reductive enzymes in the treated samples were observed to be more than control these enzymes have been reported previously for their role in biodegradation of textile dyes 33 34 3 3 correlation between in silico and in vivo analysis it was observed that the decolorization percentage was higher for a hydrophila mtcc 1739 compared to l sphaericus mtcc 9523 in compliance with the bioinformatic studies which demonstrated docking score of former being higher than latter table 5 docking score was associated with percentage of decolorization reporting a directly proportional relationship in a similar study 21 khadijah et al identified 9 bacteria capable of degrading a wide spectrum of dyes out of 1540 isolates after several isolation and screening steps 35 apart from new isolates use of existing strains for breakdown of dyes will increase the efficiency of microbiological dye degradation in the future as an attractive cost and time saving option 36 organisms with an ability to adapt to conditions similar to the textile wastewater can aid in its decolorization irrespective of its origin 37 computationally predicted xenobiotics were validated as potential targets for laccase from trametes versicolor an ecofriendly and time saving advanced remediation technique combining computer based screening of xenobiotics with experimental validation was suggested 38 hence application of in silico preliminary screening prior to microbial dye degradation paves way for cost and time effective bioremediation process 3 4 analysis of decolorization and degradation products the efficiency of a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 to decolorize drimaren red cl 5b dye was studied via change in intensity of absorption peak by measuring optical density at λmax 520 nm till 72 h fig 1 the absorption spectra of drimaren red cl 5b 100 mg l 1 of control dye sample was characterized by a peak at 520 nm for red color and used to monitor the decolorization significant reduction in the absorbance of dye treated by both species with increasing incubation time was observed signifying cleavage and transformation of dye chromophore resulting in decolorization the cultures were subjected to shaking 120 rpm for 24 h which allowed the optimal growth of bacteria followed by microaerophilic condition static for next 48 h till 72 h for degradation of dye by oxidoreductive enzymes it was observed that the dye was decolorized 59 82 85 32 and 91 96 by a hydrophila mtcc 1739 while 15 53 82 52 and 88 35 by l sphaericus mtcc 9523 at 24 48 72 h incubation respectively table 5 golden yellow her showed 91 decolorization by b laterosporus under sequential aerobic microaerophilic treatment 39 differences in decolorization may be due to variation in the metabolic function of bacterial cultures and their interaction with the chemical dye structure 40 bacterial growth takes place under initial aerobic conditions due to shaking increasing the cell biomass decolorization occurs due to the reduction of azo bonds and further degradation in anoxic environment under static conditions by oxidoreductive enzymes of both the aerobic as well as facultative anaerobic bacteria the microaerophilic process is advantageous as the molecular oxygen removes toxic aromatic amines by converting them into non toxic products 41 the decolorization of textile azo dyes by a hydrophila mtcc1739 and l sphaericus mtcc9523 observed in the present study was compared to the previously reported bacterial isolates across different geographical areas table 6 it was observed that the decolorization efficiency of textile effluent non adapted strains in this study was comparable to the adapted strains in other studies this clearly supported the use of non autochthonous strains as good candidates for textile dye bioremediation the hplc analysis of control drimaren red cl 5b dye sample showed a major peak at retention time of 2 377 min and two minor peaks at 2 494 and 1 618 min corresponding to the retention time of pure reactive dye fig 2 a when the dye was decolorized by a hydrophila mtcc 1739 intensity of peak at retention time of 2 372 min decreased and new peak was observed at retention time of 2 527 min due to the degradation of parent dye fig 2b decolorization by l sphaericus mtcc 9523 lead to decrease in peak intensity at 2 445 min and new peaks at 1 631 and 3 011 min which indicate that dye has degraded into smaller compounds fig 2c these variations in the hplc chromatogram support biotransformation and biodegradation of drimaren red cl 5b into smaller compounds by both these organisms due to change in pattern of the peaks as well as absorbance sahasrabudhe et al reported that hplc profile of rr 195 decolorized by m glutamicus ncim 2168 showed peaks at retention time of 2 56 and 2 78 min while the control peaks showed retention time of 1 95 and 2 25 min indicating breakdown of dye to form low molecular weight products 52 the significant differences in the ftir spectra of drimaren red cl 5b control and decolorized products indicate biodegradation of complex dye into simpler metabolites the control dye shows specific peaks in the frequency region for functional groups peak at 1621 12 cm 1

indicated sulfur containing nature of dye the peaks at 1211 68 cm 1 and 1041 47 cm 1 are characteristic of so3 and co respectively fig 3 a absence of peak for azo bond in ftir spectra of drimaren red cl 5b treated with a hydrophila mtcc 1739 indicated breaking of the azo bond in the dye peaks observed at 3402 53 cm 1 for nh stretching in amides 2935 67 cm 1 and 2962 83 cm 1 for ch stretching 1650 25 cm 1 for cn stretching 1454 32 cm 1 for cc ring stretching 1410 20 cm 1 for oh vibrations in phenols 1336 96 cm 1 for no2 stretching in aromatic nitro compounds 1243 22 cm 1 for so 1106 47 cm 1 for co 615 76 cm 1 for cs and 539 54 cm 1 for cn stretching fig 3b the ftir spectrum of metabolites extracted after drimaren red cl 5b was treated with l sphaericus mtcc 9523 showed a sharp peak at 1650 87 cm 1 for no stretching in aromatic intermediates supporting the formation of naphthalene peaks at 3417 92 cm 1 for nh stretching of secondary amides 1412 09 cm 1 for so stretching 1317 09 cm 1 for oh bond vibration 1210 65 cm 1 and 1055 32 cm 1 for co stretching in phenols absence of any primary amine group peak in 1630 1575 cm 1 range support the cleavage of azo bonds the peaks at 2853 31 cm 1 2923 02 cm 1 and 2959 40 cm 1 correspond to ch stretching fig 3c aravind et al 2016 used a hybrid electro oxidation cum biodegradation method for reactive red 195 and reactive orange 105 where a consortium of naphthalene degrading bacteria cleaved and mineralized aromatic intermediates into simpler organic acids and aldehydes 53 in ftir analysis significant variation in functional groups of the dyes and real textile effluent after the combined treatment process was observed gc ms analysis of degradation products of drimaren red cl 5b dye indicated formation of low molecular weight metabolites confirming degradation of the dye by a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 the degradation pathways of drimaren red cl 5b by these species were proposed based on mass to charge

the degradation of a commonly used textile azo dye drimaren red cl 5b also known as reactive red 195 was investigated these bacteria were not isolated from textile dye contaminated areas yet they demonstrated noteworthy potential for decolorization of the azo dye in combined shaking static conditions hence these textile effluent non adapted bacterial strains have been reported as highly efficient resource for treatment of textile azo dye containing wastewater under a sequential aerobic microaerophilic environment decolorization analysis corroborated the docking studies in silico techniques like docking can aid in large scale screening of bacterial strains to select the best decolorizer thus a combinatorial remediation approach comprising theoretical in silico techniques and successive microbiological validation has been projected to decrease the time and expenditure required for experimental screening these results substantiate the innovative use of bioinformatic tools for identification of easily accessible textile effluent non adapted strains enhancing the safety cost and time efficiency of bacterial decolorization and degradation of azo dye containing textile wastewater the future prospects include transforming laboratory research to real time treatment of textile industry wastewater the in silico studies comprising analysis of azo dye degrading proteins of any organism modeling and enzyme dye docking studies could be used to construct a dynamic computational interface for virtually selecting best species available in the vicinity for actual microbial bioremediation finally the nature of degraded metabolites after treatment need to be investigated by microbial toxicity cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity analysis prior to large scale bioremediation

conditions due to bacterial respiration linked to electron transport chain reducing the azo bond by azoreductase followed by desulfonation and deamination by lignin peroxidase and laccase into non harmful metabolites 12 use of single bacterial cultures for azo dye degradation in anoxic conditions has revealed promising outcomes 13 azo dye decolorization was reported by some non adapted microorganisms which did not originate in textile effluent polluted soil and water thereby indicating that dye degrading enzymatic genes may exist innately and over express in presence of toxicants causing their degradation 14 15 hence well studied and easily available non adapted microbes with inherent dye degrading capability are suitable contenders for prospective treatment of textile dye containing wastewater to identify ecologically sustainable strains for application at field level scientists worldwide are focusing on the use of in silico methods prior to in situ or ex situ biodegradation of toxicants 16 the systems biology approach for microbial bioremediation aids in reducing the time and cost incurred in the preliminary screening for identifying feasible strains for effective treatment of textile effluents molecular docking is applicable to optimize and understand the significance and interaction between protein and ligands 17 amino acid residues interacting between enzymes and dyes can be predicted by docking dynamic simulation predicted interaction of azrc of bacillus sp b29 with some azo dyes 18 important residues in active site of fmn dependent nadh azoreductase of e coli were predicted by studying enzyme dye affinity through docking 19 azrc mutants with high dye affinity were created by docking and could be verified real time for their dye degrading ability 20 recently a combinatorial approach of in silico enzyme dye docking studies followed by biodegradation of textile azo dyes by a hydrophila sk16 was positively validated 21 22 the main objective of the present study was to validate a novel approach of amalgamating bioinformatics and bacterial remediation using non native strains for decolorization and degradation of azo dyes it was focused on the application of two bacteria aeromonas hydrophila and lysinibacillus sphaericus for decolorization of a textile azo dye drimaren red cl 5b commonly known as reactive red 195 in silico study viz molecular docking and active site residue analysis were performed to investigate the interaction of dye with oxidoreductive enzymes like laccase and azoreductase present in the bacteria which are responsible for dye degradation and identifying the amino acid residues involved in enzyme dye binding this was followed by actual biodegradation of the dye by the textile effluent non adapted bacterial strains a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 respectively the dock scores were comparatively correlated with the wetlab studies viz percentage of decolorization enzymatic analysis was performed to compare the presence of the oxidoreductive enzymes before and after decolorization biodegradation and biotransformation of dye by these cultures was further confirmed by uv vis analysis uv vis high performance liquid chromatography hplc fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms based on the gc ms mass spectral data degradation pathways were proposed for the breakdown of drimaren red cl 5b by both the non autochthonous bacteria thus an advanced and cost effective in silico cum in vivo approach was validated for treatment of azo dye containing textile wastewater using non adapted strains eliminating the need for time consuming and cumbersome preliminary screening for future bioremediation

1 8 was used to perform docking to calculate docking score and identify best docking poses for interactions between ligand and target proteins the docked ligand target complexes were analyzed carefully to identify the interactions and binding affinities the interactions between laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus and the dye molecule were analyzed using poseview of leadit 2 4 comparative study between docking and decolorization the docking analysis of drimaren red cl 5b with laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus in terms of dock score was

docking and study of ligand receptor interactions of drimaren red cl 5b with laccase and azoreductase of a hydrophila and l sphaericus the binding mode molecular interaction with active site residues docking scores and amino acid residues in the binding pocket were investigated drimaren red cl 5b docked within the active site of laccase of a hydrophila with binding energies of 31 9921 kj mol interactions were favoured by electrostatic and hydrogen bonds between his38 his70 glu162 arg229 arg236 residues of the enzyme and these dye molecules the hydrophobic interactions were contributed by his38 gln68 his70 asp105 cys106 trp126 phe161 tyr228 and arg229 docking between these dyes with azoreductase of a hydrophila yielded docking score of 18 1289 kj mol electrostatic and hydrogen bonds

gly129 trp130 leu164 phe169 tyr236 arg244 with drimaren red cl 5b lastly azoreductase of l sphaericus illustrated binding energy of 2 5185 kj mol electrostatic and hydrogen bonds by arg11 ile15 lys18 trp93 and the dyes and hydrophobic interaction by arg11 gly14 ile15 lys18 pro91 trp93 his178 asn179 ile189 were observed table 3 in silico analysis viz homology modeling docking and active site analysis for laccase and azoreductase with various xenobiotics including toxic dyes has been performed in earlier studies 20 31 3 2 enzyme analysis degradation of dyes in bacterial cells occurs in the presence of certain biotransformation enzymes these enzymes indicate the extent of biodegradation of target xenobiotics 32 the specific enzymes involved an increase or decrease in their activities as well as the dye structure affects the rate of decolorization table 4 depicted that the enzymatic activities of veratryl alcohol oxidase laccase and azoreductase were significantly increased after 24 h for a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 respectively relative to the pure cultures thus the enzyme activities of oxidative as well as reductive enzymes in the treated samples were observed to be more than control these enzymes have been reported previously for their role in biodegradation of textile dyes 33 34 3 3 correlation between in silico and in vivo analysis it was observed that the decolorization percentage was higher for a hydrophila mtcc 1739 compared to l sphaericus mtcc 9523 in compliance with the bioinformatic studies which demonstrated docking score of former being higher than latter table 5 docking score was associated with percentage of decolorization reporting a directly proportional relationship in a similar study 21 khadijah et al identified 9 bacteria capable of degrading a wide spectrum of dyes out of 1540 isolates after several isolation and screening steps 35 apart from new isolates use of existing strains for breakdown of dyes will increase the efficiency of microbiological dye degradation in the future as an attractive cost and time saving option 36 organisms with an ability to adapt to conditions similar to the textile wastewater can aid in its decolorization irrespective of its origin 37 computationally predicted xenobiotics were validated as potential targets for laccase from trametes versicolor an ecofriendly and time saving advanced remediation technique combining computer based screening of xenobiotics with experimental validation was suggested 38 hence application of in silico preliminary screening prior to microbial dye degradation paves way for cost and time effective bioremediation process 3 4 analysis of decolorization and degradation products the efficiency of a hydrophila mtcc 1739 and l sphaericus mtcc 9523 to decolorize drimaren red cl 5b dye was studied via change in intensity of absorption peak by measuring optical density at λmax 520 nm till 72 h fig 1 the absorption spectra of drimaren red cl 5b 100 mg l 1 of control dye sample was characterized by a peak at 520 nm for red color and used to monitor the decolorization significant reduction in the absorbance of dye treated by both species with increasing incubation time was observed signifying cleavage and transformation of dye chromophore resulting in decolorization the cultures were subjected to shaking 120 rpm for 24 h which allowed the optimal growth of bacteria followed by microaerophilic condition static for next 48 h till 72 h for degradation of dye by oxidoreductive enzymes it was observed that the dye was decolorized 59 82 85 32 and 91 96 by a hydrophila mtcc 1739 while 15 53 82 52 and 88 35 by l sphaericus mtcc 9523 at 24 48 72 h incubation respectively table 5 golden yellow her showed 91 decolorization by b laterosporus under sequential aerobic microaerophilic treatment 39 differences in decolorization may be due to variation in the metabolic function of bacterial cultures and their interaction with the chemical dye structure 40 bacterial growth takes place under initial aerobic conditions due to shaking increasing the cell biomass decolorization occurs due to the reduction of azo bonds and further degradation in anoxic environment under static conditions by oxidoreductive enzymes of both the aerobic as well as facultative anaerobic bacteria the microaerophilic process is advantageous as the molecular oxygen removes toxic aromatic amines by converting them into non toxic products 41 the decolorization of textile azo dyes by a hydrophila mtcc1739 and l sphaericus mtcc9523 observed in the present study was compared to the previously reported bacterial isolates across different geographical areas table 6 it was observed that the decolorization efficiency of textile effluent non adapted strains in this study was comparable to the adapted strains in other studies this clearly supported the use of non autochthonous strains as good candidates for textile dye bioremediation the hplc analysis of control drimaren red cl 5b dye sample showed a major peak at retention time of 2 377 min and two minor peaks at 2 494 and 1 618 min corresponding to the retention time of pure reactive dye fig 2 a when the dye was decolorized by a hydrophila mtcc 1739 intensity of peak at retention time of 2 372 min decreased and new peak was observed at retention time of 2 527 min due to the degradation of parent dye fig 2b decolorization by l sphaericus mtcc 9523 lead to decrease in peak intensity at 2 445 min and new peaks at 1 631 and 3 011 min which indicate that dye has degraded into smaller compounds fig 2c these variations in the hplc chromatogram support biotransformation and biodegradation of drimaren red cl 5b into smaller compounds by both these organisms due to change in pattern of the peaks as well as absorbance sahasrabudhe et al reported that hplc profile of rr 195 decolorized by m glutamicus ncim 2168 showed peaks at retention time of 2 56 and 2 78 min while the control peaks showed retention time of 1 95 and 2 25 min indicating breakdown of dye to form low molecular weight products 52 the significant differences in the ftir spectra of drimaren red cl 5b

indicated sulfur containing nature of dye the peaks at 1211 68 cm 1 and 1041 47 cm 1 are characteristic of so3 and co respectively fig 3 a absence of peak for azo bond in ftir spectra of drimaren red cl 5b treated with a hydrophila mtcc 1739 indicated breaking of the azo bond in the dye peaks observed at 3402 53 cm 1 for nh stretching in amides 2935 67 cm 1 and 2962 83 cm 1 for ch stretching 1650

co 615 76 cm 1 for cs and 539 54 cm 1 for cn stretching fig 3b the ftir spectrum of metabolites extracted after drimaren red cl 5b was treated with l sphaericus mtcc 9523 showed a sharp peak at 1650 87 cm 1 for no stretching in aromatic intermediates supporting the formation of naphthalene peaks at 3417 92 cm 1 for nh stretching of secondary amides 1412 09 cm 1 for so stretching 1317 09 cm 1 for oh bond vibration 1210 65 cm 1 and 1055 32 cm 1 for co stretching in phenols absence of any primary amine group peak in 1630 1575 cm 1 range support the cleavage of azo bonds the peaks at 2853 31 cm 1 2923 02 cm 1 and 2959 40 cm 1 correspond to ch stretching fig 3c aravind et al 2016 used a hybrid electro oxidation cum biodegradation method for reactive red 195 and reactive orange 105 where a consortium of naphthalene degrading bacteria cleaved and mineralized aromatic intermediates into simpler organic acids and aldehydes 53 in ftir analysis significant variation in functional groups of the dyes and real textile effluent after the combined treatment process was observed gc ms analysis of degradation products of drimaren red cl 5b dye indicated formation of low molecular weight

degradation products indicated that decolorization occurred by reduction mechanism 4 conclusions in the present study use of aeromonas hydrophila mtcc 1739 and lysinibacillus sphaericus mtcc 9523 for the degradation of a commonly used textile azo dye drimaren red cl 5b also known as reactive red 195 was investigated these bacteria were not isolated from textile dye contaminated areas yet they demonstrated noteworthy potential for decolorization of the azo dye in combined shaking static conditions hence these textile effluent non adapted bacterial strains have been reported as highly efficient resource for treatment of textile azo dye containing wastewater under a sequential aerobic microaerophilic environment decolorization analysis corroborated the docking studies in silico techniques like docking can aid in large scale screening of bacterial strains to select the best decolorizer thus a combinatorial remediation approach comprising theoretical in silico techniques and successive microbiological validation has been projected to decrease the time and expenditure required for experimental screening these results substantiate the innovative use of bioinformatic tools for identification of easily accessible textile effluent non adapted strains enhancing the safety cost and time efficiency of bacterial decolorization and degradation of azo dye containing textile wastewater the future prospects include transforming laboratory research to real time treatment of textile industry wastewater the in silico studies comprising analysis of azo dye degrading proteins of any organism modeling and enzyme dye docking studies could be used to construct a dynamic computational interface for virtually selecting best species available in the vicinity for actual microbial bioremediation finally the nature of degraded metabolites after treatment need to be investigated by microbial toxicity cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity analysis prior to large scale bioremediation

14591,a new aminophosphonic acid was synthesized by condensation of 4 4 propane 2 2 diylbis 4 1 phenylene bis oxy dianiline phosphorous acid and formaldehyde according to the moedritzer irani reaction the structure of the inhibitor was analyzed by 1h and 31p nmr ft ir mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry the new inhibitor presented high efficiency in a static condition on the model imitating water composition with respect to caco3 and caso4 deposits the crystal formation of caco3 and caso4 was investigated by scanning electronic microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the inhibitor obviously affected the procedure of crystal growth the morphology of the caco3 crystals in the absence of inhibitor showed a predominant content of rhombohedral crystals calcite whereas in the presence of inhibitor we could observe a mixture of calcite with acicular crystals aragonite and a small content of spherical crystals vaterite concerning caso4 crystals thin needles with a smooth surface were observed in the absence of the inhibitor which became thicker with many crystal defects in the presence of the inhibitor consequently the new aminophosphonic acid described here can be used as a potential scale inhibitor keywords scale inhibitor aminophosphonic acid calcium sulfate calcium carbonate 1 introduction the precipitation of insoluble or slightly soluble salts in steam generators boilers cooling towers pipes and other equipment used in water intensive processes is a serious problem deposits of alkaline earth ions in the form of carbonates and sulphates is of particular concern since these salts usually have a solubility that decreases with increasing temperature inverse solubility 1 can and üner 2 showed that the formation of salts begins at a temperature of 30 35 c and their deposit increases with that of temperature in addition this process is intensified with the evaporation of water it was previously described that many brines found in oil bearing strata of offshore reservoirs contain high concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions ba2 ca2 sr2 and mg2 3 during secondary oil recovery seawater containing so42 is injected into the reservoir to maintain pressure when the water reaches the oil well a solid precipitate is formed which blocks production tubing and can cause damage to the reservoir itself this problem is widely spread in the oil industry in kazakhstan mineralized water in oil fields reaches 20 80 4 in some cases mineralization reaches 220 250 g l which leads to high levels of salt deposits 5 an expensive solution to this problem is to decrease the sulphate concentration in the seawater by reverse osmosis prior to injection a far cheaper alternative is the use of chemicals these chemicals either prevent the mineral scale from forming or alter the precipitate to such an extent that the scale no longer presents a problem 6 9 the main conventional mechanisms for inhibiting scaling are chelation dispersion crystal distortion and threshold action 10 12 inorganic polyphosphates primarily tri polyphosphate and sodium hexa metaphosphate shmp have been widely used as scale inhibitors it is assumed that the active mechanism of shmp as an inhibitor is due to its adsorption onto the surface of caco3 microcrystals which hinders their growth and agglomeration the main significant disadvantage of inorganic polyphosphates is their low thermal stability leading to a loss of inhibitory properties a propensity to hydrolyse into orthophosphates with the formation of insoluble calcium salts and a low efficiency with respect to caso4 entering productive horizons with fresh water shmp activates the development of sulphate reducing bacteria as a result there is a tendency to limit the use of polyphosphates 13 nowadays synthetic water additives are used that prevent scaling such as phosphonates phosphonocarboxylates organic sulphonates and phosphonated polymers which are very efficient at preventing scaling 14 close attention is paid to inhibitors based on chelating agent they are divided into two types depending on the mechanism of action 15 1 inhibitors based on carboxyl containing moieties that can bind to calcium ions prevent the formation of precipitates of sulphates or carbonates when they are used in a stoichiometric ratio 2 inhibitors based on phosphonic groups have a threshold effect and act as chelatants in a sub stoichiometric ratio they are able to inhibit the growth of crystals of precipitating salts these inhibitors also have a crystal destruction effect in the case of the formation of crystal nuclei they are able to alter the shape of the embryonic crystal and slow down its growth the principle attention currently being paid worldwide is to scale inhibitors based on phosphorus containing chelating agent 16 the main companies developing such molecules are monsanto co dequest nalco visco in the usa mirriko descum 2 in russia manuchar nv in belgium roemex limited in the uk some reagents present drawbacks when they are used in oil and gas fields certain scaling inhibitors are thermally unstable 17 18 the concentration of most inhibitors is quite elevated 10 20 mg l 19 which causes extremely high costs so the use of these reagents is not always economically justified 20 22 in the present work we describe the synthesis of a newly identified organophosphorus scale inhibitor and its efficiency for carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions in model solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 material and methods

static tests for scale inhibition the evaluation of the effectiveness of the scale inhibitor against calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions was carried out according to previously described methods 27 29 the static laboratory method consists of precipitating caco3 and caso4 from water i e heating with or without the presence of a scale inhibitor in our work we used formation water of the chloride calcium and sulphate calcium type the salt composition that simulates carbonate deposits is ca2 1100 mg l mg2 380 mg l na 7500 mg l hco 3 976 mg l cl 14023 mg l two solutions are required to imitate scale formation solution 1 contains calcium chloride 3046 mg l and hexavalent magnesium chloride 3177 mg l while solution 2 is sodium chloride 18084 mg l and sodium bicarbonate 1344 mg l the effectiveness of scale inhibition was determined for concentrations of 10 30 50 70 100 150 or 200 ppm of solution 1 in 50 ml this was mixed with 50 ml of solution 2 lids were placed on the flasks the temperature was fixed at 75 c for 5 h then the samples were filtered and the calcium ion content determined 10 ml of filtrate were placed in the conical flasks and 40 ml of distilled water 2 5 ml of 20 sodium hydroxide solution and 10 15 mg of a mixture of murexide and sodium chloride were added secondly the salt composition simulating sulphate gypsum deposits

using 31p nmr spectrometry 31p nmr was used to follow the reaction described in fig 1 in agreement with the work of other authors 30 there are many advantages of using 31p nmr as compared to 1h nmr to monitor the reaction the 31p spectrum is simple and can be analysed quickly the corresponding 1h nmr spectrum presents many overlapping peaks product purification is also easy to analyse 85 phosphoric acid was used as an internal standard δ 0 ppm and 31p nmr are presented in fig 2 in the area from 5 to 25 ppm 31 phosphonate groups were observed at the beginning only one signal can be observed at 4 53 ppm which corresponds to the signal of phosphorous acid after 5 h a new signal appears at 23 17 ppm which corresponds to aminophosphonic acid coupled to diamine these triplets can be due to the formation of intermediate products the end of the reaction can be considered to be at 72 h since we could not observe any further changes in the peak intensity 3 2 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectrum of aminophosphonic acid is presented in fig 3 the ir spectrum showed absorption bands at 2964 cm 1 athimeted to the stretching vibrations at the ch3 and ch2 groups the absorption band at 1590 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibrations of cc double bonds in the aromatic ring valence vibrations at 1363 cm 1 indicate the presence of a cn bond the absorption band at 1173 cm 1 shows the stretching vibrations of the po group valence vibrations at 738 cm 1 describe the behaviour of p c 3 3 thermogravimetric analysis tga dsc thermal stability of the aminophosphonic acid was evaluated by tga dsc the tga dsc thermogram is presented in fig 4 on the dsc curves characteristic peaks and abnormalities are observed analyses show the processes or first order transitions associated with heat absorption melting 1 the temperature of the start of the process in t1 154 c and the end in t2 176 c 2 the minimum temperature of the peak is t3 168 c there are also processes associated with weight changes the tg curves show abnormalities in the form of steps which should be described by the following parameters 1 the temperature at the beginning of the mass loss process is t1 25 c and the end at t2 245 c these are defined as the points of intersection of the tangents of the main tg line and the step shoulder the reaction interval was calculated δt t2 t1 δt 245 c 25 c 220 c 1 for the first stage the weight loss of the sample is δm 20 8 5 mg above 180 c an increase in the mass of the sample is observed apparently because oxidation of the sample occurs then already above 200 c there is a sharp decrease in mass this is due to destruction of the scale inhibitor tga dsc analysis showed that the scale inhibitor is thermally stable up to 180 c so that it should be able to be used in many industries while maintaining its effectiveness 3 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of aminophosphonic acid inhibition on calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions reddy and nancollas 32 reported that complexes containing phosphonic groups contribute to an increase in the specific surface energy and radius and a decrease in the rate of nucleation the induction period of crystallization is significantly increased while a correlation is observed between the change in the kinetic parameters of nucleation and the duration of the induction period in the presence of chelating agent the inhibitory effect increases with the increase of the number of phosphonic groups in the molecule and with the increase in the number of nitrogen atoms fig 5 shows the inhibitor efficiency as a function of the inhibitor concentration the use of the inhibitor allows the formation of mineral salts like calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate to be prevented along with their deposit on equipment in many areas of industry such as cooling systems desalination heating systems etc the mechanism of inhibitory action is probably that inhibitors based on phosphonic groups have a threshold effect and act as chelating agents in a sub stoichiometric ratio they are able to inhibit the growth of crystals of precipitating salts these inhibitors also have a destructive effect in the case of the formation of crystalline nuclei they are able to change the shape of embryonic crystals and slow their growth it is assumed 33 34 that the effect of these inhibitors is due to their adsorption on the surface of the embryos as a result of which the growth of the crystals ceases in inhibition the complexing factor is also of great importance the adsorption of complexons on the solid phase is described using the langmuir isotherm the mechanism of the inhibitory effect probably consists in selective adsorption on the active sites of the crystals that form which prevents their further growth and aggregation low adsorption on the solid phase allows the phosphorus containing complexons to be redistributed into those regions of the crystallizing solution where a density fluctuation embryo occurs since a supersaturated solution containing microcrystals of the solid phase is a thermodynamically unstable system the adsorption of the complexion contributes to a shift in equilibrium according to the le chatelier s principle in the direction of dissolution of the embryos as a result complexone is released to interact with new density fluctuations embryos a comparison of the efficiency of various scaling inhibitors for the protection from caco3 and caso4 deposits is shown in table 1 inhibition efficiency depends essentially on the composition of the inhibitor differing by the nature of the hydrocarbon radical aliphatic aromatic of the ground atom nitrogen phosphorus and acidic groups carboxyl phosphate phosphonate etc the pteroyl l glutamic acid inhibitor showed the best results the degree of inhibition efficiency was 100 at 200 ppm for calcium carbonate however information on the effectiveness of inhibition on calcium sulphate is not represented the effectiveness of the polyamino polyether methylene phosphonate inhibitor reaches up to 84 at a very low concentration of up to 7 ppm nevertheless in the published work there is no information concerning the inhibition of calcium carbonate sodium hexametaphosphate showed high efficiency in inhibiting carbonate and calcium sulphate the modified gambier extract also showed a high efficiency of 92 at 300 ppm but information on the effectiveness of calcium sulphate inhibition is not indicated as described in previous work 40 inorganic scale inhibitors have a number of drawbacks such as thermal instability they are only effective up to 80 c hydrolysis up to orthophosphates with the formation of insoluble calcium salts at low efficiency for caso4 by introducing productive horizons with fresh water shmp activates the development of sulphate reducing bacteria the degree of inhibition efficiency of the new aminophosphonic acid is 94 and 97 at 200 ppm for carbonates and calcium sulphate respectively that is it has a high efficiency for both types of deposit 3 5 morphology and polymorph characterization of crystals by sem to further investigate the mechanism of salt formation the calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate morphologies obtained under static conditions and various concentrations of inhibitor were analysed by scanning electron microscopy sem some authors have reported 41 42 that caco3 presents polymorphism the caco3 precipitates have the same chemical composition but they present a different crystalline structure calcite aragonite and vaterite moreover it was reported 43 44 that under certain conditions it is possible to generate two other forms of calcium carbonate calcium carbonate monohydrate and calcium carbonate hexahydrate fig 6 shows sem images of precipitated calcium carbonate obtained with different concentrations of the inhibitor a large difference can be observed according to the sem images in the presence or absence of the inhibitor crystals formed in the presence of the inhibitor are mainly in the form of aragonite with some vaterite at higher inhibitor concentration whereas crystals obtained without a scale inhibitor are predominantly calcite the aragonite crystals are needles 45 46 and flower like structures 47 48 while the calcite crystals are blocks like cubic shaped particles or rhombohedral 49 it is also possible to note the transitional forms of crystals and their defectiveness this proves the wide effect of the reagent on crystal growth and shape as is commonly believed the inhibition of scale formation is influenced by both the location of the adsorbed inhibitor at the crystal surface and the extent of chemical bonding with the surface these mechanisms inhibit the growth and aggregation of crystals 50 51 the sem images of calcium sulphate particles obtained during the scale inhibitor test are shown in fig 7 crystals obtained without inhibitor fig 7a and b look like thin needles with a smooth surface whereas as the concentration of inhibitor increases fig 7c s their thickening is observed with a large number of crystal defects the analysis was taken sediment which remained after exposure in section 3 4 at different concentrations as can be seen from fig 7 an increase in the crystal size in the presence of a scaling inhibitor is probably due to the fact that in addition to the complexing properties it is also the center of crystallization of the deposited precipitate the essence of the analysis of precipitated crystals was the study of the effect of aminophosphonate on their shape and surface as a conclusion the inhibitor has not only a high inhibitory efficiency against the deposit of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate but it is also able to alter the morphology of crystals which favourably affects the destruction of already precipitated salt crystals and their removal together with the process fluid 3 6 elemental analysis of crystals by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx edx spectroscopy was used to determine elemental analysis figs 8 and 9 show the edx spectra of caco3 and caso4 precipitates respectively from the results of edx spectral analysis of calcium carbonate it can be concluded that the predominant elements are ca and o corresponding to caco3 analysis of the edx spectra of calcium sulphate showed predominance of elements of ca s o which corresponds to the structure of caso4 with a small amount of na mg cl elements 4 conclusions a new aminophosphonic acid was successfully synthesized by the moedritzer irani reaction and was used as a scale inhibitor the structure of the inhibitor synthesized was studied by ft ir nmr and ms spectrometry the investigation of inhibition showed high efficiency with respect to calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate scale in addition the effects of caco3 and caso4 crystal formation was investigated with the combination of scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the results showed clearly that the aminomethylphosphonic acid scale inhibitor affects the procedure of scale crystal growth the morphology of the caco3 crystals in the absence of inhibitor showed the predominant content of rhombohedral crystals calcite whereas with the inhibitor a mixture of calcite with acicular crystals aragonite and small content of spherical crystals vaterite is observed without scale inhibitor caso4 crystals are in the form of thin needles with a smooth surface the crystal samples become thicker with a large number of crystal defects in the presence of the inhibitor the aminophosphonic acid inhibitor presents a high efficiency for common deposits of salts of carbonates 94 and sulphates 97 at a concentration of 200 ppm as a well as a high thermostability for all these reasons the newly described aminophosphonic acid could be used as a powerful scale inhibitor author contributions the manuscript was written by contributions of all

14591,a new aminophosphonic acid was synthesized by condensation of 4 4 propane 2 2 diylbis 4 1 phenylene bis oxy dianiline phosphorous acid and formaldehyde according to the moedritzer irani reaction the structure of the inhibitor was analyzed by 1h and 31p nmr ft ir mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry the new inhibitor presented high efficiency in a static condition on the model imitating water composition with respect to caco3 and caso4 deposits the crystal formation of caco3 and caso4 was investigated by scanning electronic microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx the inhibitor obviously affected the procedure of crystal growth the morphology of the caco3 crystals in the absence of inhibitor showed a predominant content of rhombohedral crystals calcite whereas in the presence of inhibitor we could observe a mixture of calcite with acicular crystals aragonite and a small content of spherical crystals vaterite concerning caso4 crystals thin needles with a smooth surface were observed in the absence of the inhibitor which became thicker with many crystal defects in the presence of the inhibitor consequently the new aminophosphonic acid described here can be used as a potential scale inhibitor keywords scale inhibitor aminophosphonic acid calcium sulfate calcium carbonate 1 introduction the precipitation of insoluble or slightly soluble salts in steam generators boilers cooling towers pipes and other equipment used in water intensive processes is a serious problem deposits of alkaline earth ions in the form of carbonates and sulphates is of particular concern since these salts usually have a solubility that decreases with increasing temperature inverse solubility 1 can and üner 2 showed that the formation of salts begins at a temperature of 30 35 c and their deposit increases with that of temperature in addition this process is intensified with the evaporation of water it was previously described that many brines found in oil bearing strata of offshore reservoirs contain high concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions ba2 ca2 sr2 and mg2 3 during secondary oil recovery seawater containing so42 is injected into the reservoir to maintain pressure when the water reaches the oil well a solid precipitate is formed which blocks production tubing and can cause damage to the reservoir itself this problem is widely spread in the oil industry in kazakhstan mineralized water in oil fields reaches 20 80 4 in some cases mineralization reaches 220 250 g l which leads to high levels of salt deposits 5 an expensive solution to this problem is to decrease the sulphate concentration in the seawater by reverse osmosis prior to injection a far cheaper alternative is the use of chemicals these chemicals either prevent the mineral scale from forming or alter the precipitate to such an extent that the scale no longer presents a problem 6 9 the main conventional mechanisms for inhibiting scaling are chelation dispersion crystal distortion and threshold action 10 12 inorganic polyphosphates primarily tri polyphosphate and sodium hexa metaphosphate shmp have been widely used as scale inhibitors it is assumed that the active mechanism of shmp as an inhibitor is due to its adsorption onto the surface of caco3 microcrystals which hinders their growth and agglomeration the main significant disadvantage of inorganic polyphosphates is their low thermal stability leading to a loss of inhibitory properties a propensity to hydrolyse into orthophosphates with the formation of insoluble calcium salts and a low efficiency with respect to caso4 entering productive horizons with fresh water shmp activates the development of sulphate reducing bacteria as a result there is a tendency to limit the use of polyphosphates 13 nowadays synthetic water additives are used that prevent scaling such as phosphonates phosphonocarboxylates organic sulphonates and phosphonated polymers which are very efficient at preventing scaling 14 close attention is paid to inhibitors based on chelating agent they are divided into two types depending on the mechanism of action 15 1 inhibitors based on carboxyl containing moieties that can bind to calcium ions prevent the formation of precipitates of sulphates or carbonates when they are used in a stoichiometric ratio 2 inhibitors based on phosphonic groups have a threshold effect and act as chelatants in a sub stoichiometric ratio they are able to inhibit the growth of crystals of precipitating salts these inhibitors also have a crystal destruction effect in the case of the formation of crystal nuclei they are able to alter the shape of the embryonic crystal and slow down its growth the principle attention currently being paid worldwide is to scale inhibitors based on phosphorus containing chelating agent 16 the main companies developing such molecules are monsanto co dequest nalco visco in the usa mirriko descum 2 in russia manuchar nv in belgium roemex limited in the uk some reagents present drawbacks when they are used in oil and gas fields certain scaling inhibitors are thermally unstable 17 18 the concentration of most inhibitors is quite elevated 10 20 mg l 19 which causes extremely high costs so the use of these reagents is not always economically justified 20 22 in the present work we describe the synthesis of a newly identified organophosphorus scale inhibitor and its efficiency for carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions in model solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 material and methods

static tests for scale inhibition the evaluation of the effectiveness of the scale inhibitor against calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions was carried out according to previously described methods 27 29 the static laboratory method consists of precipitating caco3 and caso4 from water i e heating with or without the presence of a scale inhibitor in our work we

two solutions are required to imitate scale formation solution 1 contains calcium chloride 3046 mg l and hexavalent magnesium chloride 3177 mg l while solution 2 is sodium chloride 18084 mg l and

lids were placed on the flasks the temperature was fixed at 75 c for 5 h then the samples were filtered and the calcium ion content determined 10 ml of filtrate were placed in the conical flasks and 40 ml of distilled water 2 5 ml of 20 sodium hydroxide solution and 10 15 mg of a mixture of murexide and sodium chloride were added secondly the salt composition simulating sulphate gypsum deposits

using 31p nmr spectrometry 31p nmr was used to follow the reaction described in fig 1 in agreement with the work of other authors 30 there are many advantages of using 31p nmr as compared to 1h nmr to monitor the reaction the 31p spectrum is simple and can be analysed quickly the corresponding 1h nmr spectrum presents many overlapping peaks product purification is also easy to analyse 85 phosphoric acid was used as an internal standard δ 0 ppm and 31p nmr are presented in fig 2 in the area from 5 to 25 ppm 31 phosphonate groups were observed at the beginning only one signal can be observed at 4 53 ppm which corresponds to the signal of phosphorous acid after 5 h a new signal appears at 23 17 ppm which corresponds to aminophosphonic acid coupled to diamine these triplets can be due to the formation of intermediate products the end of the reaction can be considered to be at 72 h since we could not observe any further changes in the peak intensity 3 2 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectrum of aminophosphonic acid is presented in fig 3 the ir spectrum showed absorption bands at 2964 cm 1 athimeted to the stretching vibrations at the ch3 and ch2 groups the absorption band at 1590 cm 1

the tga dsc thermogram is presented in fig 4 on the dsc curves characteristic peaks and abnormalities are observed analyses show the processes or first order transitions associated with heat absorption melting 1 the temperature of the start of the process in t1 154 c and the end in t2 176 c 2 the minimum temperature of the peak is t3 168 c there are also processes associated with weight changes the tg curves show abnormalities in the form of steps which should be described by the following parameters 1 the temperature at the beginning of the mass loss process is t1 25 c and the end at t2 245 c these are defined as the points of intersection of the tangents of the main tg line and the step shoulder the reaction interval was calculated δt t2 t1 δt 245 c 25 c 220 c 1 for the first stage the weight loss of the sample is δm 20 8 5 mg above 180 c an increase in the mass of the sample is observed apparently because oxidation of the sample occurs then already above 200 c there is a sharp decrease in mass this is due to destruction of the scale inhibitor tga dsc analysis showed that the scale inhibitor is thermally stable up to 180 c so that it should be able to be used in many industries while maintaining its effectiveness 3 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of aminophosphonic acid inhibition on calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate deposits under static conditions reddy and nancollas 32 reported that complexes containing phosphonic groups contribute to an increase in the specific surface energy and radius and a decrease in the rate of nucleation the induction period of crystallization is significantly increased while a correlation is observed between the change in the kinetic parameters of nucleation and the duration of the induction period in the presence of chelating agent the inhibitory effect increases with the increase of the number of phosphonic groups in the molecule and with the increase in the number of nitrogen atoms fig 5 shows the inhibitor efficiency as a function of the inhibitor concentration the use of the inhibitor allows the formation of mineral salts like calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate to be prevented along with their deposit on equipment in many areas of industry such as cooling systems desalination heating systems etc the mechanism of inhibitory action is probably that inhibitors based on phosphonic groups have a threshold effect and act as chelating agents in a sub stoichiometric ratio they are able to inhibit the growth of crystals of precipitating salts these inhibitors also have a destructive effect in the case of the formation of crystalline nuclei they are able to change the shape of embryonic crystals and slow their growth it is assumed 33 34 that the effect of these inhibitors is due to their adsorption on the surface of the embryos as a result of which the growth of the crystals ceases in inhibition the complexing factor is also of great importance the adsorption of complexons on the solid phase is described using the langmuir isotherm the mechanism of the inhibitory effect probably consists in selective adsorption on the active sites of the crystals that form which prevents their further growth and aggregation low adsorption on the solid phase allows the phosphorus containing complexons to be redistributed into those regions of the crystallizing solution where a density fluctuation embryo occurs since a supersaturated solution containing microcrystals of the solid phase is a thermodynamically unstable system the adsorption of the complexion contributes to a shift in equilibrium according to the le chatelier s principle in the direction of dissolution of the embryos as a result complexone is released to interact with new density fluctuations embryos a comparison of the efficiency of various scaling inhibitors for the protection from caco3 and caso4 deposits is shown in table 1 inhibition efficiency depends essentially on the composition of the inhibitor differing by the nature of the hydrocarbon radical aliphatic aromatic of the ground atom nitrogen phosphorus and acidic groups carboxyl phosphate phosphonate etc the pteroyl l glutamic acid inhibitor showed the best results the degree of inhibition efficiency was 100 at 200 ppm for calcium carbonate however information on the effectiveness of inhibition on calcium sulphate is not represented the effectiveness of the polyamino polyether methylene phosphonate inhibitor reaches up to 84 at a very low concentration of up to 7 ppm nevertheless in the published work there is no information concerning the inhibition of calcium carbonate sodium hexametaphosphate showed high efficiency in inhibiting carbonate and calcium sulphate the modified gambier extract also showed a high efficiency of 92 at 300 ppm but information on the effectiveness of calcium sulphate inhibition is not indicated as described in previous work 40 inorganic scale inhibitors have a number of drawbacks such as thermal instability they are only effective up to 80 c hydrolysis up to orthophosphates with the formation of insoluble calcium salts at low efficiency for caso4 by introducing productive horizons with fresh water shmp activates the development of sulphate reducing bacteria the degree of inhibition efficiency of the new aminophosphonic acid is 94 and 97 at 200 ppm for carbonates and calcium sulphate respectively that is it has a high efficiency for both types of deposit 3 5 morphology and polymorph characterization of crystals by sem to further investigate the mechanism of salt formation the calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate morphologies obtained under static conditions and various concentrations of inhibitor were analysed by scanning electron microscopy sem some authors have reported 41 42 that caco3 presents polymorphism the caco3 precipitates have the same chemical composition but they present a different crystalline structure calcite aragonite and vaterite moreover it was reported 43 44 that under certain conditions it is possible to generate two other forms of calcium carbonate calcium carbonate monohydrate and calcium carbonate hexahydrate fig 6 shows sem images of precipitated calcium carbonate obtained with different concentrations of the inhibitor a large difference can be observed according to the sem images in the presence or absence of the inhibitor crystals formed in the presence of the inhibitor are mainly in the form of aragonite with some vaterite at higher inhibitor concentration whereas crystals obtained without a scale inhibitor are predominantly calcite the aragonite crystals are needles 45 46 and flower like structures 47 48 while the calcite crystals are blocks like cubic shaped particles or rhombohedral 49 it is also possible to note the transitional forms of crystals and their defectiveness this proves the wide effect of the reagent on crystal growth and shape as is commonly believed the inhibition of scale formation is influenced by both the location of the adsorbed inhibitor at the crystal surface and the extent of chemical bonding with the surface these mechanisms inhibit the growth and aggregation of crystals 50 51 the sem images of calcium sulphate particles obtained during the scale inhibitor test are shown in fig 7 crystals obtained without inhibitor fig 7a and b look like thin needles with a smooth surface whereas as the concentration of inhibitor increases fig 7c s their thickening is observed with a large number of crystal defects the analysis was taken sediment which remained after exposure in section 3 4 at different concentrations as can be seen from fig 7 an increase in the crystal size in the presence of a scaling inhibitor is probably due to the fact that in addition to the complexing properties it is also the center of crystallization of the deposited precipitate the essence of the analysis of precipitated crystals was the study of the effect of aminophosphonate on their shape and surface as a conclusion the inhibitor has not only a high inhibitory efficiency against the deposit of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate but it is also able to alter the morphology of crystals which favourably affects the destruction of already precipitated salt crystals and their removal together with the process fluid 3 6 elemental analysis of crystals by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx edx spectroscopy was used to determine elemental analysis figs 8 and 9 show the edx spectra of caco3 and caso4 precipitates respectively from the results of edx spectral analysis of calcium carbonate it can be concluded that the predominant elements are ca and o corresponding to caco3 analysis of the edx spectra of calcium sulphate showed predominance of elements of ca s o which corresponds to the structure of caso4 with a small amount of na mg cl elements 4 conclusions a new aminophosphonic acid was successfully synthesized by the moedritzer irani reaction and was used as a scale inhibitor the structure of the inhibitor synthesized was studied by ft ir nmr and ms spectrometry the investigation of inhibition showed high efficiency with respect to calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate scale in addition the effects of caco3 and caso4 crystal formation was investigated with the combination of scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the results showed clearly that the aminomethylphosphonic acid scale inhibitor affects the procedure of scale crystal growth the morphology of the caco3 crystals in the absence of inhibitor showed the predominant content of rhombohedral crystals calcite whereas with the inhibitor a mixture of calcite with acicular crystals aragonite and small content of spherical crystals vaterite is observed without scale inhibitor caso4 crystals are in the form of thin needles with a smooth surface the crystal samples become thicker with a large number of crystal defects in the presence of the inhibitor the aminophosphonic acid inhibitor presents a high efficiency for common deposits of salts of carbonates 94 and sulphates 97 at a concentration of 200 ppm as a well as a high thermostability for all these reasons the newly described aminophosphonic acid could be used as a powerful scale inhibitor author contributions the manuscript was written by contributions of all

electrooxidation mineralization 1 introduction 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is a herbicide with potential toxicity for humans and animals which is widely applied in gardens and farming to control weeds 2 4 d is a low cost easily available and effective herbicide which is often used in all countries 1 2 accordingly 2 4 d has recently become a considerable environmental problem due to its chemical stability and resistance 2 4 d is identified as moderately toxic class ii to human beings and animals based of the report of who and maximum permissible concentration mpc in drinking water is recommended as 70 μg l 3 2 4 d may be an endocrine disruptor which is classified in plant hormones auxin in addition residual 2 4 d have been reported in aquatic environment and receiving waters 4 5 several methods have been suggested for 2 4 d degradation in aqueous solutions most of them are based on chemical oxidations since the biodegradability of 2 4 d is poor 6 advanced oxidation processes aops have been broadly used for degradation of persistent organic pollutants in which hydroxyl radical as main oxidative agent is produced in the solution for destruction of organic molecules 7 8 hydroxyl radical may be generated through electrochemical chemical and photochemical processes 9 electrooxidation eo is a green procedure for the production of hydroxyl radical because its reactive agent is electron 10 11 the mechanism of eo process is the generation of hydroxyl radical through oxidation of water molecule at the surface of anode which is well known as anodic oxidation 11 12 in anodic oxidation the generated hydroxyl radical can directly react with the organic compounds different high overvoltage anodes iro2 pbo2 pt graphite and boron doped diamond have been used in anodic oxidation process to generate hydroxyl radical 13 moreover dechlorination may happen in electrochemical processes for chlorinated organic compounds 1 mo x h 2 o mo x h o h e nowadays hybrid processes have received a significant attention for rapid degradation of organic pollutants in hybrid processes one or some chemical oxidation processes are coupled for synergistic degradation of organic pollutants 14 these processes often have several mechanisms for degradation of pollutants in last decade the use of oxone salt khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 has been increased for environmental remediation the presence of peroxymonosulfate anion hso5 in oxone salt induces the generation of sulfate radical so4 in which an activator is used 15 17 oxone as source of peroxymonosulfate pms is activated by transition metal ultraviolet ultrasound carbon based catalyst etc the combination of oxone and electrooxidation has been rarely considered for degradation of persistent organic pollutants 18 19 indeed this hybrid process is coupling electrooxidation process and sulfate radical based process in which oxone can be activated through electron transfer according to eq 2 18 2 hso 5 e so 4 oh several hybrid electrochemical processes have been used for 2 4 d degradation including electro peroxone 20 electro fenton 21 and sono electrooxidation 22 compared to hybrid fenton based processes electrooxidation oxone is a free metal catalyst process in which sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are simultaneously generated at the solution to enhance the degradation of organic pollutants moreover there is a little information related to integration of sulfate radical based processes and electrochemical process as a novel hybrid process it should be also noted that no study has been conducted on 2 4 d degradation via combination of electrooxidation and oxone in this study combination of electrooxidation with pbo2 anode and oxone was studied for the first time the operational parameters mechanism reaction kinetic and mineralization of 2 4 d were investigated moreover the effects of some homogenous transition metals were also studied on 2 4 d

experiments were carried out an undivided cell at room temperature a cylindrical reactor plaxi glass with the height of 10 cm and diameter of 6 cm was used as electrochemical cell a pbo2 electrode 2 4 9 0 1 cm was used as anode while a stainless steel 2 4 9 0 3 cm was used as cathode pbo2 anode is a non active and high o2 overvoltage electrode which has been classically used in eo moreover it is available and inexpensive compared to pt and bdd 250 ml of 2 4 d solution was introduced to the electrochemical cell in all experiments the concentration of 2 4 d was 40 mg l 10 mm na2so4 was applied as supporting electrolyte in order to apply electrical current a digital dc power 30 0 v 3000 ma was used the mutual distance of 3 cm between the anode and the cathode was maintained the solution was mixed by a magnetic stirrer the solution ph was adjusted by sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 0 1 m before starting the electrolysis a certain amount of oxone was added to the solution with turning on dc power the electrooxidation process was begun the sampling was carried out every 15 min from the solution for 2 4 d analysis the effects of ph current density and oxone concentration were investigated on 2 4 d removal all experiments were in triplicate and the average of them was used for presentation of data the standard deviation was less than 3 2 2 3 analytical method 2 4 d concentration was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc knauer germany with a 2500 ultraviolet uv detector at 280 nm wavelength as the absorption maximum of 2 4 d the isocratic mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water with a ratio of 50 50 the flow rate of mobile phase was 0 5 ml min the stationary phase was a c8 100 5 column 250 mm 4 6 mm the temperature of column was set at 30 c analysis time was continued up to 10 0 min whereas the retention time was 3 4 3 7 min for 2 4 d peak 2 4 d removal was calculated based on 2 4 d concentration at different reaction time the oxone concentration pms was measured based on iodometric titration chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by cod ampoules hach chemical using a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 total organic carbon toc was measured by toc analyzer shimadzu potassium hydrogen phthalate khp was used for accuracy of cod and toc measurements total dissolved solids tds 5day biochemical oxygen demand bod 5210b and chloride ions were determined according to standard methods 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of operational parameters the effect of ph was explored on 2 4 d removal under the condition of 20 ma cm2 and 2 mm oxone fig 1 a shows the 2 4 d removal at ph values of 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 as can be seen in the alkaline condition ph 10 0 the degradation efficiency was remarkably reduced this issue can be attributed to the self decomposition of oxone at alkaline condition pms as major source of sulfate radical was decomposed to water oxygen and sulfate ions 24 3 2hso 5 2oh 2so 4 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 4 d removals were 70 1 and 60 4 for ph 4 0 and ph 7 0 respectively as shown ph of 4 indicated high performance for eo process compared to neutral condition ph 7 0 it has been reported in literature that redox potential of free radicals in acidic condition is higher than that in alkaline condition 25 26 this issue can be influential on 2 4 d degradation in addition pk a of 2 4 d is 2 87 27 hence at ph values more than 2 87 its anionic form might be degraded on the surface of anode in electrochemical process current density is a vital factor for degradation reaction of organic pollutants the effect of current density was investigated in the range of 10 40 ma cm2 under the conditions of ph 4 0 2 mm oxone and 90 min reaction time fig 1b demonstrates the effect of current density on 2 4 d removal one can see that increasing in current intensity enhanced the 2 4 d removal 2 4 d removals were 53 3 70 1 82 6 and 83 1 for 5 10 15 20 ma cm2 respectively higher current density resulted in more generation of hydroxyl radical at the anode this phenomenon led to increase of electron transfer to activate oxone for generation of sulfate radical however after 30 ma cm2 removal efficiency did not change significantly in anodic oxidation parasite reactions usually occurs at higher current density in which non oxidizing reactions take place at the surface of anode in this way oxygen evolution occurs at the surface of pbo2 and consequently reduces the hydroxyl radicals eq 4 28 30 4 2pbo 2 h o 2pbo 2 o 2 2h 2e the oxone concentration affects the amount of sulfate radical and degradation of pollutant fig 1c demonstrates the effect of oxone dosage on 2 4 d removal when current density was 30 ma cm2 and the solution ph was 4 0 one can see that in the presence of 1 mm oxone degradation was relatively slow and removal efficiency reached 57 during 90 min electrolysis with increase of oxone concentration to 2 and 3 mm 2 4 d removal was dramatically increased and respectively 82 and 91 of 2 4 d were degraded during 90 min electrolysis time this increase was due to more generation of sulfate radicals to destruct 2 4 d molecules in aqueous solution on the other hand increase of oxone dosage up to 4 mm suppressed the function of eo oxone in 2 4 d removal in sulfate radical based processes excess dosage oxidants may have a negative effect on the efficiency in current study this phenomenon was observed in which excessive oxone scavenged the sulfate radicals based on eq 5 this phenomenon was frequently reported in the literature 26 31 5 hso 5 so 4 so 4 2 so 5 h 3 2 kinetic model and synergistic effect 2 4 d removal was investigated in three conditions sole application of oxone eo and eo oxone the experiment conditions were ph 4 0 3 mm oxone and current density of 30 ma cm2 fig 2 a as can be seen sole application of oxone was ineffective and only 6 of 2 4 d was degraded during 90 min eo could eliminate around 38 of 2 4 d during 90 min electrolysis time in fact the production of hydroxyl radical on the surface of anode and electron transfer were main responsible of 2 4 d degradation in eo process combination of eo and oxone exhibited high efficiency in 2 4 d removal with 91 removal efficiency as above mentioned oxone was activated in the presence of electron to generate sulfate radical as a strong reactive agent which can oxidize 2 4 d to smaller organic compounds moreover oxone may be activated on the surface of anode by reaction with hydroxyl radicals based on the eqs 6 and 7 in this way hydroxyl radical adsorbed on the surface of anode reacted with pms and generated peroxymonosulfate radical so5 which was weak oxidant with negligible reactivity howbeit adjacent so5 on the surface of anode can be joined together to generate so4 and o2 1 32 hence degradation reaction of 2 4 d was accelerated in the presence of oxone 6 pbo 2 h o hso 5 pbo 2 so 5 h 2 o 7 2pbo 2 so 5 2h 2 o 2pbo 2 oh o 2 2so 4 2h the kinetic model of eo and eo oxone for 2 4 d degradation was investigated by pseudo first order according to eq 8 8 ln 2 4 d 2 4 d 0 kt where k is rate constant of pseudo first order min 1 and t is reaction time min fig 2b shows plot of ln 2 4 d 2 4 d0 vs reaction time as can be seen the pseudo first order was well fitted for 2 4 d degradation by eo and eo oxone with r squared 0 98 the rate constant of sole application of oxone was insignificant 0 0003 min 1 while the rate constant of eo was 0 0053 min 1 the combination of eo and oxone extremely improved the rate constant of 2 4 d degradation the rate constant of 2 4 d degradation for eo oxone was 0 0267 min 1 which was 5 times more than that for eo process these results indicated that coupling eo and oxone led to a synergistic effect in the generation of free radicals for attack to organic bonds 3 3 the effect of supporting electrolyte the supporting electrolyte can affect generated free radicals in aops the effect of three electrolytes na2so4 nacl and nano3 in eo oxone process was investigated on 2 4 d removal and their results are presented in fig 3 as can be seen the trend of 2 4 d removal in na2so4 and nacl was approximately the same chloride ion has been known as a strong scavenger for aops 33 however in current study no inhibition effect was observed in the presence of chloride in the presence of chloride several chlorine species were produced in the solution which were able to destruct organic pollutants in this way reaction chains of chlorine species was formed in the bulk solution and the surface of anode regarding the solution ph ph 4 0 among these species cl2 and hocl were dominant species in the solution which were corresponded to degradation of 2 4 d 34 36 9 cl cl ads e 10 cl cl ads cl 2 e 11 cl 2 aq h 2 o hocl h cl 12 hclo clo h 13 h o cl cloh 14 cloh cl oh 15 cl cl cl 2 16 cl 2 h o hocl cl on the other hand hocl can be also generated via reaction of pms with chloride ion based on eq 17 37 38 however it is worthwhile to state that the presence of chloride as supporting electrolyte can form chlorinated organic compounds which may be more toxic than 2 4 d 17 hso 5 cl hocl so 4 2 in case of sodium nitrate nitrate ion is a scavenger for free radicals as can be seen in the presence of sodium nitrate degradation efficiency was significantly diminished compared to sulfate and chloride ions hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were scavenged by nitrate ions eq 18 and produced the nitrate radical with lower reactivity and redox potential e0 2 3 v 39 hence the sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were reduced in the solution and 2 4 d degradation was decreased 18 h o or so 4 no 3 ho or so 4 2 no 3 3 4 the effect of transition metals the transition metals especially cobalt and iron have been used for oxone activation although cobalt is a toxic metal compared to iron high efficacy in oxone activation is justified its application the effect of the presence of cobalt ii and fe ii 0 5 mm was studied on 2 4 d removal in eo oxone process fig 4 a demonstrated 2 4 d removal in eo oxone system in the presence of cobalt and ferrous ion as can be seen cobalt ii and ferrous ions enhanced 2 4 d degradation rate markedly approximately complete degradation of 2 4 d was obtained in the presence of cobalt ii and ferrous ions in eo oxone system this issue was likely due to oxone activation by transition metals m of cobalt and iron according to eq 19 40 41 19 m n hso 5 m n 1 ho so 4 moreover the higher state of transition metal m n 1 can be reduced at the cathode and regenerated mn for more activation of oxone eq 20 in fact ferrous and cobalt ii ions were regenerated at the cathode to propagate the reaction chain of generating free radicals 42 43 20 m n 1 e m n in order to confirm promotional effect of transition metals pms concentration was measured after 90 min reaction time to obtain degree of pms decay fig 4b demonstrated pms decay in three systems one can see that pms decay in eo oxone was 54 5 while with adding cobalt and iron ions pms decay was increased to 72 3 and 70 4 respectively these results proved the performance of transition metals in improvement of the efficiency of the process through pms activation it should be noted that cobalt ions had a slight superiority compared to ferrous ions this superiority has been confirmed by several researchers 40 41 44 3 5 determination of reactive species reactive species in 2 4 d degradation are determined by scavenging experiments in which a strong scavenger for free radicals was used to quench hydroxyl and sulfate radicals ethanol etoh is an alcohol with α hydrogen which can scavenge both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals by high rate constants 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 for ho tert butanol t buoh without α hydrogen is a strong scavenger for hydroxyl radical with the rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 whereas its rate constant is 1000 times less for sulfate radical hence the difference between degradation efficiencies in the presence of etoh and t buoh indicated the sulfate radical function 15 45 46 in this way scavenging experiments were conducted in the presence of t buoh 0 4 m and etoh 0 4 m in two systems eo oxone and eo oxone co2 and their results are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a in the presence of etoh in eo oxone 2 4 d degradation was significantly reduced and 2 4 d removal was only 15 indicating both sulfate and hydroxyl radical were the main responsible of 2 4 d removal however this little degradation in the presence of etoh was presumably due to direct electron transfer in anodic oxidation t buoh could inhibit 2 4 d degradation from 91 in control condition to 48 4 indicating the participation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals was almost the same indeed a half of degradation was corresponded to sulfate radical and another half for hydroxyl radical in eo oxone co2 system fig 5b in the presence of etoh 2 4 d removal was remarkably declined while in the presence of t buoh 2 4 d removal was slightly reduced presenting that sulfate radicals were dominant species in the solution for degradation of 2 4 d this phenomenon indicated that cobalt ions had a pivotal role in contribution of sulfate radical generated from oxone activation as a matter of fact cobalt ion affected the mechanism of oxone activation in eo oxone process 3 6 mineralization of 2 4 d in aops the degradation of target pollutant is not adequate hence mineralization of organic pollutants should be considered in current study toc of the solution was monitored during 3 h electrolysis time for two systems of eo oxone and eo oxone co ii fig 6 a shows toc removal for two systems as can be seen toc removal was gradually increased during electrolysis time toc removals were obtained 54 5 and 68 9 for eo oxone and eo oxone co ii respectively these results showed that the presence of cobalt had a promotional effect on eo oxone process and increased the amount of generating free radicals resulting from oxone activation the kinetic model of pseudo first order was used for toc removal for the results of fig 6a and the plot of ln toc toc0 vs time is presented in fig 6b the pseudo first order was well proportioned for both systems the rate constants of toc removal were 0 0054 and 0 0074 min 1 for eo oxone and eo oxone co ii respectively 3 7 application for real agricultural drainage the eo oxone and eo oxone co2 were tested on real agricultural drainage which was collected from haft tappeh city khuzestan province iran experimental conditions were natural ph of the drainage 3 mm oxone 30 ma cm2 and 90 min electrolysis time table 1 shows some characteristics of the agricultural drainage before and after treatment by eo oxone and eo oxone co2 systems 2 4 d was completely eliminated in both systems indicating that eo oxone was an effective process for 2 4 d removal in real matrix toc value as a mineralization index was decreased from 42 1 mg l to 21 0 and 17 9 mg l in eo oxone and eo oxone co2 processes respectively more than 50 mineralization was observed in both systems cod as index of organic compounds was significantly decreased during 90 min electrolysis time in both systems cod removals were 64 and 72 for eo oxone and eo oxone co2 respectively as expected the tds of the drainage was increased which was attributed to oxone salt this issue is the most important disadvantage of sulfate radical based process it should be also noted that oxone salt decreased the solution ph due to the presence of bisulfates in oxone salt 4 conclusion coupling eo process and oxone eo oxone exhibited high efficiency for degradation of persistent organic pollutant such as 2 4 d the excess oxone concentration and alkaline ph had a negative effect on 2 4 d degradation the pseudo first order kinetic explained 2 4 d degradation by eo oxone process with the rate constant of 0 0267 min 1 the coupling of oxone and eo demonstrated a synergistic performance for 2 4 d degradation on contrary of nacl and na2so4 nano3 as supporting electrolyte had an inhibitory effect on 2 4 d removal adding co ii and fe ii to eo oxone improved 2 4 d removal significantly through oxone activation and regeneration of co ii and fe ii at the cathode scavenging experiments showed that both sulfate and hydroxyl radical were equally responsible of 2 4 d degradation in eo oxone process while the presence of cobalt ions increased the participation of sulfate radical moreover the results of 2 4 d degradation in real drainage showed that eo oxone process can be considered as a promising hybrid process for the remediation of contaminated water acknowledgment this research was financially supported by the student research committee ahvaz jundishapur

mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water with a ratio of 50 50 the flow rate of mobile phase was 0 5 ml min the stationary phase was a c8 100 5 column 250 mm 4 6 mm the temperature of column was set at 30 c analysis time was continued up to 10 0 min whereas the retention time was 3 4 3 7 min for 2 4 d peak 2 4 d removal was calculated based on 2 4 d concentration at different reaction time the oxone concentration pms was measured based on iodometric titration chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by cod ampoules hach chemical using a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 total organic carbon toc was measured by toc analyzer shimadzu potassium hydrogen phthalate khp was used for accuracy of cod and toc measurements total dissolved solids tds 5day biochemical oxygen demand bod 5210b and chloride ions were determined according to standard methods 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of operational parameters the effect of ph was explored on 2 4 d removal under the condition of 20 ma cm2 and 2 mm oxone fig 1 a shows the 2 4 d removal at ph values of 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 as can be seen in the alkaline condition ph 10 0 the degradation efficiency was remarkably reduced this issue can be attributed to the self decomposition of oxone at alkaline condition pms as major source of sulfate radical was decomposed to water oxygen and sulfate ions 24 3 2hso 5 2oh 2so 4 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 4 d removals were 70 1 and 60 4 for ph 4 0 and ph 7 0 respectively as shown ph of 4 indicated high performance for eo process compared to neutral condition ph 7 0 it has been reported in literature that redox potential of free radicals in acidic condition is higher than that in alkaline condition 25 26 this issue can be influential on 2 4 d degradation in addition pk a of 2 4 d is 2 87 27 hence at ph values more than 2 87 its anionic form might be degraded on the surface of anode in electrochemical process current density is a vital factor for degradation reaction of organic pollutants the effect of current density was investigated in the range of 10 40 ma cm2 under the conditions of ph 4 0 2 mm oxone and 90 min reaction time fig 1b demonstrates the effect of current density on 2 4 d removal one can see that increasing in current intensity enhanced the 2 4 d removal 2 4 d removals were 53 3 70 1 82 6 and 83 1 for 5 10 15 20 ma cm2 respectively higher current density resulted in more generation of hydroxyl radical at the anode this phenomenon led to increase of electron transfer to activate oxone for generation of sulfate radical however after 30 ma cm2 removal efficiency did not change significantly in anodic oxidation parasite reactions usually occurs at higher current density in which non oxidizing reactions take place at the surface of anode in this way oxygen evolution occurs at the surface of pbo2 and consequently reduces the hydroxyl radicals eq 4 28 30 4 2pbo 2 h o 2pbo 2 o 2 2h 2e the oxone concentration affects the amount of sulfate radical and degradation of pollutant fig 1c demonstrates the effect of oxone dosage on 2 4 d removal when current density was 30 ma cm2 and the solution ph was 4 0 one can see that in the presence of 1 mm oxone degradation was relatively slow and removal efficiency reached 57 during 90 min electrolysis with increase of oxone concentration to 2 and 3 mm 2 4 d removal was dramatically increased and respectively 82 and 91 of 2 4 d were degraded during 90 min electrolysis time this increase was due to more generation of sulfate radicals to destruct 2 4 d molecules in aqueous solution on the other hand increase of oxone dosage up to 4 mm suppressed the function of eo oxone in 2 4 d removal in sulfate radical based processes excess dosage oxidants may have a negative effect on the efficiency in current study this phenomenon was observed in which excessive oxone scavenged the sulfate radicals based on eq 5 this phenomenon was frequently reported in the literature 26 31 5 hso 5 so 4 so 4 2 so 5 h 3 2 kinetic model and synergistic effect 2 4 d removal was investigated in three conditions sole application of oxone eo and eo oxone the experiment conditions were ph 4 0 3 mm oxone and current density of 30 ma cm2 fig 2 a as can be seen sole application of oxone was ineffective and only 6 of 2 4 d was degraded during 90 min eo could eliminate around 38 of 2 4 d during 90 min electrolysis time in fact the production of hydroxyl radical on the surface of anode and electron transfer were main responsible of 2 4 d degradation in eo process combination of eo and oxone exhibited high efficiency in 2 4 d removal with 91 removal efficiency as above mentioned oxone was activated in the presence of electron to generate sulfate radical as a strong reactive agent which can oxidize 2 4 d to smaller organic compounds moreover oxone may be activated on the surface of anode by reaction with hydroxyl radicals based on the eqs 6 and 7 in this way hydroxyl radical adsorbed on the surface of anode reacted with pms and generated peroxymonosulfate radical so5 which was weak oxidant with negligible reactivity howbeit adjacent so5 on the surface of anode can be joined together to generate so4 and o2 1 32 hence degradation reaction of 2 4 d was accelerated in the presence of oxone 6 pbo 2 h o hso 5 pbo 2 so 5 h 2 o 7 2pbo 2 so 5 2h 2 o 2pbo 2 oh o 2 2so 4 2h the kinetic model of eo and eo oxone for 2 4 d degradation was investigated by pseudo first order according to eq 8 8 ln 2 4 d 2 4 d 0 kt where k is rate constant of pseudo first order min 1 and t is reaction time min fig 2b shows plot of ln 2 4 d 2 4 d0 vs reaction time as can be seen the pseudo first order was well fitted for 2 4 d degradation by eo and eo oxone with r squared 0 98 the rate constant of sole application of oxone was insignificant 0 0003 min 1 while the rate constant of eo was 0 0053 min 1 the combination of eo and oxone extremely improved the rate constant of 2 4 d degradation the rate constant of 2 4 d degradation for eo oxone was 0 0267 min 1 which was 5 times more than that for eo process these results indicated that coupling eo and oxone led to a synergistic effect in the generation of free radicals for attack to organic bonds 3 3 the effect of supporting electrolyte the supporting electrolyte can affect generated free radicals in aops the effect of three electrolytes na2so4 nacl and nano3 in eo oxone process was investigated on 2 4 d removal and their results are presented in fig 3 as can be seen the trend of 2 4 d removal in na2so4 and nacl was approximately the same chloride ion has been known as a strong scavenger for aops 33 however in current study no inhibition effect was observed in the presence of chloride in the presence of chloride several chlorine species were produced in the solution which were able to destruct organic pollutants in this way reaction chains of chlorine species was formed in the bulk solution and the surface of anode regarding the solution ph ph 4 0 among these species cl2 and hocl were dominant species in the solution which were corresponded to degradation of 2 4 d 34 36 9 cl cl ads e 10 cl cl ads cl 2 e 11 cl 2 aq h 2 o hocl h cl 12 hclo clo h 13 h o cl cloh 14 cloh cl oh 15 cl cl cl 2 16 cl 2 h o hocl cl on the other hand hocl can be also generated via reaction of pms with chloride ion based on eq 17 37 38 however it is worthwhile to state that the presence of chloride as supporting electrolyte can form chlorinated organic compounds which may be more toxic than 2 4 d 17 hso 5 cl hocl so 4 2 in case of sodium nitrate nitrate ion is a scavenger for free radicals as can be seen in the presence of sodium nitrate degradation efficiency was significantly diminished compared to sulfate and chloride ions hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were scavenged by nitrate ions eq 18 and produced the nitrate radical with lower reactivity and redox potential e0 2 3 v 39 hence the sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were reduced in the solution and 2 4 d degradation was decreased 18 h o or so 4 no 3 ho or so 4 2 no 3 3 4 the effect of transition metals the transition metals especially cobalt and iron have been used for oxone activation although cobalt is a toxic metal compared to iron high efficacy in oxone activation is justified its application the effect of the presence of cobalt ii and fe ii 0 5 mm was studied on 2 4 d removal in eo oxone process fig 4 a demonstrated 2 4 d removal in eo oxone system in the presence of cobalt and ferrous ion as can be seen cobalt ii and ferrous ions enhanced 2 4 d degradation rate markedly approximately complete degradation of 2 4 d was obtained in the presence of cobalt ii and ferrous ions in eo oxone system this issue was likely due to oxone activation by transition metals m of cobalt and iron according to eq 19 40 41 19 m n hso 5 m n 1 ho so 4 moreover the higher state of transition metal m n 1 can be reduced at the cathode and regenerated mn for more activation of oxone eq 20 in fact ferrous and cobalt ii ions were regenerated at the cathode to propagate the reaction chain of generating free radicals 42 43 20 m n 1 e m n in order to confirm promotional effect of transition metals pms concentration was measured after 90 min reaction time to obtain degree of pms decay fig 4b demonstrated pms decay in three systems one can see that pms decay in eo oxone was 54 5 while with adding cobalt and iron ions pms decay was increased to 72 3 and 70 4 respectively these results proved the performance of transition metals in improvement of the efficiency of the process through pms activation it should be noted that cobalt ions had a slight superiority compared to ferrous ions this superiority has been confirmed by several researchers 40 41 44 3 5 determination of reactive species reactive species in 2 4 d degradation are determined by scavenging experiments in which a strong scavenger for free radicals was used to quench hydroxyl and sulfate radicals ethanol etoh is an alcohol with α hydrogen which can scavenge both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals by high rate constants 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 for so4 and 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 for ho tert butanol t buoh without α hydrogen is a strong scavenger for hydroxyl radical with the rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 whereas its rate constant is 1000 times less for sulfate radical hence the difference between degradation efficiencies in the presence of etoh and t buoh indicated the sulfate radical function 15 45 46 in this way scavenging experiments were conducted in the presence of t buoh 0 4 m and etoh 0 4 m in two systems eo oxone and eo oxone co2 and their results are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a in the presence of etoh in eo oxone 2 4 d degradation was significantly reduced and 2 4 d removal was only 15 indicating both sulfate and hydroxyl radical were the main responsible of 2 4 d removal however this little degradation in the presence of etoh was presumably due to direct electron transfer in anodic oxidation t buoh could inhibit 2 4 d degradation from 91 in control condition to 48 4 indicating the participation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals was almost the same indeed a half of degradation was corresponded to sulfate radical and another half for hydroxyl radical in eo oxone co2 system fig 5b in the presence of etoh 2 4 d removal was remarkably declined while in the presence of t buoh 2 4 d removal was slightly reduced presenting that sulfate radicals were dominant species in the solution for degradation of 2 4 d this phenomenon indicated that cobalt ions had a pivotal role in contribution of sulfate radical generated from oxone activation as a matter of fact cobalt ion affected the mechanism of oxone activation in eo oxone process 3 6 mineralization of 2 4 d in aops the degradation of target pollutant is not adequate hence mineralization of organic pollutants should be considered in current study toc of the solution was monitored during 3 h electrolysis time for two systems of eo oxone and eo oxone co ii fig 6 a shows toc removal for two systems as can be seen toc removal was gradually increased during electrolysis time toc removals were obtained 54 5 and 68 9 for eo oxone and eo oxone co ii respectively these results showed that the presence of cobalt had a promotional effect on eo oxone process and increased the amount of generating free radicals resulting from oxone activation the kinetic model of pseudo first order was used for toc removal for the results of fig 6a and the plot of ln toc toc0 vs time is presented in fig 6b the pseudo first order was well proportioned for both systems the rate constants of toc removal were 0 0054 and 0 0074 min 1 for eo oxone and eo oxone co ii respectively 3 7 application for real agricultural drainage the eo oxone and eo oxone co2 were tested on real agricultural drainage which was collected from haft tappeh city khuzestan province iran experimental conditions were natural ph of the drainage 3 mm oxone 30 ma cm2 and 90 min electrolysis time table 1 shows some characteristics of the agricultural drainage before and after treatment by eo oxone and eo oxone co2 systems 2 4 d was completely eliminated in both systems indicating that eo oxone was an effective process for 2 4 d removal in real matrix toc value as a mineralization index was decreased from 42 1 mg l to 21 0 and 17 9 mg l in eo oxone and eo oxone co2 processes respectively more than 50 mineralization was observed in both systems cod as index of organic compounds was significantly decreased during 90 min electrolysis time in both systems cod removals were 64 and 72 for eo oxone and eo oxone co2 respectively as expected the tds of the drainage was increased which was attributed to oxone salt this issue is the most important disadvantage of sulfate radical based process it should be also noted that oxone salt decreased the solution ph due to the presence of bisulfates in oxone salt 4 conclusion coupling eo process and oxone eo oxone exhibited high efficiency for degradation of persistent organic pollutant such as 2 4 d the excess oxone concentration and alkaline ph had a negative effect on 2 4 d degradation the pseudo first order kinetic explained 2 4 d degradation by eo oxone process with the rate constant of 0 0267 min 1 the coupling of oxone and eo demonstrated a synergistic performance for 2 4 d degradation on contrary of nacl and na2so4 nano3 as supporting electrolyte had an inhibitory effect on 2 4 d removal adding co ii and fe ii to eo oxone improved 2 4 d removal significantly through oxone activation and regeneration of co ii and fe ii at the cathode scavenging experiments showed that both sulfate and hydroxyl radical were equally responsible of 2 4 d degradation in eo oxone process while the presence of cobalt ions increased the participation of sulfate radical moreover the results of 2 4 d degradation in real drainage showed that eo oxone process can be considered as a promising hybrid process for the remediation of contaminated water acknowledgment this research was financially supported by the student research committee ahvaz jundishapur

14593,discharges of phosphorus p from on site wastewater treatment systems generally contribute to eutrophication problems in swedish freshwaters and ultimately in the baltic sea such concerns have led to a growing interest in improving p removal in treatment facilities this study investigated the reduction of p in 12 full scale on site treatment systems featuring sand filters and alkaline p filters by sampling and analysing filter influents and effluents the flow proportional samples collected were analysed for total and dissolved p bod7 total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc and ph seven of the eight investigated sand filters did not provide satisfactory total p reduction the likely explanations are filter clogging and wastewater dilution by extraneous water in addition effluents from four of the eight sand filters had total p concentrations higher than 3 mg l 1 which is the swedish effluent limit recommended for common receiving waters indicating that a subsequent polishing step would be needed six of the nine investigated p filters reduced p adequately with total p concentrations in the effluent ranging between 0 1 and 1 9 mg l 1 the three underperforming p filters had effluent ph values below 9 filter age clogging and hydraulic overload were identified as probable reasons for their poor performance a statistically significant correlation was found between total p reduction and filtrate ph but no significant correlation was detected between organic load in the influent and p reduction by the p filters the p filter media replacement frequency could not be established but filtrate ph appeared to be a good estimator keywords sand filters polonite small scale septic system composite samples 1 introduction eutrophication caused by excess nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p in water bodies is acknowledged as the single largest environmental problem in the baltic sea 1 all swedish waters including lakes rivers and coastal waters have been identified as sensitive to p discharge 2 moreover the gross discharge of p from private small scale wastewater systems septic systems in sweden is as large as the discharge from all municipal wastewater treatment plants together accounting for 15 of the total anthropogenic release of p 3 the swedish regulation for small scale wastewater facilities 25 person equivalents consists of a set of guidelines recommending certain reductions for p n and organic carbon measured as bod 4 the suggested criteria are 70 and 90 removal of total p tot p for common and highly sensitive receiving waters corresponding to tot p effluent concentrations of less than 3 and 1 mg l 1 respectively however it is estimated that less than 50 of the approximately 700 000 existing facilities provide adequate treatment and comply with these guidelines 5 6 thus better understanding of how much p these facilities remove and how long the filters maintain their efficiency after installation is needed on site wastewater treatment facilities in sweden usually consist of primary treatment in a septic tank followed by secondary treatment usually either soil based systems such as sand filter beds or drain fields or package treatment plants both biological and physicochemical processes can occur in secondary treatment additionally where required a tertiary treatment with an alkaline filter p filter can be added as a final polishing step to remove p the effluent water is discharged into the subsoil or into receiving water bodies e g ditches streams lakes or the sea extensive reviews of p removal and recovery technologies 7 and specifically of reactive filter materials for p sorption 8 have highlighted the potential benefits and development of p removal and recycling removal of p in p filters and sand filters is influenced by the hydraulic and organic load of the incoming wastewater 9 10 and the physical and chemical properties of the filter material e g mineralogy grain size and ph 10 12 biofilm growth and clogging may occur and diminish the efficiency of the filter material the efficiency of sand filters with respect to hydraulic and biological behaviour such as biofilm development 10 clogging mechanisms 13 and performance under cold weather conditions 14 15 has been previously studied in laboratory and pilot scale tests and field conditions 16 materials used in p filters for on site treatment have been also studied in laboratory and pilot scale tests 17 18 but only few full scale studies have been published these full scale studies include 19 who investigated the performance of nine filter beds containing filtralite p filter media in several nordic countries and 20 who compared the nutrient removal efficiency of 13 different sand filters in finland despite previous laboratory and pilot scale studies there is a lack of full scale studies on p removal in both sand filters and p filters in particular investigations based on flow proportional sampling instead of grab sampling are rare probably due to the laborious nature of the methodology 20 moreover grab sampling can result in the collection of non representative samples due to the varying flow and concentration of wastewater constituents and can increase the uncertainty range of the results especially when analysing tot p loads 21 the objective of this study was to investigate the reduction of p in full scale on site wastewater treatment systems equipped with either sand filters and or p filters using flow proportional sampling the analysis focused on filter performance and compliance with current guidelines the study also examined whether ph can be used as a parameter for deciding when the filter media needs to be changed 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated facilities twelve on site wastewater treatment facilities a l were investigated table 1 a c sand filters d h sand filters with p filters and i l p filters four of the p filters were installed in small package plants and five were installed downstream from sand filters the remaining three sand filters did not have any downstream treatment the sand filters in facilities a d and e were built according to swedish standards and consisted of a 80 cm layer of filter media sand and gravel particle sizes 2 8 mm with a design load of 30 60 l m 2 d 1 and a typical surface area of 25 m2 22 the lifespan of sand filters has been estimated to 15 years 23 however it is often used for 20 30 years 6 the wastewater was distributed through slotted pipes and filtered vertically through the filter bed to the bottom of the system where it was collected in drainage pipes the sand filters in facilities b and c were smaller in size than the swedish standard and contained plastic crates biomodules to increase their hydraulic capacity sand filters f g and h used a slightly different construction method than the standard and had a layer of drainage baskets on the top biomodules with a triangular cross section about 0 5 m wide where the distribution pipe was located all sand filters were covered with an approximately 30 cm thick layer of soil the nine p filters consisted of bags filled with p sorbing material in eight of them the filter media polonite was used supplier ecofiltration ab sweden placed in a plastic container installed at ground level and operated in down flow d or up flow f l mode in facility e the filter media filtra p supplier wavin laboko ltd was used and placed in two chambers installed at different levels so the wastewater percolated downwards through the filter media in the first chamber and upwards in the second chamber facilities i j k and l had p filters installed inside package plants that functioned as a pre treatment for the p filters alkaline p filters should be replaced after 2 3 of years of use according to the producers 24 facility i was a package plant 4evergreen by biorock consisting of a trickling filter made of fibre material installed inside a hdpe tank where the wastewater percolated through facilities j and k were biop plants that consisted of a pe unit with multi stage biological treatment based on attached growth with no aeration and facility l was an aerated activated sludge system installed inside of a hdpe unit ecobox small by ecotech ab 2 2 water sampling and analyses sampling was carried out between september and october 2015 and between may and august 2016 table 2 for each facility grab samples were taken in the third chamber of the septic tank or from the distribution pumping box where the wastewater was transferred to the sand filter flow proportional samples were taken from the outlets of the sand filters package plants and the p filters the samples were taken at different times of the day over a period of several hours depending on the specific flow it varied greatly between facilities and practicalities regarding equipment and location flow was measured manually volumetric flow measurements using effluent flow for the sand filters and either influent or effluent flow for the p filters at each sampling event two composite samples of approximately 2 to 3 l depending on flow were taken from the effluent water collected from the outlets of the sand filters package plants and p filters over a period of 1 5 2 h approximately total suspended solids tss not measured on all occasions and ph were measured on site the ph was measured using a wtw ph330 ph meter with a wtw sentix41 ph electrode tss was determined following the european standard en 872 2005 26 the samples for determining total and dissolved p dis p total and dissolved organic carbon toc doc and biological oxygen demand bod7 were frozen and stored for later analysis in the laboratory samples for doc and dis p analyses were

septic tank and the effluent from the final treatment step sand filter or p filter hence the estimated p reduction of the system did not include treatment in the septic tank 2 3 tracer tests in three p filters h j k the hydraulic residence time was estimated with tracer tests by using an optical monitoring sonde ysi 600oms v2 with a rhodamine probe ysi 6130 a rhodamine water tracing wt solution with a 70 μg l 1 concentration made from 20 rhodamine wt concentrate was used estimations of the required volume of tracer solution were based on the volume 0 7 m3 and density 730 kg m3 of the filter media in the p filter bag the 0 5 l of the rhodamine wt solution was added to the inlet pipe of the p filters and the rhodamine wt concentration was then measured in the filter effluent the sonde was left in unattended mode collecting data concentration of rhodamine wt measured by the optical sensor over one j two k and six h days in december 2016 the rhodamine wt concentration was measured every two minutes j k and five minutes h the data was processed based on time of the first arrival 2 4 statistical analysis the concentrations of tot p dis p toc and doc as well as the ph were weighted for

assumed that the influent flow rate to the filter was the same as the measured effluent flow rate and vice versa when the influent flow rate was the one measured instead the software minitab 31 was used for the statistical analyses spearmańs rank order correlation was used to analyse the nonparametric data normality test anderson darling applied 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the average concentrations of tot p measured in the effluent from the septic tanks sand filters package plants and p filters in the studied facilities a l the concentrations of tot p in the septic tank effluent varied greatly among the study facilities ranging between 6 and 29 mg l 1 fig 1 possibly as a result of the different water consumption patterns and contribution by different sources of p in each household such as human waste and the extent of synthetic detergent use concentrations ranging between 1 2 and 21 8 mg l 1 are normally found in septic tank effluents as reported in a u s study 32 modelling the fate and transport of nutrients from on site wastewater systems 3 1 phosphorus reduction in the sand filters four b f g and h of the eight investigated sand filters a h had effluent concentrations for tot p higher than 7 5 mg l 1 fig 1 exceeding the swedish recommended value for common receiving waters 3 mg l 1 and making downstream p treatment advisable the highest average concentration of tot p in the effluent from the sand filter in facility f was almost 15 mg l 1 fig 1 the highest tot p reduction was observed in sand filters d and h showing a 62 and 70 reduction respectively fig 2 which is acceptable according to current swedish guidelines although both sand filters were quite different with respect to the influent p load the tot p concentration in the effluent from sand filter d was 1 8 mg l 1 which is below the recommended value of 3 mg l 1 whereas in sand filter h the effluent concentration was still high 10 6 mg l 1 despite the good p reduction capacity of the sand filter this was caused by the very high initial concentration of tot p in the septic tank effluent 29 3 mg l 1 thus good tot p reduction in a sand filter does not necessarily translate into an acceptable tot p concentration in the effluent low p reduction was observed for three sand filters b f and g in sand filter b which had been in operation for three years the measured water flow through the filter was low 3 2 l h 1 with a high suspended solids content at the outlet tss 17 mg l 1 high bacterial concentrations 25 dark colour and strong odour indicating that this filter was clogged the main reasons causing clogging are high concentrations of extracellular bacterial slimes in the sand pores accumulation of suspended solids or precipitation and deposition of compounds such as calcium carbonate 13 33 moreover clogging can persist and increase when ponding of waster occurs between the batches 34 neither the clogging characteristics nor any obvious malfunction were observed in sand filters f and g five and three years in operation respectively their inefficiency could be explained by the chemical composition of the sand used gill et al 35 discussed the clear relationship between p removal in subsoils and soil mineralogy after studying on site wastewater effluent discharge in six sites in ireland at ph 6 as observed in the influent and effluent of the sand filters f and g in this study the p removal capacity of the sand is dominated by a combination of physical adsorption to iron fe and aluminium al oxides and precipitation of p as sparingly soluble calcium phosphates 11 35 according to eveborn et al 36 mechanisms for p removal in sand filters were explained by the strong relation between oxalate extractable p and al hence a lack of al or fe compounds in the sand filters f and g could have hampered the adsorption and mineral precipitation of p the distribution of wastewater in the filter surface could also affect the p removal as uneven distribution has been shown to promote preferential flows and decrease the potential to remove p in sand filters 37 38 at least three a c e of the eight investigated sand filters had likely dilution problems i e extraneous soil ground rainwater infiltrating into the filter bed and diluting the wastewater dilution was suspected to occur based on field observations such as high measured water flow through the sand filters even when the users were not at home and when the pump transporting wastewater from the septic tank was not operating during collection as well as very clear effluent water in these facilities the low p concentration could therefore be explained by the dilution of the phosphorus concentration and not the filters efficiency for this reason correct installation and supervision of sand filters are crucial and highly recommended to ensure that the filter material is properly sealed and there is no infiltration exfiltration between the treatment facility and the surrounding environment p reduction occurring in the septic tank was not investigated in this study but this reduction has been estimated to be 15 10 of the incoming quantity 5 assuming this percentage of reduction in the septic tank facilities b f and g whose sand filters showed low p reduction would be estimated to reach only 33 39 tot p reduction which is still below the recommended reduction of 70 suggested by the swedish guidelines the low p reduction capacity of sand filters had already been shown in previous studies e g eveborn et al 36 reported 8 16 p removal in four sand filters by using a mass balance approach while vilpas and santala 20 reported low performance from two conventional sand filters with tot p concentrations in the effluent exceeding the finnish regulation of 3 mg l 1 a similar trend was shown by wilson 39 who investigated the long term effects of filter length and wastewater loading on performance of eight sand filters in canada in the mentioned study the p removal decreased with time as adsorption sites in the sand filters became exhausted the estimated removal of tot p in sand filters in sweden including reduction in septic tank is 50 30 5 which is a wide range that reflects the expected large variations in removal efficiency sizeable variation in sand filter performance and their general low p reduction was corroborated in this study the four package plants i l reduced p to a lesser extent than the sand filters the influent tot p concentrations ranged between 7 5 and 11 6 mg l 1 of tot p fig 1 and the highest reduction rate in the package plants was only about 11 facility k fig 2 in contrast to the sand filters these units have not been designed as stand alone treatment systems but as a pre treatment step before the p filter units to reduce organic matter hence residence time is short and p treatment capacity is low 3 2 phosphorus reduction in the p filters six out of the nine investigated p filters generally reduced p satisfactorily and covered for a considerable amount of tot p removed in the treatment facility the effluent p concentrations of the p filters that functioned well ranged between 0 15 and 1 9 mg l 1 fig 1 and the relative contribution to p reduction ranged between 26 and 91 fig 2 five of the studied p filters d h had sand filters upstream while four i l were contained within package plants whose biological treatment unit is not designed to remove p eight out of nine p filters reduced between 43 and 99 of the tot p of the influent to the p filter but one p filter e reduced only 8 of p calculated using influent and effluent concentrations shown in table 3 most of the p measured in the influent water to the p filters was in the dissolved phase dis p 93 on average table 3 however the share of dis p in the effluent was smaller than in the influent 55 on average which could indicate that some of the dis p precipitated as bound particles within the filter but to some extent was washed out with the water possibly because of the small size of the particles thus escaping from the filter material as studied by herrmann et al 9 the investigated p filters that worked well and had tot p effluent concentrations below 3 mg l 1 namely d f g h i and l had varied influent tot p concentrations for example p filter d had already low concentrations of tot p in the influent 1 8 mg l 1 while the rest had much higher influent concentrations ranging from 7 5 to 14 8 mg l 1 table 3 this suggests that the filter is able to function adequately and remove most of the tot p regardless of influent concentration within this range 14 8 1 8 mg l 1 three p filters e j and k did not remove p satisfactorily j and k had the highest average effluent concentration of tot p 3 04 and 4 4 mg l 1 respectively p filter e was possibly saturated with respect to p and because of its construction some of the influent water bypassed it without passing through the filter material the ph in the effluent was very low around 6 and almost no p was reduced p filter e was the oldest p filter in the study built in 2009 and was more than six years old by the time the samples were taken the filter medium used was filtra p in contrast to all the other investigated p filters which contained the filter medium polonite both filter media have been reported to have significant potential for p removal although filtra p has been shown in column experiments to be prone to clogging due to structural degradation of the material which in practice translates into a shorter service life 40 the two other p filters with low p reduction j k were highly loaded j 79 4 l m 2 h 1 k 58 5 l m 2 h 1 because of the number of users they provided service to as compared to the rest of the facilities the ph in the effluents of both filters was below 9 although the filters had been installed only around two weeks before sampling started the low ph could be explained by the washing out of calcium from the filter caused by the high hydraulic load as previously studied by herrmann et al 9 furthermore the high hydraulic load corresponds to short residence time so that there was probably not sufficient time for the calcium phosphates to precipitate another possible explanation would be differences in the pore distribution and the formation of preference channels which can also affect the sorption efficiency of p filters as discussed in 41 the organic matter concentrations in the influent to the p filters in facilities j and k were in the same range as for most of the other p filters with high p reduction rates table 3 ruling out high organic matter influent concentrations as a reason for the low p reduction in facilities j and k 3 2 1 ph dependency of phosphorus reduction in the p filters the effluent ph of the p filters ranged between 6 0 and 12 1 table 3 the p filter with the highest tot p reduction f was also the one with the highest effluent ph 12 1 fig 3 significant correlation was found between the p reduction in the p filters and the ph measured in their effluents spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 833 p 005 higher ph values favour the precipitation of calcium phosphate 42 which is the filters main retention mechanism 40 in previous column studies 12 found a positive correlation and a strong relationship between the p removal in polonite filters and ph nilsson et al 43 reported the same positive correlation but only when the p filters were loaded with high bod concentrations 120 11 mg l 1 in the same study no significant correlation was found between the p removal and ph when the polonite filters were loaded with low bod concentrations 20 5 mg l 1 which is in the range of the corresponding data in the present study table 3 however the positive correlation between ph and p removal in p filters with influent bod concentrations ranging from 1 9 to 31 4 mg l 1 was confirmed in this study the p filters with an effluent ph of 9 4 or higher had 75 or more tot p reduction fig 3 however ph is not the only factor affecting the p reduction in the p filter and several facilities showed different rates of p reduction despite similar phs for example in p filters j and k with similar ph values of 8 6 and 8 8 respectively residence times were estimated to be considerably different fig 4 and their p reductions differed by approx 16 percentage points this indicates that the residence time of the wastewater in the p filter is an important factor governing p removal an earlier comparative study of various filter materials by cucarella and renman 44 concluded that low effluent ph values indicated low p sorption but higher ph values did not necessarily imply greater p sorption these findings are in line with the results of the present study when comparing the performance of the p filter in facility g with the other facilities with effluent ph 9 e g facility g had higher effluent ph than facilities d l i and h but lower p reduction fig 3 3 2 2 effect of organic load on phosphorus reduction in the p filters the toc concentrations in the influent to the p filters were rather low ranging between 8 and 40 mg l 1 toc table 3 no significant correlation was found between p reduction in the p filters and the toc in the influent to the filters spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 150 p 700 previous studies on the effect of organic matter content in wastewater on p removal in p filters have shown that higher p removal is achieved when extensive pre treatment of the wastewater occurs 12 43 a study with batch experiments 42 found that humic substances negatively affected phosphate removal efficiency when the ph of the solution was 8 but had almost no effect when the solution had a ph of 9 the inhibitory effect of the humic substances on phosphate precipitation was explained by the combination of calcium and humic substances and by the blocking of active growth sites on newly nucleated precipitates of calcium phosphate similarly the lack of correlation between p reduction and influent toc in the present study could be explained by the fact that effluent ph from only one facility e was low 6 0 table 3 while effluent ph for the other eight facilities ranged between 8 6 and 12 1 hence for the statistical analysis the inhibitory effect of organic matter on p precipitation might have been small because most of the facilities had a high ph in column experiments 43 reported a significant positive correlation between toc removal in polonite filters and ph concentration in the effluent for low concentrations of bod 20 5 mg l 1 however this was not confirmed in the present study which found no significant correlation spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 133 p 732 when comparing effluent ph and toc reduction in the p filter 3 2 3 estimating hydraulic residence time in the p filters tracer tests were carried out to estimate the arrival times of the influent water in three p filters h j and k in p filter h the rhodamine wt was detected in the effluent after approximately 5 5 days fig 4 in p filters j and k the rhodamine wt was detected in the effluent after 1 5 h and 4 5 h respectively fig 4 the water flow was not measured during the tests but average flows from previous sampling campaigns were 5 3 39 9 and 29 4 l h 1 in p filter h j and k respectively in p filters h and k the end transit pulse of the rhodamine was not reached hence no estimations of the flow rate were made however the end transit pulse of the rhodamine was reached in p filter j the peak concentration of rhodamine was achieved after approximately 80 min decreasing asymptotically afterwards the calculated average flow for this facility based on the measured rhodamine concentrations and assuming complete recovery of the rhodamine wt was 0 23 l h 1 the twofold difference between the measured flow during the sampling campaign 39 9 l h 1 and the calculated average flow 0 23 l h 1 may be due to several reasons explanations include the lack of pumping cycles during night hours the uncompleted mixing of rhodamine with the influent water which would consequently affect the detection and or the presence of holes or cracks in the bag that would allow the water outflow without being detected by the sensor the oscillations observed in the graph for p filter k may show the system s pumping cycles the observed time of arrival was inversely related to the previously measured wastewater flow although the flow measurements were carried out during limited time periods table 2 higher p reduction occurred in the filter with the longest arrival time h and lower reduction in the filter with the shortest arrival time k possibly because high loading rates have washed out more p precipitates or reactive calcium ions and the short residence time was insufficient to form calcium p precipitates previous column experiments with filtralite p have shown that a short residence time 15 min when wastewater was used was sufficient for p removal in p filters 9 however more time might be needed for p that has already reacted to be retained in the filter material the short residence time in p filters j and k and the higher flows may possibly have had a negative effect on the binding capacity of the p filters 3 2 4 when and how often should p filter media be changed according to the manufacturers of polonite ecofiltration nordic ab p filters are built to maintain high p reduction during the first 2 4 years depending on load with decreasing reduction during the remainder of the filteŕs life cycle based on data obtained and the field observations in this study it is difficult to determine how often the p filters should be changed both old e 6 years and new p filters j k 2 weeks showed low p reduction but for different reasons age and clogging were assumed to account for the poor performance of p filter e while the high hydraulic load hindered the performance of p filters j and k the ph in the effluent to all these p filters e j and k was below 9 suggesting that ph is a good indicator for estimating filter performance p filters showed high reduction rates both when the influent p concentrations were high e g facility f 14 78 mg l and when they were low e g facility d 1 80 mg l indicating that the influent p concentration is not decisive for their functioning at least for the concentration range covered in this study a review of sorption filter materials 44 found a clear tendency for higher p sorption capacity of the materials investigated with increasing initial p concentration however the studies selected in the review 44 included a wide variety of materials such as blast furnace slag fly ash filtralite p and shell sand and the initial p concentrations ranged from normal values of 0 30 mg p l 1 to very elevated concentrations of 10 000 mg p l 1 pratt et al 45 argued that the complex relation between the p filters lifespan and the hydraulic retention time hrt makes it difficult to estimate the filters lifespan as flow dynamics weathering reactions and removal mechanisms must be taken into account continuous flow conditions are needed to predict the long term performance and lifespan of the p filters conditions that are often not met in full scale systems 4 conclusions this study evaluated the reduction of p in 12 full scale on site wastewater facilities with two general types of filters used individually and in combination sand filters and p filters and compared the effluent concentrations of tot p to current swedish guidelines only one sand filter d of four was confirmed to remove p satisfactorily effluent concentration below 3 mg p l 1 the inefficiency of the four sand filters that did not function adequately discharged more than 3 mg p l 1 indicates that a downstream treatment step is needed the remaining three sand filters were suspected to have dilution problems this means that correct installation and proper sealing of the filter must be ensured to prevent mixing wastewater with other water sources in order to achieve adequate p reduction within the treatment unit six out of nine of the investigated p filters generally removed p well 75 99 p reduction and accounted for a considerable amount of tot p reduced in the treatment facilities with the exception of one filter that was old and clogged and two other filters that had to cope with high hydraulic loads the analysis found a significant positive correlation between p reduction in the p filters and ph measured in the effluent indicating that ph could be used as an indicator of p filter efficiency in the three p filters that worked insufficiently with effluent concentrations higher than 3 mg p l 1 j k or 0 7 tot p reduction e when ph was 8 8 or less no significant correlation was found between the reduction of p in the p filters and the toc measured in the influent to the filters it may be that the low incoming toc concentrations and the high ph found in the majority of the p filters prevented this effect from reaching quantifiable levels with the low incoming toc the inhibitory effect of organic matter on p precipitation was probably small it was difficult to determine how often the filter media in p filters should be changed possibly due to the variation in the data in this study and because the filters included in it were rather new except for p filter e with proper installation the p filters in the study that handled a moderate load had a ph above 9 4 and not too many years of use 2 4 years as suggested by manufacturers functioned well and reduced the incoming concentration of tot p to below 1 9 mg p l 1 acknowledgements we thankfully acknowledge the financial support provided by the

14593,discharges of phosphorus p from on site wastewater treatment systems generally contribute to eutrophication problems in swedish freshwaters and ultimately in the baltic sea such concerns have led to a growing interest in improving p removal in treatment facilities this study investigated the reduction of p in 12 full scale on site treatment systems featuring sand filters and alkaline p filters by sampling and analysing filter influents and effluents the flow proportional samples collected were analysed for total and dissolved p bod7 total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc and ph seven of the eight investigated sand filters did not provide satisfactory total p reduction the likely explanations are filter clogging and wastewater dilution by extraneous water in addition effluents from four of the eight sand filters had total p concentrations higher than 3 mg l 1 which is the swedish effluent limit recommended for common receiving waters indicating that a subsequent polishing step would be needed six of the nine investigated p filters reduced p adequately with total p concentrations in the effluent ranging between 0 1 and 1 9 mg l 1 the three underperforming p filters had effluent ph values below 9 filter age clogging and hydraulic overload were identified as probable reasons for their poor performance a statistically significant correlation was found between total p reduction and filtrate ph but no significant correlation was detected between organic load in the influent and p reduction by the p filters the p filter media replacement frequency could not be established but filtrate ph appeared to be a good estimator keywords sand filters polonite small scale septic system composite samples 1 introduction eutrophication caused by excess nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p in water bodies is acknowledged as the single largest environmental problem in the baltic sea 1 all swedish waters including lakes rivers and coastal waters have been identified as sensitive to p discharge 2 moreover the gross discharge of p from private small scale wastewater systems septic systems in sweden is as large as the discharge from all municipal wastewater treatment plants together accounting for 15 of the total anthropogenic release of p 3 the swedish regulation for small scale wastewater facilities 25 person equivalents consists of a set of guidelines recommending certain reductions for p n and organic carbon measured as bod 4 the suggested criteria are 70 and 90 removal of total p tot p for common and highly sensitive receiving waters corresponding to tot p effluent concentrations of less than 3 and 1 mg l 1 respectively however it is estimated that less than 50 of the approximately 700 000 existing facilities provide adequate treatment and comply with these guidelines 5 6 thus better understanding of how much p these facilities remove and how long the filters maintain their efficiency after installation is needed on site wastewater treatment facilities in sweden usually consist of primary treatment in a septic tank followed by secondary treatment usually either soil based systems such as sand filter beds or drain fields or package treatment plants both biological and physicochemical processes can occur in secondary treatment additionally where required a tertiary treatment with an alkaline filter p filter can be added as a final polishing step to remove p the effluent water is discharged into the subsoil or into receiving water bodies e g ditches streams lakes or the sea extensive reviews of p removal and recovery technologies 7 and specifically of reactive filter materials for p sorption 8 have highlighted the potential benefits and development of p removal and recycling removal of p in p filters and sand filters is influenced by the hydraulic and organic load of the incoming wastewater 9 10 and the physical and chemical properties of the filter material e g mineralogy grain size and ph 10 12 biofilm growth and clogging may occur and diminish the efficiency of the filter material the efficiency of sand filters with respect to hydraulic and biological behaviour such as biofilm development 10 clogging mechanisms 13 and performance under cold weather conditions 14 15 has been previously studied in laboratory and pilot scale tests and field conditions 16 materials used in p filters for on site treatment have been also studied in laboratory and pilot scale tests 17 18 but only few full scale studies have been published these full scale studies include 19 who investigated the performance of nine filter beds containing filtralite p filter media in several nordic countries and 20 who compared the nutrient removal efficiency of 13 different sand filters in finland despite previous laboratory and pilot scale studies there is a lack of full scale studies on p removal in both sand filters and p filters in particular investigations based on flow proportional sampling instead of grab sampling are rare probably due to the laborious nature of the methodology 20 moreover grab sampling can result in the collection of non representative samples due to the varying flow and concentration of wastewater constituents and can increase the uncertainty range of the results especially when analysing tot p loads 21 the objective of this study was to investigate the reduction of p in full scale on site wastewater treatment systems equipped with either sand filters and or p filters using flow proportional sampling the analysis focused on filter performance and compliance with current guidelines the study also examined whether ph can be used as a parameter for deciding when the filter media needs to be changed 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigated facilities twelve on site wastewater treatment facilities a l were investigated table 1 a c sand filters d h sand filters with p filters and i l p filters four of the p filters were installed in small package plants and five were installed downstream from sand filters the remaining three sand filters did not have any downstream treatment the sand filters in facilities a d and e were built according to swedish standards and consisted of a 80 cm layer of filter media sand and gravel particle sizes 2 8 mm with a design load of 30 60 l m 2 d 1 and a typical surface area of 25 m2 22 the lifespan of sand filters has been estimated to 15 years 23 however it is often used for 20 30 years 6 the wastewater was distributed through slotted pipes and filtered vertically through the filter bed to the bottom of the system where it was collected in drainage pipes the sand filters in facilities b and c were smaller in size than the swedish standard and contained plastic crates biomodules to increase their hydraulic capacity sand filters f g and h used a slightly different construction method than the standard and had a layer of drainage baskets on the top biomodules with a triangular cross section about 0 5 m wide where the distribution pipe was located all sand filters were covered with an approximately 30 cm thick layer of soil the nine p filters consisted of bags filled with p sorbing material in eight of them the filter media polonite was used supplier ecofiltration ab sweden placed in a plastic container installed at ground level and operated in down flow d or up flow f l mode in facility e the filter media filtra p supplier wavin laboko ltd was used and placed in two chambers installed at different levels so the wastewater percolated downwards through the filter media in the first chamber and upwards in the second chamber facilities i j k and l had p filters installed inside package plants that functioned as a pre treatment for the p filters alkaline p filters should be replaced after 2 3 of years of use according to the producers 24 facility i was a package plant 4evergreen by biorock consisting of a trickling filter made of fibre material installed inside a hdpe tank where the wastewater percolated through facilities j and k were biop plants that consisted of a pe unit with multi stage biological treatment based on attached growth with no aeration and facility l was an aerated activated sludge system installed inside of a hdpe unit ecobox small by ecotech ab 2 2 water sampling and analyses sampling was carried out between september and october 2015 and between may and august 2016 table 2 for each facility grab samples were taken in the third chamber of the septic tank or from the distribution pumping box where the wastewater was transferred to the sand filter flow proportional samples were taken from the outlets of the sand filters package plants and the p filters the samples were taken at different times of the day over a period of several hours depending on the specific flow it varied greatly between facilities and practicalities regarding equipment and location flow was measured manually volumetric flow measurements using effluent flow for the sand filters and either influent or effluent flow for the p filters at each sampling event two composite samples of approximately 2 to 3 l depending on flow were taken from the effluent water collected from the outlets of the sand filters package plants and p filters over a period of 1 5 2 h approximately total suspended solids tss not measured on all occasions and ph were measured on site the ph was measured using a wtw ph330 ph meter with a wtw sentix41 ph electrode tss was determined following the european standard en 872 2005 26 the samples for determining total and dissolved p dis p total and dissolved organic carbon toc doc and biological oxygen demand bod7 were frozen and stored for later analysis in the laboratory samples for doc and dis p analyses were

septic tank and the effluent from the final treatment step sand filter or p filter hence the estimated p reduction of the system did not include treatment in the septic tank 2 3 tracer tests in three p filters h j k the hydraulic residence time was estimated with tracer tests by using an optical monitoring sonde ysi 600oms v2 with a rhodamine probe ysi 6130 a rhodamine water tracing wt solution with a 70 μg l 1 concentration made from 20 rhodamine wt concentrate was used estimations of the required volume of tracer solution were based on the volume 0 7 m3 and density 730 kg m3 of the filter media in the p filter bag the 0 5 l of the rhodamine wt solution was added to the inlet pipe of the p filters and the rhodamine wt concentration was then measured in the filter effluent the sonde was left in unattended mode collecting data concentration of rhodamine wt measured by the optical sensor over one j two k and six h days in december 2016 the rhodamine wt concentration was measured every two minutes j k and five minutes h the data was processed based on time of the first arrival 2 4 statistical analysis the concentrations of tot p dis p toc and doc as well as the ph were weighted for

assumed that the influent flow rate to the filter was the same as the measured effluent flow rate and vice versa when the influent flow rate was the one measured instead the software minitab 31 was used for the statistical analyses spearmańs rank order correlation was used to analyse the nonparametric data normality test anderson darling applied 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the average concentrations of tot p measured in the effluent from the septic tanks sand filters package plants and p filters in the studied facilities a l the concentrations of tot p in the septic tank effluent varied greatly among the study facilities ranging between 6 and 29 mg l 1 fig 1 possibly as a result of the different water consumption patterns and contribution by different sources of p in each household such as human waste and the extent of synthetic detergent use concentrations ranging between 1 2 and 21 8 mg l 1 are normally found in septic tank effluents as reported in a u s study 32 modelling the fate and transport of nutrients from on site wastewater systems 3 1 phosphorus reduction in the sand filters four b f g and h of the eight investigated sand filters a h had effluent concentrations for tot p higher than 7 5 mg l 1 fig 1 exceeding the swedish recommended value for common receiving waters 3 mg l 1 and making downstream p treatment advisable the highest average concentration of tot p in the effluent from the sand filter in facility f was almost 15 mg l 1 fig 1 the highest tot p reduction was observed in sand filters d and h showing a 62 and 70 reduction respectively fig 2 which is acceptable according to current swedish guidelines although both sand filters were quite different with respect to the influent p load the tot p concentration in the effluent from sand filter d was 1 8 mg l 1 which is below the recommended value of 3 mg l 1 whereas in sand filter h the effluent concentration was still high 10 6 mg l 1 despite the good p reduction capacity of the sand filter this was caused by the very high initial concentration of tot p in the septic tank effluent 29 3 mg l 1 thus good tot p reduction in a sand filter does not necessarily translate into an acceptable tot p concentration in the effluent low p reduction was observed for three sand filters b f and g in sand filter b which had been in operation for three years the measured water flow through the filter was low 3 2 l h 1 with a high suspended solids content at the outlet tss 17 mg l 1 high bacterial concentrations 25 dark colour and strong odour indicating that this filter was clogged the main reasons causing clogging are high concentrations of extracellular bacterial slimes in the sand pores accumulation of suspended solids or precipitation and deposition of compounds such as calcium carbonate 13 33 moreover clogging can persist and increase when ponding of waster occurs between the batches 34 neither the clogging characteristics nor any obvious malfunction were observed in sand filters f and g five and three years in operation respectively their inefficiency could be explained by the chemical composition of the sand used gill et al 35 discussed the clear relationship between p removal in subsoils and soil mineralogy after studying on site wastewater effluent discharge in six sites in ireland at ph 6 as observed in the influent and effluent of the sand filters f and g in this study the p removal capacity of the sand is dominated by a combination of physical adsorption to iron fe and aluminium al oxides and precipitation of p as sparingly soluble calcium phosphates 11 35 according to eveborn et al 36 mechanisms for p removal in sand filters were explained by the strong relation between oxalate extractable p and al hence a lack of al or fe compounds in the sand filters f and g could have hampered the adsorption and mineral precipitation of p the distribution of wastewater in the filter surface could also affect the p removal as uneven distribution has been shown to promote preferential flows and decrease the potential to remove p in sand filters 37 38 at least three a c e of the eight investigated sand filters had likely dilution problems i e extraneous soil ground rainwater infiltrating into the filter bed and diluting the wastewater dilution was suspected to occur based on field observations such as high measured water flow through the sand filters even when the users were not at home and when the pump transporting wastewater from the septic tank was not operating during collection as well as very clear effluent water in these facilities the low p concentration could therefore be explained by the dilution of the phosphorus concentration and not the filters efficiency for this reason correct installation and supervision of sand filters are crucial and highly recommended to ensure that the filter material is properly sealed and there is no infiltration exfiltration between the treatment facility and the surrounding environment p reduction occurring in the septic tank was not investigated in this study but this reduction has been estimated to be 15 10 of the incoming quantity 5 assuming this percentage of reduction in the septic tank facilities b f and g whose sand filters showed low p reduction would be estimated to reach only 33 39 tot p reduction which is still below the recommended reduction of 70 suggested by the swedish guidelines the low p reduction capacity of sand filters had already been shown in previous studies e g eveborn et al 36 reported 8 16 p removal in four sand filters by using a mass balance approach while vilpas and santala 20 reported low performance from two conventional sand filters with tot p concentrations in the effluent exceeding the finnish regulation of 3 mg l 1 a similar trend was shown by wilson 39 who investigated the long term effects of filter length and wastewater loading on performance of eight sand filters in canada in the mentioned study the p removal decreased with time as adsorption sites in the sand filters became exhausted the estimated removal of tot p in sand filters in sweden including reduction in septic tank is 50 30 5 which is a wide range that reflects the expected large variations in removal efficiency sizeable variation in sand filter performance and their general low p reduction was corroborated in this study the four package plants i l reduced p to a lesser extent than the sand filters the influent tot p concentrations ranged between 7 5 and 11 6 mg l 1 of tot p fig 1 and the highest reduction rate in the package plants was only about 11 facility k fig 2 in contrast to the sand filters these units have not been designed as stand alone treatment systems but as a pre treatment step before the p filter units to reduce organic matter hence residence time is short and p treatment capacity is low 3 2 phosphorus reduction in the p filters six out of the nine investigated p filters generally reduced p satisfactorily and covered for a considerable amount of tot p removed in the treatment facility the effluent p concentrations of the p filters that functioned well ranged between 0 15 and 1 9 mg l 1 fig 1 and the relative contribution to p reduction ranged between 26 and 91 fig 2 five of the studied p filters d h had sand filters upstream while four i l were contained within package plants whose biological treatment unit is not designed to remove p eight out of nine p filters reduced between 43 and 99 of the tot p of the influent to the p filter but one p filter e reduced only 8 of p calculated using influent and effluent concentrations shown in table 3 most of the p measured in the influent water to the p filters was in the dissolved phase dis p 93 on average table 3 however the share of dis p in the effluent was smaller than in the influent 55 on average which could indicate that some of the dis p precipitated as bound particles within the filter but to some extent was washed out with the water possibly because of the small size of the particles thus escaping from the filter material as studied by herrmann et al 9 the investigated p filters that worked well and had tot p effluent concentrations below 3 mg l 1 namely d f g h i and l had varied influent tot p concentrations for example p filter d had already low concentrations of tot p in the influent 1 8 mg l 1 while the rest had much higher influent concentrations ranging from 7 5 to 14 8 mg l 1 table 3 this suggests that the filter is able to function adequately and remove most of the tot p regardless of influent concentration within this range 14 8 1 8 mg l 1 three p filters e j and k did not remove p satisfactorily j and k had the highest average effluent concentration of tot p 3 04 and 4 4 mg l 1 respectively p filter e was possibly saturated with respect to p and because of its construction some of the influent water bypassed it without passing through the filter material the ph in the effluent was very low around 6 and almost no p was reduced p filter e was the oldest p filter in the study built in 2009 and was more than six years old by the time the samples were taken the filter medium used was filtra p in contrast to all the other investigated p filters which contained the filter medium polonite both filter media have been reported to have significant potential for p removal although filtra p has been shown in column experiments to be prone to clogging due to structural degradation of the material which in practice translates into a shorter service life 40 the two other p filters with low p reduction j k were highly loaded j 79 4 l m 2 h 1 k 58 5 l m 2 h 1 because of the number of users they provided service to as compared to the rest of the facilities the ph in the effluents of both filters was below 9 although the filters had been installed only around two weeks before sampling started the low ph could be explained by the washing out of calcium from the filter caused by the high hydraulic load as previously studied by herrmann et al 9 furthermore the high hydraulic load corresponds to short residence time so that there was probably not sufficient time for the calcium phosphates to precipitate another possible explanation would be differences in the pore distribution and the formation of preference channels which can also affect the sorption efficiency of p filters as discussed in 41 the organic matter concentrations in the influent to the p filters in facilities j and k were in the same range as for most of the other p filters with high p reduction rates table 3 ruling out high organic matter influent concentrations as a reason for the low p reduction in facilities j and k 3 2 1 ph dependency of phosphorus reduction in the p filters the effluent ph of the p filters ranged between 6 0 and 12 1 table 3 the p filter with the highest tot p reduction f was also the one with the highest effluent ph 12 1 fig 3 significant correlation was found between the p reduction in the p filters and the ph measured in their effluents spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 833 p 005 higher ph values favour the precipitation of calcium phosphate 42 which is the filters main retention mechanism 40 in previous column studies 12 found a positive correlation and a strong relationship between the p removal in polonite filters and ph nilsson et al 43 reported the same positive correlation but only when the p filters were loaded with high bod concentrations 120 11 mg l 1 in the same study no significant correlation was found between the p removal and ph when the polonite filters were loaded with low bod concentrations 20 5 mg l 1 which is in the range of the corresponding data in the present study table 3 however the positive correlation between ph and p removal in p filters with influent bod concentrations ranging from 1 9 to 31 4 mg l 1 was confirmed in this study the p filters with an effluent ph of 9 4 or higher had 75 or more tot p reduction fig 3 however ph is not the only factor affecting the p reduction in the p filter and several facilities showed different rates of p reduction despite similar phs for example in p filters j and k with similar ph values of 8 6 and 8 8 respectively residence times were estimated to be considerably different fig 4 and their p reductions differed by approx 16 percentage points this indicates that the residence time of the wastewater in the p filter is an important factor governing p removal an earlier comparative study of various filter materials by cucarella and renman 44 concluded that low effluent ph values indicated low p sorption but higher ph values did not necessarily imply greater p sorption these findings are in line with the results of the present study when comparing the performance of the p filter in facility g with the other facilities with effluent ph 9 e g facility g had higher effluent ph than facilities d l i and h but lower p reduction fig 3 3 2 2 effect of organic load on phosphorus reduction in the p filters the toc concentrations in the influent to the p filters were rather low ranging between 8 and 40 mg l 1 toc table 3 no significant correlation was found between p reduction in the p filters and the toc in the influent to the filters spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 150 p 700 previous studies on the effect of organic matter content in wastewater on p removal in p filters have shown that higher p removal is achieved when extensive pre treatment of the wastewater occurs 12 43 a study with batch experiments 42 found that humic substances negatively affected phosphate removal efficiency when the ph of the solution was 8 but had almost no effect when the solution had a ph of 9 the inhibitory effect of the humic substances on phosphate precipitation was explained by the combination of calcium and humic substances and by the blocking of active growth sites on newly nucleated precipitates of calcium phosphate similarly the lack of correlation between p reduction and influent toc in the present study could be explained by the fact that effluent ph from only one facility e was low 6 0 table 3 while effluent ph for the other eight facilities ranged between 8 6 and 12 1 hence for the statistical analysis the inhibitory effect of organic matter on p precipitation might have been small because most of the facilities had a high ph in column experiments 43 reported a significant positive correlation between toc removal in polonite filters and ph concentration in the effluent for low concentrations of bod 20 5 mg l 1 however this was not confirmed in the present study which found no significant correlation spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 133 p 732 when comparing effluent ph and toc reduction in the p filter 3 2 3 estimating hydraulic residence time in the p filters tracer tests were carried out to estimate the arrival times of the influent water in three p filters h j and k in p filter h the rhodamine wt was detected in the effluent after approximately 5 5 days fig 4 in p filters j and k the rhodamine wt was detected in the effluent after 1 5 h and 4 5 h respectively fig 4 the water flow was not measured during the tests but average flows from previous sampling campaigns were 5 3 39 9 and 29 4 l h 1 in p filter h j and k respectively in p filters h and k the end transit pulse of the rhodamine was not reached hence no estimations of the flow rate were made however the end transit pulse of the rhodamine was reached in p filter j the peak concentration of rhodamine was achieved after approximately 80 min decreasing asymptotically afterwards the calculated average flow for this facility based on the measured rhodamine concentrations and assuming complete recovery of the rhodamine wt was 0 23 l h 1 the twofold difference between the measured flow during the sampling campaign 39 9 l h 1 and the calculated average flow 0 23 l h 1 may be due to several reasons explanations include the lack of pumping cycles during night hours the uncompleted mixing of rhodamine with the influent water which would consequently affect the detection and or the presence of holes or cracks in the bag that would allow the water outflow without being detected by the sensor the oscillations observed in the graph for p filter k may show the system s pumping cycles the observed time of arrival was inversely related to the previously measured wastewater flow although the flow measurements were carried out during limited time periods table 2 higher p reduction occurred in the filter with the longest arrival time h and lower reduction in the filter with the shortest arrival time k possibly because high loading rates have washed out more p precipitates or reactive calcium ions and the short residence time was insufficient to form calcium p precipitates previous column experiments with filtralite p have shown that a short residence time 15 min when wastewater was used was sufficient for p removal in p filters 9 however more time might be needed for p that has already reacted to be retained in the filter material the short residence time in p filters j and k and the higher flows may possibly have had a negative effect on the binding capacity of the p filters 3 2 4 when and how often should p filter media be changed according to the manufacturers of polonite ecofiltration nordic ab p filters are built to maintain high p reduction during the first 2 4 years depending on load with decreasing reduction during the remainder of the filteŕs life cycle based on data obtained and the field observations in this study it is difficult to determine how often the p filters should be changed both old e 6 years and new p filters j k 2 weeks showed low p reduction but for different reasons age and clogging were assumed to account for the poor performance of p filter e while the high hydraulic load hindered the performance of p filters j and k the ph in the effluent to all these p filters e j and k was below 9 suggesting that ph is a good indicator for estimating filter performance p filters showed high reduction rates both when the influent p concentrations were high e g facility f 14 78 mg l and when they were low e g facility d 1 80 mg l indicating that the influent p concentration is not decisive for their functioning at least for the concentration range covered in this study a review of sorption filter materials 44 found a clear tendency for higher p sorption capacity of the materials investigated with increasing initial p concentration however the studies selected in the review 44 included a wide variety of materials such as blast furnace slag fly ash filtralite p and shell sand and the initial p concentrations ranged from normal values of 0 30 mg p l 1 to very elevated concentrations of 10 000 mg p l 1 pratt et al 45 argued that the complex relation between the p filters lifespan and the hydraulic retention time hrt makes it difficult to estimate the filters lifespan as flow dynamics weathering reactions and removal mechanisms must be taken into account continuous flow conditions are needed to predict the long term performance and lifespan of the p filters conditions that are often not met in full scale systems 4 conclusions this study evaluated the reduction of p in 12 full scale on site wastewater facilities with two general types of filters used individually and in combination sand filters and p filters and compared the effluent concentrations of tot p to current swedish guidelines only one sand filter d of four was confirmed to remove p satisfactorily effluent concentration below 3 mg p l 1 the inefficiency of the four sand filters that did not function adequately discharged more than 3 mg p l 1 indicates that a downstream treatment step is needed the remaining three sand filters were suspected to have dilution problems this means that correct installation and proper sealing of the filter must be ensured to prevent mixing wastewater with other water sources in order to achieve adequate p reduction within the treatment unit six out of nine of the investigated p filters generally removed p well 75 99 p reduction and accounted for a considerable amount of tot p reduced in the treatment facilities with the exception of one filter that was old and clogged and two other filters that had to cope with high hydraulic loads the analysis found a significant positive correlation between p reduction in the p filters and ph measured in the effluent indicating that ph could be used as an indicator of p filter efficiency in the three p filters that worked insufficiently with effluent concentrations higher than 3 mg p l 1 j k or 0 7 tot p reduction e when ph was 8 8 or less no significant correlation was found between the reduction of p in the p filters and the toc measured in the influent to the filters it may be that the low incoming toc concentrations and the high ph found in the majority of the p filters prevented this effect from reaching quantifiable levels with the low incoming toc the inhibitory effect of organic matter on p precipitation was probably small it was difficult to determine how often the filter media in p filters should be changed possibly due to the variation in the data in this study and because the filters included in it were rather new except for p filter e with proper installation the p filters in the study that handled a moderate load had a ph above 9 4 and not too many years of use 2 4 years as suggested by manufacturers functioned well and reduced the incoming concentration of tot p to below 1 9 mg p l 1 acknowledgements we thankfully acknowledge the financial support provided by the

14594,the us poultry industry produces over 60 billion gallons of poultry processing wastewater ppw per year which requires treatment prior to discharge in this work nine different commercially available ultrafiltration membranes having different nominal molecular weight cut offs 10 300 kda and made of different polymeric materials polyethersulfone and regenerated cellulose were screened for treating ppw streams obtained from bird washer and chiller operations wastewater samples were treated for recycling and reuse purposes bird washer wastewater was found to cause more fouling as it contained higher biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod fat oil and grease fog and total suspended solid tss compared to the chiller wastewater the presence of suspended particles can lead to plugging of the membrane pores thus it is important to select the most appropriate membrane pore size polymeric material flux etc that minimizes fouling and maximizes contaminate rejection for the feed streams considered here membranes with 30 kda nominal molecular weight cut off provided the most stable performance in laboratory scale tangential flow filtration larger pore size membranes displayed rapid flux decline most likely due to entrapment of smaller particulate matter within the membrane structure these particles were excluded from the smaller pore size membrane by size exclusion the particle size distribution of the feed stream affected the level of contaminate rejection significant removal of bod up to 93 cod up to 94 tss up to 100 and fog up to 100 was obtained for both wastewater streams keywords bird washer water chiller water fouling flux rejection 1 introduction the poultry industry is becoming one of the growing food industries as the demand for chicken products increases in the united states as well as the rest of the world 1 based on the national agricultural statistical survey by united states department of agriculture the number of chickens slaughtered in 2016 was 8 9 109 an increase from 8 8 109 in 2015 2 during the various stages of processing such as scalding bird washing chilling etc up to 26 l of water per bird are used 3 4 even for transport of inedible poultry by products for further processing water is required 5 due to the high levels of organics biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demands cod total suspended solids tss fat oil and grease fog nitrogen phosphorus etc these poultry processing wastewaters ppw require proper treatment before their disposal into the environment 6 8 fig 1 is a schematic representation of the major operations in a poultry processing facility after receiving the birds they are passed through electric stunning and are slaughtered next scalding is used to loosen the feathers in order to facilitate their removal the next operation known as picking refers to feather removal following picking evisceration involves the removal of the internal organs 9 the wastewater collected from these unit operations forms the bird washer wastewater bww stream after the recovery of valuable by products the bww is sent for treatment prior to discharge from the facility the bww contains high levels of protein bod cod fog etc 10 the chiller represents one of the last steps prior to cooking operations the birds are chilled in water containing an antimicrobial agent in order to suppress bacterial growth 11 zhang et al 12 and avula et al 4 indicated that the main contaminants of the chiller wastewater cw are blood fat oils and micro pollutants they note tss values of 600 800 mg l 1 in cw about 30 of these suspended solids are large floating particles of grease and fat about 55 of the suspended solids are in the size range of 20 50 μm and consist of emulsified oils containing entrapped proteins and lipids cw has lower bod and cod than bww here we have investigated the feasibility of treating bww and cw the actual composition of ppw depends on the type of system used the method of operation and the processing loads several investigators 13 15 have considered treatment of slaughterhouse wastewaters with very high bod over 2000 mg l 1 and cod up to 9000 mg l 1 here the focus is on ppw streams with much lower bod 390 mg l 1 and cod 460 mg l 1 values to reduce plant water consumption crucial in arid areas as well as wastewater volume to municipal treatment plants there is significant interest in recycling and reuse of these wastewater streams 4 7 16 18 several unit operations have been reported in the literature for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater including biological treatment involving aerobic and anaerobic systems 1 7 8 19 20 although these biological treatments are effective and economical the need for long retention times and consequently large land area often limits the practicality of these processes 21 26 compared to conventional separation procedures such as conventional filtration e g diatomaceous earth filtration decantation centrifugation chromatography etc membrane based separation processes were found to be advantageous as they provides simple miniaturized cost effective unit operations 27 29 furthermore an ultrafiltration membrane can provide an absolute barrier to pathogens this could be a major advantage as validation of pathogen removal will be essential if ppw are to be recycled and reused here we focus on the use of ultrafiltration membranes in particular by choosing an appropriate pore size ultrafiltration membrane it may be used to validate clearance of virus and bacteria 30 37 in the poultry industry ultrafiltration has been used to separate fat and protein lo et al 30 reported the retention of almost all crude protein in poultry processing water and reduction of cod to less than 200 mg l 1 by polysulphone ultrafiltration membranes bayar et al 25 investigated the effect of ph on the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater by electrocoagulation using aluminum electrodes their process was optimized for higher cod removal rate 85 in 20 min mohammad et al 27 reviewed the application of ultrafiltration not only in the poultry industry but also in the entire food processing industry 33 though ultrafiltration could find numerous applications in the food industry membrane fouling is reported to be one of the major issues limiting its practical application 38 41 the main aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the overall performance of nine different commercially available membranes with different nominal molecular cut offs membrane barrier and inert support materials for processing different streams from ppw i e bww and cw their performance was evaluated in terms of water recovery potential as well as removal efficiency of bod cod tss fog proteins tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen and tds total dissolved solids since practical application of ultrafiltration will involve effective membrane regeneration a membrane cleaning procedure was also developed 2 experimental 2 1 wastewater bww and cw samples were obtained from tyson foods inc springdale ar the bww sample was collected after the de feathering process prior to evisceration cw was collected from the chiller wastewater stream all water samples were analyzed at the food safety and research laboratory tyson foods inc the following water parameters were measured bod cod tss fog tds proteins tkn and ph in addition the size distribution of the particles in the wastewater samples was determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 13 320 brea ca 2 2 ultrafiltration membranes commercially available ultrafiltration membranes four polyethersulfone pes and five regenerated cellulose rc were tested membrane properties are summarized in table 1 these membranes were kindly provided by milliporesigma billerica ma and pall corporation new york ny 2 3 tangential flow filtration all membranes were tested using a tangential flow minitan s filtration cell milliporesigma billerica ma fig 2 a is a schematic representation of the experimental setup the membrane module is shown in fig 2 b the effective membrane surface area was 0 0033 m2 the feed channel contained a spacer with nine separate transverse channels while the permeate channel contained grooves in the upper manifold prior to filtration each membrane was rinsed and then pre compacted using de ionized di water as the feed the feed flow rate was adjusted such that the inlet pressure was 200 kpa filtration was continued until the permeate flux varied by less than 2 l m 2 h 1 lmh in 15 min the wastewater sample consisting of about 1 l was passed through a 300 μm stainless steel mesh twp inc berkley ca in order to remove larger particulate matter the feed tank was then filled with the wastewater the wastewater was pumped using a peristaltic pump masterflex i p cole parmer vernon hills il from the feed reservoir through the feed side of the membrane module all tangential flow filtration experiments were conducted at ambient temperature initially the permeate outlet was closed the inlet feed pressure was 67 5 kpa which resulted in a feed flow rate of 1 21 l min 1 the retentate was returned to the feed reservoir at atmospheric pressure after 5 min of operation once steady state had been reached the permeate outlet was opened the permeate was collected at atmospheric pressure in a second reservoir which was placed on a computer connected analytical balance mettler toledo columbus oh filtration was continued till 50 of the feed volume 500 ml was collected as permeate 2 4 membrane regeneration a four step cleaning process was developed in order to regenerate the membranes given the large amount of fog in the water simple backwashing was not successful the permeate line was open during all cleaning steps and the permeate was recirculated to the feed reservoir in the first step 0 2 triton x in 500 ml of di water at ph 9 ph adjusted using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide was placed in the feed tank and pumped at a feed pressure of 67 5 kpa feed flow rate 1 2 l min 1 for 30 min next the feed tank was filled with 500 ml of di water and the above procedure was repeated the third step consisted of filling the feed tank with di water containing citric acid adjusted to ph 4 0 again the feed was recirculated to the feed reservoir for 30 min at a feed pressure of 67 5 kpa and a feed flow rate of 1 2 l min 1 finally the feed reservoir was filled with di water which was recycled for 30 min under the same conditions after cleaning the di water flux of the membrane was determined 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization fig 3 gives wastewater characterization results the error bars give the range of values for 20 samples collected on 10 different days over a three month period the variation in the wastewater parameters represents the expected fluctuation a practical ultrafiltration process must be sufficiently robust in order to treat wastewater with this level of variation in quality as can be seen in general the bww contains higher levels of bod cod fog and tss tds and tkn were generally higher in cw compared to bww while protein content of both streams were nearly equal bayar et al 25 reported the composition of the ppw from local poultry slaughter house from erzincan turkey with a capacity of processing 20 000 chicken daily by comparison the tyson foods inc facility that provided the wastewater for this project processes about 200 000 birds per day they note very high values of bod 1123 mg l 1 the values for cod tss tkn fog in the wastewater reported by them were also found to be almost twice the values we report in fig 3 lo et al 30 reported that 400 mg l 1 of crude protein in their ppw while kiepper et al 3 reported the presence of 27 1 protein in the ppw as can be seen there is a considerable variation in the level of contaminants in the wastewater thus any ultrafiltration process must be sufficiently robust to be of practical value fig 4 gives both the number and volume average particle size distribution for particulate matter in the wastewater samples for both wastewater samples the volume average size distribution is skewed to the right this indicates the presence of a small number of larger particles which in terms of the total volume of particulate matter are significant while the range of particle sizes is similar for both wastewater streams the modal size is larger for the bww this is not surprising given the source of the two wastewaters see fig 1 the particle size distribution obtained here is in general agreement with previous studies 4 12 3 2 membranes performance 3 2 1 permeate flux fig 5 gives the permeate flux at the start of the filtration process for brand new as well as the membranes after cleaning the initial di water flux as well as initial cw and bww flux are given in all cases the flux was determined over a 10 min period after the start of the filtration the differences di water flux for the brand new membranes tested with cw and bww suggest the range of variation between different samples of the same membrane as can be seen in general the flux decreases with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off this is not unexpected as for the ideal case of laminar flow through cylindrical pores the flow rate varies with pore radius to the 4th power for a constant pressure drop two exceptions are the rc 30 and pes 30 membranes which have higher and lower than expected fluxes respectively however membranes made from different materials and from different manufactures will have different porosities which will affect the permeability 34 36 fig 5 gives the membranes in the order of increasing nominal molecular weight cut off however the initial cw and bww fluxes do not follow the same order in addition the di water flux after regeneration does not follow the same order as the di water flux for brand new membranes the results highlight the fact that fouling depends on the interplay between membrane properties such as hydrophobicity membrane morphology pore size pore size distribution and feed properties such as the type and concentration of the foulants as well as the particle size distribution of the particulate matter present 42 in general the drop in flux is greater for bww compared to cw this is not unexpected given the higher concentration of contaminants present in bww an ideal membrane is one that displays a high flux and can be easily regenerated after cleaning the permeate fluxes during filtration after cleaning are frequently less than for the brand new membranes this is not unexpected as there will always be some irreversible membrane fouling 43 45 in general the decrease in di water flux after regeneration for rc membranes is less than that for the pes membranes indicating less irreversible fouling of the rc membranes as can be seen the p rc 10 and p rc 30 membranes show a slightly increased permeate flux after cleaning as has been suggested in previous studies 46 this could be due to slight changes in the support structure of these membranes during cleaning with ph 9 0 solution figs 6 and 7 give variation of cw and bww fluxes for brand new and cleaned membranes as a function of the permeate volume all fluxes are normalized by the initial fluxes given in fig 5 thus these figures indicate the decrease in flux for each membrane relative to the initial flux for the membrane the variation in the actual flux is given in the supplementary data figs 6 and 7 indicate that there is an initial period of rapid flux decline followed by a period of much slower flux decline the initial period of rapid flux decline is probably due to initial deposition in the membrane pores the effect of particle size on membrane fouling is more complex if the particles are smaller than the membrane pore size they can plug the pores and be trapped within the membrane structure 47 48 the region of more gradual flux decline is probably due to deposition on the membrane surface 49 in addition as the contents of the feed reservoir are concentrated the viscosity of the feed will increase leading to a gradual decrease in permeate flux concentration polarization results from the fact that the membrane enables selective transport of some species more readily than the others the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface the phenomenon is completely reversible if the permeate flow is stopped the concentration boundary layer disappears concentration polarization strongly affects the performance of the separation process it leads to an increase in the osmotic back pressure and hence lower fluxes in addition as the concentration of rejected species is higher at the membrane surface than the bulk feed the apparent rejection coefficient will decrease moreover as there is a higher concentration of rejected species at the membrane surface it can hasten the onset of cake formation and irreversible fouling it can be seen that membrane pore size and material affect the relative flux decline fig 6 indicates that the smallest pore size pes membrane pes 30 displays the highest relative flux for cw before and after membrane cleaning for bww the pes 100 membrane gives a higher relative flux before cleaning while pes 30 gives a higher relative flux after cleaning fig 1 of the supplementary data suggest the pes 30 membrane appears to provide the most stable performance the fluxes observed for the larger pore size pes 100 and 300 membranes lead to higher initial fluxes and there is a very rapid flux decline during filtration this is most likely due to the fact that the particulate matter present in feed stream is excluded from the membrane for the larger pore size membranes a greater amount of smaller particulate matter is able to enter the membrane pores and is trapped within the membrane structure see fig 4 given the high variation on feed properties selection of a membrane which provides stable performance over a range of conditions will be essential zhou et al 50 investigated the use of ultrafiltration membranes for treating high strength wastewaters without pretreatment in this study the only pretreatment of the feed was pre filtration using a 300 μm mesh their wastewater had cod values in the range 29 000 97 000 mg l 1 and tss values varying from 11 000 to 47 000 mg l 1 these values are much higher than the values in the wastewaters used here see fig 3 zhou et al also note that the higher permeability membranes i e higher di water fluxes do not necessarily enhance filtration flux this observation is in agreement with our findings results for rc membranes given in fig 7 display similar trends to the results for the pes membranes there is an initial period of rapid flux decline followed by an extended period of slow flux decline fig 7 indicates that the decrease in relative flux is greater for the larger pore sized membranes as was the case for the pes membranes the particulate matter present is able to more easily enter and plug the pores of the larger pore sized membranes whereas it is excluded from the smaller pore size membrane by size exclusion generally the p rc 30 membrane shows the lowest relative flux decline interestingly the two different 30 kda rc membranes perform differently this highlights the fact that membranes with the same nominal molecular weight cut off from different manufacturers will often show different performance due to differences in morphology and surface properties the water contact angle for rc membranes were in the range 32 36 while that for pes were 60 66 51 52 this indicates that the rc membranes are more hydrophilic compared to that of pes membranes consequently for membranes with similar nominal molecular weight cut off the rc membranes showed better water flux compared to the pes membranes except for the case of 300 kda membranes the supplementary data gives the actual flux decline for the rc membranes as can be seen more stable operation with a lower rapid decrease in the flux is obtained for 30 and 10 kda membranes the 10 kda membrane while displaying stable operation does exhibit the lowest flux as was the case for the pes membranes the 30 kda membranes appear to provide higher and more stable permeate fluxes throughout the filtration process as noted earlier the p rc 30 membrane performed better than the rc 30 membrane this suggests that slightly different manufacturing processes and conditions used by different manufacturers will lead to slight differences in membrane morphologies and surface properties that will affect the level of fouling for a given feed stream the greater the nominal molecular weight cut off of the membrane the higher the expected flux provided all other experimental parameters and membrane surface characteristics are the same however larger pore sizes may be less efficient at excluding smaller particulate matter from the membrane leading to more rapid flux decline due to pore plugging it is also to be noted that during the processing of actual ppw which is complicated and non homogeneous in nature membrane performance may not be the same as expected for an ideal situation 3 2 2 contaminant rejection rejection of contaminates is given in figs 8 and 9 the removal efficiency is calculated as following 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration in the feed and bulk permeate after removal of 500 ml of permeate respectively fig 8 gives the removal efficiency results for brand new membranes while fig 9 gives results for membranes after cleaning the results indicate that the performance is similar for each brand new and regenerated membrane slight variations in performance are most likely due to variation in the quality of the wastewater see fig 3 results obtained here suggest that the cleaning procedure is effective at regenerating the membranes the removal efficiency depends on the nominal molecular weight cut off of the membrane as well as the membrane material in general the removal efficiency increases with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off fig 3 indicates considerable variability in both cw and bww consequently some variation is observed due to variation in feed properties as well as membrane morphology and surface properties for pes versus rc membranes as well as rc membranes made by different manufacturers the results indicate that for all membranes and both wastewater streams almost complete removal of tss and fog is observed this is not unexpected given the particle size distribution of suspended solids see fig 4 however as described in section 3 2 1 the smaller pore sized membranes 10 and 30 kda appear to be more resistant to pore plugging and hence display more stable fluxes throughout the filtration process zhou et al 53 indicate a similar result in general the decrease in bod cod and tkn is greater for bww than cw for all membranes fig 3 indicates that though there is considerable variation the bod and cod of the bww is greater than that of cw furthermore fig 4 indicates the modal particle size is greater for the bww it is likely that the greater reduction in bod cod and tkn is due to the fact that organic foulants responsible for bod cod and tkn are more effectively adsorbed to the larger particles that is present in the bww figs 8 and 9 indicate lower reduction of tkn than protein which is often observed since non protein nitrogen such as urates and other low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds are present 4 all membranes show only limited removal of proteins and tds the removal however is slightly higher for bww than cw the results suggest that much of the suspended solids present are small enough to go through the pores of the 10 kda membrane our results suggest that for the feed streams investigated 30 kda membranes appear to be optimal the smaller pore size 10 kda membrane has a lower flux while larger pore size membranes display rapid initial flux decline the membrane cleaning protocol was able to effectively regenerate membrane performance in this work pretreatment of the feed consisted of pre filtration through a 300 μm screen practical application of ultrafiltration for treating bww and cw will require optimization of the pretreatment and ultrafiltration step as well as incorporation of the ultrafiltration step into the entire water treatment process 4 conclusion bww and cw streams were treated using a range of ultrafiltration membranes bww was found to be more contaminated compared to cw stream almost 400 mgl 1 of bod 1000 mg l 1 of cod 200 mg l 1 of protein and fog 300 mg l 1 of tss and less than 50 mg l 1 of tkn were found to be present in the wastewater streams with a significant variation the particle size analysis of these wastewater streams revealed the presence of particles in the range of 0 05 100 μm the 30 kda membranes provided the highest stable fluxes throughout filtration almost complete rejection of tss and fog was obtained for all membranes tested indicating that the fog particles were generally larger than the largest pores present it the largest nominal molecular weight cut off 300 kda membranes removal of cod bod protein tds and tkn increased with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off rejection for brand new and regenerated membranes was similar however a slight decrease in filtration flux was observed for regenerate membrane compared to brand new membranes acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the national science foundation industry and university cooperative research center for membrane

type of system used the method of operation and the processing loads several investigators 13 15 have considered treatment of slaughterhouse wastewaters with very high bod over 2000 mg l 1 and cod up to 9000 mg l 1 here the focus is on ppw streams with much lower bod 390 mg l 1 and cod 460 mg l 1 values to reduce plant water consumption crucial in arid areas as well as wastewater volume to municipal treatment plants there is significant interest in recycling and reuse of these wastewater streams 4 7 16 18 several unit operations have been reported in the literature for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater including biological treatment involving aerobic and anaerobic systems 1 7 8 19 20 although these biological treatments are effective and economical the need for long retention times and consequently large land area often limits the practicality of these processes 21 26 compared to conventional separation procedures such as conventional filtration e g diatomaceous earth filtration decantation centrifugation chromatography etc membrane based separation processes were found to be advantageous as they provides simple miniaturized cost effective unit operations 27 29 furthermore an ultrafiltration membrane can provide an absolute barrier to pathogens this could be a major advantage as validation of pathogen removal will be essential if ppw are to be recycled and reused here we focus on the use of ultrafiltration membranes in particular by choosing an appropriate pore size ultrafiltration membrane it may be used to validate clearance of virus and bacteria 30 37 in the poultry industry ultrafiltration has been used to separate fat and protein lo et al 30 reported the retention of almost all crude protein in poultry processing water and reduction of cod to less than 200 mg l 1 by polysulphone ultrafiltration membranes bayar et al 25 investigated the effect of ph on the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater by electrocoagulation using aluminum electrodes their process was optimized for higher cod removal rate 85 in 20 min mohammad et al 27 reviewed the application of ultrafiltration not only in the poultry industry but also in the entire food processing industry 33 though ultrafiltration could find numerous applications in the food industry membrane fouling is reported to be one of the major issues limiting its practical application 38 41 the main aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the overall performance of nine different commercially available membranes with different nominal molecular cut offs membrane barrier and inert support materials for processing different streams from ppw i e bww and cw their performance was evaluated in terms of water recovery potential as well as removal efficiency of bod cod tss fog proteins tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen and tds total dissolved solids since practical application of ultrafiltration will involve effective membrane regeneration a membrane cleaning procedure was also developed 2 experimental 2 1 wastewater bww and cw samples were obtained from tyson foods inc springdale ar the bww sample was collected after the de feathering process prior to evisceration cw was collected from the chiller wastewater stream all water samples were analyzed at the food safety and research laboratory tyson foods inc the following water parameters were measured bod cod tss fog tds proteins tkn and ph in addition the size distribution of the particles in the wastewater samples was determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 13 320 brea ca 2 2 ultrafiltration membranes commercially available ultrafiltration membranes four polyethersulfone pes and five regenerated cellulose rc were tested membrane properties are summarized in table 1 these membranes were kindly provided by milliporesigma billerica ma and pall corporation new york ny 2 3 tangential flow filtration all membranes were tested using a tangential flow minitan s filtration cell milliporesigma billerica ma fig 2 a is a schematic representation of the experimental setup the membrane module is shown in fig 2 b the effective membrane surface area was 0 0033 m2 the feed channel contained a spacer with nine separate transverse channels while the permeate channel contained grooves in the upper manifold prior to filtration each membrane was rinsed and then pre compacted using de ionized di water as the feed the feed flow rate was adjusted such that the inlet pressure was 200 kpa filtration was continued until the permeate flux varied by less than 2 l m 2 h 1 lmh in 15 min the wastewater sample consisting of about 1 l was passed through a 300 μm stainless steel mesh twp inc berkley ca in order to remove larger particulate matter the feed tank was then filled with the wastewater the wastewater was pumped using a peristaltic pump masterflex i p cole parmer vernon hills il from the feed reservoir through the feed side of the membrane module all tangential flow filtration experiments were conducted at ambient temperature initially the permeate outlet was closed the inlet feed pressure was 67 5 kpa which resulted in a feed flow rate of 1 21 l min 1 the retentate was returned to the feed reservoir at atmospheric pressure after 5 min of operation once steady state had been reached the permeate outlet was opened the permeate was collected at atmospheric pressure in a second reservoir which was placed on a computer connected analytical balance mettler toledo columbus oh filtration was continued till 50 of the feed volume 500 ml was collected as permeate 2 4 membrane regeneration a four step cleaning process was developed in order to regenerate the membranes given the large amount of fog in the water simple backwashing was not successful the permeate line was open during all cleaning steps and the permeate was recirculated to the feed reservoir in the first step 0 2 triton x in 500 ml of di water at ph 9 ph adjusted using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide was placed in the feed tank and pumped at a feed pressure of 67 5 kpa feed flow rate 1 2 l min 1 for 30 min next the feed tank was filled with 500 ml of di water and the above procedure was repeated the third step consisted of filling the feed tank with di water containing citric acid adjusted to ph 4 0 again the feed was recirculated to the feed reservoir for 30 min at a feed pressure of 67 5 kpa and a feed flow rate of 1 2 l min 1 finally the feed reservoir was filled with di water which was recycled for 30 min under the same conditions after cleaning the di water flux of the membrane was determined 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization fig 3 gives wastewater characterization results the error bars give the range of values for 20 samples collected on 10 different days over a three month period the variation in the wastewater parameters represents the expected fluctuation a practical ultrafiltration process must be sufficiently robust in order to treat wastewater with this level of variation in quality as can be seen in general the bww contains higher levels of bod cod fog and tss tds and tkn were generally higher in cw compared to bww while protein content of both streams were nearly equal bayar et al 25 reported the composition of the ppw from local poultry slaughter house from erzincan turkey with a capacity of processing 20 000 chicken daily by comparison the tyson foods inc facility that provided the wastewater for this project processes about 200 000 birds per day they note very high values of bod 1123 mg l 1 the values for cod tss tkn fog in the wastewater reported by them were also found to be almost twice the values we report in fig 3 lo et al 30 reported that 400 mg l 1 of crude protein in their ppw while kiepper et al 3 reported the presence of 27 1 protein in the ppw as can be seen there is a considerable variation in the level of contaminants in the wastewater thus any ultrafiltration process must be sufficiently robust to be of practical value fig 4 gives both the number and volume average particle size distribution for particulate matter in the wastewater samples for both wastewater samples the volume average size distribution is skewed to the right this indicates the presence of a small number of larger particles which in terms of the total volume of particulate matter are significant while the range of particle sizes is similar for both wastewater streams the modal size is larger for the bww this is not surprising given the source of the two wastewaters see fig 1 the particle size distribution obtained here is in general agreement with previous studies 4 12 3 2 membranes performance 3 2 1 permeate flux fig 5 gives the permeate flux at the start of the filtration process for brand new as well as the membranes after cleaning the initial di water flux as well as initial cw and bww flux are given in all cases the flux was determined over a 10 min period after the start of the filtration the differences di water flux for the brand new membranes tested with cw and bww suggest the range of variation between different samples of the same membrane as can be seen in general the flux decreases with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off this is not unexpected as for the ideal case of laminar flow through cylindrical pores the flow rate varies with pore radius to the 4th power for a constant pressure drop two exceptions are the rc 30 and pes 30 membranes which have higher and lower than expected fluxes respectively however membranes made from different materials and from different manufactures will have different porosities which will affect the permeability 34 36 fig 5 gives the membranes in the order of increasing nominal molecular weight cut off however the initial cw and bww fluxes do not follow the same order in addition the di water flux after regeneration does not follow the same order as the di water flux for brand new membranes the results highlight the fact that fouling depends on the interplay between membrane properties such as hydrophobicity membrane morphology pore size pore size distribution and feed properties such as the type and concentration of the foulants as well as the particle size distribution of the particulate matter present 42 in general the drop in flux is greater for bww compared to cw this is not unexpected given the higher concentration of contaminants present in bww an ideal membrane is one that displays a high flux and can be easily regenerated after cleaning the permeate fluxes during filtration after cleaning are frequently less than for the brand new membranes this is not unexpected as there will always be some irreversible membrane fouling 43 45 in general the decrease in di water flux after regeneration for rc membranes is less than that for the pes membranes indicating less irreversible fouling of the rc membranes as can be seen the p rc 10 and p rc 30 membranes show a slightly increased permeate flux after cleaning as has been suggested in previous studies 46 this could be due to slight changes in the support structure of these membranes during cleaning with ph 9 0 solution figs 6 and 7 give variation of cw and bww fluxes for brand new and cleaned membranes as a function of the permeate volume all fluxes are normalized by the initial fluxes given in fig 5 thus these figures indicate the decrease in flux for each membrane relative to the initial flux for the membrane the variation in the actual flux is given in the supplementary data figs 6 and 7 indicate that there is an initial period of rapid flux decline followed by a period of much slower flux decline the initial period of rapid flux decline is probably due to initial deposition in the membrane pores the effect of particle size on membrane fouling is more complex if the particles are smaller than the membrane pore size they can plug the pores and be trapped within the membrane structure 47 48 the region of more gradual flux decline is probably due to deposition on the membrane surface 49 in addition as the contents of the feed reservoir are concentrated the viscosity of the feed will increase leading to a gradual decrease in permeate flux concentration polarization results from the fact that the membrane enables selective transport of some species more readily than the others the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface the phenomenon is completely reversible if the permeate flow is stopped the concentration boundary layer disappears concentration polarization strongly affects the performance of the separation process it leads to an increase in the osmotic back pressure and hence lower fluxes in addition as the concentration of rejected species is higher at the membrane surface than the bulk feed the apparent rejection coefficient will decrease moreover as there is a higher concentration of rejected species at the membrane surface it can hasten the onset of cake formation and irreversible fouling it can be seen that membrane pore size and material affect the relative flux decline fig 6 indicates that the smallest pore size pes membrane pes 30 displays the highest relative flux for cw before and after membrane cleaning for bww the pes 100 membrane gives a higher relative flux before cleaning while pes 30 gives a higher relative flux after cleaning fig 1 of the supplementary data suggest the pes 30 membrane appears to provide the most stable performance the fluxes observed for the larger pore size pes 100 and 300 membranes lead to higher initial fluxes and there is a very rapid flux decline during filtration this is most likely due to the fact that the particulate matter present in feed stream is excluded from the membrane for the larger pore size membranes a greater amount of smaller particulate matter is able to enter the membrane pores and is trapped within the membrane structure see fig 4 given the high variation on feed properties selection of a membrane which provides stable performance over a range of conditions will be essential zhou et al 50 investigated the use of ultrafiltration membranes for treating high strength wastewaters without pretreatment in this study the only pretreatment of the feed was pre filtration using a 300 μm mesh their wastewater had cod values in the range 29 000 97 000 mg l 1 and tss values varying from 11 000 to 47 000 mg l 1 these values are much higher than the values in the wastewaters used here see fig 3 zhou et al also note that the higher permeability membranes i e higher di water fluxes do not necessarily enhance filtration flux this observation is in agreement with our findings results for rc membranes given in fig 7 display similar trends to the results for the pes membranes there is an initial period of rapid flux decline followed by an extended period of slow flux decline fig 7 indicates that the decrease in relative flux is greater for the larger pore sized membranes as was the case for the pes membranes the particulate matter present is able to more easily enter and plug the pores of the larger pore sized membranes whereas it is excluded from the smaller pore size membrane by size exclusion generally the p rc 30 membrane shows the lowest relative flux decline interestingly the two different 30 kda rc membranes perform differently this highlights the fact that membranes with the same nominal molecular weight cut off from different manufacturers will often show different performance due to differences in morphology and surface properties the water contact angle for rc membranes were in the range 32 36 while that for pes were 60 66 51 52 this indicates that the rc membranes are more hydrophilic compared to that of pes membranes consequently for membranes with similar nominal molecular weight cut off the rc membranes showed better water flux compared to the pes membranes except for the case of 300 kda membranes the supplementary data gives the actual flux decline for the rc membranes as can be seen more stable operation with a lower rapid decrease in the flux is obtained for 30 and 10 kda membranes the 10 kda membrane while displaying stable operation does exhibit the lowest flux as was the case for the pes membranes the 30 kda membranes appear to provide higher and more stable permeate fluxes throughout the filtration process as noted earlier the p rc 30 membrane performed better than the rc 30 membrane this suggests that slightly different manufacturing processes and conditions used by different manufacturers will lead to slight differences in membrane morphologies and surface properties that will affect the level of fouling for a given feed stream the greater the nominal molecular weight cut off of the membrane the higher the expected flux provided all other experimental parameters and membrane surface characteristics are the same however larger pore sizes may be less efficient at excluding smaller particulate matter from the membrane leading to more rapid flux decline due to pore plugging it is also to be noted that during the processing of actual ppw which is complicated and non homogeneous in nature membrane performance may not be the same as expected for an ideal situation 3 2 2 contaminant rejection rejection of contaminates is given in figs 8 and 9 the removal efficiency is calculated as following 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the concentration in the feed and bulk permeate after removal of 500 ml of permeate respectively fig 8 gives the removal efficiency results for brand new membranes while fig 9 gives results for membranes after cleaning the results indicate that the performance is similar for each brand new and regenerated membrane slight variations in performance are most likely due to variation in the quality of the wastewater see fig 3 results obtained here suggest that the cleaning procedure is effective at regenerating the membranes the removal efficiency depends on the nominal molecular weight cut off of the membrane as well as the membrane material in general the removal efficiency increases with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off fig 3 indicates considerable variability in both cw and bww consequently some variation is observed due to variation in feed properties as well as membrane morphology and surface properties for pes versus rc membranes as well as rc membranes made by different manufacturers the results indicate that for all membranes and both wastewater streams almost complete removal of tss and fog is observed this is not unexpected given the particle size distribution of suspended solids see fig 4 however as described in section 3 2 1 the smaller pore sized membranes 10 and 30 kda appear to be more resistant to pore plugging and hence display more stable fluxes throughout the filtration process zhou et al 53 indicate a similar result in general the decrease in bod cod and tkn is greater for bww than cw for all membranes fig 3 indicates that though there is considerable variation the bod and cod of the bww is greater than that of cw furthermore fig 4 indicates the modal particle size is greater for the bww it is likely that the greater reduction in bod cod and tkn is due to the fact that organic foulants responsible for bod cod and tkn are more effectively adsorbed to the larger particles that is present in the bww figs 8 and 9 indicate lower reduction of tkn than protein which is often observed since non protein nitrogen such as urates and other low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds are present 4 all membranes show only limited removal of proteins and tds the removal however is slightly higher for bww than cw the results suggest that much of the suspended solids present are small enough to go through the pores of the 10 kda membrane our results suggest that for the feed streams investigated 30 kda membranes appear to be optimal the smaller pore size 10 kda membrane has a lower flux while larger pore size membranes display rapid initial flux decline the membrane cleaning protocol was able to effectively regenerate membrane performance in this work pretreatment of the feed consisted of pre filtration through a 300 μm screen practical application of ultrafiltration for treating bww and cw will require optimization of the pretreatment and ultrafiltration step as well as incorporation of the ultrafiltration step into the entire water treatment process 4 conclusion bww and cw streams were treated using a range of ultrafiltration membranes bww was found to be more contaminated compared to cw stream almost 400 mgl 1 of bod 1000 mg l 1 of cod 200 mg l 1 of protein and fog 300 mg l 1 of tss and less than 50 mg l 1 of tkn were found to be present in the wastewater streams with a significant variation the particle size analysis of these wastewater streams revealed the presence of particles in the range of 0 05 100 μm the 30 kda membranes provided the highest stable fluxes throughout filtration almost complete rejection of tss and fog was obtained for all membranes tested indicating that the fog particles were generally larger than the largest pores present it the largest nominal molecular weight cut off 300 kda membranes removal of cod bod protein tds and tkn increased with decreasing nominal molecular weight cut off rejection for brand new and regenerated membranes was similar however a slight decrease in filtration flux was observed for regenerate membrane compared to
