6950,sediment and nutrient fluxes from agricultural areas to rivers have led to high dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations that promote algal blooms few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of sediments on aquatic nitrogen especially don on such blooms here concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen don urea free amino acids dfaa combined amino acids dcaa excitation emission matrices eems were simultaneously determined in both sediments and the overlying waters from three different waterways and their interactions were analyzed together with sediment enzyme activities in the agriculture dominant st lucie watershed concentrations of dcaa were generally higher as compared to dfaa regardless of medium the sum of urea and amino acids accounted for 20 of water don the composition of dcaa and dfaa varied between water and sediment degradation index of both dfaa and dcaa was similar between sediment and water suggesting strong exchange activities between water and sediment sediment nh4 n concentration was associated closely with 14 water dfaa a model comprised of sediment don nh4 n activities of acid phosphatase ap and leucine aminopeptidase lap and two fluorescence compounds can predict the variations of water nh4 n 55 no3 n 77 doc 83 don 64 dfaa 88 dcaa 62 96 and fluorescence indexes 98 while this model provided an accurate prediction of water nutrient status in the st lucie watershed it still needs to be verified in situ across larger environmental gradients to incorporate real world complexity and increase generality keywords fluorescence compounds degradation index amino acid urea water quality 1 introduction in recent decades intensive management of agricultural systems has increased inputs of bioavailable n to estuaries which have enhanced coastal eutrophication conley et al 2009 diaz and rosenberg 2008 li et al 2016 2017 paerl et al 2016 rabalais et al 2007 scavia and bricker 2006 while the distribution and properties of inorganic n have been well studied in aquatic systems chapra et al 2017 jorgensen 2006 reisinger et al 2016 dissolved organic nitrogen don a dominant form of n in agriculture dominant watersheds chapra et al 2017 li et al 2016 van kessel et al 2009 has been largely overlooked chapra et al 2017 don contains a complex mixture of different compounds li et al 2018 it is a crucial n source for both bacteria and phytoplankton andersson et al 2006 bronk et al 1998 eom et al 2017 jorgensen 2006 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 in fact some labile species of don such as urea represent a significant portion of n fertilizer yet minimal information is available regarding their roles in aquatic eutrophication davis et al 2016 in natural aquatic systems dissolved amino acids daa are found in dissolved free forms dfaa or combined dcaa in which the latter is bound as peptides proteins and or adsorbed onto inorganic and organic components aufdenkampe et al 2001 duan and bianchi 2007 compared to smaller dfaas which are cycled very rapidly bianchi et al 2014 fuhrman 1990 dcaas are cycled more slowly because assimilation depends on the enzymatic liberation of smaller aas and peptides which can then be utilized more efficiently by microbes in addition only 1 10 of dcaa is recognized by bacteria as fresh protein and dcaa utilization is inhibited by the availability of dfaa keil and kirchman 1993 and particulate matter degradation can replenish dcaa dcaa composition changes slightly by diagenetic transformations keil and kirchman 1993 thus dcaa concentrations tend to be higher and more stable than dfaa in aquatic ecosystems freese et al 2007 grace and bianchi 2010 grossart and simon 2002 zhang et al 2015 the relative abundance of individual amino acids can also reflect the diagenetic state of organic matter dauwe et al 1999 and bioavailability of don zhang et al 2015 and dom benner and kaiser 2011 urea constitutes 60 of global n based fertilizer glibert et al 2006 and its use as a fertilizer is expected to double by 2050 assessment 2005 in fact urea n has been a significant part of agricultural paddock don losses davis et al 2016 excessive urea can increase the frequency and toxicity of algal blooms king et al 2017 change phytoplankton species composition alter aquatic carbon c sequestration efficiency and ultimately impact fisheries glibert et al 2008 therefore a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of amino acid and urea in an aquatic ecosystem is essential for future management decisions it has been well established that sediments are significant sources of both organic and inorganic n to coastal waters bianchi 2007 in general benthic don fluxes are highly variable and usually small relative to total net n flux from sediments however the release of nh4 n from sediments tends to be much higher with nh4 n being the most substantial fraction of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din pool in coastal sediments burdige and zheng 1998 nevertheless there have been reports of don fluxes from sediments exceeding that of din in a temperate australia estuary cook et al 2004 water column residence time has been shown to be a critical factor in controlling the impact of n effluxes from sediments to the water column for example after sediments were suspended in the overlying water for an extended period of time there were increases in daa concentrations which were comparable to the reported nitrate concentrations in the lower region of an estuary tappin et al 2007 regeneration of dissolved n from sediments has also been shown to contribute to urea concentrations in lake waters leavitt et al 2006 aquatic systems that receive inputs from agricultural systems typically have sediments with much higher urea n concentrations in stagnant surface waters than in aquatic systems not impacted by agriculture king et al 2017 when the green algae selenastrum capricornutum was incubated with don from sediments for 15 days the relative fluorescent intensities of tryptophan like proteins and tyrosine like substance were reported to increase by 25 26 and 28 63 respectively zhai et al 2016 this implies that bio decomposition of sediment don can increase the relative abundance of bioavailable don and protein like fluorescence compounds via primary producers in the overlying water in aquatic ecosystems microorganisms degrade biomolecules through the production of extracellular enzymes which in part drive the flow of energy and nutrients benner and kaiser 2011 sinsabaugh and foreman 2001 for example sediment microbial enzymes can regulate aquatic nutrient dynamics hill et al 2010 with sediment nutrient dynamics commonly associated with concentrations of surface water nutrients talib et al 2016 however due to the complexity of the aquatic ecosystem only a few studies to date have quantified the contribution of sediment to water don pools the selection of proper sediment variables and linking sediment properties and water don dynamics is challenging partial least squares analysis pls is a statistical method which can project data into a low dimensional space formed by a set of orthogonal latent variables by a simultaneous decomposition of x predictable variables and y response variables maximizing the covariance between x and y wold et al 2001 when there are more predictor variables than observations and there is multi collinearity among the predictor variables pls is particularly useful in selecting proper variables and constructing a simplified model without a loss of prediction accuracy ohsowski et al 2016 vohland and emmerling 2011 the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the biogeochemical linkages between overlying waters and sediments through measurements of dissolved organic c don urea and amino acids dissolved organic matter dom fluorescence in water and sediment and sediment extracellular enzyme activity in an agricultural watershed in this study we used pls to 1 select proper sediment variables 2 construct a model to predict changes of water quality in agricultural catchments and 3 verify the accuracy the model generated via pls 2

indicates the contribution of recently produced dom fellman et al 2010 2 3 sediment extraction the sediments here were composed mainly of sand with a small amount of silt and clay fractions 18 on average zhang et al 2003 large stones and plant litter were removed from sediment samples by sieving prior to extraction of amino acids and urea amino acids and fluorescence compounds were extracted from field moist sediments following the method described by jones et al 2002 briefly three g of sediment were shaken with 25 ml di water in a 40 ml volume polycarbonate tube on a reciprocating shaker 200 rpm 15 min the sediment suspension was then centrifuged 16 000g 15 min 4 c supernatant collected and stored in polyethylene vials at 20 c prior to analysis duplicate extracts were performed for

substrates 4 methylumbelliferyl n acetyl β d glucosaminide mub was used for nag ap and bg and l leucine 7 amido 4 methyl coumarin amc for lap hoppe 1983 fluorochrome methylumbelliferone muf and aminomethylcoumarin amc are produced immediately after they are hydrolyzed by the enzymes briefly sediment extracts were prepared at sediment water ratio of 1 g 100 ml the mub and amc standards ranging from 0 0 to 100 0 μm and 0 0 to 50 0 μm were prepared respectively the buffer solution was 50 mm tris buffer a 50 μl buffer along with 100 μl substrates standards were added to each microplate well containing di water as control 100 μl and sediments extracts 100 μl in triplicates microplates were kept at room temperature in the dark prior to fluorescence measurement ten μl of 0 5 n naoh was added to each well fluorescence of samples at 0 h and after two h were analyzed with the emission intensity at 450 nm excitation at 350 nm using a bio tek model fl600 fluorometric plate reader bio tek instruments inc winooski vt results were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting the activity of the control samples 2 5 statistical analysis jmp pro 13 sas institute cary nc was used to perform principal compound analysis pca and nonlinear iterative partial least squares analysis nipals we used the percentage of every amino acid to run the pca analysis degradation index di was calculated as d i i a a i a v g a a i s t d a a i f c i dauwe et al 1999 in which the molar composition of amino acids were measured for samples ranging in degradation state and age aai is the original mole percentage of amino acid i avgaai and stdaai are its mean and standard deviation in corresponding data set and fci is the factor coefficient for amino acid i on the first axis of the pca although these coefficients were determined using samples from the marine environment the samples were widely distributed geographically so that variability due to source were minimized dauwe et al 1999 a more negative value indicates a higher degree of degradation the degradation index of different sources decrease in the order phytoplankton bacteria and sediment trap matter 1 1 5 suspended particulate matter and sediment samples on the namibian shelf 0 2 0 9 particulate organic matter pom in coastal and ocean margin sediments 0 3 1 refractory pom from pelagic deep sea sediments 1 and surface layers generally have a better preservation of organic matter om than subsurface ones dauwe et al 1999 nagel et al 2016 unger et al 2005 we acknowledge a major caveat of our use of the di is that none of the samples used to generate the factors in dauwe et al 1999 are from terrestrial freshwater systems therefore we are assuming the shift in the amino acid molar composition that occurs during degradation in marine waters is the same in this freshwater system sediment variables concentrations of different sediment n species and doc the intensity of different sediment fluorescent compounds activities of different sediment enzymes the percentage of different amino acids fluorescent indexes were used as independent factors water parameters listed in fig 5 as the response factors using nipals we utilized a broad suite of sediment variables sets to determine an optimized combination of variables that potentially represent very complex conditions of water parameters across the sampling sites for example we used variations in activities of different enzyme soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration doc concentration intensity of different fluorescence compounds soil nh4 n concentration activities of different enzymes soil nh4 n concentration doc concentration activities of different enzymes soil doc concentration activities of different enzymes bix table s1 we tried 50 sets to use soil nh4 n concentration doc concentration activities of lap and ap intensity of fluorescence compounds 1 and 2 table 3 to develop the model table s1 since this set of variables has the lowest root mean of the predicted residual sum of squares 1 2 and explained the highest percentage 84 of the variations of all the water variables in fig 5 especially for water dfaa 3 results water do ranged from 2 4 to 12 mg l 1 with the mean value of 6 4 mg l 1 water ph ranged from 8 3 to 9 2 table 1 salinity was between 0 19 and 0 61 with the highest value in pd2 table 1 under the same pasture land use concentrations of nh4 n don doc and total dfaa tdfaa were lower in pd2 than the other pd sites table 1 concentrations of no3 n was 2 58 times higher than nh4 n except in canal 3 concentrations of don were higher than the sum of no3 n and nh4 n though the citrus grove was fertilized urea concentrations were relatively low in cgd1 and cgd2 and reached 7 7 µm in pd1 table 1 concentrations of tdfaa was highest in pd3 and was lowest in canal concentrations of tdcaa was 0 3 175 times the size of tdfaa pool table 1 on average urea tdfaa and tdcaa contributed to 3 28 2 68 and 13 5 of don respectively the concentration of tdfaa was the lowest in the canal and highest in the pd fig 2 a the dissolved free aliphatic amino acids ala leu val and the acidic amino acid glu accounted for 10 of tdfaa followed by the imino acids pro 7 6 and arg 7 2 and the aromatic acid tyr 6 7 dissolved free asp gly and ser were measured exclusively in pd fig 2a the degradation index of dfaa ranged from 4 8 to 3 5 with the mean value of 0 19 the degradation index of dfaa in the canal 3 2 0 32 was significantly higher than that in cgd 0 71 1 4 and pd 1 9 2 5 the concentration of tdcaa was the lowest in the pd fig 2a compared to dfaa the relative abundance of gly in the dcaa increased from 1 1 to 12 asp from 0 39 to 14 while val decreased from 14 to 6 5 fig 2b ala and glu also represented 10 of tdcaa respectively dissolved free dapa and dissolved combined ser were not detected the degradation index of dcaa ranged from 3 7 to 9 2 with the mean value of 0 02 there was no significant difference between degradation indices of dfaa and dcaa four independent fluorescence components components 1 to 4 c1 c4 were identified by parafac fig s1 they are terrestrial humic acid microbial humic acid potential photoproduct of terrestrial dom soil fulvic acid and tryptophan like component respectively fellman et al 2010 osburn et al 2015 stedmon and markager 2005 total fluorescence decreased from c1 to c4 and was lowest in canal fig 3 a the biological index represents the strength of autochthonous biological activity fluorescence index indicates the source or the degradation status of dom the biological index was relatively higher in cgd and lower in the canal but fluorescence index was similar across the sites table 1 3 1 sediment properties sediment toc concentration ranged from 2203 to 13758 µg g 1 these values were in the range of reported sediment toc data seiter et al 2004 sediment nh4 n concentrations varied from 0 13 to 4 5 µg n g 1 concentrations of no3 n were 2 77 times higher than nh4 n table 2 concentrations of tdfaa ranged from 0 013 0 046 µg n g 1 with tdcaa concentrations 23 67 times higher than tdfaa table 2 percentages of tdcaa to tn ranged from 0 09 0 48 mean urea concentration was 0 24 µg n g 1 and contributed to 0 07 of total n mean values of enzyme activities for ap bg nag and lap were 15 8 0 15 and 11 µmol h 1g

2475 µmol h 1g c 1 respectively sediment tdfaa and tdcaa concentrations were the lowest in pd fig 2 dissolved free ala 13 glu 17 leu 11 and val 22 were the dominant forms of dfaa followed by ile 6 7 and tyr 6 3 dissolved free asp was present exclusively in the canal compared to dfaa the relative abundance of ala and glu in the dcaa decreased asp increased from 2 6 to 11 gly from 0 to 10 and thr from 0 to 5 fig 2d ser was not detected in sediment approximately 0 33 0 27 of sediment total n was thaa sediment dfaa was characterized by a relatively enriched content of dapa glu and val whereas sediment dcaa were more enriched in arg ile leu and val fig 4 the degradation index of dfaa and dcaa ranged from 4 7 to 1 6 and 2 5 to 5 6 with mean values of 0 19 and 0 02 respectively there was no significant difference between degradation indices of dfaa and dcaa total fluorescence increased from cgd to canal fig 3b mean relative abundance of c1 c2 c3 and c4 were 66 4 19 3 10 4 and 3 88 respectively the biological index was higher in cgd and lower in pd table 2 3 2 the linkage between water and sediments a pca of the amino acid molar compositions resulted in a significant separation between the dcaa and dfaa in sediments and water column along pc2 fig 4 sediment lap c2 nh4 n doc and ap were loaded most on factors 1 2 3 4 and 5 table 3 on average factor 1 2 3 4 and 5 explained 32 17 14 7 5 and 6 6 of the variance of water parameters respectively fig 5 the 5 factor model explained 60 and 40 of water don and urea respectively 88 of total dfaa and every dfaa except ser and 80 variances of most dcaas fig 6 and table s1 the model is more efficient in explaining variations of water nh4 n no3 n and doc as compared to fluorescence dom however the model explained 98 of biological index and 78 of fluorescence index respectively fig 5 detailed information on the regression model for every water variable is presented in table s1 the predominant factors linked with water variables varied considerably fig 5 for example most amino acids were explained by factor 1 39 with fluoresce compounds and indices more by factor 2 32 and water no3 n by factor 3 40 4 discussion 4 1 urea and amino acid distribution urea concentrations 2 3 5 3 µm in the st lucie watershed were higher than mean values 1 4 µm commonly found in the lakes of central north america bogard et al 2012 excessive urea can promote the growth of toxic cyanobacteria in phosphorus p rich lakes 0 05 mg dissolved p l 1 donald et al 2011 in fact dissolved p concentrations have been shown to be 0 05 mg p l 1 in the storm waters of the st lucie watershed li et al 2017 the high urea concentrations in pd1 may have resulted from direct deposits of cow manure or from transport to surrounding ditches during the periods of high hydrologic runoff tilman et al 2001 interestingly we observed a lower percentage of water don as urea 3 3 2 5 than commonly found in american lakes and rivers 5 54 bogard et al 2012 wiegner et al 2006 suggestive of other don sources such as amino acids higher concentrations of dcaa than dfaa in both water and sediment support other work showing that dfaa is cycled more quickly than dcaa sarmento et al 2013 the concentrations of dfaa in the canal water were significantly lower than those in the cgd and pd samples this could be caused by either degradation or dilution of the dfaa in the canal the significantly higher di scores of the canal samples suggest it is due to more significant degradation of the dfaa downstream rather than dilution the low concentration of water and sediment dapa fig 2 a biomarker for gram negative bacteria philben et al 2014 suggests a low abundance of gram negative bacteria in the st lucie watershed however this is a contrast to other reports that suggested gram negative bacteria are common in irrigation water river stream and sediment benjamin et al 2013 jovanovic et al 2017 reche et al 2016 the absence of df hyp hydroxyproline in water and sediment used as a biomarker for vascular plant carbon and nitrogen philben et al 2014 may have been due to the insoluble nature of the proteins in which hyp is present cassab 1998 the significant difference between the molar composition of dfaa and dcaa between water and sediments fig 4 suggests there is some fundamental difference in protein peptide composition of the two biomes however both the free and combined amino acids in the water column can be modeled using the model which only takes sediment composition into account the primary factor in that model for amino acids is factor 1 which is largely driven by lap activity an enzyme responsible for cleaving peptides the correlations between sediment lap and water column amino acid concentrations suggest that the dominant source of peptides and amino acids in the water column are likely from the breakdown of proteins in the sediment the very soluble amino acid cysteine was detected in the dcaa and dfaa of water samples but not in the sediments two other highly soluble amino acids threonine and glycine are relatively enriched in the dfaa water samples compared to the sediments therefore we hypothesize that the compositional difference observed between water column amino acids and sediment amino acids are driven largely by the solubility of the different amino acids and peptides and sorption desorption onto mineral sediments in addition to cysteine another sulfur containing amino acid methionine is also enriched in the water column but we are unable to determine a possible mechanism at this time the ph and salinity were invariable across all the sampling sites 9 0 0 3 and 0 36 0 16 respectively although we did not measure the mineral composition of the sediments they are likely similar within this small drainage basin considering that the soil surrounding all the sampling sites is alfisol these parameters will affect the solubility and subsequent sorption desorption kinetics of amino acids and proteins therefore future studies should consider these variables when using our model for amino acid concentrations and further optimization of the model may be necessary under different conditions 4 2 fluorescence compounds distribution fluorescence c1 covaried with mean annual temperature and percentage of agriculture in the catchment kothawala et al 2014 c2 is a potential product of terrestrial dom and correlated positively with water no3 n and chlorophyll a concentrations fellman et al 2010 osburn et al 2015 wu et al 2017 c3 is photo labile and regarded as terrestrial dom marker osburn et al 2015 in situ produced tryptophan like c4 like contributed 20 of sediment total fluorescence wu et al 2017 on average c1 c2 c3 and c4 represented 61 22 13 and 3 9 of total fluorescence respectively fig 3 such a high percentage of c1 and a low percentage of c4 indicated that aquatic dom was humic acid dominated fluorescence index was similar between water 2 2 and sediment 2 0 water c2 which may be produced by heterotrophic bacteria rochelle newall and fisher 2002 had a linear relationship with degradation index of sediment dcaa r 0 84 p 0 005 this result indicates that sediment resuspension and the resultant decomposition of sediment dom may supply water fluorescence dom 4 3 validation of the pls model urbanization industrial and metropolitan effluents agriculture and channel modifications have altered and impaired river ecosystems throughout the world at an unprecedented rate hill et al 2010 in addition the temporal changes of different don forms bogard et al 2012 freese et al 2007 li et al 2016 ni et al 2016 complicate the anthropogenic impact on aquatic don an increase in nutrient and sediment influx reduces water quality langland and cronin 2003 li et al 2016 degradation index of dfaa and dcaa biological index and florescence index were similar between overlying water and sediment suggesting a strong exchange between water column and sediment therefore using sediment parameters to predict the variations of water variables was reliable fig 5 and table s1 the model can only explain 52 variation of water urea concentration which was reported to have a relationship with mean water column oxygen concentration bogard et al 2012 however water urea here had a week correlation with water oxygen concentration r2 0 2 hence the factors that influence water urea need further research activities of ap bg and nag correlated with each other positively r 0 66 p 0 05 and lap was associated with ap only r 0 84 p 0 01 relative to bg and nag ap and lap had higher variable importance 0 97 in the pls model indicating that cycles of sediment n and p rather than c are essential in regulating aquatic n sediment ap hydrolyzes phosphate from phosphosaccarides and phospholipids phosphorus release from biological detritus influences sediment protein like materials williams et al 2010 ap activities were coincident with the values of sediment in urban storm water pond song et al 2017 but lower than the geometric means in freshwater sediments 15 557 µmol h 1gc 1 sinsabaugh et al 2012 given much higher water tp concentrations in the agricultural catchment li et al 2017 ap activities had a negative relationship with relative abundance of sediment c4 r 0 83 p 0 01 the proteolytic enzyme lap can break polypeptide chains at the amino acid n terminus to provide c and n for microorganisms the activity of lap was higher than the geometric mean value in freshwater sediments 1653 µmol h 1gc 1 sinsabaugh et al 2012 the activity of lap had a positive interaction with sediment organic carbon sinsabaugh et al 2014 and water c4 williams et al 2010 sediment activity of lap had no associations with sediment organic matter or water fluorescence compounds here but had a positive correlation with water df arg and thr dc cys and lys r 0 67 p 0 05 concentrations of sediment nh4 n were relatively low as the bridge of don between sediment and water it played an unequivocal role in transformations of aquatic don sediment nh4 n was closely associated with 14 water dfaa suggesting sediment n was released to water through denitrification process therefore the model including sediment nh4 n and lap worked best in explaining variations of water dfaa followed by dcaa microbial and photochemical processes often play a more important role than the original source in determining molecular composition of dom in aquatic systems chaffin and bridgeman 2014 however mean value of biological index in water and sediment was 0 56 and 0 58 respectively lower than the value of low autochthonous component 0 6 0 7 huguet et al 2009 suggesting weak biodegradation processes in the agricultural catchments hence factor 2 which was loaded most by fluorescence compounds table 3 only explained 14 of variances of water amino acids fig 5 and the model cannot effectively explain the variances of fluorescence

water quality benner and kaiser 2011 bronk et al 2014 wu et al 2017 inorganic n has been involved in regular monitoring protocol li et al 2016 don has been overlooked though the labile proportion amino acid and urea may pose a threat to water quality complicated pretreatment time consuming measurement and requirement of high performance liquid chromatography make it difficult to add amino acids to monitoring routine pls facilitates the identification of critical environmental parameters for predicting the distribution of different water amino acids urea and other environmental variables the six sediment variables model proposed in this study has a potential to simplify monitoring protocol and make monitoring bioavailable don possible the model developed from this study

6950,sediment and nutrient fluxes from agricultural areas to rivers have led to high dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations that promote algal blooms few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of sediments on aquatic nitrogen especially don on such blooms here concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen don urea free amino acids dfaa combined amino acids dcaa excitation emission matrices eems were simultaneously determined in both sediments and the overlying waters from three different waterways and their interactions were analyzed together with sediment enzyme activities in the agriculture dominant st lucie watershed concentrations of dcaa were generally higher as compared to dfaa regardless of medium the sum of urea and amino acids accounted for 20 of water don the composition of dcaa and dfaa varied between water and sediment degradation index of both dfaa and dcaa was similar between sediment and water suggesting strong exchange activities

fluorescence compounds degradation index amino acid urea water quality 1 introduction in recent decades intensive management of agricultural systems has increased inputs of bioavailable n to estuaries which have enhanced coastal eutrophication conley et al 2009 diaz and rosenberg 2008 li et al 2016 2017 paerl et al 2016 rabalais et al 2007 scavia and bricker 2006 while the distribution and properties of inorganic n have been well studied in aquatic systems chapra et al 2017 jorgensen 2006 reisinger et al 2016 dissolved organic nitrogen don a dominant form of n in agriculture dominant watersheds chapra et al 2017 li et al 2016 van kessel et al 2009 has been largely overlooked chapra et al 2017 don contains a complex mixture of different compounds li et al 2018 it is a crucial n source for both bacteria and phytoplankton andersson et al 2006 bronk et al 1998 eom et al 2017 jorgensen 2006 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 in fact some labile species of don such as urea represent a significant portion of n fertilizer yet minimal information is available regarding their roles in aquatic eutrophication davis et al 2016 in natural aquatic systems dissolved amino acids daa are found in dissolved free forms dfaa or combined dcaa in which the latter is bound as peptides proteins and or adsorbed onto inorganic and organic components aufdenkampe et al 2001 duan and bianchi 2007 compared to smaller dfaas which are cycled very rapidly bianchi et al 2014 fuhrman 1990 dcaas are cycled more slowly because assimilation depends on the enzymatic liberation of smaller aas and peptides which can then be utilized more efficiently by microbes in addition only 1 10 of dcaa is recognized by bacteria as fresh protein and dcaa utilization is inhibited by the availability of dfaa keil and kirchman 1993 and particulate matter degradation can replenish dcaa dcaa composition changes slightly by diagenetic transformations keil and kirchman 1993 thus dcaa concentrations tend to be higher and more stable than dfaa in aquatic ecosystems freese et al 2007 grace and bianchi 2010 grossart and simon 2002 zhang et al 2015 the relative abundance of individual amino acids can also reflect the diagenetic state of organic matter dauwe et al 1999 and bioavailability of don zhang et al 2015 and dom benner and kaiser 2011 urea constitutes 60 of global n based fertilizer glibert et al 2006 and its use as a fertilizer is expected to double by 2050 assessment 2005 in fact urea n has been a significant part of agricultural paddock don losses davis et al 2016 excessive urea can increase the frequency and toxicity of algal blooms king et al 2017 change phytoplankton species composition alter aquatic carbon c sequestration efficiency and ultimately impact fisheries glibert et al 2008 therefore a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of amino acid and urea in an aquatic ecosystem is essential for future management decisions it has been well established that sediments are significant sources of both organic and inorganic n to coastal waters bianchi 2007 in general benthic don fluxes are highly variable and usually small relative to total net n flux from sediments however the release of nh4 n from sediments tends to be much higher with nh4 n being the most substantial fraction of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din pool in coastal sediments burdige and zheng 1998 nevertheless there have been reports of don fluxes from sediments exceeding that of din in a temperate australia estuary cook et al 2004 water column residence time has been shown to be a critical factor in controlling the impact of n effluxes from sediments to the water column for example after sediments were suspended in the overlying water for an extended period of time there were increases in daa concentrations which were comparable to the reported nitrate concentrations in the lower region of an estuary tappin et al 2007 regeneration of dissolved n from sediments has also been shown to contribute to urea concentrations in lake waters leavitt et al 2006 aquatic systems that receive inputs from agricultural systems typically have sediments with much higher urea n concentrations in stagnant surface waters than in aquatic systems not impacted by agriculture king et al 2017 when the green algae selenastrum capricornutum was incubated with don from sediments for 15 days the relative fluorescent intensities of tryptophan like proteins and tyrosine like substance were reported to increase by 25 26 and 28 63 respectively zhai et al 2016 this implies that bio decomposition of sediment don can increase the relative abundance of bioavailable don and protein like fluorescence compounds via primary producers in the overlying water in aquatic ecosystems microorganisms degrade biomolecules through the production of extracellular enzymes which in part drive the flow of energy and nutrients benner and kaiser 2011 sinsabaugh and foreman 2001 for example sediment microbial enzymes can regulate aquatic nutrient dynamics hill et al 2010 with sediment nutrient dynamics commonly associated with concentrations of surface water nutrients talib et al 2016 however due to the complexity of the aquatic ecosystem only a few studies to date have quantified the contribution of sediment to water don pools the selection of proper sediment variables and linking sediment properties and water don dynamics is challenging partial least squares analysis pls is a statistical method which can project data into a low dimensional space formed by a set of orthogonal latent variables by a simultaneous decomposition of x predictable variables and y response variables maximizing the covariance between x and y wold et al 2001 when there are more predictor variables than observations and there is multi collinearity among the predictor variables pls is particularly useful in selecting proper variables and constructing a simplified model without a loss of prediction accuracy ohsowski et al 2016 vohland and emmerling 2011 the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the biogeochemical linkages between overlying waters and sediments through measurements of dissolved organic c don urea and amino acids dissolved organic matter dom fluorescence in water and sediment and sediment extracellular enzyme activity in an agricultural watershed in this study we used pls to 1 select proper sediment variables 2 construct a model to predict changes of water quality in agricultural catchments and 3 verify the accuracy the model generated via pls 2

average zhang et al 2003 large stones and plant litter were removed from sediment samples by sieving prior to extraction of amino acids and urea amino acids and fluorescence compounds were extracted from field moist sediments following the method described by jones et al 2002 briefly three g of sediment were shaken with 25 ml di water in a 40 ml volume polycarbonate tube on a reciprocating shaker

instruments inc winooski vt results were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting the activity of the control samples 2 5 statistical analysis jmp pro 13 sas institute cary nc was used to perform principal compound analysis pca and nonlinear iterative partial least squares analysis nipals we used the percentage of every amino acid to run the pca analysis degradation index di was calculated as d i i a a i a v g a a i s t d a a i f c i dauwe et al 1999 in which the molar composition of amino acids were measured for samples ranging in degradation state and age aai is the original mole percentage of amino acid i avgaai and stdaai are its mean and standard deviation in corresponding data set and fci is the factor coefficient for amino acid i on the first axis of the pca although these coefficients were determined using samples from the marine environment the samples were widely distributed geographically so that variability due to source were minimized dauwe et al 1999 a more negative value indicates a higher degree of degradation the degradation index of different sources decrease in the order phytoplankton bacteria and sediment trap matter 1 1 5 suspended

surface layers generally have a better preservation of organic matter om than subsurface ones dauwe et al 1999 nagel et al 2016 unger et al 2005 we acknowledge a major caveat of our use of the di is that none of the samples used to generate the factors in dauwe et al 1999 are from terrestrial freshwater systems therefore we are assuming the shift in the amino acid molar composition that occurs during degradation in marine waters is the same in this freshwater system sediment variables concentrations of different sediment n species and doc the intensity of different sediment fluorescent compounds activities of different sediment enzymes the percentage of different amino acids fluorescent indexes were used as independent factors water parameters listed in fig 5 as the response factors using nipals we utilized a broad suite of sediment variables sets to determine an optimized combination of variables that potentially represent very complex conditions of water parameters across the sampling sites for example we used variations in activities of different enzyme soil nh4 n concentration soil no3 n concentration doc concentration intensity of different fluorescence compounds soil nh4 n concentration activities of different enzymes soil nh4 n concentration doc concentration activities of different enzymes soil doc concentration activities of different enzymes bix table s1 we tried 50 sets to use soil nh4 n concentration doc concentration activities of lap and ap intensity of fluorescence compounds 1 and 2 table 3 to develop the model table s1 since this set of variables has the lowest root mean of the predicted residual sum of squares 1 2 and explained the highest percentage 84 of the variations of all the water variables in fig 5 especially for water dfaa 3 results

pasture land use concentrations of nh4 n don doc and total dfaa tdfaa were lower in pd2 than the other pd sites table 1 concentrations of no3 n was 2 58 times higher than nh4 n except in canal 3

accounted for 10 of tdfaa followed by the imino acids pro 7 6 and arg 7 2 and the aromatic acid tyr 6 7 dissolved free asp gly and ser were measured exclusively in pd fig 2a the degradation index of dfaa ranged from 4 8 to 3 5 with the mean value of 0 19 the degradation index of dfaa in the canal 3 2 0 32 was significantly higher than that in cgd 0 71 1 4 and pd 1 9 2 5 the concentration of tdcaa was the lowest in the pd fig 2a compared to dfaa the relative abundance of gly in the dcaa increased from 1 1 to 12 asp from 0 39 to 14 while val decreased from 14 to 6 5 fig 2b ala and glu also represented 10 of tdcaa respectively dissolved free dapa and dissolved combined ser were not detected the degradation index of dcaa ranged from 3 7 to 9 2 with the mean value of 0 02 there was no significant difference between degradation indices of dfaa and dcaa four independent fluorescence components components 1 to 4 c1 c4 were identified by parafac fig s1 they are terrestrial humic acid microbial humic acid potential photoproduct of terrestrial dom soil fulvic acid and tryptophan like component respectively fellman et al 2010 osburn et al 2015 stedmon and markager 2005 total fluorescence decreased from c1 to c4 and was lowest in canal fig 3 a the biological index represents the strength of autochthonous biological activity fluorescence index indicates the source or the degradation status of dom the biological index was relatively higher in cgd and lower in the canal but fluorescence index was similar across the sites table 1 3 1 sediment properties sediment toc concentration ranged from 2203 to 13758 µg g 1 these values were in the range of reported sediment toc data seiter et al 2004 sediment nh4 n concentrations varied from 0 13 to 4 5 µg n g 1 concentrations of no3 n were 2 77 times higher than nh4 n table 2 concentrations of tdfaa ranged from 0 013 0 046 µg n g 1 with tdcaa concentrations 23 67 times higher than tdfaa table 2 percentages of tdcaa to tn ranged from 0 09 0 48 mean urea concentration was 0 24 µg n g 1 and contributed to 0 07 of total n mean values of enzyme activities for ap bg nag and lap were 15 8 0 15 and 11 µmol h 1g

2475 µmol h 1g c 1 respectively sediment tdfaa and tdcaa concentrations were the lowest in pd fig 2 dissolved free ala 13 glu 17 leu 11 and val 22 were the dominant forms of dfaa followed by ile 6 7 and tyr 6 3 dissolved free asp was present exclusively in the canal compared to dfaa the relative abundance of ala and glu in the dcaa decreased asp increased from 2 6 to 11 gly from 0 to 10 and thr from 0 to 5 fig 2d ser was not detected in sediment approximately 0 33 0 27 of sediment total n was thaa sediment dfaa was characterized by a relatively enriched content of dapa glu and val whereas sediment dcaa were more enriched in arg ile leu and val fig 4 the degradation index of dfaa and dcaa ranged from 4 7 to 1 6 and 2 5 to 5 6 with mean values of 0 19 and 0 02 respectively there was no significant difference between degradation indices of dfaa and dcaa total fluorescence increased from cgd to canal fig 3b mean relative abundance of c1 c2 c3 and c4 were 66 4 19 3 10 4 and 3 88 respectively the biological index was higher in cgd and lower in pd table 2 3 2 the linkage between water and sediments a pca of the amino acid molar compositions resulted in a significant separation between the dcaa and dfaa in sediments and water column along pc2 fig 4 sediment lap c2 nh4 n doc and ap were loaded most on factors 1 2 3 4 and 5 table 3 on average factor 1 2 3 4 and 5 explained 32 17 14 7 5 and 6 6 of the variance of water parameters respectively fig 5 the 5 factor model explained 60 and 40 of water don and urea respectively 88 of total dfaa and every dfaa except ser and 80 variances of most dcaas fig 6 and table s1 the model is more efficient in explaining variations of water nh4 n no3 n and doc as compared to fluorescence dom however the model explained 98 of biological index and 78 of fluorescence index respectively fig 5 detailed information on the regression model for every water variable is presented in table s1 the predominant factors linked with water variables varied considerably fig 5 for example most amino acids were explained by factor 1 39 with fluoresce compounds and indices more by factor 2 32 and water no3 n by factor 3 40 4 discussion 4 1 urea and amino acid distribution urea concentrations 2 3 5 3 µm in the st lucie watershed were higher than mean values 1 4 µm commonly found in the lakes of central north america bogard et al 2012 excessive urea can promote the growth of toxic cyanobacteria in phosphorus p rich lakes 0 05 mg dissolved p l 1 donald et al 2011 in fact dissolved p concentrations have been shown to be 0 05 mg p l 1 in the storm waters of the st lucie watershed li et al 2017 the high urea concentrations in pd1 may have resulted from direct deposits of cow manure or from transport to surrounding ditches during the periods of high hydrologic runoff tilman et al 2001 interestingly we observed a lower percentage of water don as urea 3 3 2 5 than commonly found in american lakes and rivers 5 54 bogard et al 2012 wiegner et al 2006 suggestive of other don sources such as amino acids higher concentrations of dcaa than dfaa in both water and sediment support other work showing that dfaa is cycled more quickly than dcaa sarmento et al 2013 the concentrations of dfaa in the canal water were significantly lower than those in the cgd and pd samples this could be caused by either degradation or dilution of the dfaa in the canal the significantly higher di scores of the canal samples suggest it is due to more significant degradation of the dfaa downstream rather than dilution the low concentration of water and sediment dapa fig 2 a biomarker for gram negative bacteria philben et al 2014 suggests a low abundance of gram negative bacteria in the st lucie watershed however this is a contrast to other reports that suggested gram negative bacteria are common in irrigation water river stream and sediment benjamin et al 2013 jovanovic et al 2017 reche et al 2016 the absence of df hyp hydroxyproline in water and sediment used as a biomarker for vascular plant carbon and nitrogen philben et al 2014 may have been due to the insoluble nature of the proteins in which hyp is present cassab 1998 the significant difference between the molar composition of dfaa and dcaa between water and sediments fig 4 suggests there is some fundamental difference in protein peptide composition of the two biomes however both the free and combined amino acids in the water column can be modeled using the model which only takes sediment composition into account the primary factor in that model for amino acids is factor 1 which is largely driven by lap activity an enzyme responsible for cleaving peptides the correlations between sediment lap and water column amino acid concentrations suggest that the dominant source of peptides and amino acids in the water column are likely from the breakdown of proteins in the sediment the very soluble amino acid cysteine was detected in the dcaa and dfaa of water samples but not in the sediments two other highly soluble amino acids threonine and glycine are relatively enriched in the dfaa water samples compared to the sediments therefore we hypothesize that the compositional difference observed between water column amino acids and sediment amino acids are driven largely by the solubility of the different amino acids and peptides and sorption desorption onto mineral sediments in addition to cysteine another sulfur containing amino acid methionine is also enriched in the water column but we are unable to determine a possible mechanism at this time the ph and salinity were invariable across all the sampling sites 9 0 0 3 and 0 36 0 16 respectively although we did not measure the mineral composition of the sediments they are likely similar within this small drainage basin considering that the soil surrounding all the sampling sites is alfisol these parameters will affect the solubility and subsequent sorption desorption kinetics of amino acids and proteins therefore future studies should consider these variables when using our model for amino acid concentrations and further optimization of the model may be necessary under different conditions 4 2 fluorescence compounds distribution fluorescence c1 covaried with mean annual temperature and percentage of agriculture in the catchment kothawala et al 2014 c2 is a potential product of terrestrial dom and correlated positively with water no3 n and chlorophyll a concentrations fellman et al 2010 osburn et al 2015 wu et al 2017 c3 is photo labile and regarded as terrestrial dom marker osburn et al 2015 in situ produced tryptophan like c4 like contributed 20 of sediment total fluorescence wu et al 2017 on average c1 c2 c3 and c4 represented 61 22

water 2 2 and sediment 2 0 water c2 which may be produced by heterotrophic bacteria rochelle newall and fisher 2002 had a linear relationship with degradation index of sediment dcaa r 0 84 p 0 005 this result indicates that sediment resuspension and the resultant decomposition of sediment dom may supply water fluorescence dom 4 3 validation of the pls model urbanization industrial and metropolitan effluents agriculture and channel modifications have altered and impaired river ecosystems throughout the world at an unprecedented rate hill et al 2010 in addition the temporal changes of different don forms bogard et al 2012 freese et al 2007 li et al 2016 ni et al 2016 complicate the anthropogenic impact on aquatic don an increase in nutrient and sediment influx reduces water quality langland and cronin 2003 li et al 2016 degradation index of dfaa and dcaa biological index and florescence index were similar between overlying water and sediment suggesting a strong exchange between water column and sediment therefore using sediment parameters to predict the variations of water variables was reliable fig 5 and table s1 the model can only explain 52 variation of water urea concentration which was reported to have a relationship with mean water column oxygen concentration bogard et al 2012 however water urea here had a week correlation with water oxygen concentration r2

polypeptide chains at the amino acid n terminus to provide c and n for microorganisms the activity of lap was higher than the geometric mean value in freshwater sediments 1653 µmol h 1gc 1 sinsabaugh et al 2012 the activity of lap had a positive interaction with sediment organic carbon sinsabaugh et al 2014 and water c4 williams et al 2010 sediment activity of lap had no associations with sediment organic matter or water fluorescence compounds here but had a positive correlation with water df arg and thr dc cys and lys r 0 67 p 0 05 concentrations of sediment nh4 n were relatively low as the bridge of don between sediment and water it played an unequivocal role in transformations of aquatic don sediment nh4 n was closely associated with 14 water dfaa suggesting sediment n was released to water through denitrification process therefore the model including sediment nh4 n and lap worked best in explaining variations of water dfaa followed by dcaa microbial and photochemical processes often play a more important role than the original source in determining molecular composition of dom in aquatic systems chaffin and bridgeman 2014 however mean value of biological index in water and sediment was 0 56 and 0 58 respectively lower than the value of low autochthonous component 0 6 0 7 huguet et al 2009 suggesting weak biodegradation processes in the agricultural catchments hence factor 2 which was loaded most by fluorescence compounds table 3 only explained 14 of variances of water amino acids fig 5 and the model cannot effectively explain the variances of fluorescence compounds however the model explained 98 of biological index that reveal the freshness of dom 4 4 implications as a source of n agricultural catchments play a crucial role in determining the nutrient

amino acid and urea may pose a threat to water quality complicated pretreatment time consuming measurement and requirement of high performance liquid chromatography make it difficult to add amino

6951,carbon 14 14c has been measured in groundwater for over half a century and remains a widely used tool for understanding groundwater flow systems ultimately the usefulness of 14c as a groundwater tracer relies on the ability to distinguish between changes in concentration due to various chemical physical processes e g chemical reactions with solid carbonate material conditions at the water table and changes due to ageing along flow paths the latter being most informative of groundwater flow conditions to this end a number of correction methodologies have been developed to account for chemical modifications in groundwater systems in this paper we implement two different single sample correction models one for closed and one for open system carbonate dissolution in conjunction with a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach at two sites the sedimentary port willunga formation aquifer in south australia and a fractured rock aquifer in the hamersley basin northwest australia for comparison we include argon 39 39ar data taken from some of the wells sampled and use a mixing envelope constraint in the mcmc procedure we found that considering all of the errors associated with 14c correction resulted in a distribution of values to consider for groundwater dating procedures when accounting for all parameters associated with single sample correction techniques the associated error was 10 times greater than the analytical errors additionally inclusion of the 39ar data produced mixed results with little improvement observed in the port willunga aquifer closed system correction and a significant improvement observed at the hamersley site open system this is most likely due to the mixing caused by long screens and the sensitivity of the open system correction model our results highlight the importance of considering all sources of error in groundwater dating studies keywords groundwater dating carbon 14 correction models argon 39 1 introduction groundwater age offers an important insight into the time frames of key processes occurring in aquifer systems groundwater ages can be used to predict recharge rates mcmahon et al 2011 wood et al 2015 quantify mixing in groundwater systems małoszewski and zuber 1982 and understand groundwater sustainability jasechko et al 2017 ages are inferred by measuring concentrations of chemical and isotopic species in aquifers and relating measured concentrations to recharge times using interpretive models ideally the concentration of the measured chemical compound should only reflect the time since recharge i e aging this can only be achieved if other processes that modify the concentration can be accounted for and corrected one of the most commonly used chemical compounds to determine groundwater ages is carbon 14 14c vogel 1967 carbon 14 decays with a half life of 5730 years hence knowing the decay related change in concentration since recharge allows an age to be determined however the measurements of 14c used for dating are performed on the dissolved inorganic carbon dic within a sample and therefore the 14c activity will reflect all processes that 1 modify dic concentration e g dissolution of solid carbonate addition of geogenic co2 or 2 do not change dic concentration but modify 14c e g carbon exchange between dic and solid carbonate han and plummer 2016 for example in a carbonate aquifer dissolution of aquifer material will add dead carbon to the dic pool resulting in dilution of 14c activity and an apparent aging of the sample in many simple applications of the method the estimated flow or recharge rate is directly proportional to the age and therefore an older apparent 14c age will result in an underestimate of flow or recharge rate currently a number of techniques exist to correct 14c activities for an extensive review see han and plummer 2016 these include modelling geochemical evolution along a flow path plummer 1977 single sample correction techniques using a carbon 13 13c mass balance ingerson and pearson 1964 mook and bommerson 1974 han and plummer 2013 measuring recharge concentrations wood et al 2014 and statistical methods gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 han et al 2014 meredith et al 2018 the processes that affect 14c can also be included in full flow and transport modelling salmon et al 2015 these methods vary in their complexity data requirements and assumptions the most widely used technique is single sample based models however these require some assumptions about the processes affecting 14c activities in the aquifer and information about the 13c and 14c concentrations of end members the values of these end members will depend on aquifer material and the vegetation types c3 or c4 in recharge areas when applying single sample methods the choice of end member values is based upon some understanding of the studied groundwater flow system for example the fractionation of soil gas carbon isotope ratios δ13c that will occur due to soil carbon cycling is dependent on the pathways in which plants process carbon c3 or c4 plants however the plant speciation at the site may have also varied over time additionally measurements of δ13c of aquifer material may vary spatially making end members difficult to determine in this study a markov chain monte carlo method is used to constrain 14c corrections we also perform the procedure with a limited number of argon 39 39ar samples to assess if the inclusion of a second tracer can reduce ranges of corrected 14c 14ccorr activities evaluation of the full distribution of 14ccorr activities allows for correction errors to be propagated to estimates of groundwater age we demonstrate the method at two field sites one in south australia where closed system carbonate dissolution is occurring and another in northwest australia where open system carbonate dissolution is occurring 2 field sites 2 1 port willunga formation aquifer the willunga embayment is located approximately 35 km south of the city of adelaide south australia the port willunga formation is the collective name given to the stratigraphic units that comprise the upper tertiary aquifer of the willunga embayment and includes the aldinga ruwarung and pirramimma sand members these cainozoic sediments are bounded to the south east by the willunga fault and to the north by basement rock cooper and mckenzie 1979 the ruwarung member composed of calcareous sands silts and clays is present mostly in the coastal part of the basin and is not present at or up gradient of the locations investigated in this study of the two more extensive formations the aldinga member is a marine limestone extending inland from the coast cooper and mckenzie 1979 the pirramimma sand overlies the aldinga member in the central part of the basin and represents the majority of the port willunga formation aquifer away from the coast fairburn 1998 the pirramimma sand member consists of fine unconsolidated and weakly cemented calcareous sand cooper and mckenzie 1979 groundwater samples were collected from two monitoring networks in the willunga embayment some samples were taken from an existing network of state government monitoring bores and other samples were collected from new groundwater monitoring wells installed to monitor regional groundwater flow surface water and groundwater interaction flow across a regional fault and sea water intrusion all samples were taken from monitoring wells with short production screen lengths 6 m long as collectively the screened intervals of the wells covered the entire thickness of the aquifer sampled 14c activities range between 1 4 and 94 7 pmc the port willunga aquifer is semi confined with a shallow water table within five metres of the surface the sediments in the unconfined components have a limited carbonate content therefore we have assumed that carbonate dissolution happens under closed conditions for this reason we apply a closed system correction model to the samples collected at this site 2 2 hamersley basin the hamersley basin of north west australia contains one of the oldest aquifers on the planet earth 2 ga the samples collected at this field site were obtained from an operational mine approximately 75 km west of newman western australia these samples have previously been reported in cook et al 2017 and mccallum et al 2017 the site has a sub tropical climate typical of the pilbara region recharge occurs through ephemeral streams during flood periods dogramaci et al 2012 which coincide with the timing of tropical cyclones rouillard et al 2015 unlike the port willunga formation site where samples were taken from wells with short production screens the samples collected at hamersley basin came from production bores with long screen lengths up to 100 m these production bores extend across a number of geological units including tertiary detritals and the main water bearing unit the dolomitic wittenoom formation measured 14c at the site falls within a narrow range and shows significant discrepancies with young tracers chlorofluorocarbons cfcs suggesting extensive mixing between young and old waters mccallum et al 2017 the hammersley basin site contains a significant amount of calcrete in the recharge area around ephemeral streams fig 1 the ephemeral recharge mechanism also creates a significant unsaturated zone it is likely that the carbonate dissolution occurs in the unsaturated component of the aquifer hence we have applied an open system correction model to the hamersley site 3 methods 3 1 field methods the groundwater sampling procedure at the two sites was customised for the type of wells being sampled for samples collected from the port willunga formation aquifer three bore volumes were purged prior to sampling samples taken from hamersley basin were collected from active production bores in situ temperature ph and electrical conductivity measurements were collected during sampling with a calibrated handheld ysi portable field meter 3 1 1 carbon 14 and δ13c samples were collected in one litre bottles for carbon isotope analysis all samples from the willunga site were analysed for 13c using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and 14c using accelerated mass spectrometry ams at gns rafter radiocarbon laboratory in new zealand for the pilbara site samples collected after 2008 were analysed in the same way however earlier samples for 13c used either irms or ams at csiro land and water australia and 14c samples were analysed using ams at the australian national university 3 1 2 argon 39 gas samples for 39ar analysis were collected in the field by degassing of groundwater collected from the monitoring and production bores following the method described by purtschert et al 2013 in all cases more than three m3 of water was required to obtain gas samples of approximately 6 5 bar of pressure in ten litre gas cylinders a gas volume of 6 4 10 2 m3 analysis of the samples was undertaken at the university of bern in switzerland by low level gas proportional counting loosli et al 1986 loosli and purtschert 2005 riedmann and purtschert 2016 3 2 correction techniques the correction of 14c activities was undertaken following the method outlined by han and plummer 2013 the single sample method assumes that the correction can be carried out using the carbonate speciation within a sample and a mass balance using δ13c end members the carbonate speciation of the sample can be estimated using equilibrium constants determined as a function of temperature mook 2000 the speciation of carbonates in a sample i e dissolved co2 hco3 co3 2 is determined by the ph the carbonate speciation of the sample can be determined as 1 c b h k 1 h 2 h k 1 k 1 k 2 c t 2 c a c t c b where c a is the dissolved co2 concentration c b is the concentration of bicarbonate and c t is the total dissolved carbon concentration the determination of the constants followed the equations presented by millero and rabindra 1997 these constants can be obtained using the equations as where k 10 pk 3 pk 1 3404 71 t 0 032786 t 14 8435 4 pk 2 2902 39 t 0 02379 t 6 4980 where t is the temperature in k and the p symbol represents that these values are the log of the constants the δ13c balance requires the definition of two end members the end members for soil gas and solid soil aquifer carbonate the mass balance is conducted by accounting for the fractionation processes that occur during changes in the ionic composition of the water the fractionations are determined as a function of temperature mook 2000 defining an appropriate soil gas end member requires knowledge of the plant speciation as c3 and c4 type plants induce a different fractionation on soil gas over the time important to 14c dating this speciation may have changed huang et al 2006 the processes that alter 14c activities also depend on whether the system is open or closed to atmospheric co2 in this analysis we implement both the open system and closed system corrections presented by han and plummer 2013 dependant on the field site contitions section 2 the equation for open system 14c correction is given as 5 14 c 0 c a c t 14 c a 0 c b c t 14 c b 0 14 c g 14 c b 0 0 2 ε g b δ 13 c c a c t δ 13 c a 0 c b c t δ 13 c b 0 δ 13 c g δ 13 c b 0 ε g b where we assume 14 c 0 is the corrected initial 14c activity of the sample water 14 c a 0 is the atmospheric 14c activity 14 c b 0 is the 14c activity of dissolved bicarbonate which is produced under the assumption that only carbonate dissolution has occurred without further carbon exchange between bicarbonate and soil gas and or solid carbonate where 14 c b 0 14 c a 0 2 14 c g is the soil gas 14c activity were we assume 14 c g 14 c a 0 ε g b is the fractionation between the gas and bicarbonate phases ε g b 9483 t 23 89 δ 13 c is the δ13c of the groundwater sample δ 13 c a 0 is the δ13c of dissolved soil co2 δ 13 c g is the δ13c of soil co2 and δ 13 c b 0 is the δ13c of dissolved bicarbonate assuming that only carbonate dissolution has occurred in a system closed to atmospheric or soil gas the correction for initial 14c activities of the sample can be given by 6 14 c 0 c a c t 14 c a 0 c b c t 14 c b 0 14 c b 0 0 2 ε s b δ 13 c c a c t δ 13 c a 0 c b c t δ 13 c b 0 δ 13 c s δ 13 c b 0 ε s b where ε s b is the fractionation between the calcite and bicarbonate ε s b 4232 t 15 1 and δ 13 c s is the δ13c of the carbonate mineral when correcting a sample activity we make the following approximation 7 14 c corr 14 c 14 c 0 14 c g where 14 c corr is the corrected activity of 14c in the groundwater sample accounting for decay and carbonate exchange 14 c is the measured 14c in the groundwater sample this varies from the standard method where the initial activity of individual samples is modified and used for groundwater dating this correction approach allows for all samples to be interpreted with the atmospheric curve eq 7 is only an approximation as eqs 5 and 6 are not linearly related to the soil gas 14c end member which has historically varied due to bomb testing since the 1940s this leads to errors when correcting equations with modern activities 100pmc which can be useful in studies of younger waters in our testing we have found that the ratio of 14 c g 14 c 0 varies by less than 2 when varying 14cg between 100 and 160pmc therefore we believe that eq 7 is a valid approximation allowing the direct determination of concentrations for all samples 3 3 determining ranges of 14ccorr the equations referenced above use multiple parameters both measured e g temperature and ph and estimated e g δ13c end members measured parameters have an associated analytical error and the estimated parameters have a range of possible values when using 14ccorr to make hydrogeological predictions of recharge and travel times the associated errors are important to consider therefore we present a procedure that propagates the uncertainties of the correction model parameters to the 14ccorr values we implemented a markov chain monte carlo approach to predict plausible ranges of 14ccorr concentrations the mcmc method has previously been applied to environmental tracer studies massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh 2013 petersen et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 some of these studies have included the estimation of the fraction of mineral carbon to account for 14c modification massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2017 the main difference between the present study and the previous study is the focus on using a bayesian approach to determine site wide end members prior to further age determination the mcmc selected method is known as the metropolis hastings algorithm metropolis et al 1953 the method determines a posterior probability distribution by maximising the likelihood of the parameters subject to some constraints fig 2 presents the concept of likelihood for measured parameters the likelihood is described as a normal distribution using the measured value as the mean and the measurement error as the standard deviation as the value of the parameter moves away from the mean value the likelihood is reduced the rate at which the likelihood decreases is dependent on the standard deviation or error of the measured value therefore measurements with a higher error produce a larger range of plausible values for un measured parameters the likelihood can be defined as a normal or uniform distribution for a uniform distribution the likelihood is defined as one within the plausible range and zero outside this range the range of 14ccorr activities can also be constrained the processes of 14c decay and carbon exchange will result in the measured value 14c being the minimum possible value hence this forms a lower limit for 14ccorr additionally the maximum value for 14ccorr would represent the maximum possible initial 14c activity input to a groundwater system therefore the upper limit of 14ccorr is 160 pmc the maximum atmospheric value in the southern hemisphere the metropolis hastings method works by assessing the likelihood here used in log scale ln l of individual model runs for a set of generated parameters for the sampled values of ph 14c δ13c 39ar and t the likelihood assumes that the samples have a normal distribution where the mean is the measured value and the standard deviation is the measurement error the variable part of the log likelihood of these sample parameters can be described as 8 ln l 1 σ 2 obs mod 2 where σ is the measurement error and obs and mod are the measured and current modelled parameter values respectively we see that moving model parameters away from the measured value will result in the likelihood will becoming more negative at a rate scaled by the measurement error meaning that a higher value of the likelihood indicates a better fit the total likelihood of a model run is a product of all the individual likelihoods in a non log space the likelihood is the multiplication of the individual likelihoods hence in log space the likelihood for each concentration can be summed to give the total likelihood as stated above we implemented a number of constraints on the corrected ranges such that 9 ln l 0 min val max 9999 otherwise where val represents the parameter or constraint of interest and the desired range of that parameter defined between min and max this measure effectively penalises corrected 14c activities where correction parameters do not meet our additional constraints eq 9 included the following constraints the 14ccorr activity is greater than or equal to the 14c concentration min and less than the maximum decay corrected 14c recharge concentration max the δ13c end members fall within the prior ranges specified below the metropolis hastings algorithm is a mcmc which generates new parameter sets based on the current parameter values accepting the new parameters dependent on likelihood the initial parameter set is chosen at by randomly sampling the ranges of measured and unknown values each of the parameter sets contains values for each of the parameters of interest this includes all of the chemical values of the sampled sites and end member values used to determine 14ccorr a higher likelihood is obtained when the sample values are more representative of measured chemical values all parameter sets that produce a higher likelihood are accepted and parameter sets that produce a lower likelihood are accepted conditional on the probability of the poorer likelihood a parameter set that produces a small reduction in likelihood is more probable than one that produces a large reduction in likelihood the method therefore favours parameter combinations that represent the measured data and constraints better initially a burn in period is implemented to allow for the markov chain to find a favourable parameter set based on the initial conditions we used 10 000 samples for the burn in period after this burn in period the sampled values form the distribution of 14ccorr that should be considered in dating or modelling studies additionally the resulting distributions of the δ13c end member mixing parameters δ13cg and δ13cs sampled by the mcmc represent the joint distribution of the values that were considered when determining 14ccorr activities at the sites these distributions were obtained from 200 000 samples 3 4 constraining correction parameters using argon 39 a key component of our approach is to assess the accuracy of single sample correction models using a second tracer the use of a piston flow model is only appropriate when the mixing of multiple ages is negligible mccallum et al 2015 however the maximum variation of two environmental tracers can be defined using mixing envelopes cook et al 2017 the mixing envelope defines the ranges of concentrations that can be obtained from the combination of any points obtained from a piston flow line this effectively represents all plausible concentration relationships for the two tracers from physical mixing and ageing processes hence all samples corrected for geochemical processes must fall within these ranges it should be noted that measured samples that lie within the mixing envelope may also contain some modification from carbonate dissolution and carbon exchange and a correction may still be required fig 3 shows the data from the port willunga formation aquifer and hamersley basin sites at sites where both 39ar and 14c are sampled the corrected 14c activities should fall within the mixing envelope for an appropriate range of δ13c end members to be valid in the single sample correction model all of the resulting corrections from the sites must fall within the mixing envelope argon 39 has a half life of 269 years and is appropriate for dating groundwater between 100 and 1000 years filling the gap between young tracers like 3h cfcs and 85kr and 14c the advantages of using 39ar are that it is not affected by geochemical reactions has a well known and constant input value and is sensitive over some of the range of values where changes in 14c may be attributable to carbonate exchange due to it s low abundance in natural water 39ar needs to be obtained from a large volume of water if measured by proportional counting lu et al 2014 the 1 3 tons of water that needs to be degassed in the field means that it is often not practical to collect a large number of 39ar samples however here we investigate the use of a limited number of groundwater samples analysed for 39ar concentrations to constrain 14ccorr activities of groundwater in large scale aquifers the data collected from sites with 39ar samples can also be included in the procedure by including a mixing envelope constraint this includes penalising values of 39ar 100 pma which arises where measured values are close to 100 pma and the analytical uncertainty theoretically allows values above 100 pma this is implemented as 10 in l 0 inside 9999 outside hence the constraint of the second tracer 39ar is included in the likelihood assessment our results present the correction procedure for scenarios where 39ar is included and excluded from the analysis for comparison 3 5 ranges for correction parameters the ranges of the correction parameters for the δ13c mass balance are presented in table 1 typically the soil gas end members are determined by the plant speciation the fractionation between gas and water is different for c3 and c4 type plants however over the time frames important to 14c dating the plant speciation may change in the recharge area hence we have adopted a range encompassing both c3 and c4 plants the one limit of the end member is that it cannot be greater than the value of the corrected groundwater sample this was enforced in our study the other parameters important to the method are temperature and ph temperature is an important parameter of the correction scheme as it controls the fractionation rates of δ13c and equilibrium constants in this study we have assumed an error of the temperature measurements of 1 c the error was assumed to be normally distributed and samples were generated using the measured concentration as the mean the ph also has an impact on the correction scheme as it controls the speciation of carbonate minerals for a given set of equilibrium constants we assumed an error of the ph measurements of 0 5 ph units and the sampling was implemented in the same way as temperature finally the measured 14c δ13c and 39ar concentrations in the groundwater samples play an important role in the calculations of 14ccorr activities the measurement errors are presented in tables 2 and 3 these errors were also implemented in the sampling scheme of the markov chain monte carlo method 4 results the measured 14c activities for most of the groundwater samples in the port willunga formation aquifer fall within the mixing envelope with 39ar fig 3 this suggests that the mixing of old and young groundwater is a plausible scenario in that the concentrations of both the 39ar and the 14c are explainable by physical mixing processes alone as the envelope represents all cases of two component mixing conversely the data from hamersley basin falls outside the envelope of the plausible ranges explained by only physical processes except for two samples hence some level of correction is required for the data the 14ccorr activities for four example wells are presented in fig 4 the example represents two sites where both 39ar and 14c were measured fig 4a and b and two sites where only 14c was measured fig 4c and d we have also included sites from both the port willunga aquifer fig 4a and c and the hamersley site fig 4b and d for the sites from the port willunga aquifer the ranges of corrected values are narrower than those for the hamersley site when excluding 39ar from the analysis this is because the closed system model is less sensitive to variation in ph t and δ13c end members when 39ar is included in the correction only a minor change is observed for the sites located in the port willunga aquifer fig 4a and c conversely the range of the corrected values is significantly reduced for the samples collected from the hamersley site fig 4b and d this is the case for the site with fig 4a and without fig 4b additional 39ar data hence the 39ar data collected at selected sites is able to improve estimates of14ccorr activities at all sites as the end member values of the correction models are shared between all sites histograms from other sites are available in the supplementary material sections 1 through 4 in comparing the changes in the 14ccorr activities that include the mixing envelope constraint we can examine both the change in the median value and the range of values defined by the standard deviation for the closed system port willunga aquifer negligible changes were observed in both the median and the range of values the average change in the median 4ccorr value was an 0 08 pmc reduction and the average change in the standard deviation was an 0 05 pmc reduction for the open system hamersley site the changes were significant an average increase of 6 pmc for the median value and a 3 pmc reduction in the standard deviation the mixing plot of 39ar and 14c after the correction procedures are presented in fig 5 for the port willunga formation aquifer the closed system correction moves the samples to the right of the atmospheric mixing line consistent with the observations of relative ranges and values of 14ccorr activity there is little difference between the points obtained from the scenarios despite the inclusion of the mixing envelope constraints the region to the right of the mixing line represents mixtures between post 1950s bomb peak recharge and pre 1950 s recharge this was also validated by the presence of some detectable 85kr at the site these values ranged from 0 6 to 2 0 dpm cm3 compared to a modern recharge value of 70 dpm cm3 suggesting a measurable component of young water for the samples collected from the hamersley site some of the samples corrected without the mixing envelope constraint still fall outside the envelope additionally the changes between the scenarios are more significant than at the port willunga aquifer site the error of the corrections for the hamersley basin and port willunga aquifer groundwater is much greater than for the analytical measurement error comparison of figs 3 and 5 however the revised errors from the correction model include the errors attributable to both the measurement errors and the other parameters and constraints interestingly the correction also modifies 39ar ranges because the mcmc procedure will also favour 39ar values that honour the mixing envelope fig 6 presents an example of a measured and posterior distribution of 39ar concentrations the mixing envelope constraint at the hamersley basin site removed groundwater samples with 39ar values 100 pma resulting in reduction of the range of plausible 39ar values the corrected 39ar ranges for all sites are located in the supplementary material sections 5 and 6 the posterior distributions of the δ13c end members for both sites are presented in table 4 for the four scenarios the posterior ranges of the soil gas end members were significantly reduced from the prior ranges table 1 for the port willunga formation aquifer the end members were predicted to have similar ranges both with and without the inclusion of 39ar data the ranges for the soil gas end member are more representative of c3 vegetation this is consistent with the eucalyptus vegetation type that historically covered the willunga embayment conversely the soil gas end member at the hamersley basin site is more representative of c4 vegetation it is also of note that the inclusion of the 39ar data both reduces the median value and narrows the range this is consistent with the reduction in the range of corrected 14c activities rouillard et al 2016 found that the alternating δ13c of sediment organic matter indicated variations between c3 and c4 type plants over the past 2000 years at the hamersley site the sediment records indicate that the c4 type vegetation is most representative of a period approximately 500 1400 years ago however this is not consistent with the ages of corrected 39ar suggesting some mixing of older water fig 7 presents the corrected and measured 14c activities for all sites the correction for the port willunga formation aquifer results in a significant number of sites reporting post 1950 s water this suggests that age interpretations made on samples with lower 14c activities are less sensitive to carbon exchange processes for the hamersley basin site the correction results in a large range of 14ccorr activities measured ranges were relatively narrow for 14c activities 20 50 pmc however the corrected activities indicate a greater range of concentrations suggesting a greater variation in the apparent groundwater ages at the site 5 discussion the stochastic method we used in this study allows the determination of uncertainties of not only measured 14c activities but also all of the parameters important for correction to be considered in arriving at a final range of 14ccorr activities additionally we extended the method to use sparsely collected 39ar data to inform the parameters of single sample 14c correction models we have shown that the range of plausible values of 14ccorr activities is much higher than analytical data alone the results of our analysis suggest that the errors associated with 14ccorr activity of groundwater samples 10 pmc is two orders of magnitude higher compared to analytical error 0 1 pmc when including 39ar data we found that the largest reduction in uncertainty was observed at the hamersley site the reduction was not only observed in groundwater samples analysed for 39ar concentrations but also at sites where only 14c was collected this reduction in uncertainty was attributable to the narrowed ranges of the soil gas end member that were modified by penalising values that resulted in 14ccorr and 39ar combinations falling outside the mixing envelope this is significant in that the collection of a relatively small number of groundwater samples with 39ar concentrations can improve the accuracy of 14ccorr values across the entire site this work builds on previous studies that apply bayesian techniques to environmental tracer studies massoudieh et al 2012 petersen et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 one of the outcomes of the method presented here is that the data for 39ar concentrations and 14ccorr activity are no longer independent observations but form a joint probability distribution and therefore further interpretation can no longer consider these observations independently this is because the use of the mixing envelope constraint correlates the two corrected concentrations i e each sample of 14ccorr corresponds to a specific sample 39ar value it is also notable that the error ranges and mean values of the 39ar were modified by the modelling parameter estimation procedures by invoking the mixing envelope constraint the viable ranges of the 39ar data became lower than the measurement errors for 39ar note the measurement error is relatively high for the 39ar relative to 14c this is evidenced by comparing the vertical error bars in figs 4 and 5 and is directly presented in fig 6 although we have used 39ar to form the mixing envelope here it would be possible to use multiple other tracers e g tritium cfcs and helium 4 the advantage of using 39ar is that it has a more sensitive age range than young tracers like tritium and cfcs which results in a more constrained mixing envelope argon 39 also covers the range of ages where the decay of 14c is not significant as young tracers are only present in water recharged after 1950 the mixture between pre 1950 waters and post 1950 waters form a fairly unconstrained range also if other processes affect tracer concentrations after the recharge event then these would also need to be considered in the correction schemes for example degradation of cfcs or production of helium 4 4he would modify the shape of the mixing envelope but could be jointly estimated in the procedure the estimation of additional processes has previously been included in the studies of massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 estimating these parameters would likely increase the degrees of freedom and hence the overall ranges of the non mixed values previous studies used validation of 14c ages with recharge temperatures using noble gases edmunds and smedley 2000 and radiogenic 4he measurements aeschbach hertig et al 2002 our modelling framework builds on these studies by formalising a multi tracer validation approach using a mixing envelope constraint and in an mcmc framework in this study we have used a single sample model however other methods exist to determine 14ccorr geochemical mass balance techniques may have been applicable at the port willunga formation site because the monitoring wells were completed with shorter production screen lengths which allow for the sampling of individual flow paths however at the hamersley basin site the convergent flow field induced by sampling from wells with long production screen lengths would make it difficult to obtain multiple samples from a single flow path further improvements may be made for calculated age at this site by making soil gas measurements e g wood et al 2015 as modifications to the carbon occurring in the vadose zone seem to be attributable to open system models the implications of the 14ccorr activity is also important for our understanding of the conceptual hydrogeology of the site in the port willunga aquifer the 14ccorr ranges suggest a substantial amount of modern recharge this is consistent with the slow water table decline observed at the site despite the high volume of extraction for irrigation purposes it is also consistent with the understanding of significant ephemeral recharge at the site batlle aguilar and cook 2012 batlle aguilar et al 2015 the corrected mixtures also indicate the mixing of modern 14ccorr 100 pmc and water up to 460 years old 39ar 30 pma this suggests some amount of mixing even for short screens which may be attributable to heterogeneity of the aquifer engdahl et al 2012 mccallum et al 2014 for the hamersley site the values of 14ccorr correspond to the understanding of the transient nature of flooding and recharge dogramaci et al 2012 rouillard et al 2016 mccallum et al 2017 this is also consistent with the observation of measurable concentrations of young tracers post 1950 at the site cook et al 2017 6 conclusions this investigation highlighted the need to account for all sources of error when performing corrections with single sample models to determine 14ccorr activities for groundwater dating our work has provided two main outcomes firstly when we consider the errors of all components of 14ccorr the error is 100 times greater than the analytical error this is important when including 14ccorr activities in hydrogeological studies especially when additional data is being compared these errors can be significant when assessing aspects of a system given the timeframes associated with 14c decay secondly we found that the use of a second tracer 39ar provided improved estimates of 14ccorr activities at the hamersley basin aquifer where open system carbonate dissolution was occurring the improvements observed in the port willunga aquifer where a closed system condition prevails were not substantial this is related to the relative sensitivity of the open and closed system models to parameters including ph temperature and δ13c end members future work should include the uncertainties of single site correction models with more constrained forms of groundwater age distributions as the second

6951,carbon 14 14c has been measured in groundwater for over half a century and remains a widely used tool for understanding groundwater flow systems ultimately the usefulness of 14c as a groundwater tracer relies on the ability to distinguish between changes in concentration due to various chemical physical processes e g chemical reactions with solid carbonate material conditions at the water table and changes due to ageing along flow paths the latter being most informative of groundwater flow conditions to this end a number of correction methodologies have been developed to account for chemical modifications in groundwater systems in this paper we implement two different single sample correction models one for closed and one for open system carbonate dissolution in conjunction with a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach at two sites the sedimentary port willunga formation aquifer in south australia and a fractured rock aquifer in the hamersley basin northwest australia for comparison we include argon 39 39ar data taken from some of the wells sampled and use a mixing envelope constraint in the mcmc procedure we found that considering all of the errors associated with 14c correction resulted in a distribution of values to consider for groundwater dating procedures when accounting for all parameters associated with single sample correction techniques the associated error was 10 times greater than the analytical errors additionally inclusion of the 39ar data produced mixed results with little improvement observed in the port willunga aquifer closed system correction and a significant improvement observed at the hamersley site open system this is most likely due to the mixing caused by long screens and the sensitivity of the open system correction model our results highlight the importance of considering all sources of error in groundwater dating studies keywords groundwater dating carbon 14 correction models argon 39 1 introduction groundwater age offers an important insight into the time frames of key processes occurring in aquifer systems groundwater ages can be used to predict recharge rates mcmahon et al 2011 wood et al 2015 quantify mixing in groundwater systems małoszewski and zuber 1982 and understand groundwater sustainability jasechko et al 2017 ages are inferred by measuring concentrations of chemical and isotopic species in aquifers and relating measured concentrations to recharge times using interpretive models ideally the concentration of the measured chemical compound should only reflect the time since recharge i e aging this can only be achieved if other processes that modify the concentration can be accounted for and corrected one of the most commonly used chemical compounds to determine groundwater ages is carbon 14 14c vogel 1967 carbon 14 decays with a half life of 5730 years hence knowing the decay related change in concentration since recharge allows an age to be determined however the measurements of 14c used for dating are performed on the dissolved inorganic carbon dic within a sample and therefore the 14c activity will reflect all processes that 1 modify dic concentration e g dissolution of solid carbonate addition of geogenic co2 or 2 do not change dic concentration but modify 14c e g carbon exchange between dic and solid carbonate han and plummer 2016 for example in a carbonate aquifer dissolution of aquifer material will add dead carbon to the dic pool resulting in dilution of 14c activity and an apparent aging of the sample in many simple applications of the method the estimated flow or recharge rate is directly proportional to the age and therefore an older apparent 14c age will result in an underestimate of flow or recharge rate currently a number of techniques exist to correct 14c activities for an extensive review see han and plummer 2016 these include modelling geochemical evolution along a flow path plummer 1977 single sample correction techniques using a carbon 13 13c mass balance ingerson and pearson 1964 mook and bommerson 1974 han and plummer 2013 measuring recharge concentrations wood et al 2014 and statistical methods gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 han et al 2014 meredith et al 2018 the processes that affect 14c can also be included in full flow and transport modelling salmon et al 2015 these methods vary in their complexity data requirements and assumptions the most widely used technique is single sample based models however these require some assumptions about the processes affecting 14c activities in the aquifer and information about the 13c and 14c concentrations of end members the values of these end members will depend on aquifer material and the vegetation types c3 or c4 in recharge areas when applying single sample methods the choice of end member values is based upon some understanding of the studied groundwater flow system for example the fractionation of soil gas carbon isotope ratios δ13c that will occur due to soil carbon cycling is dependent on the pathways in which plants process carbon c3 or c4 plants however the plant speciation at the site may have also varied over time additionally measurements of δ13c of aquifer material may vary spatially making end members difficult to determine in this study a markov chain monte carlo method is used to constrain 14c corrections we also perform the procedure with a limited number of argon 39 39ar samples to assess if the inclusion of a second tracer can reduce ranges of corrected 14c 14ccorr activities evaluation of the full distribution of 14ccorr activities allows for correction errors to be propagated to estimates of groundwater age we demonstrate the method at two field sites one in south australia where closed system carbonate dissolution is occurring and another in northwest australia where open system carbonate dissolution is occurring 2 field sites 2 1 port willunga formation aquifer the willunga embayment is located approximately 35 km south of the city of adelaide south australia the port willunga formation is the collective name given to the stratigraphic units that comprise the upper tertiary aquifer of the willunga embayment and includes the aldinga ruwarung and pirramimma sand members these cainozoic sediments are bounded to the south east by the willunga fault and to the north by basement rock cooper and mckenzie 1979 the ruwarung member composed of calcareous sands silts and clays is present mostly in the coastal part of the basin and is not present at or up gradient of the locations investigated in this study of the two more extensive formations the aldinga member is a marine limestone extending inland from the coast cooper and mckenzie 1979 the pirramimma sand overlies the aldinga member in the central part of the basin and represents the majority of the port willunga formation aquifer away from the coast fairburn 1998 the pirramimma sand member consists of fine unconsolidated and weakly cemented calcareous sand cooper and mckenzie 1979 groundwater samples were collected from two monitoring networks in the willunga embayment some samples were taken from an existing network of state government monitoring bores and other samples were collected from new groundwater monitoring wells installed to monitor regional groundwater flow surface water and groundwater interaction flow across a regional fault and sea water intrusion all samples were taken from monitoring wells with short production screen lengths 6 m long as collectively the screened intervals of the wells covered the entire thickness of the aquifer sampled 14c activities range between 1 4 and 94 7 pmc the port willunga aquifer is semi confined with a shallow water table within five metres of the surface the sediments in the unconfined components have a limited carbonate content therefore we have assumed that carbonate dissolution happens under closed conditions for this reason we apply a closed system correction model to the samples collected at this site 2 2 hamersley basin the hamersley basin of north west australia contains one of the oldest aquifers on the planet earth 2 ga the samples collected at this field site were obtained from an operational mine approximately 75 km west of newman western australia these samples have previously been reported in cook et al 2017 and mccallum et al 2017 the site has a sub tropical climate typical of the pilbara region recharge occurs through ephemeral streams during flood periods dogramaci et al 2012 which coincide with the timing of tropical cyclones rouillard et al 2015 unlike the port willunga formation site where samples were taken from wells with short production screens the samples collected at hamersley basin came from production bores with long screen lengths up to 100 m these production bores extend across a number of geological units including tertiary detritals and the main water bearing unit the dolomitic wittenoom formation measured 14c at the site falls within a narrow range and shows significant discrepancies with young tracers chlorofluorocarbons cfcs suggesting extensive mixing between young and old waters mccallum et al 2017 the hammersley basin site contains a significant amount of calcrete in the recharge area around ephemeral streams fig 1 the ephemeral recharge mechanism also creates a significant unsaturated zone it is likely that the carbonate dissolution occurs in the unsaturated component of the aquifer hence we have applied an open system correction model to the hamersley site 3 methods 3 1 field methods the groundwater sampling procedure at the two sites was customised for the type of wells being sampled for samples collected from the port willunga formation aquifer three bore volumes were purged prior to sampling samples taken from hamersley basin were collected from active production bores in situ temperature ph and electrical conductivity measurements were collected during sampling with a calibrated handheld ysi portable field meter 3 1 1 carbon 14 and δ13c samples were collected in one litre bottles for carbon isotope analysis all samples from the willunga site were analysed for 13c using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and 14c using accelerated mass spectrometry ams at gns rafter radiocarbon laboratory in new zealand for the pilbara site samples collected after 2008 were analysed in the same way however earlier samples for 13c used either irms or ams at csiro land and water australia and 14c samples were analysed using ams at the australian national university 3 1 2 argon 39 gas samples for 39ar analysis were collected in the field by degassing of groundwater collected from the monitoring and production bores following the method described by purtschert et al 2013 in all cases more than three m3 of water was required to obtain gas samples of approximately 6 5 bar of pressure in ten litre gas cylinders a gas volume of 6 4 10 2 m3 analysis of the samples was undertaken at the university of bern in switzerland by low level gas proportional counting loosli et al 1986 loosli and purtschert 2005 riedmann and purtschert 2016 3 2 correction techniques the correction of 14c activities was undertaken following the method outlined by han and plummer 2013 the single sample method assumes that the correction can be carried out using the carbonate speciation within a sample and a mass balance using δ13c end members the carbonate speciation of the sample can be estimated using equilibrium constants determined as a function of temperature mook 2000 the speciation of carbonates in a sample i e dissolved co2 hco3 co3 2 is determined by the ph the carbonate speciation of the sample can be determined as 1 c b h k 1 h 2 h k 1 k 1 k 2 c t 2 c a c t c b where c a is the dissolved co2 concentration c b is the concentration of bicarbonate and c t is the total dissolved carbon concentration the determination of the constants followed the equations presented by millero and rabindra 1997 these constants can be obtained using the equations as where k 10 pk 3 pk 1 3404 71 t 0 032786 t 14 8435 4 pk 2 2902 39 t 0 02379 t 6 4980 where t is the temperature in k and the p symbol represents that these values are the log of the constants the δ13c balance requires the definition of two end members the end members for soil gas and solid soil aquifer carbonate the mass balance is conducted by accounting for the fractionation processes that occur during changes in the ionic composition of the water the fractionations are determined as a function of temperature mook 2000 defining an appropriate soil gas end member requires knowledge of the plant speciation as c3 and c4 type plants induce a different fractionation on soil gas over the time important to 14c dating this speciation may have changed huang et al 2006 the processes that alter 14c activities also depend on whether the system is open or closed to atmospheric co2 in this analysis we implement both the open system and closed system corrections presented by han and plummer 2013 dependant on the field site contitions section 2 the equation for open system 14c correction is given as 5 14 c 0 c a c t 14 c a 0 c b c t 14 c b 0 14 c g 14 c b 0 0 2 ε g b δ 13 c c a c t δ 13 c a 0 c b c t δ 13 c b 0 δ 13 c g δ 13 c b 0 ε g b where we assume 14 c 0 is the corrected initial 14c activity of the sample water 14 c a 0 is the atmospheric 14c activity 14 c b 0 is the 14c activity of dissolved bicarbonate which is produced under the assumption that only carbonate dissolution has occurred without further carbon exchange between bicarbonate and soil gas and or solid carbonate where 14 c b 0 14 c a 0 2 14 c g is the soil gas 14c activity were we assume 14 c g 14 c a 0 ε g b is the fractionation between the gas and bicarbonate phases ε g b 9483 t 23 89 δ 13 c is the δ13c of the groundwater sample δ 13 c a 0 is the δ13c of dissolved soil co2 δ 13 c g is the δ13c of soil co2 and δ 13 c b 0 is the δ13c of dissolved bicarbonate assuming that only carbonate dissolution has occurred in a system closed to atmospheric or soil gas the correction for initial 14c activities of the sample can be given by 6 14 c 0 c a c t 14 c a 0 c b c t 14 c b 0 14 c b 0 0 2 ε s b δ 13 c c a c t δ 13 c a 0 c b c t δ 13 c b 0 δ 13 c s δ 13 c b 0 ε s b where ε s b is the fractionation between the calcite and bicarbonate ε s b 4232 t 15 1 and δ 13 c s is the δ13c of the carbonate mineral when correcting a sample activity we make the following approximation 7 14 c corr 14 c 14 c 0 14 c g where 14 c corr is the corrected activity of 14c in the groundwater sample accounting for decay and carbonate exchange 14 c is the measured 14c in the groundwater sample this varies from the standard method where the initial activity of individual samples is modified and used for groundwater dating this correction approach allows for all samples to be interpreted with the atmospheric curve eq 7 is only an approximation as eqs 5 and 6 are not linearly related to the soil gas 14c end member which has historically varied due to bomb testing since the 1940s this leads to errors when correcting equations with modern activities 100pmc which can be useful in studies of younger waters in our testing we have found that the ratio of 14 c g 14 c 0 varies by less than 2 when varying 14cg between 100 and 160pmc therefore we believe that eq 7 is a valid approximation allowing the direct determination of concentrations for all samples 3 3 determining ranges of 14ccorr the equations referenced above use multiple parameters both measured e g temperature and ph and estimated e g δ13c end members measured parameters have an associated analytical error and the estimated parameters have a range of possible values when using 14ccorr to make hydrogeological predictions of recharge and travel times the associated errors are important to consider therefore we present a procedure that propagates the uncertainties of the correction model parameters to the 14ccorr values we implemented a markov chain monte carlo approach to predict plausible ranges of 14ccorr concentrations the mcmc method has previously been applied to environmental tracer studies massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh 2013 petersen et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 some of these studies have included the estimation of the fraction of mineral carbon to account for 14c modification massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2017 the main difference between the present study and the previous study is the focus on using a bayesian approach to determine site wide end members prior to further age determination the mcmc selected method is known as the metropolis hastings algorithm metropolis et al 1953 the method determines a posterior probability distribution by maximising the likelihood of the parameters subject to some constraints fig 2 presents the concept of likelihood for measured parameters the likelihood is described as a normal distribution using the measured value as the mean and the measurement error as the standard deviation as the value of the parameter moves away from the mean value the likelihood is reduced the rate at which the likelihood decreases is dependent on the standard deviation or error of the measured value therefore measurements with a higher error produce a larger range of plausible values for un measured parameters the likelihood can be defined as a normal or uniform distribution for a uniform distribution the likelihood is defined as one within the plausible range and zero outside this range the range of 14ccorr activities can also be constrained the processes of 14c decay and carbon exchange will result in the measured value 14c being the minimum possible value hence this forms a lower limit for 14ccorr additionally the maximum value for 14ccorr would represent the maximum possible initial 14c activity input to a groundwater system therefore the upper limit of 14ccorr is 160 pmc the maximum atmospheric value in the southern hemisphere the metropolis hastings method works by assessing the likelihood here used in log scale ln l of individual model runs for a set of generated parameters for the sampled values of ph 14c δ13c 39ar and t the likelihood assumes that the samples have a normal distribution where the mean is the measured value and the standard deviation is the measurement error the variable part of the log likelihood of these sample parameters can be described as 8 ln l 1 σ 2 obs mod 2 where σ is the measurement error and obs and mod are the measured and current modelled parameter values respectively we see that moving model parameters away from the measured value will result in the likelihood will becoming more negative at a rate scaled by the measurement error meaning that a higher value of the likelihood indicates a better fit the total likelihood of a model run is a product of all the individual likelihoods in a non log space the likelihood is the multiplication of the individual likelihoods hence in log space the likelihood for each concentration can be summed to give the total likelihood as stated above we implemented a number of constraints on the corrected ranges such that 9 ln l 0 min val max 9999 otherwise where val represents the parameter or constraint of interest and the desired range of that parameter defined between min and max this measure effectively penalises corrected 14c activities where correction parameters do not meet our additional constraints eq 9 included the following constraints the 14ccorr activity is greater than or equal to the 14c concentration min and less than the maximum decay corrected 14c recharge concentration max the δ13c end members fall within the prior ranges specified below the metropolis hastings algorithm is a mcmc which generates new parameter sets based on the current parameter values accepting the new parameters dependent on likelihood the initial parameter set is chosen at by randomly sampling the ranges of measured and unknown values each of the parameter sets contains values for each of the parameters of interest this includes all of the chemical values of the sampled sites and end member values used to determine 14ccorr a higher likelihood is obtained when the sample values are more representative of measured chemical values all parameter sets that produce a higher likelihood are accepted and parameter sets that produce a lower likelihood are accepted conditional on the probability of the poorer likelihood a parameter set that produces a small reduction in likelihood is more probable than one that produces a large reduction in likelihood the method therefore favours parameter combinations that represent the measured data and constraints better initially a burn in period is implemented to allow for the markov chain to find a favourable parameter set based on the initial conditions we used 10 000 samples for the burn in period after this burn in period the sampled values form the distribution of 14ccorr that should be considered in dating or modelling studies additionally the resulting distributions of the δ13c end member mixing parameters δ13cg and δ13cs sampled by the mcmc represent the joint distribution of the values that were considered when determining 14ccorr activities at the sites these distributions were obtained from 200 000 samples 3 4 constraining correction parameters using argon 39 a key component of our approach is to assess the accuracy of single sample correction models using a second tracer the use of a piston flow model is only appropriate when the mixing of multiple ages is negligible mccallum et al 2015 however the maximum variation of two environmental tracers can be defined using mixing envelopes cook et al 2017 the mixing envelope defines the ranges of concentrations that can be obtained from the combination of any points obtained from a piston flow line this effectively represents all plausible concentration relationships for the two tracers from physical mixing and ageing processes hence all samples corrected for geochemical processes must fall within these ranges it should be noted that measured samples that lie within the mixing envelope may also contain some modification from carbonate dissolution and carbon exchange and a correction may still be required fig 3 shows the data from the port willunga formation aquifer and hamersley basin sites at sites where both 39ar and 14c are sampled the corrected 14c activities should fall within the mixing envelope for an appropriate range of δ13c end members to be valid in the single sample correction model all of the resulting corrections from the sites must fall within the mixing envelope argon 39 has a half life of 269 years and is appropriate for dating groundwater between 100 and 1000 years filling the gap between young tracers like 3h cfcs and 85kr and 14c the advantages of using 39ar are that it is not affected by geochemical reactions has a well known and constant input value and is sensitive over some of the range of values where changes in 14c may be attributable to carbonate exchange due to it s low abundance in natural water 39ar needs to be obtained from a large volume of water if measured by proportional counting lu et al 2014 the 1 3 tons of water that needs to be degassed in the field means that it is often not practical to collect a large number of 39ar samples however here we investigate the use of a limited number of groundwater samples analysed for 39ar concentrations to constrain 14ccorr activities of groundwater in large scale aquifers the data collected from sites with 39ar samples can also be included in the procedure by including a mixing envelope constraint this includes penalising values of 39ar 100 pma which arises where measured values are close to 100 pma and the analytical uncertainty theoretically allows values above 100 pma this is implemented as 10 in l 0 inside 9999 outside hence the constraint of the second tracer 39ar is included in the likelihood assessment our results present the correction procedure for scenarios where 39ar is included and excluded from the analysis for comparison 3 5 ranges for correction parameters the ranges of the correction parameters for the δ13c mass balance are presented in table 1 typically the soil gas end members are determined by the plant speciation the fractionation between gas and water is different for c3 and c4 type plants however over the time frames important to 14c dating the plant speciation may change in the recharge area hence we have adopted a range encompassing both c3 and c4 plants the one limit of the end member is that it cannot be greater than the value of the corrected groundwater sample this was enforced in our study the other parameters important to the method are temperature and ph temperature is an important parameter of the correction scheme as it controls the fractionation rates of δ13c and equilibrium constants in this study we have assumed an error of the temperature measurements of 1 c the error was assumed to be normally distributed and samples were generated using the measured concentration as the mean the ph also has an impact on the correction scheme as it controls the speciation of carbonate minerals for a given set of equilibrium constants we assumed an error of the ph measurements of 0 5 ph units and the sampling was implemented in the same way as temperature finally the measured 14c δ13c and 39ar concentrations in the groundwater samples play an important role in the calculations of 14ccorr activities the measurement errors are presented in tables 2 and 3 these errors were also implemented in the sampling scheme of the markov chain monte carlo method 4 results the measured 14c activities for most of the groundwater samples in the port willunga formation aquifer fall within the mixing envelope with 39ar fig 3 this suggests that the mixing of old and young groundwater is a plausible scenario in that the concentrations of both the 39ar and the 14c are explainable by physical mixing processes alone as the envelope represents all cases of two component mixing conversely the data from hamersley basin falls outside the envelope of the plausible ranges explained by only physical processes except for two samples hence some level of correction is required for the data the 14ccorr activities for four example wells are presented in fig 4 the example represents two sites where both 39ar and 14c were measured fig 4a and b and two sites where only 14c was measured fig 4c and d we have also included sites from both the port willunga aquifer fig 4a and c and the hamersley site fig 4b and d for the sites from the port willunga aquifer the ranges of corrected values are narrower than those for the hamersley site when excluding 39ar from the analysis this is because the closed system model is less sensitive to variation in ph t and δ13c end members when 39ar is included in the correction only a minor change is observed for the sites located in the port willunga aquifer fig 4a and c conversely the range of the corrected values is significantly reduced for the samples collected from the hamersley site fig 4b and d this is the case for the site with fig 4a and without fig 4b additional 39ar data hence the 39ar data collected at selected sites is able to improve estimates of14ccorr activities at all sites as the end member values of the correction models are shared between all sites histograms from other sites are available in the supplementary material sections 1 through 4 in comparing the changes in the 14ccorr activities that include the mixing envelope constraint we can examine both the change in the median value and the range of values defined by the standard deviation for the closed system port willunga aquifer negligible changes were observed in both the median and the range of values the average change in the median 4ccorr value was an 0 08 pmc reduction and the average change in the standard deviation was an 0 05 pmc reduction for the open system hamersley site the changes were significant an average increase of 6 pmc for the median value and a 3 pmc reduction in the standard deviation the mixing plot of 39ar and 14c after the correction procedures are presented in fig 5 for the port willunga formation aquifer the closed system correction moves the samples to the right of the atmospheric mixing line consistent with the observations of relative ranges and values of 14ccorr activity there is little difference between the points obtained from the scenarios despite the inclusion of the mixing envelope constraints the region to the right of the mixing line represents mixtures between post 1950s bomb peak recharge and pre 1950 s recharge this was also validated by the presence of some detectable 85kr at the site these values ranged from 0 6 to 2 0 dpm cm3 compared to a modern recharge value of 70 dpm cm3 suggesting a measurable component of young water for the samples collected from the hamersley site some of the samples corrected without the mixing envelope constraint still fall outside the envelope additionally the changes between the scenarios are more significant than at the port willunga aquifer site the error of the corrections for the hamersley basin and port willunga aquifer groundwater is much greater than for the analytical measurement error comparison of figs 3 and 5 however the revised errors from the correction model include the errors attributable to both the measurement errors and the other parameters and constraints interestingly the correction also modifies 39ar ranges because the mcmc procedure will also favour 39ar values that honour the mixing envelope fig 6 presents an example of a measured and posterior distribution of 39ar concentrations the mixing envelope constraint at the hamersley basin site removed groundwater samples with 39ar values 100 pma resulting in reduction of the range of plausible 39ar values the corrected 39ar ranges for all sites are located in the supplementary material sections 5 and 6 the posterior distributions of the δ13c end members for both sites are presented in table 4 for the four scenarios the posterior ranges of the soil gas end members were significantly reduced from the prior ranges table 1 for the port willunga formation aquifer the end members were predicted to have similar ranges both with and without the inclusion of 39ar data the ranges for the soil gas end member are more representative of c3 vegetation this is consistent with the eucalyptus vegetation type that historically covered the willunga embayment conversely the soil gas end member at the hamersley basin site is more representative of c4 vegetation it is also of note that the inclusion of the 39ar data both reduces the median value and narrows the range this is consistent with the reduction in the range of corrected 14c activities rouillard et al 2016 found that the alternating δ13c of sediment organic matter indicated variations between c3 and c4 type plants over the past 2000 years at the hamersley site the sediment records indicate that the c4 type vegetation is most representative of a period approximately 500 1400 years ago however this is not consistent with the ages of corrected 39ar suggesting some mixing of older water fig 7 presents the corrected and measured 14c activities for all sites the correction for the port willunga formation aquifer results in a significant number of sites reporting post 1950 s water this suggests that age interpretations made on samples with lower 14c activities are less sensitive to carbon exchange processes for the hamersley basin site the correction results in a large range of 14ccorr activities measured ranges were relatively narrow for 14c activities 20 50 pmc however the corrected activities indicate a greater range of concentrations suggesting a greater variation in the apparent groundwater ages at the site 5 discussion the stochastic method we used in this study allows the determination of uncertainties of not only measured 14c activities but also all of the parameters important for correction to be considered in arriving at a final range of 14ccorr activities additionally we extended the method to use sparsely collected 39ar data to inform the parameters of single sample 14c correction models we have shown that the range of plausible values of 14ccorr activities is much higher than analytical data alone the results of our analysis suggest that the errors associated with 14ccorr activity of groundwater samples 10 pmc is two orders of magnitude higher compared to analytical error 0 1 pmc when including 39ar data we found that the largest reduction in uncertainty was observed at the hamersley site the reduction was not only observed in groundwater samples analysed for 39ar concentrations but also at sites where only 14c was collected this reduction in uncertainty was attributable to the narrowed ranges of the soil gas end member that were modified by penalising values that resulted in 14ccorr and 39ar combinations falling outside the mixing envelope this is significant in that the collection of a relatively small number of groundwater samples with 39ar concentrations can improve the accuracy of 14ccorr values across the entire site this work builds on previous studies that apply bayesian techniques to environmental tracer studies massoudieh et al 2012 petersen et al 2014 massoudieh et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 one of the outcomes of the method presented here is that the data for 39ar concentrations and 14ccorr activity are no longer independent observations but form a joint probability distribution and therefore further interpretation can no longer consider these observations independently this is because the use of the mixing envelope constraint correlates the two corrected concentrations i e each sample of 14ccorr corresponds to a specific sample 39ar value it is also notable that the error ranges and mean values of the 39ar were modified by the modelling parameter estimation procedures by invoking the mixing envelope constraint the viable ranges of the 39ar data became lower than the measurement errors for 39ar note the measurement error is relatively high for the 39ar relative to 14c this is evidenced by comparing the vertical error bars in figs 4 and 5 and is directly presented in fig 6 although we have used 39ar to form the mixing envelope here it would be possible to use multiple other tracers e g tritium cfcs and helium 4 the advantage of using 39ar is that it has a more sensitive age range than young tracers like tritium and cfcs which results in a more constrained mixing envelope argon 39 also covers the range of ages where the decay of 14c is not significant as young tracers are only present in water recharged after 1950 the mixture between pre 1950 waters and post 1950 waters form a fairly unconstrained range also if other processes affect tracer concentrations after the recharge event then these would also need to be considered in the correction schemes for example degradation of cfcs or production of helium 4 4he would modify the shape of the mixing envelope but could be jointly estimated in the procedure the estimation of additional processes has previously been included in the studies of massoudieh et al 2012 massoudieh et al 2014 alikhani et al 2016 estimating these parameters would likely increase the degrees of freedom and hence the overall ranges of the non mixed values previous studies used validation of 14c ages with recharge temperatures using noble gases edmunds and smedley 2000 and radiogenic 4he measurements aeschbach hertig et al 2002 our modelling framework builds on these studies by formalising a multi tracer validation approach using a mixing envelope constraint and in an mcmc framework in this study we have used a single sample model however other methods exist to determine 14ccorr geochemical mass balance techniques may have been applicable at the port willunga formation site because the monitoring wells were completed with shorter production screen lengths which allow for the sampling of individual flow paths however at the hamersley basin site the convergent flow field induced by sampling from wells with long production screen lengths would make it difficult to obtain multiple samples from a single flow path further improvements may be made for calculated age at this site by making soil gas measurements e g wood et al 2015 as modifications to the carbon occurring in the vadose zone seem to be attributable to open system models the implications of the 14ccorr activity is also important for our understanding of the conceptual hydrogeology of the site in the port willunga aquifer the 14ccorr ranges suggest a substantial amount of modern recharge this is consistent with the slow water table decline observed at the site despite the high volume of extraction for irrigation purposes it is also consistent with the understanding of significant ephemeral recharge at the site batlle aguilar and cook 2012 batlle aguilar et al 2015 the corrected mixtures also indicate the mixing of modern 14ccorr 100 pmc and water up to 460 years old 39ar 30 pma this suggests some amount of mixing even for short screens which may be attributable to heterogeneity of the aquifer engdahl et al 2012 mccallum et al 2014 for the hamersley site the values of 14ccorr correspond to the understanding of the transient nature of flooding and recharge dogramaci et al 2012 rouillard et al 2016 mccallum et al 2017 this is also consistent with the observation of measurable concentrations of young tracers post 1950 at the site cook et al 2017 6 conclusions this investigation highlighted the need to account for all sources of error when performing corrections with single sample models to determine 14ccorr activities for groundwater dating our work has provided two main outcomes firstly when we consider the errors of all components of 14ccorr the error is 100 times greater than the analytical error this is important when including 14ccorr activities in hydrogeological studies especially when additional data is being compared these errors can be significant when assessing aspects of a system given the timeframes associated with 14c decay secondly we found that the use of a second tracer 39ar provided improved estimates of 14ccorr activities at the hamersley basin aquifer where open system carbonate dissolution was occurring the improvements observed in the port willunga aquifer where a closed system condition prevails were not substantial this is related to the relative sensitivity of the open and closed system models to parameters including ph temperature and δ13c end members future work should include the uncertainties of single site correction models with more constrained forms of groundwater age distributions as the second

a newly developed residual error model accompanied with the bayesian uncertainty analysis are performed cmorph satellite gauge merged precipitation product recently developed by the china meteorological administration cma cmorph cma is a high quality regional precipitation product thus this study applies the cmorph cma within the same framework to provide a benchmark the results show that the parameter uncertainty are influenced significantly by the input of various precipitation products there is a tradeoff between the deterministic streamflow performance and the probabilistic predictive performance for selecting the best input among the three global precipitation products the streamflow uncertainty intervals of the three global precipitation products are then merged using the bayesian model averaging bma method the bma results show satisfying hydrological performance in terms of deterministic streamflow predictions with the largest nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce values of 0 86 and 0 64 and the smallest absolute relative error re values of 0 and 10 2 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in addition the bma results also produce

water cycle precipitation often shows notable variability in both space and time kidd and huffman 2011 thus significantly affecting the land surface hydrological process and playing a key role in water resource management therefore obtaining accurate precipitation data is of great importance for hydrological simulation mcmillan et al 2011 yu et al 2011 satellite based precipitation estimates have become important resources and have been used worldwide for different hydrological applications vergara et al 2014 sun et al 2016 because many products have the advantage to provide global

potentials and values in hydrological simulation and water resources management behrangi et al 2011 bitew and gebremichael 2011 li et al 2012 2015 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2017 zubieta et al 2015 these studies also pointed out that different satellite precipitation products have variable accuracy and distinct hydrological performance in different basins because of various uncertainties in the data sources retrieval algorithms and bias correction processes of satellite precipitation products dinku et al 2010 kidd et al 2003 tian et al 2010 the quality of these products would affect hydrological simulations through the rainfall runoff processes in hydrologic models nikolopoulos et al 2013 vergara et al 2014 zubieta et al 2015 in another word the uncertainty in satellite based precipitation data together with parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty of hydrologic models will result in uncertainty in streamflow predictions although lots of studies have applied different satellite precipitation products to streamflow or flood modeling most of them focused on evaluating the performance of deterministic simulations without uncertainty estimation there are also some proposed methods to account for the satellite precipitation uncertainties in hydrological simulations hong et al 2006 assessed the influence of satellite based precipitation estimation error on the uncertainty of hydrological response using monte carlo simulation by constructing an error function associated with the precipitation estimates the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain and anagnostou 2006 was used to generate ensembles of satellite rain fields for investigating the error propagation from satellite rainfall to streamflow falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2013 however these studies did not consider the parameter and model structure uncertainty when obtaining the streamflow ensemble which could probably lead to unrealistic uncertainty bounds ajami et al 2007 in addition these studies generated ensemble streamflow simulations based on a single satellite precipitation product thus the corresponding performance could be highly affected by the error characteristics of the selected satellite precipitation product in the region there is limited research on the impacts of different satellite precipitation products on model parameter uncertainty and hydrologic predictive uncertainty estimation which are essential parts of hydrologic study kavetski 2018 stedinger et al 2008 for uncertainty analysis of streamflow prediction the errors should be described adequately with respect to their characteristics kuczera et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 sikorska and seibert 2016 a common method is to use residual error models to treat total uncertainty in a lumped manner bates and campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 2014 schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 sun et al 2017 the residual errors typically consist of a combination of input model structural and parameter errors schoups and vrugt 2010 within the bayesian framework parameter posterior distributions are obtained based on a likelihood function derived from the residual error model box and tiao 1992 accordingly posterior predictive distribution of streamflow can be created by adding residual errors to model outputs sikorska and seibert 2016 performed a bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved characterization of model residual errors to quantify the effects of station based and radar based precipitation on model calibration and flood predictions to date similar studies have rarely been applied to satellite based precipitation ensemble modeling techniques based on different models or datasets have the potential advantage to improve uncertainty estimation in meteorological and hydrological modeling duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 ma et al 2018a b bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most widely used ensemble approaches which derives the consensus prediction from multiple competing predictions hoeting et al 1999 and generates a better merged forecast by exploiting the strengths of the individual predictions the bma method assigns weight to each member based on its corresponding predictive performance within the observations in hydrological field bma has been successfully applied to provide improved and more reliable streamflow predictions with corresponding uncertainty measures most of the studies used the bma method to combine streamflow simulations from different hydrologic models for better accounting for model structure uncertainty ajami et al 2007 duan et al 2007 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 liang et al 2013 roy et al 2017 through the use of multiple different hydrologic models the model error is implied in the variability of different model predictions this method of using bma assumes there is enough variability in model structures to account for the uncertainties in the general model framework dechant and moradkhani 2014 similarly the framework has been transferred to account for precipitation input uncertainty of hydrologic models strauch et al 2012 used the bma method to account for precipitation uncertainty by merging streamflow simulations forced by different types of gauge based precipitation datasets however studies focusing on satellite precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulations are relatively few jiang et al 2012 2014 a lot of studies have demonstrated that sgmp products which use gauge observations to correct the errors of original satellite rainfall estimates yield improved streamflow performance maggioni and massari 2018 mei et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the first objective of this study is therefore to investigate the hydrologic value of three mainstream global sgmp products e g tmpa gsmap gauge and cmorph bld for hydrological simulations over the huaihe river basin of china with the involvement of the bayesian uncertainty analysis sun et al 2017 proposed a novel residual error model to address the strong and complex heteroscedasticity of residual errors showed in the huaihe river basin by means of this newly developed residual error model the parameter and model structural uncertainty could also be properly considered in addition to the precipitation uncertainty through the bayesian uncertainty analysis the impact of different sgmp products on parameter uncertainty and streamflow predictive uncertainty estimation is explored the second objective is to improve the streamflow prediction skills and provide more reliable uncertainty estimations by merging the individual model outputs of the three sgmp products using the bma method sun et al 2016 found out that the regional sgmp product cmorph cma produced the best streamflow simulations and could serve as the high quality precipitation input data in china to evaluate the performance of the streamflow predictions forced by the three global sgmp products and the bma merged streamflow prediction the high quality cmorph cma forced streamflow prediction based on the same error model sun et al 2017 is used as benchmark the comparison could provide quantitative evaluation of the usage of multiple global satellite precipitation products within the bma framework thus indicating its application prospect in poorly gauged basins the rest part of the paper is organized as follows section

located in eastern china between the yangtze and yellow river basins is the most densely inhabited river basin and the sixth largest river basin in china the basin situates within the china s climate transition zone of subtropical moist and semi moist monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 900 mm of which 50 75 falls during the summer monsoon season the study area fig 1 covers the upper region of bengbu hydrologic station over the huaihe river basin same as the one in sun et al 2016 2017 2 2 data this study aims to evaluate the effect of three global sgmp products on streamflow prediction uncertainty over the huaihe river basin including tmpa 3b42v7 tmpa cmorph satellite gauge merged product cmorph bld developed at noaa cpc gsmap gauge calibrated rainfall product

cmorph bld the authors have made very detailed introductions in sun et al 2016 interested readers can refer to the paper for more information according to sun et al 2016 the recent cmorph sgmp product developed by cma cmorph cma showed even higher accuracy in rainfall monitoring and streamflow simulations than high density ground rain gauge data therefore cmorph cma can serve as an alternative high quality precipitation product in china the streamflow prediction interval forced by cmorph cma was adopted as a reference in this study the four sgmp products were aggregated into the uniform 0 25 0 25 spatial grid and daily 00 utc 00 utc resolution during the study period of 2002 2012 the annual basin average precipitation of the four satellite gauge products is shown in table 1 which is characterized by consistent performance and slight interannual variability for the four products the daily discharge observations of the bengbu hydrologic station were collected from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the collected discharge dataset contained the period of 2003 2007 for calibration the spinup period of 2002 and the remaining dataset 2008 2012 for validation 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model in this study the physically based distributed vic hydrologic model was selected to simulate the rainfall runoff processes the vic model is based on a soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme that considers both energy and water balances liang et al 1994 1996 the 3 layer model also takes into account the spatial variation of vegetation cover topography precipitation soil properties and soil moisture many of the vic parameters are assigned according to the vegetation type and soil texture although most parameters can be directly estimated from the land surface database in this study a total of six hydrologic parameters were optimized through calibration including the exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b the maximum baseflow that can occur from the lowest soil layer dsmax the fraction of maximum base flow ds the fraction of maximum soil moisture content of the third layer ws the second and the third soil layer thicknesses d2 and d3 3 2 bayesian uncertainty analysis consider that a hydrologic model simulates streamflow q with the forcing data x e g precipitation temperature and a set of model parameters θ h a residual error model is used to describe the additive errors e defined at time step t as 1 e t q t q t x 1 t θ h where q t is the observed streamflow and q t x 1 t θ h is the simulated streamflow with hydrologic model parameters θ h and forcing data over time steps 1 to t x 1 t according to the bayesian inference the posterior distribution of parameters is 2 p θ h θ e x q p q θ h θ e x p θ h θ e where θ e denotes the residual error model parameters p q θ h θ e x is the likelihood function and p θ h θ e is the prior distribution of hydrologic and residual error model parameters the likelihood function can be represented in the form of the joint probability density function pdf of the residual errors 3 p q θ h θ e x p e θ h x q θ e where e θ h x q is the vector of residual errors obtained over the calibration period the successful application of bayesian inferential approaches is typically based on the formal likelihood function properly characterizing the form of the residual errors mantovan and todini 2006 residual errors often show characteristics of autocorrelation nonnormality and heteroscedasticity and a number of strategies have been proposed to handle these features recently sun et al 2017 proposed a combined approach ca combining the advantages of the linear modeling and box cox transformation to deal with the strong and complex heteroscedasticity showed in the huaihe river basin together with the first order autoregressive model and the skew exponential power sep distribution the residual error model ca sep was generated the expression of the ca sep is shown below 4 η t e t σ t η t φ 1 η t 1 a t with a t s e p 0 1 ξ β σ t σ 0 σ 1 q t where e t denotes the residual errors after the box cox transformation σ t is a normalization term φ 1 is the first order autoregressive coefficient and a t is the innovation described by the sep distribution with parameters ξ and β accounting for nonnormality σ t is conditioned on the simulated streamflow after box cox transformation q t with parameters σ 0 and σ 1 the box cox transformation is shown below 5 f y y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 λ 1 0 y λ 2 ln y λ 2 λ 1 0 y λ 2 where y is observed or simulated streamflow λ 1 and λ 2 are the box cox parameters we fixed the value of λ 2 to 1 to make the original zero flows still zero after the transformation the corresponding likelihood function derived from the residual error model can be expressed using the generalized likelihood gl function schoups and vrugt 2010 the expression for the log likelihood function is 6 log l q θ h θ e n log ω β 2 σ ξ ξ ξ 1 t 1 n log σ t c β t 1 n a ξ t 2 1 β λ 1 1 t 1 n log q t 1 where n is the number of observations a ξ t ξ s i g n μ ξ σ ξ a t and values for μ ξ σ β ω β and c β are all functions of the skewness parameter ξ and the kurtosis parameter β see schoups and vrugt 2010 for details in sun et al 2017 the residual error model ca sep was developed using the high quality precipitation product cmorph cma as the input and the obtained streamflow prediction interval was reliable to investigate the effects of imprecise precipitation input on streamflow predictions we performed a comparative bayesian uncertainty analysis for the three global sgmp products in which the parameters of the hydrologic model vic and residual error model ca sep were calibrated jointly with each of the three precipitation products as model input this led to three different parameter posterior distributions 7 p θ h θ e x i q p q θ h θ e x i p θ h θ e where x i is the forcing data containing the i th sgmp product p θ h θ e x i q is the i th parameter posterior distribution the i th posterior distribution of the hydrologic model parameters θ h was then used to simulate the streamflow with the i th precipitation product producing the i th streamflow uncertainty interval moreover by adding residual errors to the i th streamflow uncertainty interval based on the i th posterior distribution of the residual error model parameters θ e the i th streamflow prediction interval was obtained for better comparison the parameter posterior distributions and the streamflow prediction interval calibrated with cmorph cma were used as benchmark 3 3 calibration method a state of the art markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm called dream zs was used in this study to perform the bayesian calibration and uncertainty estimation dream zs is based on the original dream differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2008a 2009 which runs multiple markov chains simultaneously in this study five parallel chains were used and each chain contained 14 000 iterations the last 1000 samples after each chain s convergence altogether 5000 samples were retained to estimate parameter posterior distribution and predictive performance both visual observations and r statistic calculations gelman and rubin 1992 were adopted to check the chains convergence 3 4 bayesian model averaging bma bayesian model averaging is a probabilistic scheme for model combination a brief description of the essence of bma is shown below consider a quantity y as the forecasted variable here streamflow d as the observations of the forecasted variable and the f f 1 f 2 f k as the k sets of considered predictions according to the law of total probability the posterior distribution of the bma prediction can be represented as 8 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d where p f k d is the posterior probability of prediction f k also known as the likelihood of prediction f k being the correct prediction given the observation data d if we denote w k p f k d w k can be considered as weight and k 1 k w k 1 p k y f k d is the posterior distribution of y given prediction f k and observations d and is usually approximated by a normal distribution with mean a k b k f k and variance σ 2 where a k and b k are regression coefficients obtained through simple linear regression of y on f k using the training data the estimation of a k and b k can be viewed as a simple bias correction process raftery et al 2005 the bma weights w k and variance σ 2 were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of occurrence of the observed data y it is easier to maximize the logarithm of likelihood function which is defined as follows 9 l w 1 w 2 w k σ 2 t 1 t log k 1 k w k p y t f kt in this study we assumed a heteroscedastic variance of the conditional forecast distribution as σ kt 2 c f kt the multiplier c applied to all predictions of the ensemble the value of c along with the bma weights were estimated by maximizing eq 9 using markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation with dream vrugt et al 2008b the bma predictive mean is then given by 10 e y f 1 f 2 f k d k 1 k w k a k b k f k finally the bma probabilistic ensemble predictions were generated following raftery et al 2005 the procedure involves i selecting the ensemble size m ii generating a value of k from the numbers 1 2 k with the probabilities w 1 w 2 w k iii drawing a replication of y from the conditional forecast distribution p y f k and iiii repeating steps ii and iii m times to obtain m values of y for each time step in this study the generated bma probabilistic prediction consisted of 5000 ensemble streamflow simulations which had the same sample size as the single precipitation product forced streamflow prediction interval inspired by the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 framework this study merged the three streamflow uncertainty intervals using bma to fully consider the input parameter estimation and model structural uncertainty the detailed procedure is described as follows 1 obtain posterior distribution of hydrologic model and residual error model parameters forced by each global sgmp product using dream zs 2

different precipitation products on calibration procedure the final parameter ranges calibrated with the four sgmp products are shown in fig 2 it is obvious that using different precipitation products to calibrate the vic model results in different parameter values it is shown that gsmap gauge and cmorph bld yield the largest parameter uncertainty for example the interquartile ranges of the final parameter distributions exceed 25 and 15 of the initial parameter range for dsmax and d3 respectively in contrast the final parameter distributions for tmpa and cmorph cma except for the parameter ds are much narrower sun et al 2016 has reported that cmorph cma is the most accurate among the four precipitation products and sometimes even performs better than the high quality ground gauge rainfall product correspondingly less parameter uncertainty is associated with less error in precipitation for cmorph cma the reason that cmorph cma produces large uncertainty for ds may be partly explained by the residual error model used in this study because the parameter ds is insensitive and has much less impact on the streamflow simulation than the other five parameters in the vic model it is the most likely to be affected by the interaction with residual error model parameters which was also observed in sun et al 2017 as for gsmap gauge and cmorph bld the errors in precipitation are propagated into simulated streamflow and amplified through the interaction with the hydrologic processes when these two are used to calibrate the vic model the parameter uncertainty increases interestingly final parameter ranges calibrated with tmpa are narrow the additive form of the model residual errors represent the model structural uncertainty the model parameter uncertainty and the input uncertainty because of the interaction of different sources of uncertainty during the calibration process the informativeness of different precipitation datasets for parameter estimation is varied therefore it s inferred that tmpa contains more information to inform model parameters with the residual error model used in this study it is noted that the final parameter ranges vary significantly among input precipitation products except the parameter b both gsmap gauge and cmorph bld produce higher estimations of parameter dsmax with median values of 23 and 25 compared to the other two precipitation products with median values of 5 and 3 7 large dsmax tends to cause a high baseflow produced by the bottom soil layer thus having an impact on the simulated streamflow in addition gsmap gauge and cmorph bld provide lower estimation of d2 and higher estimation of d3 than the other two the thicker bottom soil layer may lead to larger soil moisture capacity and hence increase baseflow which has consistent effect with the large estimation of dsmax at the same time thinner second soil layer results in smaller soil moisture capacity in the upper layer and thus reduces the infiltration when rainfall falls on the surface the different calibrated parameter values will directly affect the streamflow predictions as shown in fig 3 in general the 90 uncertainty interval of cmorph bld overestimates the baseflow and produces higher peak flows than others because cmorph bld has higher estimation of dsmax and d3 as well as lower estimation of d2 based on the definition of the residual error model eq 4 the higher flow corresponds to higher residual error in addition the estimated residual error model parameters of cmorph bld also have the largest uncertainty therefore the prediction band of cmorph bld is the widest after adding the additive residual errors similarly the prediction band of gsmap gauge is also wider than those of tmpa and cmorph cma especially at high flows the prediction interval of tmpa displays similar magnitudes to that of cmorph cma while the latter one is narrower sun et al 2017 has demonstrated that the newly developed residual error model ca sep is capable of addressing the complicated heteroscedasticity over the huaihe river basin when cmorph cma was used as the input ca sep produced accurate predictions with high reliability and effectively avoided the negative flows it is worth mentioning that the prediction intervals calibrated with the three global sgmp products could effectively avoid the negative flows which further confirms the stability of ca sep over this basin as summarized in table 2 the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma has the highest nsce values of 0 802 and 0 51 in the calibration and validation periods respectively although the calibrated parameters have relatively large uncertainty for cmorph bld its maximum likelihood simulated streamflow has the second highest nsce and the best re in the calibration period because cmorph bld overestimates the baseflow and its underestimation of peak flows is less severe than tmpa and cmorph cma the overall average biases are smaller gsmap gauge forced simulation has larger nsce than that of tmpa in the calibration period but their difference decreases in the validation period 4 2 deterministic predictive performance the daily mean streamflow of the posterior streamflow distribution forced by the different precipitation products and the bma predictive mean are shown in fig 4 the mean flows for the four precipitation input have the same trend as their 90 streamflow uncertainty intervals shown in fig 3 the detailed evaluation scores for the mean flows are shown in table 3 cmorph bld has the highest nsce and best re among the three global sgmp products in the calibration period because bma weights reflect the ensemble members deterministic predictive performance over the training period duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 cmorph bld receives the largest weight fig 5 tmpa however receives the second largest weight despite having lower nsce than gsmap gauge the parameter posterior distributions of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld are very similar their corresponding streamflow uncertainty intervals also have similar shape since gsmap gauge performs worse than cmorph bld it could contribute little additional information for bma predictions and receives the lowest weight similarly the two members selected from each streamflow uncertainty interval at the 5 and 50 quantiles receive significantly lower weights than the member selected at the 95 quantile table 4 in terms of nsce and re the bma predictive mean performs better than any individual deterministic prediction during both calibration and validation periods table 3 the nsce values of the bma predictive mean are even higher than those of the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma table 2 it can also be seen that the bma predictive mean has the consistent trend with the observed flow and can reproduce both the peak flow and low flow very well fig 4 the high agreement between the bma predictive mean and the observed flow is also reflected by the best re which is even zero in the calibration period 4 3 predictive uncertainty fig 6 displays the 90 bma probabilistic prediction intervals in the calibration and validation periods compared to the most reliable prediction band using cmorph cma as input the bma prediction band is narrower under low flow conditions but a little bit wider at peak flows in the calibration period in the validation period it seems that the bma prediction band becomes narrower at high flows and some flood peaks are not covered to further evaluate the predictive performance a set of probabilistic verification metrics are then applied fig 7 shows the pit histograms for the different prediction intervals it can be seen that the pit histograms for the same probabilistic prediction in the calibration and validation periods show similar shape the shape of pit histograms for tmpa indicates their overestimation of the prediction uncertainty for gsmap gauge and cmorph bld more observations fall into the low probability bins than are expected by the forecasted distributions indicating a positive bias for its prediction interval which is consistent with the former result that gsmap gauge and cmorph bld tends to overestimate the streamflow cmorph cma forced prediction interval also shows a little over dispersive in the calibration period but gets better in the validation period the prediction interval for bma shows the most reliable performance with the flattest pit histogram in the calibration period in the validation period the more obvious u shaped histogram for bma is an indication of under dispersion as expected the quantile quantile qq plots fig 8 for bma are close to the diagonal line indicating its prediction intervals are reliable despite a slight underestimation of the prediction uncertainty the performance of bma is further improved in the validation period the s shaped curvature of the qq plots for tmpa and gsmap gauge suggests a consistent overestimation of the prediction uncertainty while the s shaped feature for tmpa remains unchanged the qq plot for gsmap gauge shows a positive bias of prediction in the validation period the qq plots for cmorph cma also feature systematic under prediction but less pronounced in the validation period as for cmorph bld its qq plots indicate evident systematic over prediction which is more pronounced in the validation period it is noticed that the poor performance of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld becomes worse in the validation period when the streamflow record is relatively dominated by low flows interspersed with high flow events therefore the weakness of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld for producing overlarge predictions is again highlighted to quantitatively analyze the departure of the qq plot from the diagonal table 5 reports the corresponding statistical metric π reliab although the deterministic prediction of tmpa is inferior to the other two global sgmp products the probabilistic prediction of tmpa is much better with the smallest π reliab of 0 095 and 0 084 in the calibration and validation periods respectively bma also shows high reliability of predictive distributions with small values of π reliab which is slightly lower than those of cmorph cma to further compare the skills of probabilistic predictions fig 9 shows the bss at different streamflow thresholds in both calibration and validation periods in the calibration period cmorph cma has the highest scores at low thresholds of 20 and 40 the bsss of tmpa and gsmap gauge also outperform that of bma at the low threshold of 20 bma shows superior predicative skills over cmorph cma at high thresholds of 60 and 80 the bsss of the four precipitation products have an obvious deterioration in the validation period especially at 20 threshold the result of bma however shows consistently high skills cmorph cma outperforms bma at 40 threshold though bma is evidently superior to the results of the four precipitation products at other thresholds in addition the bsss of cmorph bld in both periods reinforce its lower predictive skills than others additionally crpss shown in table 5 can also reflect the reliability of the probabilistic prediction bma has the highest crpsss in both calibration and validation periods further indicating that combining individual predictions simulated from the global sgmp products through bma is an efficient way to produce reliable probabilistic predictions in addition to the above evaluations focusing on the reliability of the probabilistic predictions table 5 further shows the coverage rate cr and the d factor for evaluating the sharpness of the probabilistic predictions perfect predictive uncertainty would expect the cr close to the assumed 90 prediction level and the d factor close to 1 it is clear that bma probabilistic predictions leads to accurate cr values with only slight overestimation in the calibration period 1 and underestimation in the validation period 4 5 the d factors of bma are also the closest to 1 in both calibration and validation periods indicating the intervals would correspond to the standard deviation of the observations with good sharpness all the three global sgmp products especially cmorph bld produce pretty wide prediction bands with crs larger than 97 and d factors larger than 2 the d factor of cmorph cma is 1 37 in the calibration period indicating modest overestimation of the observed variance in streamflow in the validation period the predictive bounds of the four precipitation products become wider with increased d factors by contrast the d factor of bma further decreases during the validation period indicating much more stable performance generally speaking the prediction band of bma performs the best in both reliability and sharpness it is noted that the bma predictions even outperform the predictions forced by a high quality precipitation input therefore using bma for ensemble modeling with multiple global sgmp input can considerably increase both accuracy and reliability in streamflow simulation results which provides a promising approach to support hydrological modeling and water management in regions with sparse precipitation data 5 discussion this study adopted the bayesian framework to assess three global sgmp products this is a general framework for evaluating the value of the precipitation data with consideration of the parameter uncertainty and model structural uncertainty it could easily be applied using different hydrologic models different residual error models and other precipitation products through the calibration cmoprh bld obtained higher estimation of parameter dsmax and d3 but lower estimation of d2 thus producing higher baseflow and surface runoff than gsmap gauge and tmpa therefore the peak flows of cmorph bld were closer to the observations than the other two which helped cmorph bld to acquire higher nsce this is because nsce places more emphasis on high flows due to the squaring of the errors between the simulated and observed data krause et al 2005 however higher flows along with higher parameter uncertainty of cmorph bld also resulted in large predictive uncertainty and unreliable predictive performance due to the tradeoff between the deterministic performance and the probabilistic performance sometimes using a single satellite precipitation product may not be enough in hydrological application therefore multiple precipitation ensembles are suggested for distributed hydrologic models such as vic by taking advantage of varied performance on model calibration and streamflow predictions using different precipitation input this study used the bma method to account for precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulations over the huaihe river basin of china currently there are many kinds of mainstream global satellite precipitation products with high spatiotemporal resolutions the selection of bma input could affect the bma results since many studies have demonstrated that sgmp products have better performance than original satellite rainfall estimates in streamflow simulations maggioni and massari 2018 mei et al 2016 wang et al 2015 this study selected three mainstream global sgmp products involving the poorly performing members in the bma scheme could even worsen the bma predictive performance chen et al 2015 besides the bma method would assign low weights to the members with poor performance raftery et al 2005 and thus these member would have little impact on the bma results in this study we also did an experiment to include another popular sgmp product namely persiann cdr as bma input persiann cdr only uses the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly product to adjust the bias at 2 5 monthly scale the relatively rough bias adjustment process causes its worse performance than other precipitation products over the huaihe river basin consequently the large bias identified for persiann cdr was followed by unrealistic parameter estimation and large predictive uncertainty when using ca sep in the bayesian framework the bma results with persiann cdr showed slightly worse performance not shown and the weight of persiann cdr was smaller than 0 01 when applying the bma method some previous studies ajami et al 2007 strauch et al 2012 compared the bma prediction intervals with the uncertainty intervals associated with parameter uncertainty however such comparisons were not strict because the spread of the ensemble streamflow simulations highly depends on parameter uncertainties in our study all the sgmp products generated very narrow uncertainty intervals therefore the uncertainty intervals can be easily outperformed by bma prediction intervals to properly estimate the predictive uncertainty corresponding to each precipitation input an explicit model of the residual error say ca sep in this study is also recommended the classical bma approach assumes that the conditional pdf of each ensemble member is described with a normal distribution the assumption of normal distribution may be inappropriate for streamflow primarily driven by precipitation while the gamma distribution seems more reasonable however when we examined the normal and gamma distribution the assumption of normality obtained more improvements for streamflow predictions vrugt and robinson 2007 also found an improvement of bma method for streamflow forecasting under the assumption of normal distribution instead of the gamma distribution many studies also recommended using the box cox transformation for the nonnormal distribution prior to the bma process duan et al 2007 ma et al 2018a however the box cox transformation would not always guarantee the dataset after transformation is normally distributed since a lot of studies applying bma to hydrological predictions still directly adopted the normal distribution for computational simplicity ajami et al 2007 kim et al 2015 roy et al 2017 strauch et al 2012 yen et al 2014 and the focus of this study is not on improving the bma approach the normal distribution is acceptable in the future we will test the effect of using the box cox transformation and other conditional distributions on bma performance there is still room for improvement in the bma application for example stationary weights were assigned to the ensemble members in this study some studies have found that dynamically adaptive weights based on the nature of the forecasts and or catchment states may have advantages for improving predictive performance devineni et al 2008 ma et al 2018a b in addition some technical improvements have also been made on the bma method itself madadgar and moradkhani 2014 rings et al 2012 future works are needed to further improve the performance by fully exploring the advantage of the bma method 6 conclusions this study investigated the hydrologic value of three global sgmp products namely tmpa gsmap gauge cmorph bld for hydrologic model parameter calibration and streamflow predictions over the huaihe river basin in china a newly developed residual error model ca sep sun et al 2017 was used to represent total uncertainty in streamflow predictions and the bayesian uncertainty analysis was performed based on this residual error model in addition the individual streamflow simulations selected from each streamflow uncertainty interval were combined using bma the regional high quality sgmp product cmorph cma was also applied within the same framework to provide a benchmark for evaluation the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 using different precipitation products to calibrate the vic model resulted in different parameter posterior values the parameter posterior distributions calibrated with gsmap gauge and cmorph bld had larger uncertainty than those calibrated with tmpa the final estimated parameter values directly affected the streamflow simulation results the higher estimation of parameter dsmax and d3 but lower estimation of d2 obtained by cmorph bld produced higher baseflow and surface runoff than gsmap gauge and tmpa and further led to larger predictive uncertainty 2 among the three global sgmp products cmorph bld forced deterministic simulations performed the best with the highest nsce values of 0 685 and 0 436 accompanied with the smallest absolute re values of 12 and 4 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively however its corresponding probabilistic prediction bands were extremely wide with the worst reliability on the contrary tmpa forced deterministic simulations had the lowest nsce values of 0 623 and 0 397 in the calibration and validation periods respectively however its probabilistic predictions were much better than the other two products 3 the bma predictive mean not only performed better than any individual deterministic prediction of the three global precipitation products but also obtained higher nsces 0 859 and 0 639 for the calibration and validation periods respectively than those of the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma it also fitted fairly well with the observed streamflow and captured most peak flows in addition bma largely improved probabilistic streamflow predictions with the best reliability and sharpness compared to other prediction bands based on the various probabilistic verification methods overall the demonstrated advantages of using multiple global sgmp products ensemble should be transferable to other hydrologic models and other regions especially in ungauged basins bma can be used as an efficient tool to improve the performance of both the deterministic and probabilistic streamflow predictions hence better supporting water management and decision making acknowledgments the authors are very grateful to the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive

observation at time step t f t is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the probabilistic forecast at that time in this study we divide the interval 0 1 into 10 equally sized bins for perfectly reliable forecasts the pit histogram will be approximately flat if the pit histogram is not flat its shape can be used to diagnose problems with the predictive uncertainty for example dome shaped pit histogram indicates too large spread or uncertainty of the forecast note that a flat pit histogram does not necessarily indicate a reliable forecast hamill 2001 quantile quantile qq plot and π reliab

a newly developed residual error model accompanied with the bayesian uncertainty analysis are performed cmorph satellite gauge merged precipitation product recently developed by the china meteorological administration cma cmorph cma is a high quality regional precipitation product thus this study applies the cmorph cma within the same framework to provide a benchmark the results show that the parameter uncertainty are influenced significantly by the input of various precipitation products there is a tradeoff between the deterministic streamflow performance and the probabilistic predictive performance for selecting the best input among the three global precipitation products the streamflow uncertainty intervals of the three global precipitation products are then merged using the bayesian model averaging bma method the bma results show satisfying hydrological performance in terms of deterministic streamflow predictions with the largest nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce values of 0 86 and 0 64 and the smallest absolute relative error re values of 0 and 10 2 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in addition the bma results also produce much more reliable probabilistic predictions which even outperform the outcomes of the high quality cmorph cma our study demonstrates the potential uncertainty of various sgmp products for model

water cycle precipitation often shows notable variability in both space and time kidd and huffman 2011 thus significantly affecting the land surface hydrological process and playing a key role in water resource management therefore obtaining accurate precipitation data is of great importance for hydrological simulation mcmillan et al 2011 yu et al 2011 satellite based precipitation estimates have become important resources and have been used worldwide for different hydrological applications vergara et al 2014 sun et al 2016 because many products have the advantage to provide global coverage of precipitation observation kucera et al 2013 currently a lot of quasi global satellite only precipitation estimates are widely used such as the raw version of precipitation estimation from

potentials and values in hydrological simulation and water resources management behrangi et al 2011 bitew and gebremichael 2011 li et al 2012 2015 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2017 zubieta et al 2015 these studies also pointed out that different satellite precipitation products have variable accuracy and distinct hydrological performance in different basins because of various uncertainties in the data sources retrieval algorithms and bias correction processes of satellite precipitation products dinku et al 2010 kidd et al 2003 tian et al 2010 the quality of these products would affect hydrological simulations through the rainfall runoff processes in hydrologic models nikolopoulos et al 2013 vergara et al 2014 zubieta et al 2015 in another word the uncertainty in satellite based precipitation data together with parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty of hydrologic models will result in uncertainty in streamflow predictions although lots of studies have applied different satellite precipitation products to streamflow or flood modeling most of them focused on evaluating the performance of deterministic simulations without uncertainty estimation there are also some proposed methods to account for the satellite precipitation uncertainties in hydrological simulations hong et al 2006 assessed the influence of satellite based precipitation estimation error on the uncertainty of hydrological response using monte carlo simulation by constructing an error function associated with the precipitation estimates the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d hossain and anagnostou 2006 was used to generate ensembles of satellite rain fields for investigating the error propagation from satellite rainfall to streamflow falck et al 2015 maggioni et al 2013 however these studies did not consider the parameter and model structure uncertainty when obtaining the streamflow ensemble which could probably lead to unrealistic uncertainty bounds ajami et al 2007 in addition these studies generated ensemble streamflow simulations based on a single satellite precipitation product thus the corresponding performance could be highly affected by the error characteristics of the selected satellite precipitation product in the region there is limited research on the impacts of different satellite precipitation products on model parameter uncertainty and hydrologic predictive uncertainty estimation which are essential parts of hydrologic study kavetski 2018 stedinger et al 2008 for uncertainty analysis of streamflow prediction the errors should be described adequately with respect to their characteristics kuczera et al 2010 schoups and vrugt 2010 sikorska and seibert 2016 a common method is to use residual error models to treat total uncertainty in a lumped manner bates and campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 2014 schoups and vrugt 2010 sorooshian and dracup 1980 sun et al 2017 the residual errors typically consist of a combination of input model structural and parameter errors schoups and vrugt 2010 within the bayesian framework parameter posterior distributions are obtained based on a likelihood function derived from the residual error model box and tiao 1992 accordingly posterior predictive distribution of streamflow can be created by adding residual errors to model outputs sikorska and seibert 2016 performed a bayesian uncertainty analysis with an improved characterization of model residual errors to quantify the effects of station based and radar based precipitation on model calibration and flood predictions to date similar studies have rarely been applied to satellite based precipitation ensemble modeling techniques based on different models or datasets have the potential advantage to improve uncertainty estimation in meteorological and hydrological modeling duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 ma et al 2018a b bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most widely used ensemble approaches which derives the consensus prediction from multiple competing predictions hoeting et al 1999 and generates a better merged forecast by exploiting the strengths of the individual predictions the bma method assigns weight to each member based on its corresponding predictive performance within the observations in hydrological field bma has been successfully applied to provide improved and more reliable streamflow predictions with corresponding uncertainty measures most of the studies used the bma method to combine streamflow simulations from different hydrologic models for better accounting for model structure uncertainty ajami et al 2007 duan et al 2007 he et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 liang et al 2013 roy et al 2017 through the use of multiple different hydrologic models the model error is implied in the variability of different model predictions this method of using bma assumes there is enough variability in model structures to account for the uncertainties in the general model framework dechant and moradkhani 2014 similarly the framework has been transferred to account for precipitation input uncertainty of hydrologic models strauch et al 2012 used the bma method to account for precipitation uncertainty by merging streamflow simulations forced by different types of gauge based precipitation datasets however studies focusing on satellite precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulations are relatively few jiang et al 2012 2014 a lot of studies have demonstrated that sgmp products which use gauge observations to correct the errors of original satellite rainfall estimates yield improved streamflow performance maggioni and massari 2018 mei et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the first objective of this study is therefore to investigate the hydrologic value of three mainstream global

novel residual error model to address the strong and complex heteroscedasticity of residual errors showed in the huaihe river basin by means of this newly developed residual error model the parameter and model structural uncertainty could also be properly considered in addition to the precipitation uncertainty through the bayesian uncertainty analysis the impact of different sgmp products on parameter uncertainty and streamflow predictive uncertainty estimation is explored the second objective is to improve the streamflow prediction skills and provide more reliable uncertainty estimations by merging the individual model outputs of the three sgmp products using the bma method sun et al 2016 found out that the regional sgmp product cmorph cma produced the best streamflow simulations and could serve as the high quality precipitation input data in china to evaluate the performance of the streamflow predictions forced by the three global sgmp products and the bma merged streamflow prediction the high quality cmorph cma forced streamflow prediction based on the same error model sun et al 2017 is used as benchmark the comparison could provide quantitative evaluation of the usage of multiple global satellite precipitation products within the bma framework thus indicating its application prospect in poorly gauged basins the rest part of the paper is organized as follows section

located in eastern china between the yangtze and yellow river basins is the most densely inhabited river basin and the sixth largest river basin in china the basin situates within the china s climate transition zone of subtropical moist and semi moist monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 900 mm of which 50 75 falls during the summer monsoon season the study area fig 1 covers the upper region of bengbu hydrologic station over the huaihe river basin same as the one in sun et al 2016 2017 2 2 data this study aims to evaluate the effect of three global sgmp products on streamflow prediction uncertainty over the huaihe river basin including tmpa 3b42v7 tmpa cmorph satellite gauge merged product cmorph bld developed at noaa cpc gsmap gauge calibrated rainfall product gsmap gauge gsmap integrates passive microwave pmw retrievals and infrared ir radiometer data using a pmw ir merged algorithm which uses the kalman filter to refine rainfall rate estimated from the two way morphing technique from ir images joyce et al 2004 to produce the gsmap moving vector with kalman filter gsmap mvk product ushio et al 2009 to develop gsmap gauge noaa cpc global rain gauge dataset is used to remove the bias of gsmap mvk mega et al 2014 the gsmap gauge product used in this study is daily and covers 60 s 60 n 180 w 180 e with a spatial resolution of 0 1 for tmpa and cmorph bld the authors have made very detailed introductions in sun et al 2016 interested readers can refer to the paper for more information according to sun et al 2016 the recent cmorph sgmp product developed by cma cmorph cma showed even higher accuracy in rainfall monitoring and streamflow simulations than high density ground rain gauge data therefore cmorph cma can serve as an alternative high quality precipitation product in china the streamflow prediction interval forced by cmorph cma was adopted as a reference in this study the four sgmp products were aggregated into the uniform 0 25 0 25 spatial grid and daily 00 utc 00 utc resolution during the study period of 2002 2012 the annual basin average precipitation of the four satellite gauge products is shown in table 1 which is characterized by consistent performance and slight interannual variability for the four products the daily discharge observations of the bengbu hydrologic station were collected from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the collected discharge dataset contained the period of 2003 2007 for calibration the spinup period of 2002 and the remaining dataset 2008 2012 for validation 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model in this study the physically based distributed vic hydrologic model was selected to simulate the rainfall runoff processes the vic model is based on a soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme that considers both energy and water balances liang et al 1994 1996 the 3 layer model also takes into account the spatial variation of vegetation cover topography precipitation soil properties and soil moisture many of the vic parameters are assigned according to the vegetation type and soil texture although most parameters can be directly estimated from the land surface database in this study a total of six hydrologic parameters were optimized through calibration including the exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b the maximum baseflow that can occur from the lowest soil layer dsmax the fraction of maximum base flow ds the fraction of maximum soil moisture content of the third layer ws the second and the third soil layer thicknesses d2 and d3 3 2 bayesian uncertainty analysis consider that a hydrologic model simulates streamflow q with the forcing data x e g precipitation temperature and a set of model parameters θ h a residual error model is used to describe the additive errors e defined at time step t as 1 e t q t q t x 1 t θ h where q t is the observed streamflow and q t x 1 t θ h is the simulated streamflow with hydrologic model parameters θ h and forcing data over time steps 1 to t x 1 t according to the bayesian inference the posterior distribution of parameters is 2 p θ h θ e x q p q θ h θ e x p θ h θ e where θ e denotes the residual error model parameters p q θ h θ e x is the likelihood function and p θ h θ e is the prior distribution of hydrologic and residual error model parameters the likelihood function can be represented in the form of the joint probability density function pdf of the residual errors 3 p q θ h θ e x p e θ h x q θ e where e θ h x q is the vector of residual errors obtained over the calibration period the successful application of bayesian inferential approaches is typically based on the formal likelihood function properly characterizing the form of the residual errors mantovan and todini 2006 residual errors often show characteristics of autocorrelation nonnormality and heteroscedasticity and a number of strategies have been proposed to handle these features recently sun et al 2017 proposed a combined approach ca combining the advantages of the linear modeling and box cox transformation to deal with the strong and complex heteroscedasticity showed in the huaihe river basin together with the first order autoregressive model and the skew exponential power sep distribution the residual error model ca sep was generated the expression of the ca sep is shown below 4 η t e t σ t η t φ 1 η t 1 a t with a t s e p 0 1 ξ β σ t σ 0 σ 1 q t where e t denotes the residual errors after the box cox transformation σ t is a normalization term φ 1 is the first order autoregressive coefficient and a t is the innovation described by the sep distribution with parameters ξ and β accounting for nonnormality σ t is conditioned on the simulated streamflow after box cox transformation q t with parameters σ 0 and σ 1 the box cox transformation is shown below 5 f y y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 λ 1 0 y λ 2 ln y λ 2 λ 1 0 y λ 2 where y is observed or simulated streamflow λ 1 and λ 2 are the box cox parameters we fixed the value of λ 2 to 1 to make the original zero flows still zero after the transformation the corresponding likelihood function derived from the residual error model can be expressed using the generalized likelihood gl function schoups and vrugt 2010 the expression for the log likelihood function is 6 log l q θ h θ e n log ω β 2 σ ξ ξ ξ 1 t 1 n log σ t c β t 1 n a ξ t 2 1 β λ 1 1 t 1 n log q t 1 where n is the number of observations a ξ t ξ s i g n μ ξ σ ξ a t and values for μ ξ σ β ω β and c β are all functions of the skewness parameter ξ and the kurtosis parameter β see schoups and vrugt 2010 for details in sun et al 2017 the residual error model ca sep was developed using the high quality precipitation product cmorph cma as the input and the obtained streamflow prediction interval was reliable to investigate the effects of imprecise precipitation input on streamflow predictions we performed a comparative bayesian uncertainty analysis for the three global sgmp products in which the parameters of the hydrologic model vic and residual error model ca sep were calibrated jointly with each of the three precipitation products as model input this led to three different parameter posterior distributions 7 p θ h θ e x i q p q θ h θ e x i p θ h θ e where x i is the forcing data containing the i th sgmp product p θ h θ e x i q is the i th parameter posterior distribution the i th posterior distribution of the hydrologic model parameters θ h was then used to simulate the streamflow with the i th precipitation product producing the i th streamflow uncertainty interval moreover by adding residual errors to the i th streamflow uncertainty interval based on the i th posterior distribution of the residual error model parameters θ e the i th streamflow prediction interval was obtained for better comparison the parameter posterior distributions and the streamflow prediction interval calibrated with cmorph cma were used as benchmark 3 3 calibration method a state of the art markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm called dream zs was used in this study to perform the bayesian calibration and uncertainty estimation dream zs is based on the original dream differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm vrugt et al 2008a 2009 which runs multiple markov chains simultaneously in this study five parallel chains were used and each chain contained 14 000 iterations the last 1000 samples after each chain s convergence altogether 5000 samples were retained to estimate parameter posterior distribution and predictive performance both visual observations and r statistic calculations gelman and rubin 1992 were adopted to check the chains convergence 3 4 bayesian model averaging bma bayesian model averaging is a probabilistic scheme for model combination a brief description of the essence of bma is shown below consider a quantity y as the forecasted variable here streamflow d as the observations of the forecasted variable and the f f 1 f 2 f k as the k sets of considered predictions according to the law of total probability the posterior distribution of the bma prediction can be represented as 8 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d where p f k d is the posterior probability of prediction f k also known as the likelihood of prediction f k being the correct prediction given the observation data d if we denote w k p f k d w k can be considered as weight and k 1 k w k 1 p k y f k d is the posterior distribution of y given prediction f k and observations d and is usually approximated by a normal distribution with mean a k b k f k and variance σ 2 where a k and b k are regression coefficients obtained through simple linear regression of y on f k using the training data the estimation of a k and b k can be viewed as a simple bias correction process raftery et al 2005 the bma weights w k and variance σ 2 were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of occurrence of the observed data y it is easier to maximize the logarithm of likelihood function which is defined as follows 9 l w 1 w 2 w k σ 2 t 1 t log k 1 k w k p y t f kt in this study we assumed a heteroscedastic variance of the conditional forecast distribution as σ kt 2 c f kt the multiplier c applied to all predictions of the ensemble the value of c along with the bma weights were estimated by maximizing eq 9 using markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation with dream vrugt et al 2008b the bma predictive mean is then given by 10 e y f 1 f 2 f k d k 1 k w k a k b k f k finally the bma probabilistic ensemble predictions were generated following raftery et al 2005 the procedure involves i selecting the ensemble size m ii generating a value of k from the numbers 1 2 k with the probabilities w 1 w 2 w k iii drawing a replication of y from the conditional forecast distribution p y f k and iiii repeating steps ii and iii m times to obtain m values of y for each time step in this study the generated bma probabilistic prediction consisted of 5000 ensemble streamflow simulations which had the same sample size as the single precipitation product forced streamflow prediction interval inspired by the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 framework this study merged the three streamflow uncertainty intervals using bma to fully consider the input parameter estimation and model structural uncertainty the detailed procedure is described as follows 1 obtain posterior distribution of hydrologic model and residual error model parameters forced by each global sgmp product using dream zs 2 select three streamflow ensembles from the streamflow uncertainty interval forced by each sgmp product at 5 50 and 95 quantiles respectively thus generating a nine member ensemble 3 estimate the model weight and variance multiplier of each ensemble member 4 compute the final weight of each precipitation product by summing the weights for all ensemble members generated from the corresponding streamflow uncertainty interval 5 generate the bma probabilistic prediction of 5000 ensemble streamflow simulations 6 assess the performance of bma predictive mean and predictive uncertainty 3 5 verification methods both deterministic and probabilistic verification methods were applied in this study to comprehensively access the predictive performance deterministic verification methods included nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and relative error re probabilistic verification metrics used to quantify reliability and forecast skill included probability integral transform pit histogram quantile quantile qq plot with the corresponding quantified metric π reliab the brier skill score bss and the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss on the other hand the methods for quantifying sharpness included the cover rate cr and the d factor the detailed explanations and equations of the verification methods can be found in appendix a 4 results 4 1 effects of different precipitation products on calibration procedure the final parameter ranges calibrated with the four sgmp products are shown in fig 2 it is obvious that using different precipitation products to calibrate the vic model results in different parameter values it is shown that gsmap gauge and cmorph bld yield the largest parameter uncertainty for example the interquartile ranges of the final parameter distributions exceed 25 and 15 of the initial parameter range for dsmax and d3 respectively in contrast the final parameter distributions for tmpa and cmorph cma except for the parameter ds are much narrower sun et al 2016 has reported that cmorph cma is the most accurate among the four precipitation products and sometimes even performs better than the high quality ground gauge rainfall product correspondingly less parameter uncertainty is associated with less error in precipitation for cmorph cma the reason that cmorph cma produces large uncertainty for ds may be partly explained by the residual error model used in this study because the parameter ds is insensitive and has much less impact on the streamflow simulation than the other five parameters in the vic model it is the most likely to be affected by the interaction with residual error model parameters which was also observed in sun et al 2017 as for gsmap gauge and cmorph bld the errors in precipitation are propagated into simulated streamflow and amplified through the interaction with the hydrologic processes when these two are used to calibrate the vic model the parameter uncertainty increases interestingly final parameter ranges calibrated with tmpa are narrow the additive form of the model residual errors represent the model structural uncertainty the model parameter uncertainty and the input uncertainty because of the interaction of different sources of uncertainty during the calibration process the informativeness of different precipitation datasets for parameter estimation is varied therefore it s inferred that tmpa contains more information to inform model parameters with the residual error model used in this study it is noted that the final parameter ranges vary significantly among input precipitation products except the parameter b both gsmap gauge and cmorph bld produce higher estimations of parameter dsmax with median values of 23 and 25 compared to the other two precipitation products with median values of 5 and 3 7 large dsmax tends to cause a high baseflow produced by the bottom soil layer thus having an impact on the simulated streamflow in addition gsmap gauge and cmorph bld provide lower estimation of d2 and higher estimation of d3 than the other two the thicker bottom soil layer may lead to larger soil moisture capacity and hence increase baseflow which has consistent effect with the large estimation of dsmax at the same time thinner second soil layer results in smaller soil moisture capacity in the upper layer and thus reduces the infiltration when rainfall falls on the surface the different calibrated parameter values will directly affect the streamflow predictions as shown in fig 3 in general the 90 uncertainty interval of cmorph bld overestimates the baseflow and produces higher peak flows than others because cmorph bld has higher estimation of dsmax and d3 as well as lower estimation of d2 based on the definition of the residual error model eq 4 the higher flow corresponds to higher residual error in addition the estimated residual error model parameters of cmorph bld also have the largest uncertainty therefore the prediction band of cmorph bld is the widest after adding the additive residual errors similarly the prediction band of gsmap gauge is also wider than those of tmpa and cmorph cma especially at high flows the prediction interval of tmpa displays similar magnitudes to that of cmorph cma while the latter one is narrower sun et al 2017 has demonstrated that the newly developed residual error model ca sep is capable of addressing the complicated heteroscedasticity over the huaihe river basin when cmorph cma was used as the input ca sep produced accurate predictions with high reliability and effectively avoided the negative flows it is worth mentioning that the prediction intervals calibrated with the three global sgmp products could effectively avoid the negative flows which further confirms the stability of ca sep over this basin as summarized in table 2 the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma has the highest nsce values of 0 802 and 0 51 in the calibration and validation periods respectively although the calibrated parameters have relatively large uncertainty for cmorph bld its maximum likelihood simulated streamflow has the second highest nsce and the best re in the calibration period because cmorph bld overestimates the baseflow and its underestimation of peak flows is less severe than tmpa and cmorph cma the overall average biases are smaller gsmap gauge forced simulation has larger nsce than that of tmpa in the calibration period but their difference decreases in the validation period 4 2 deterministic predictive performance the daily mean streamflow of the posterior streamflow distribution forced by the different precipitation products and the bma predictive mean are shown in fig 4 the mean flows for the four precipitation input have the same trend as their 90 streamflow uncertainty intervals shown in fig 3 the detailed evaluation scores for the mean flows are shown in table 3 cmorph bld has the highest nsce and best re among the three global sgmp products in the calibration period because bma weights reflect the ensemble members deterministic predictive performance over the training period duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 cmorph bld receives the largest weight fig 5 tmpa however receives the second largest weight despite having lower nsce than gsmap gauge the parameter posterior distributions of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld are very similar their corresponding streamflow uncertainty intervals also have similar shape since gsmap gauge performs worse than cmorph bld it could contribute little additional information for bma predictions and receives the lowest weight similarly the two members selected from each streamflow uncertainty interval at the 5 and 50 quantiles receive significantly lower weights than the member selected at the 95 quantile table 4 in terms of nsce and re the bma predictive mean performs better than any individual deterministic prediction during both calibration and validation periods table 3 the nsce values of the bma predictive mean are even higher than those of the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma table 2 it can also be seen that the bma predictive mean has the consistent trend with the observed flow and can reproduce both the peak flow and low flow very well fig 4 the high agreement between the bma predictive mean and the observed flow is also reflected by the best re which is even zero in the calibration period 4 3 predictive uncertainty fig 6 displays the 90 bma probabilistic prediction intervals in the calibration and validation periods compared to the most reliable prediction band using cmorph cma as input the bma prediction band is narrower under low flow conditions but a little bit wider at peak flows in the calibration period in the validation period it seems that the bma prediction band becomes narrower at high flows and some flood peaks are not covered to further evaluate the predictive performance a set of probabilistic verification metrics are then applied fig 7 shows the pit histograms for the different prediction intervals it can be seen that the pit histograms for the same probabilistic prediction in the calibration and validation periods show similar shape the shape of pit histograms for tmpa indicates their overestimation of the prediction uncertainty for gsmap gauge and cmorph bld more observations fall into the low probability bins than are expected by the forecasted distributions indicating a positive bias for its prediction interval which is consistent with the former result that gsmap gauge and cmorph bld tends to overestimate the streamflow cmorph cma forced prediction interval also shows a little over dispersive in the calibration period but gets better in the validation period the prediction interval for bma shows the most reliable performance with the flattest pit histogram in the calibration period in the validation period the more obvious u shaped histogram for bma is an indication of under dispersion as expected the quantile quantile qq plots fig 8 for bma are close to the diagonal line indicating its prediction intervals are reliable despite a slight underestimation of the prediction uncertainty the performance of bma is further improved in the validation period the s shaped curvature of the qq plots for tmpa and gsmap gauge suggests a consistent overestimation of the prediction uncertainty while the s shaped feature for tmpa remains unchanged the qq plot for gsmap gauge shows a positive bias of prediction in the validation period the qq plots for cmorph cma also feature systematic under prediction but less pronounced in the validation period as for cmorph bld its qq plots indicate evident systematic over prediction which is more pronounced in the validation period it is noticed that the poor performance of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld becomes worse in the validation period when the streamflow record is relatively dominated by low flows interspersed with high flow events therefore the weakness of gsmap gauge and cmorph bld for producing overlarge predictions is again highlighted to quantitatively analyze the departure of the qq plot from the diagonal table 5 reports the corresponding statistical metric π reliab although the deterministic prediction of tmpa is inferior to the other two global sgmp products the probabilistic prediction of tmpa is much better with the smallest π reliab of 0 095 and 0 084 in the calibration and validation periods respectively bma also shows high reliability of predictive distributions with small values of π reliab which is slightly lower than those of cmorph cma to further compare the skills of probabilistic predictions fig 9 shows the bss at different streamflow thresholds in both calibration and validation periods in the calibration period cmorph cma has the highest scores at low thresholds of 20 and 40 the bsss of tmpa and gsmap gauge also outperform that of bma at the low threshold of 20 bma shows superior predicative skills over cmorph cma at high thresholds of 60 and 80 the bsss of the four precipitation products have an obvious deterioration in the validation period especially at 20 threshold the result of bma however shows consistently high skills cmorph cma outperforms bma at 40 threshold though bma is evidently superior to the results of the four precipitation products at other thresholds in addition the bsss of cmorph bld in both periods reinforce its lower predictive skills than others additionally crpss shown in table 5 can also reflect the reliability of the probabilistic prediction bma has the highest crpsss in both calibration and validation periods further indicating that combining individual predictions simulated from the global sgmp products through bma is an efficient way to produce reliable probabilistic predictions in addition to the above evaluations focusing on the reliability of the probabilistic predictions table 5 further shows the coverage rate cr and the d factor for evaluating the sharpness of the probabilistic predictions perfect predictive uncertainty would expect the cr close to the assumed 90 prediction level and the d factor close to 1 it is clear that bma probabilistic predictions leads to accurate cr values with only slight overestimation in the calibration period 1 and underestimation in the validation period 4 5 the d factors of bma are also the closest to 1 in both calibration and validation periods indicating the intervals would correspond to the standard deviation of the observations with good sharpness all the three global sgmp products especially cmorph bld produce pretty wide prediction bands with crs larger than 97 and d factors larger than 2 the d factor of cmorph cma is 1 37 in the calibration period indicating modest overestimation of the observed variance in streamflow in the validation period the predictive bounds of the four precipitation products become wider with increased d factors by contrast the d factor of bma further decreases during the validation period indicating much more stable performance generally speaking the prediction band of bma performs the best in both reliability and sharpness it is noted that the bma predictions even outperform the predictions forced by a high quality precipitation input therefore using bma for ensemble modeling with multiple global sgmp input can considerably increase both accuracy and reliability in streamflow simulation results which provides a promising approach to support hydrological modeling and water management in regions with sparse precipitation data 5 discussion this study adopted the bayesian framework to assess three global sgmp products this is a general framework for evaluating the value of the precipitation data with consideration of the parameter uncertainty and model structural uncertainty it could easily be applied using different hydrologic models different residual error models and other precipitation products through the calibration cmoprh bld obtained higher estimation of parameter dsmax and d3 but lower estimation of d2 thus producing higher baseflow and surface runoff than gsmap gauge and tmpa therefore the peak flows of cmorph bld were closer to the observations than the other two which helped cmorph bld to acquire higher nsce this is because nsce places more emphasis on high flows due to the squaring of the errors between the simulated and observed data krause et al 2005 however higher flows along with higher parameter uncertainty of cmorph bld also resulted in large predictive uncertainty and unreliable predictive performance due to the tradeoff between the deterministic performance and the probabilistic performance sometimes using a single satellite precipitation product may not be enough in hydrological application therefore multiple precipitation ensembles are suggested for distributed hydrologic models such as vic by taking advantage of varied performance on model calibration and streamflow predictions using different precipitation input this study used the bma method to account for precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulations over the huaihe river basin of china currently there are many kinds of mainstream global satellite precipitation products with high spatiotemporal resolutions the selection of bma input could affect the bma results since many studies have demonstrated that sgmp products have better performance than original satellite rainfall estimates in streamflow simulations maggioni and massari 2018 mei et al 2016 wang et al 2015 this study selected three mainstream global sgmp products involving the poorly performing members in the bma scheme could even worsen the bma predictive performance chen et al 2015 besides the bma method would assign low weights to the members with poor performance raftery et al 2005 and thus these member would have little impact on the bma results in this study we also did an experiment to include another popular sgmp product namely persiann cdr as bma input persiann cdr only uses the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly product to adjust the bias at 2 5 monthly scale the relatively rough bias adjustment process causes its worse performance than other precipitation products over the huaihe river basin consequently the large bias identified for persiann cdr was followed by unrealistic parameter estimation and large predictive uncertainty when using ca sep in the bayesian framework the bma results with persiann cdr showed slightly worse performance not shown and the weight of persiann cdr was smaller than 0 01 when applying the bma method some previous studies ajami et al 2007 strauch et al 2012 compared the bma prediction intervals with the uncertainty intervals associated with parameter uncertainty however such comparisons were not strict because the spread of the ensemble streamflow simulations highly depends on parameter uncertainties in our study all the sgmp products generated very narrow uncertainty intervals therefore the uncertainty intervals can be easily outperformed by bma prediction intervals to properly estimate the predictive uncertainty corresponding to each precipitation input an explicit model of the residual error say ca sep in this study is also recommended the classical bma approach assumes that the conditional pdf of each ensemble member is described with a normal distribution the assumption of normal distribution may be inappropriate for streamflow primarily driven by precipitation while the gamma distribution seems more reasonable however when we examined the normal and gamma distribution the assumption of normality obtained more improvements for streamflow predictions vrugt and robinson 2007 also found an improvement of bma method for streamflow forecasting under the assumption of normal distribution instead of the gamma distribution many studies also recommended using the box cox transformation for the nonnormal distribution prior to the bma process duan et al 2007 ma et al 2018a however the box cox transformation would not always guarantee the dataset after transformation is normally distributed since a lot of studies applying bma to hydrological predictions still directly adopted the normal distribution for computational simplicity ajami et al 2007 kim et al 2015 roy et al 2017 strauch et al 2012 yen et al 2014 and the focus of this study is not on improving the bma approach the normal distribution is acceptable in the future we will test the effect of using the box cox transformation and other conditional distributions on bma performance there is still room for improvement in the bma application for example stationary weights were assigned to the ensemble members in this study some studies have found that dynamically adaptive weights based on the nature of the forecasts and or catchment states may have advantages for improving predictive performance devineni et al 2008 ma et al 2018a b in addition some technical improvements have also been made on the bma method itself madadgar and moradkhani 2014 rings et al 2012 future works are needed to further improve the performance by fully exploring the advantage of the bma method 6 conclusions this study investigated the hydrologic value of three global sgmp products namely tmpa gsmap gauge cmorph bld for hydrologic model parameter calibration and streamflow predictions over the huaihe river basin in china a newly developed residual error model ca sep sun et al 2017 was used to represent total uncertainty in streamflow predictions and the bayesian uncertainty analysis was performed based on this residual error model in addition the individual streamflow simulations selected from each streamflow uncertainty interval were combined using bma the regional high quality sgmp product cmorph cma was also applied within the same framework to provide a benchmark for evaluation the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 using different precipitation products to calibrate the vic model resulted in different parameter posterior values the parameter posterior distributions calibrated with gsmap gauge and cmorph bld had larger uncertainty than those calibrated with tmpa the final estimated parameter values directly affected the streamflow simulation results the higher estimation of parameter dsmax and d3 but lower estimation of d2 obtained by cmorph bld produced higher baseflow and surface runoff than gsmap gauge and tmpa and further led to larger predictive uncertainty 2 among the three global sgmp products cmorph bld forced deterministic simulations performed the best with the highest nsce values of 0 685 and 0 436 accompanied with the smallest absolute re values of 12 and 4 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively however its corresponding probabilistic prediction bands were extremely wide with the worst reliability on the contrary tmpa forced deterministic simulations had the lowest nsce values of 0 623 and 0 397 in the calibration and validation periods respectively however its probabilistic predictions were much better than the other two products 3 the bma predictive mean not only performed better than any individual deterministic prediction of the three global precipitation products but also obtained higher nsces 0 859 and 0 639 for the calibration and validation periods respectively than those of the maximum likelihood simulated streamflow calibrated with cmorph cma it also fitted fairly well with the observed streamflow and captured most peak flows in addition bma largely improved probabilistic streamflow predictions with the best reliability and sharpness compared to other prediction bands based on the various probabilistic verification methods overall the demonstrated advantages of using multiple global sgmp products ensemble should be transferable to other hydrologic models and other regions especially in ungauged basins bma can be used as an efficient tool to improve the performance of both the deterministic and probabilistic streamflow predictions hence better supporting water management and decision making acknowledgments the authors are very grateful to the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive

verification methods probability integral transform pit histogram the pit histogram is analogous to the rank histogram it s used to assess the consistency between the frequency of occurrence of

observation at time step t f t is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the probabilistic forecast at that time in this study we divide the interval 0 1 into 10 equally sized bins for perfectly reliable forecasts the pit histogram will be approximately flat if the pit histogram is not flat its shape can be used to diagnose problems with the predictive uncertainty for example dome shaped pit

6953,sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties in this study first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal then by using the results of this model a fuzzy inference system fis was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal automatically the capability of this approach is studied in the astaneh kouchesfahan plain in north of iran to do this the groundwater of this plain was simulated using modflow code then two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 mcm according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22 0 and 14 6 of the water demand respectively the results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the fis considering the predictor variables these variables were applied to the developed fis model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer the evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination normalized root mean square error and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0 94 0 26 mcm and 3 8 mcm respectively for the best scenarios these scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods keywords conjunctive use fuzzy optimization groundwater management fuzzy inference systems uncertainty 1 introduction the occurrence of hydrological droughts in recent years has increased the water demand and extra water withdrawal of the resources of the earth and has caused many problems in environment health and agricultural production the negative consequences of such a situation have led to water management as a necessity groundwater is generally considered as a suitable option for water supply where rivers faces with water shortage however excessive pumping from aquifers in the past two decades has led to a dramatic groundwater level drop and a decrease in the quality of groundwater in most parts of iran thus control on groundwater withdrawal should be considered as a basis for water resources planning furthermore optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources is required in the arid and semi arid areas with a surface water resources river or dam and groundwater resources aquifer a conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources is generally used to ensure sustainable water supply for agriculture and other sectors particularly in the area where there is no spatial and temporal synchrony between surface water resource and demand the surface water shortages can be partly compensated by the use of combined management of surface and groundwater resources safavi and esmikhani 2013 water resources management problems such as optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources generally have variables with uncertain values loucks et al 1981 errors and approximations of observed data models variables structure and algorithm are all sources of uncertainty one of the methods for reducing uncertainty in data and variables is employing fuzzy logic in which fuzzy values are considered for variables in optimization models for considering the uncertainties in the objective function and constraints in recent decades in areas which include surface and groundwater resources extensive studies have been carried out on optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources ejaz and peralta 1995 vedula et al 2005 karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 safavi et al 2013 rezaei et al 2017a b yousefi et al 2018 safavi and alijanian 2010 simulated the interaction between surface and groundwater resources in the najafabad aquifer using groundwater vistas 4 0 software in order to control the level of water table during the optimization the model were applied in different scenarios to consider the various conditions of the aquifer in the optimization they used fuzzy linear regression to consider the uncertainties due to the approximations of the simulation by model chang et al 2013 implemented conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network in taiwan the model s objective function was to allocate surface water including from two reservoirs and groundwater resources their results showed that the use of fuzzy set can replace other simulation models for surface and groundwater management rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 used the bayesian network to formulate real time conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources their research objectives included reduction of pumping costs improving the groundwater quality water supply with acceptable quality and controlling the groundwater table fluctuations the results of the optimization model were used to train the bayesian network and to develop operation rules in the long term planning safavi and rezaei 2015 conducted a research on conjunctive use based on a simulation optimization technique in the najafabad plain in iran they used the combination of fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network to consider various weather conditions and reduce the uncertainty of the variables and data for the simulation optimization was carried out by using fuzzy dynamic programming for the najafabad aquifer to minimize the difference between water demand and allocated water resources rezaei et al 2017a b in the same area of study presented a new fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization their results showed that the proposed algorithm had more satisfactory results in terms of water demand and minimization of groundwater level changes compared to other optimization algorithms yousefi et al 2018 although fuzzy optimization models have not been used in conjunctive use studies the acceptable performance of these models has been shown in other fields of water and agricultural science sahoo et al 2006 and li et al 2017 have used fuzzy optimization for optimal cropping pattern and irrigation water allocation the fuzzy inference system model is used by many researchers in different fields due to its simplicity and the consideration of uncertainty asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 in the field of hydrology this model is used for various purposes such as flood flow forecasting determination of drought periods forecasting of flow rate and urban flood risk management since this method is based on the membership functions designed by experts it can simulate the water resources problems with acceptable performance the xiong et al 2001 developed a first order sugeno takagi fuzzy system model to predict precipitation and runoff studies have shown the simplicity and high performance of the model compared with other models such as artificial neural networks firat et al 2009 used adaptive neuro fuzzy system and fuzzy inference system models to predict urban water consumption their results showed that adaptive neuro fuzzy system provides better results than fuzzy inference system mahapatra et al 2011 used a fuzzy inference system to investigate and evaluate the water quality of five rivers in india using a dimensionless water quality index their results indicated the acceptable performance of these systems lohani et al 2014 used a fuzzy inference system for real time prediction of flood events in india they used data for the prediction of hourly precipitation and river flow their fuzzy inference model was also compared with the artificial neural network which indicated the acceptable performance of the fuzzy inference system model compared with artificial neural network in real time flood prediction vadiati et al 2016 used the mamdani fuzzy logic decision making approach to assess groundwater quality based on groundwater quality index gqi water quality index wqi and ground water quality index gwqi they reported the acceptable performance of the fuzzy inference system to assess groundwater quality and they concluded that this model could replace expert opinions tabesh et al 2018 used a fuzzy inference system to evaluate the risk of non revenue water nrw they used a questionnaire to collect various risk factors in nrw and then used the bayesian network to identify possible relationships among factors and identifying their effectiveness finally using a fis they carried out risk analysis for nrw factors in the present study for the first time a fully fuzzy optimization model was employed for the optimization of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater sources to reduce existing uncertainties and reach the more realistic optimization of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources the study area is astaneh kouchesfahan region in guilan province in iran despite of rich surface and groundwater resources in this area there is a low reliability of providing the water demand because surface and groundwater resources are not optimally supplied furthermore due to the fact that a major part of water demand is provided by surface water in this area the level of groundwater is high enough to evaporate from the ground level and the drainage systems have been considered in some areas of the aquifer after preparing the optimized combined fuzzy model and solving it the results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal from the aquifer using fuzzy inference system from the results of the optimization model the fuzzy inference system and extracted fuzzy rules were designed according to the optimization results in order that using the fuzzy inference system and providing instructions and rules the optimal water withdrawal amount for the next month can be predicted 2 study area astaneh kouchesfahan area in guilan province of iran is located on the sefidrud river alluvial fan fig 1 its area is approximately 2581 km2 the plain area is about 1300 km2 with an average altitude of 1281 m above sea level it is located between 36 44 37 28 n latitude and 49 15 50 11 e longitude the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the plain are 1079 and 1000 mm respectively the study area is divided into six development units that are responsible for providing water to the aquifer the information of the water demands in this aquifer can be seen in table 1 the dominant cultivation of this area is rice but other products such as melon and peanuts are cultivated periodically according to the rice cultivation the irrigation program starts from april and ends in august the time and amount of irrigation varies depending on the growth of the agricultural products the major water demand is provided by the sefidrud dam the outflow volume from the sefidrud dam is diverted out of the area after water withdrawal through the fuman tunnel and galle rud diversion dam in the upstream of sangar diversion dam and through the right canal of the dam about 70 of the flow is diverted to the astaneh kouchesfahan study area and the rest to the lahijan and fumanat areas from the sangar diversion dam and through the left canal a flow is diverted to provide water supply for the astaneh kouchesfahan study area the aquifer is divided to left and right parts of sangar due to its large size and a part of fumanat area this ratio is about 70 for astaneh kouchesfahan area fig 1a the part of the water demand which cannot be provided by surface water is supplied through groundwater in the study area the level of groundwater is so high that in some areas of the aquifer groundwater evaporation is about 20 million m3 per year and several artificial drainage systems are considered in the northeast part of the region fig 1b the average water withdrawal from groundwater through drains is 120 million m3 per year in addition despite the abundant surface and groundwater resources there is a shortage of water resources in the agricultural seasons in order that in current water withdrawal situation in some years about 46 of water demand cannot be supplied by optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in addition to providing water demand it will be possible to control the groundwater evaporation and the water discharge from the drainage by more water withdrawal from groundwater than the current situation and controlling the average groundwater level drop 3 methodology the stages of this research are shown as a flowchart in fig 2 firstly groundwater was simulated by gms software then from the groundwater simulation model the simulator approximation was extracted in the form of groundwater level drop withdrawal regression equations these equations were used as the constraints of the combined optimization model to control the groundwater amount the fully fuzzy optimization model was evaluated in two different ways in the following from the optimization model a fuzzy inference system fis was developed to predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal the input variables of the fuzzy inference system were groundwater level drop s variables at the end of the previous month and two months ago surface water at the beginning of current month and the beginning of the previous month and the water demand in current month input variables were applied by the inference system under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the best prediction performance in the aquifer water withdrawal these scenarios were different in the number of input variables the selected scenarios were also assessed using other types of fuzzy membership function the results of the optimization model were considered as control data to predict the optimal water withdrawal this was done to replace combined optimization models with an intelligent fuzzy inference model for optimal water withdrawal the selected scenario is able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and the optimization model can be replaced by it the rest of this section is dedicated to a description of the flowchart stages 3 1 groundwater simulation the astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer was simulated by modflow 2000 code using gms software hardaugh et al 2000 the modflow code is one of the most reliable and most widely used groundwater simulation codes which simulates underground flows based on finite difference methods hardaugh et al 2000 the aquifer thickness varied from 80 m to 260 m and the size of the cells was considered 500 500 the overall slope of the aquifer is from the south to the north therefore due to the aquifer slope the groundwater flows from the highlands to the caspian sea fig 3 a the borders of the aquifer entrance fronts are adjacent to the borders of the highlands fig 3b the outlet of the aquifer flows to the sea many rivers begin at highlands and pass through the aquifer to the caspian sea from which sefidrud is of great importance the rivers are in exchange with the aquifer in their route and play the role of charging or discharging the aquifer in the right part of the aquifer due to the high groundwater level and to prevent damages to agricultural products artificial drains have been provided as groundwater withdrawal units fig 3b evaporation of underground water occurs in parts of the aquifer where the groundwater level is less than 5 m from ground level therefore by considering a 5 m threshold in groundwater simulation the amount of evaporation was considered for parts of the aquifer which had a depth below 5 m the amount of charge to the aquifer from irrigation water varies according to the agricultural seasons for non agricultural months this amount is zero and for agricultural months the percentage is similar to the percentage of return water from wells 20 30 for drinking and industrial wells the amount of charge is about 60 75 also about 10 20 of the aquifer water charge belongs to precipitation in the studied aquifer artificial drainage of rivers and evaporation are also considered as aquifer charge discharge there are approximately 57 observation wells in the aquifer of which 50 observation wells were used for calibration in steady and unsteady states data of october 2010 was used to run the model in the steady state and from november 2010 to september 2012 for unsteady state in the monthly simulation of groundwater hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated in steady and unsteady states respectively 3 2 fuzzy optimization 3 2 1 the objective function the objective function is to minimize the shortage of water supply which is provided by surface water and groundwater the amount of surface water allocation is diverted to sangar right and left canals from the upstream of the sangar diversion dam about 30 of the water volume of each canal flows to lahijan and fumanat areas the objective function is to minimize the yearly water shortage eq 1 the optimization period was considered to be 20 years 1996 1997 to 2016 2017 and the model has been developed with monthly steps due to the presence of left and right canals and the large area of the case study the area was divided into two areas called the left sangar and right sangar 1 min z i 1 20 j 1 12 k l r d ijk sw ijk gw ijk where i is the number of the year in optimization period j is the number of the month in a year k is the number of the area right or left sangar d ijk is the water demand in the year i and the month j in the area j mcm s w ijk is the surface water withdrawal volume mcm and g w ijk is the groundwater withdrawal volume mcm 3 2 2 constraints according to the allowable groundwater level drop due to water withdrawal eq 2 the drop should not exceed the limit as this would result in a shortage of aquifer water volume it is necessary to explain that the results of groundwater simulation extracted in the form of regression equations will be substituted in eqs 2 and 3 2 a ijk gw ijk h ijk i j k where h ijk is the allowable amount of groundwater level drop in the year i the month j and the area k m pleasecheck is the fuzzy regression coefficient in the groundwater level drop water withdrawal equation according to the allowable rise in level eq 3 amount of the rise should also not exceed the limit as this would result in run offs and possible damage to the root of the plants 3 a ijk g w ijk h ijk i j k where h ijk is the allowable rise in level in the year i the month j and the area k m furthermore according to the maximum capacity of the canals eq 4 each of the left and right canals of sangar has the maximum water capacity which should be considered during the water allocation 4 sw ijk cp ijk i j k where c p ijk is the maximum capacity of the canals in the year i the month j and the area k mcm the total amount of water allocated to the left and right canals of the sangar should not be bigger than the water volume available by the sangar dam thus the total available water can be considered for the two canals eq 5 5 k l r sw ijk aw ij i j where a w ij is the volume of water available by the sangar diversion dam in the year i the month j and the area k the final constraint eq 6 is that the total volume of water allocated to the left or right canal and the groundwater resources of the left or right sangar should not exceed the water demand in the considered month and year 6 sw ijk gw ijk d ijk i j k the fully fuzzy optimization model was first converted into three explicit objective functions with respect to the left middle and right fuzzy bands using the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method the model was solved using the linear optimization simplex algorithm with gams software therefore decision variables were solved for each fuzzy band finally the crisp values of the results were obtained by centroid defuzzification in order to consider the uncertainty in the variables since the water demand values were not time series data they decreased and increased by 20 to create left and right fuzzy membership functions as their uncertainty bands due to the fact that about 70 of the total water behind the sangar divergent dam is allocated to the study area in order to consider maximum minimum and average uncertainty the amount of water resources during the studied 20 years was extracted and given these values the fuzzy membership functions of the surface water were determined 3 2 3 the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 solutions so far various methods have been proposed to convert a fully fuzzy model into a crisp model each of which has advantages and disadvantages lotfi et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 among the existing methods the methods introduced by kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 are used in this study the algorithm of the both methods is shown in fig 4 in the kumar et al 2010 method the objective function is ranked using the equation in table 2 and then the equations defuzzicated through the operators of table 2 and finally is solved by the gams software however in the jayalakshmi and pandian method 2012 in addition to the operators shown in table 2 the objective function was converted to three separate objective functions and each level is solved by the gams software considering the constraints shown in table 3 finally fuzzy functions in both methods were converted to the crisp state through the centroid defuzzification wang 1992 3 3 fuzzy inference system fuzzy inference system is based on if then rules in order that the input and output variables are connected to each other by these fuzzy rules therefore fuzzy inference system can be used as a prediction model for situations where input or output data has high uncertainty in order to determine the optimal groundwater withdrawal in each month a combined optimization model is needed to be developed for the desired period and its effect on groundwater should be assessed which is costly and time consuming therefore from the results of the optimization model several rules can be developed by fuzzy inference system to predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal in every month this can reduce the complexity of optimization and the developed intelligent system will be user friendly the data obtained from the optimization model input and output variables were divided into two groups training and test about 75 of the data were used for training and determination of fuzzy rules and 25 for the test in the training process the performance of the model was evaluated by the evaluation criteria described in section 3 4 and the rules with acceptable performance along with the fuzzy membership functions were selected for verification 3 4 evaluation criteria the performance of the scenarios was appraised based on coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae using eqs 7 9 respectively 7 r 2 1 i 1 n x p x o 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 8 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 2 1 n i 1 n x o 9 mae 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 where xo is the observed value xp is the predicted value and n is the number of samples the lower nrmse and mae and higher r2 the better performance of the model is 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater simulation results the water table of astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer is determined by 50 observation wells as control points scattered throughout the aquifer area the simulation of groundwater was performed in both steady and unsteady conditions and the hydraulic conductivity values in steady state and specific storage in unsteady state were calibrated fig 5 shows the aquifer wells after calibration in unsteady state and groundwater level in order to evaluate the performance of the model the nrmse and mae were 0 90 and 0 91 respectively in unsteady state the observed and computed groundwater level of the aquifer wells were then plotted which four of them is illustrated in fig 6 according to this figure the modflow code is able to simulate groundwater in the study area in fig 6 vertical axis of the plots shows the groundwater level as shown in this figure the difference between the observed and computed level is insignificant this indicates that the groundwater model has the capability of groundwater level prediction in steady state simulation of groundwater the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated initially the initial values of the hydraulic conductivity are calculated regarding the t k b equation where k is hydraulic conductivity m day b is the aquifer thickness m and t is the aquifer transformability m2 day and are given to the model and then calibrated further fig 7 a illustrates the hydraulic conductivity values in the study area which varies from 2 5 to 25 m day in some parts of the aquifer where the particles are coarse grains the hydraulic conductivity values are the highest in unsteady state the specific yield are calibrated these values vary from 3 to 25 in different parts of the aquifer and its variation follows the hydraulic conductivity values fig 7b 4 2 approximation of simulation model using linear regression recently the main simulator model has been approximated to create a relationship between the simulator and optimizer model and then the obtained approximate equation is used in optimization safavi et al 2010 this method will be much more useful in terms of costs and processing time this approximation was carried out using various methods the simplest method for approximating the main simulator model was linear regression in this study fuzzy linear regression has been used to approximate the results of the simulation model to do this after the calibration of the groundwater simulator model different water withdrawal volumes were applied to the model and the groundwater level drop was calculated simultaneously then the average amount of water level in the aquifer was obtained using thiessen polygons in order to obtain enough data for regression fitting about 100 water withdrawals with different volumes were applied to the model then the data was divided according to the amount of loss into three levels of low medium and high loss and for each level a regression equation was extracted in fact each level forms a fuzzy expression band and the regression slope and intercept are formed for the fuzzy bands in the following through the centroid defuzzification these fuzzy regression equations became crisp non fuzzy values the results of defuzzified regression equations and their evaluation criteria are presented in table 4 evaluation criteria show that the simulator approximation was able to predict the groundwater level drop or rise hi due to groundwater withdrawal qqw i in the i th month consequently these equations can be used in the constraints of the combined optimization model and to measure the aquifer response to the groundwater allocation 4 3 results of the fuzzy combined optimization model the optimization model was implemented for a period of 20 years from 1996 to 1997 to 2015 2016 the 20 year period was chosen such that it includes drought and wetness uniform periods then the fuzzy optimization model developed by the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods was solved using gams software the fuzzy results for the period of 20 years were extracted monthly for the left and right sangar and then they were defuzzified the results of the optimization model for the right and left sangar provided by kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods are illustrated in fig 8 referring to fig 8 the main supply of water is provided in both methods through surface water and groundwater serves as an auxiliary water source along with surface water to meet the water demand in fact the optimization model firstly uses the surface water to meet the water needs and if possible uses groundwater resources by considering the allowable groundwater level drop for this reason during june and august when there was enough surface water water demand was supplied by surface water however the greatest shortage in the right sangar was about 80 million m3 in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 while the water demand in current month was about 95 million m3 during this time the water shortage in the left sangar was about 17 million m3 while the water demand in this area was 206 million m3 in 2014 15 there was a water shortage about 54 million m3 while the water demand was 206 million m3 from fig 8 it should be noted that the higher allocation of surface water in the optimization model is for the left sangar in fact the optimization model firstly allocates the surface water to the left sangar and then to the right sangar the highest shortage in the left sangar was in may 2008 09 equal to 137 million m3 in the same time there is a shortage in the right sangar equal to 47 million m3 in this case the model first considered the surface water for the right sangar then allocates the remainder to the left sangar in the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method the most shortage in the right sangar was in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 which was equal to 80 million m3 while the water demand for current month was about 95 million m3 during the same time there was a shortage of about 17 million m3 in the left sangar while the water demand was 206 million m3 the highest shortage in the left sangar was in may 2008 09 equal to 135 million m3 in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 the optimization model firstly allocated water resources to the left sangar and used groundwater resources only to meet the water demand of the right sangar which is why about 80 million m3 of the 95 million m3 water demand about 84 was not provided in current month however in the left sangar 8 of the water demand was not provided in other words about 92 of the needs was supplied through the total surface water and groundwater in the other words from the 206 million m3 173 million m3 and 17 million m3 were provided through surface water and groundwater respectively although about 16 million m3 of water demand was not provided the surface water was not allocated to the right sangar and only 15 million m3 of groundwater was withdrawn to meet about 16 of the water demand every year during may we have faced a lot of shortages in comparison to other months because the water demand is high in current month furthermore the volume of surface water and the limitations that we had applied to groundwater limited supply sources so we face a water shortage in current month every year if we consider a higher allowable groundwater level drop for may compared with other months higher percentage of water demand will be provided in current month due to the fact that there is enough surface water in the month after may june and no groundwater is withdraw in current month due to the optimal allocation of the model this higher groundwater level drop will be compensated somewhat in the following month in june and july due to the presence of surface water resources which is more than water demand there were no water shortage in both sides of the sangar 4 3 1 comparison of the results of fuzzy optimization methods and current water withdrawal the optimization model was compared with the current water withdrawal and finally a suitable solution was selected current water withdrawal was obtained by available records for the 20 year optimization period the total annual water shortage for the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods and current water withdrawal are presented in fig 9 this figure shows that in the current water withdrawal during 1998 99 we saw the greatest water shortage in the total area which was equal to 413 million m3 and 46 of water demand was not provided this amount was calculated equal to 325 and 317 million m3 in the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which were 34 1 33 6 of the water demand respectively in 2011 12 a water shortage 47 million m3 was observed in current water withdrawal while 5 of water demand was not met this amount was calculated equal to 23 and 15 million m3 in the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which were 2 4 1 6 of the water demand respectively in the long term average studied 20 year period the average water shortage was equal to 215 148 and 138 million m3 according to current water withdrawal the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which was 22 0 15 7 14 6 of the water demand respectively according to fig 9 the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods as optimization techniques resulted in better performance compared with current water withdrawal in order that the water shortage in all years in these methods was less than current water withdrawal finally the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method provided better results than kumar et al 2010 fig 10 shows groundwater level in current water withdrawal and fuzzy optimization methods according to fig 10 over the studied years the groundwater level drop increased in some years groundwater level faced more groundwater level drop in combined optimization method compared to current water withdrawal in the years 1997 98 2000 01 and 2007 08 a higher groundwater level drop was observed in comparison with other years although this decrease in water level was observed both in the optimization models and in the current water withdrawal the decrement is larger for optimization methods the reason here is the higher allowable groundwater level drop water was considered in the optimization models in the three years mentioned above surface water is lower than other years in order that in 1998 99 the surface water was 393 million m3 while 65 9 of water demand was provided that the contribution of groundwater was about 25 the withdrawn groundwater was 235 million m3 in this year in the year 2000 01 the surface water was 493 million m3 while 70 0 of water demand was provided that the contribution of groundwater was 225 million m3 about 24 in 2008 09 the withdrawn groundwater was 230 million m3 which was equal to 24 5 of the water demand considering the climatic conditions of the study area where the high groundwater level evaporates from the ground surface and causes run offs the implementation of the combined optimization model reduces evaporation from ground level about 13 million m3 per year and reduces groundwater withdrawal from drainage by about 50 million m3 per year therefore several problems of the aquifer can be solved by utilizing the combined optimization model 4 4 results of the fuzzy inference model after implementation of the optimization model and analysis of its results the optimum groundwater withdrawal was predicted using fuzzy inference system based on the results of the optimization model the input variables of the predictive model were the amount of groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month a the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months b surface water at the beginning of current month c surface water at the beginning of the previous month d and the water demand at current month e the amount of groundwater withdrawal was the output parameter regarding the shape of membership functions since the two variables a and b were similar in nature and amount their range and the shape membership function were the same furthermore the range of these variables includes a negative part since the groundwater level drop and rise amounts were expressed with positive and negative signs respectively the membership functions for the variables a and b was considered low medium high and very high similarly since the two variables c and d were the same in the amount and nature the amount of zero to 320 million m3 of surface water per month is divided into five membership functions very low low medium high and very high the variable e which shows the water demand was divided into three membership functions low medium and high finally the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal which is the output variable has divided into five membership functions very low low medium high and very high respectively with a minimum value of zero and a maximum of 45 million m3 the shape of triangular fuzzy membership functions for the variables is presented in fig 11 the amount of groundwater withdrawal was constant in non agricultural months as well as the amount of surface water was zero in non agricultural months and water demand was also insignificant which was provided by groundwater therefore the fuzzy rules designing and the amount of groundwater withdrawal was only for agricultural months according to the predictive variables 9 scenarios were considered according to table 5 the number of fuzzy rules used in each scenario varied according to shape of the membership functions and the number of input variables for example for the second scenario where the number of predictive variables was two and four membership functions were considered for each variable 4 4 16 rules were considered in this scenario indeed fuzzy rules in scenarios with a low number of parameters such as scenarios 1 6 were obtained by multiplying the number of variables membership functions however in the last three scenarios scenarios 7 9 due to the existence of more predictive parameters it was needed to summarize many rules to avoid the development of a fis with a low accuracy so with respect to the parameters and their relative membership functions some rules were summed up to cover all the model requirements and to obtain acceptable results these rules were designed based on the results of the optimization model two examples of the rules in the second scenario are as follow a if the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month is high and the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months is high then groundwater withdrawal is low b if the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month is low and the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months is low then groundwater withdrawal is very high fig 12 shows these rules with the input and output variables of the fuzzy inference system table 6 summarizes the results of each scenarios with the evaluation criteria listed among the scenarios the fifth and sixth scenarios were selected for having appropriate evaluation criteria both selected scenarios had three input variables the input variables in the fifth scenario was the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago and the surface water at the beginning of current month moreover for the sixth scenario they were the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago and water demand at current month it can be concluded that with lower number of input variables the constructed scenario will be very simple and therefore the predictive model will have less accuracy for example none of single variable and two variables scenarios provided appropriate results if the number of input variables is large the number of applied rules will increase significantly and the model becomes more complicated the fifth and sixth scenarios are actually completed forms of the second and third scenarios by considering the value of surface water at the beginning of current month as an input variable to the second and third scenarios their accuracy has reached a satisfactory level therefore it can be concluded that the surface water resources play a significant role in predicting the amount of groundwater withdrawal in reality if there is more surface water the withdrawn water from groundwater will be less and vice versa water demand was also an important predictor because in some cases surface water may be high but we need more water which should be provided by groundwater considering the groundwater drop at the end of the previous month in fact three variables including groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month the surface water at current month and the water demand at current month had a more important role than the rest of the variables to evaluate the effects of the membership function shape other shapes of fuzzy membership functions were compared for the two selected scenarios beside triangle common fuzzy membership function shapes include trapezoid gaussian and bell shaped therefore these membership function for input and output variables is shown in fig 13 results of evaluation criteria with different fuzzy membership functions for the fifth and sixth scenarios is presented in tables 7 and 8 among different fuzzy membership functions for the fifth scenario triangular fuzzy membership function with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 92 nrmse of 0 22 and mae of 3 50 for training data had the highest performance these criteria were 0 93 0 35 and 4 1 for test data respectively in the sixth scenario triangular fuzzy membership function resulted in a coefficient of determination equal to 0 92 nrmse of 0 21 and mae of 3 20 for training data had the highest performance these criteria were 0 94 0 28 and 4 1 for test data respectively as a result the triangular fuzzy membership was the most appropriate membership function for the fifth and sixth scenarios consequently using the fifth or sixth scenario with triangular fuzzy membership function the fuzzy inference system can predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal fig 14 in this situation fuzzy inference system can replace the combined optimization model for groundwater withdrawal 5 conclusions in this study a new approach is introduced for optimal conjunctive surface and ground water use applying fully fuzzy optimization and fuzzy inference system fully fuzzy optimization was used for optimal water withdrawal and fuzzy inference system was used to predict the optimal aquifer water withdrawal the results of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the average annual water shortage in the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method was lower than that of kumar et al 2010 as a result the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method is more appropriate for fully fuzzy combined optimization model than kumar et al 2010 method 2 in the fuzzy conjunctive use based on both methods the shortage of water resources was much lower than the current water withdrawal which shows the importance of the conjunctive use during the studied period 3 implementing the combined optimization model decreased groundwater evaporation about 13 million m3 per year and reduced groundwater withdrawal from drainage by about 50 million m3 per year in order to eliminate the problem of run offs and evaporation from groundwater 4 in the fuzzy rules designing scenarios with three input variables in the form of triangular membership functions performed the best prediction scenarios with lower input variables single variable and two variables scenarios resulted in the lowest performance because of their simplicity and not considering the actual conditions 5 fifth and sixth scenarios provided highest performance using predictive variables of the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago available surface water resources at current month and water demand at current month 6 fuzzy inference system had the ability to predict groundwater withdrawal based on the results of fuzzy optimization model generally the method presented in this study can help managers and stakeholders for better planning of surface and groundwater use and it can be evaluated in other study areas 
6953,sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties in this study first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal then by using the results of this model a fuzzy inference system fis was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal automatically the capability of this approach is studied in the astaneh kouchesfahan plain in north of iran to do this the groundwater of this plain was simulated using modflow code then two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 mcm according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22 0 and 14 6 of the water demand respectively the results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the fis considering the predictor variables these variables were applied to the developed fis model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer the evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination normalized root mean square error and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0 94 0 26 mcm and 3 8 mcm respectively for the best scenarios these scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods keywords conjunctive use fuzzy optimization groundwater management fuzzy inference systems uncertainty 1 introduction the occurrence of hydrological droughts in recent years has increased the water demand and extra water withdrawal of the resources of the earth and has caused many problems in environment health and agricultural production the negative consequences of such a situation have led to water management as a necessity groundwater is generally considered as a suitable option for water supply where rivers faces with water shortage however excessive pumping from aquifers in the past two decades has led to a dramatic groundwater level drop and a decrease in the quality of groundwater in most parts of iran thus control on groundwater withdrawal should be considered as a basis for water resources planning furthermore optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources is required in the arid and semi arid areas with a surface water resources river or dam and groundwater resources aquifer a conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources is generally used to ensure sustainable water supply for agriculture and other sectors particularly in the area where there is no spatial and temporal synchrony between surface water resource and demand the surface water shortages can be partly compensated by the use of combined management of surface and groundwater resources safavi and esmikhani 2013 water resources management problems such as optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources generally have variables with uncertain values loucks et al 1981 errors and approximations of observed data models variables structure and algorithm are all sources of uncertainty one of the methods for reducing uncertainty in data and variables is employing fuzzy logic in which fuzzy values are considered for variables in optimization models for considering the uncertainties in the objective function and constraints in recent decades in areas which include surface and groundwater resources extensive studies have been carried out on optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources ejaz and peralta 1995 vedula et al 2005 karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 safavi et al 2013 rezaei et al 2017a b yousefi et al 2018 safavi and alijanian 2010 simulated the interaction between surface and groundwater resources in the najafabad aquifer using groundwater vistas 4 0 software in order to control the level of water table during the optimization the model were applied in different scenarios to consider the various conditions of the aquifer in the optimization they used fuzzy linear regression to consider the uncertainties due to the approximations of the simulation by model chang et al 2013 implemented conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network in taiwan the model s objective function was to allocate surface water including from two reservoirs and groundwater resources their results showed that the use of fuzzy set can replace other simulation models for surface and groundwater management rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 used the bayesian network to formulate real time conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources their research objectives included reduction of pumping costs improving the groundwater quality water supply with acceptable quality and controlling the groundwater table fluctuations the results of the optimization model were used to train the bayesian network and to develop operation rules in the long term planning safavi and rezaei 2015 conducted a research on conjunctive use based on a simulation optimization technique in the najafabad plain in iran they used the combination of fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network to consider various weather conditions and reduce the uncertainty of the variables and data for the simulation optimization was carried out by using fuzzy dynamic programming for the najafabad aquifer to minimize the difference between water demand and allocated water resources rezaei et al 2017a b in the same area of study presented a new fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization their results showed that the proposed algorithm had more satisfactory results in terms of water demand and minimization of groundwater level changes compared to other optimization algorithms yousefi et al 2018 although fuzzy optimization models have not been used in conjunctive use studies the acceptable performance of these models has been shown in other fields of water and agricultural science sahoo et al 2006 and li et al 2017 have used fuzzy optimization for optimal cropping pattern and irrigation water allocation the fuzzy inference system model is used by many researchers in different fields due to its simplicity and the consideration of uncertainty asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 in the field of hydrology this model is used for various purposes such as flood flow forecasting determination of drought periods forecasting of flow rate and urban flood risk management since this method is based on the membership functions designed by experts it can simulate the water resources problems with acceptable performance the xiong et al 2001 developed a first order sugeno takagi fuzzy system model to predict precipitation and runoff studies have shown the simplicity and high performance of the model compared with other models such as artificial neural networks firat et al 2009 used adaptive neuro fuzzy system and fuzzy inference system models to predict urban water consumption their results showed that adaptive neuro fuzzy system provides better results than fuzzy inference system mahapatra et al 2011 used a fuzzy inference system to investigate and evaluate the water quality of five rivers in india using a dimensionless water quality index their results indicated the acceptable performance of these systems lohani et al 2014 used a fuzzy inference system for real time prediction of flood events in india they used data for the prediction of hourly precipitation and river flow their fuzzy inference model was also compared with the artificial neural network which indicated the acceptable performance of the fuzzy inference system model compared with artificial neural network in real time flood prediction vadiati et al 2016 used the mamdani fuzzy logic decision making approach to assess groundwater quality based on groundwater quality index gqi water quality index wqi and ground water quality index gwqi they reported the acceptable performance of the fuzzy inference system to assess groundwater quality and they concluded that this model could replace expert opinions tabesh et al 2018 used a fuzzy inference system to evaluate the risk of non revenue water nrw they used a questionnaire to collect various risk factors in nrw and then used the bayesian network to identify possible relationships among factors and identifying their effectiveness finally using a fis they carried out risk analysis for nrw factors in the present study for the first time a fully fuzzy optimization model was employed for the optimization of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater sources to reduce existing uncertainties and reach the more realistic optimization of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources the study area is astaneh kouchesfahan region in guilan province in iran despite of rich surface and groundwater resources in this area there is a low reliability of providing the water demand because surface and groundwater resources are not optimally supplied furthermore due to the fact that a major part of water demand is provided by surface water in this area the level of groundwater is high enough to evaporate from the ground level and the drainage systems have been considered in some areas of the aquifer after preparing the optimized combined fuzzy model and solving it the results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal from the aquifer using fuzzy inference system from the results of the optimization model the fuzzy inference system and extracted fuzzy rules were designed according to the optimization results in order that using the fuzzy inference system and providing instructions and rules the optimal water withdrawal amount for the next month can be predicted 2 study area astaneh kouchesfahan area in guilan province of iran is located on the sefidrud river alluvial fan fig 1 its area is approximately 2581 km2 the plain area is about 1300 km2 with an average altitude of 1281 m above sea level it is located between 36 44 37 28 n latitude and 49 15 50 11 e longitude the average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration in the plain are 1079 and 1000 mm respectively the study area is divided into six development units that are responsible for providing water to the aquifer the information of the water demands in this aquifer can be seen in table 1 the dominant cultivation of this area is rice but other products such as melon and peanuts are cultivated periodically according to the rice cultivation the irrigation program starts from april and ends in august the time and amount of irrigation varies depending on the growth of the agricultural products the major water demand is provided by the sefidrud dam the outflow volume from the sefidrud dam is diverted out of the area after water withdrawal through the fuman tunnel and galle rud diversion dam in the upstream of sangar diversion dam and through the right canal of the dam about 70 of the flow is diverted to the astaneh kouchesfahan study area and the rest to the lahijan and fumanat areas from the sangar diversion dam and through the left canal a flow is diverted to provide water supply for the astaneh kouchesfahan study area the aquifer is divided to left and right parts of sangar due to its large size and a part of fumanat area this ratio is about 70 for astaneh kouchesfahan area fig 1a the part of the water demand which cannot be provided by surface water is supplied through groundwater in the study area the level of groundwater is so high that in some areas of the aquifer groundwater evaporation is about 20 million m3 per year and several artificial drainage systems are considered in the northeast part of the region fig 1b the average water withdrawal from groundwater through drains is 120 million m3 per year in addition despite the abundant surface and groundwater resources there is a shortage of water resources in the agricultural seasons in order that in current water withdrawal situation in some years about 46 of water demand cannot be supplied by optimal conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in addition to providing water demand it will be possible to control the groundwater evaporation and the water discharge from the drainage by more water withdrawal from groundwater than the current situation and controlling the average groundwater level drop 3 methodology the stages of this research are shown as a flowchart in fig 2 firstly groundwater was simulated by gms software then from the groundwater simulation model the simulator approximation was extracted in the form of groundwater level drop withdrawal regression equations these equations were used as the constraints of the combined optimization model to control the groundwater amount the fully fuzzy optimization model was evaluated in two different ways in the following from the optimization model a fuzzy inference system fis was developed to predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal the input variables of the fuzzy inference system were groundwater level drop s variables at the end of the previous month and two months ago surface water at the beginning of current month and the beginning of the previous month and the water demand in current month input variables were applied by the inference system under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the best prediction performance in the aquifer water withdrawal these scenarios were different in the number of input variables the selected scenarios were also assessed using other types of fuzzy membership function the results of the optimization model were considered as control data to predict the optimal water withdrawal this was done to replace combined optimization models with an intelligent fuzzy inference model for optimal water withdrawal the selected scenario is able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and the optimization model can be replaced by it the rest of this section is dedicated to a description of the flowchart stages 3 1 groundwater simulation the astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer was simulated by modflow 2000 code using gms software hardaugh et al 2000 the modflow code is one of the most reliable and most widely used groundwater simulation codes which simulates underground flows based on finite difference methods hardaugh et al 2000 the aquifer thickness varied from 80 m to 260 m and the size of the cells was considered 500 500 the overall slope of the aquifer is from the south to the north therefore due to the aquifer slope the groundwater flows from the highlands to the caspian sea fig 3 a the borders of the aquifer entrance fronts are adjacent to the borders of the highlands fig 3b the outlet of the aquifer flows to the sea many rivers begin at highlands and pass through the aquifer to the caspian sea from which sefidrud is of great importance the rivers are in exchange with the aquifer in their route and play the role of charging or discharging the aquifer in the right part of the aquifer due to the high groundwater level and to prevent damages to agricultural products artificial drains have been provided as groundwater withdrawal units fig 3b evaporation of underground water occurs in parts of the aquifer where the groundwater level is less than 5 m from ground level therefore by considering a 5 m threshold in groundwater simulation the amount of evaporation was considered for parts of the aquifer which had a depth below 5 m the amount of charge to the aquifer from irrigation water varies according to the agricultural seasons for non agricultural months this amount is zero and for agricultural months the percentage is similar to the percentage of return water from wells 20 30 for drinking and industrial wells the amount of charge is about 60 75 also about 10 20 of the aquifer water charge belongs to precipitation in the studied aquifer artificial drainage of rivers and evaporation are also considered as aquifer charge discharge there are approximately 57 observation wells in the aquifer of which 50 observation wells were used for calibration in steady and unsteady states data of october 2010 was used to run the model in the steady state and from november 2010 to september 2012 for unsteady state in the monthly simulation of groundwater hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated in steady and unsteady states respectively 3 2 fuzzy optimization 3 2 1 the objective function the objective function is to minimize the shortage of water supply which is provided by surface water and groundwater the amount of surface water allocation is diverted to sangar right and left canals from the upstream of the sangar diversion dam about 30 of the water volume of each canal flows to lahijan and fumanat areas the objective function is to minimize the yearly water shortage eq 1 the optimization period was considered to be 20 years 1996 1997 to 2016 2017 and the model has been developed with monthly steps due to the presence of left and right canals and the large area of the case study the area was divided into two areas called the left sangar and right sangar 1 min z i 1 20 j 1 12 k l r d ijk sw ijk gw ijk where i is the number of the year in optimization period j is the number of the month in a year k is the number of the area right or left sangar d ijk is the water demand in the year i and the month j in the area j mcm s w ijk is the surface water withdrawal volume mcm and g w ijk is the groundwater withdrawal volume mcm 3 2 2 constraints according to the allowable groundwater level drop due to water withdrawal eq 2 the drop should not exceed the limit as this would result in a shortage of aquifer water volume it is necessary to explain that the results of groundwater simulation extracted in the form of regression equations will be substituted in eqs 2 and 3 2 a ijk gw ijk h ijk i j k where h ijk is the allowable amount of groundwater level drop in the year i the month j and the area k m pleasecheck is the fuzzy regression coefficient in the groundwater level drop water withdrawal equation according to the allowable rise in level eq 3 amount of the rise should also not exceed the limit as this would result in run offs and possible damage to the root of the plants 3 a ijk g w ijk h ijk i j k where h ijk is the allowable rise in level in the year i the month j and the area k m furthermore according to the maximum capacity of the canals eq 4 each of the left and right canals of sangar has the maximum water capacity which should be considered during the water allocation 4 sw ijk cp ijk i j k where c p ijk is the maximum capacity of the canals in the year i the month j and the area k mcm the total amount of water allocated to the left and right canals of the sangar should not be bigger than the water volume available by the sangar dam thus the total available water can be considered for the two canals eq 5 5 k l r sw ijk aw ij i j where a w ij is the volume of water available by the sangar diversion dam in the year i the month j and the area k the final constraint eq 6 is that the total volume of water allocated to the left or right canal and the groundwater resources of the left or right sangar should not exceed the water demand in the considered month and year 6 sw ijk gw ijk d ijk i j k the fully fuzzy optimization model was first converted into three explicit objective functions with respect to the left middle and right fuzzy bands using the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method the model was solved using the linear optimization simplex algorithm with gams software therefore decision variables were solved for each fuzzy band finally the crisp values of the results were obtained by centroid defuzzification in order to consider the uncertainty in the variables since the water demand values were not time series data they decreased and increased by 20 to create left and right fuzzy membership functions as their uncertainty bands due to the fact that about 70 of the total water behind the sangar divergent dam is allocated to the study area in order to consider maximum minimum and average uncertainty the amount of water resources during the studied 20 years was extracted and given these values the fuzzy membership functions of the surface water were determined 3 2 3 the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 solutions so far various methods have been proposed to convert a fully fuzzy model into a crisp model each of which has advantages and disadvantages lotfi et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 among the existing methods the methods introduced by kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 are used in this study the algorithm of the both methods is shown in fig 4 in the kumar et al 2010 method the objective function is ranked using the equation in table 2 and then the equations defuzzicated through the operators of table 2 and finally is solved by the gams software however in the jayalakshmi and pandian method 2012 in addition to the operators shown in table 2 the objective function was converted to three separate objective functions and each level is solved by the gams software considering the constraints shown in table 3 finally fuzzy functions in both methods were converted to the crisp state through the centroid defuzzification wang 1992 3 3 fuzzy inference system fuzzy inference system is based on if then rules in order that the input and output variables are connected to each other by these fuzzy rules therefore fuzzy inference system can be used as a prediction model for situations where input or output data has high uncertainty in order to determine the optimal groundwater withdrawal in each month a combined optimization model is needed to be developed for the desired period and its effect on groundwater should be assessed which is costly and time consuming therefore from the results of the optimization model several rules can be developed by fuzzy inference system to predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal in every month this can reduce the complexity of optimization and the developed intelligent system will be user friendly the data obtained from the optimization model input and output variables were divided into two groups training and test about 75 of the data were used for training and determination of fuzzy rules and 25 for the test in the training process the performance of the model was evaluated by the evaluation criteria described in section 3 4 and the rules with acceptable performance along with the fuzzy membership functions were selected for verification 3 4 evaluation criteria the performance of the scenarios was appraised based on coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae using eqs 7 9 respectively 7 r 2 1 i 1 n x p x o 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 8 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 2 1 n i 1 n x o 9 mae 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 where xo is the observed value xp is the predicted value and n is the number of samples the lower nrmse and mae and higher r2 the better performance of the model is 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater simulation results the water table of astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer is determined by 50 observation wells as control points scattered throughout the aquifer area the simulation of groundwater was performed in both steady and unsteady conditions and the hydraulic conductivity values in steady state and specific storage in unsteady state were calibrated fig 5 shows the aquifer wells after calibration in unsteady state and groundwater level in order to evaluate the performance of the model the nrmse and mae were 0 90 and 0 91 respectively in unsteady state the observed and computed groundwater level of the aquifer wells were then plotted which four of them is illustrated in fig 6 according to this figure the modflow code is able to simulate groundwater in the study area in fig 6 vertical axis of the plots shows the groundwater level as shown in this figure the difference between the observed and computed level is insignificant this indicates that the groundwater model has the capability of groundwater level prediction in steady state simulation of groundwater the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated initially the initial values of the hydraulic conductivity are calculated regarding the t k b equation where k is hydraulic conductivity m day b is the aquifer thickness m and t is the aquifer transformability m2 day and are given to the model and then calibrated further fig 7 a illustrates the hydraulic conductivity values in the study area which varies from 2 5 to 25 m day in some parts of the aquifer where the particles are coarse grains the hydraulic conductivity values are the highest in unsteady state the specific yield are calibrated these values vary from 3 to 25 in different parts of the aquifer and its variation follows the hydraulic conductivity values fig 7b 4 2 approximation of simulation model using linear regression recently the main simulator model has been approximated to create a relationship between the simulator and optimizer model and then the obtained approximate equation is used in optimization safavi et al 2010 this method will be much more useful in terms of costs and processing time this approximation was carried out using various methods the simplest method for approximating the main simulator model was linear regression in this study fuzzy linear regression has been used to approximate the results of the simulation model to do this after the calibration of the groundwater simulator model different water withdrawal volumes were applied to the model and the groundwater level drop was calculated simultaneously then the average amount of water level in the aquifer was obtained using thiessen polygons in order to obtain enough data for regression fitting about 100 water withdrawals with different volumes were applied to the model then the data was divided according to the amount of loss into three levels of low medium and high loss and for each level a regression equation was extracted in fact each level forms a fuzzy expression band and the regression slope and intercept are formed for the fuzzy bands in the following through the centroid defuzzification these fuzzy regression equations became crisp non fuzzy values the results of defuzzified regression equations and their evaluation criteria are presented in table 4 evaluation criteria show that the simulator approximation was able to predict the groundwater level drop or rise hi due to groundwater withdrawal qqw i in the i th month consequently these equations can be used in the constraints of the combined optimization model and to measure the aquifer response to the groundwater allocation 4 3 results of the fuzzy combined optimization model the optimization model was implemented for a period of 20 years from 1996 to 1997 to 2015 2016 the 20 year period was chosen such that it includes drought and wetness uniform periods then the fuzzy optimization model developed by the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods was solved using gams software the fuzzy results for the period of 20 years were extracted monthly for the left and right sangar and then they were defuzzified the results of the optimization model for the right and left sangar provided by kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods are illustrated in fig 8 referring to fig 8 the main supply of water is provided in both methods through surface water and groundwater serves as an auxiliary water source along with surface water to meet the water demand in fact the optimization model firstly uses the surface water to meet the water needs and if possible uses groundwater resources by considering the allowable groundwater level drop for this reason during june and august when there was enough surface water water demand was supplied by surface water however the greatest shortage in the right sangar was about 80 million m3 in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 while the water demand in current month was about 95 million m3 during this time the water shortage in the left sangar was about 17 million m3 while the water demand in this area was 206 million m3 in 2014 15 there was a water shortage about 54 million m3 while the water demand was 206 million m3 from fig 8 it should be noted that the higher allocation of surface water in the optimization model is for the left sangar in fact the optimization model firstly allocates the surface water to the left sangar and then to the right sangar the highest shortage in the left sangar was in may 2008 09 equal to 137 million m3 in the same time there is a shortage in the right sangar equal to 47 million m3 in this case the model first considered the surface water for the right sangar then allocates the remainder to the left sangar in the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method the most shortage in the right sangar was in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 which was equal to 80 million m3 while the water demand for current month was about 95 million m3 during the same time there was a shortage of about 17 million m3 in the left sangar while the water demand was 206 million m3 the highest shortage in the left sangar was in may 2008 09 equal to 135 million m3 in may 2013 14 and 2014 15 the optimization model firstly allocated water resources to the left sangar and used groundwater resources only to meet the water demand of the right sangar which is why about 80 million m3 of the 95 million m3 water demand about 84 was not provided in current month however in the left sangar 8 of the water demand was not provided in other words about 92 of the needs was supplied through the total surface water and groundwater in the other words from the 206 million m3 173 million m3 and 17 million m3 were provided through surface water and groundwater respectively although about 16 million m3 of water demand was not provided the surface water was not allocated to the right sangar and only 15 million m3 of groundwater was withdrawn to meet about 16 of the water demand every year during may we have faced a lot of shortages in comparison to other months because the water demand is high in current month furthermore the volume of surface water and the limitations that we had applied to groundwater limited supply sources so we face a water shortage in current month every year if we consider a higher allowable groundwater level drop for may compared with other months higher percentage of water demand will be provided in current month due to the fact that there is enough surface water in the month after may june and no groundwater is withdraw in current month due to the optimal allocation of the model this higher groundwater level drop will be compensated somewhat in the following month in june and july due to the presence of surface water resources which is more than water demand there were no water shortage in both sides of the sangar 4 3 1 comparison of the results of fuzzy optimization methods and current water withdrawal the optimization model was compared with the current water withdrawal and finally a suitable solution was selected current water withdrawal was obtained by available records for the 20 year optimization period the total annual water shortage for the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods and current water withdrawal are presented in fig 9 this figure shows that in the current water withdrawal during 1998 99 we saw the greatest water shortage in the total area which was equal to 413 million m3 and 46 of water demand was not provided this amount was calculated equal to 325 and 317 million m3 in the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which were 34 1 33 6 of the water demand respectively in 2011 12 a water shortage 47 million m3 was observed in current water withdrawal while 5 of water demand was not met this amount was calculated equal to 23 and 15 million m3 in the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which were 2 4 1 6 of the water demand respectively in the long term average studied 20 year period the average water shortage was equal to 215 148 and 138 million m3 according to current water withdrawal the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods which was 22 0 15 7 14 6 of the water demand respectively according to fig 9 the kumar et al 2010 and jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 methods as optimization techniques resulted in better performance compared with current water withdrawal in order that the water shortage in all years in these methods was less than current water withdrawal finally the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method provided better results than kumar et al 2010 fig 10 shows groundwater level in current water withdrawal and fuzzy optimization methods according to fig 10 over the studied years the groundwater level drop increased in some years groundwater level faced more groundwater level drop in combined optimization method compared to current water withdrawal in the years 1997 98 2000 01 and 2007 08 a higher groundwater level drop was observed in comparison with other years although this decrease in water level was observed both in the optimization models and in the current water withdrawal the decrement is larger for optimization methods the reason here is the higher allowable groundwater level drop water was considered in the optimization models in the three years mentioned above surface water is lower than other years in order that in 1998 99 the surface water was 393 million m3 while 65 9 of water demand was provided that the contribution of groundwater was about 25 the withdrawn groundwater was 235 million m3 in this year in the year 2000 01 the surface water was 493 million m3 while 70 0 of water demand was provided that the contribution of groundwater was 225 million m3 about 24 in 2008 09 the withdrawn groundwater was 230 million m3 which was equal to 24 5 of the water demand considering the climatic conditions of the study area where the high groundwater level evaporates from the ground surface and causes run offs the implementation of the combined optimization model reduces evaporation from ground level about 13 million m3 per year and reduces groundwater withdrawal from drainage by about 50 million m3 per year therefore several problems of the aquifer can be solved by utilizing the combined optimization model 4 4 results of the fuzzy inference model after implementation of the optimization model and analysis of its results the optimum groundwater withdrawal was predicted using fuzzy inference system based on the results of the optimization model the input variables of the predictive model were the amount of groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month a the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months b surface water at the beginning of current month c surface water at the beginning of the previous month d and the water demand at current month e the amount of groundwater withdrawal was the output parameter regarding the shape of membership functions since the two variables a and b were similar in nature and amount their range and the shape membership function were the same furthermore the range of these variables includes a negative part since the groundwater level drop and rise amounts were expressed with positive and negative signs respectively the membership functions for the variables a and b was considered low medium high and very high similarly since the two variables c and d were the same in the amount and nature the amount of zero to 320 million m3 of surface water per month is divided into five membership functions very low low medium high and very high the variable e which shows the water demand was divided into three membership functions low medium and high finally the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal which is the output variable has divided into five membership functions very low low medium high and very high respectively with a minimum value of zero and a maximum of 45 million m3 the shape of triangular fuzzy membership functions for the variables is presented in fig 11 the amount of groundwater withdrawal was constant in non agricultural months as well as the amount of surface water was zero in non agricultural months and water demand was also insignificant which was provided by groundwater therefore the fuzzy rules designing and the amount of groundwater withdrawal was only for agricultural months according to the predictive variables 9 scenarios were considered according to table 5 the number of fuzzy rules used in each scenario varied according to shape of the membership functions and the number of input variables for example for the second scenario where the number of predictive variables was two and four membership functions were considered for each variable 4 4 16 rules were considered in this scenario indeed fuzzy rules in scenarios with a low number of parameters such as scenarios 1 6 were obtained by multiplying the number of variables membership functions however in the last three scenarios scenarios 7 9 due to the existence of more predictive parameters it was needed to summarize many rules to avoid the development of a fis with a low accuracy so with respect to the parameters and their relative membership functions some rules were summed up to cover all the model requirements and to obtain acceptable results these rules were designed based on the results of the optimization model two examples of the rules in the second scenario are as follow a if the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month is high and the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months is high then groundwater withdrawal is low b if the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month is low and the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous two months is low then groundwater withdrawal is very high fig 12 shows these rules with the input and output variables of the fuzzy inference system table 6 summarizes the results of each scenarios with the evaluation criteria listed among the scenarios the fifth and sixth scenarios were selected for having appropriate evaluation criteria both selected scenarios had three input variables the input variables in the fifth scenario was the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago and the surface water at the beginning of current month moreover for the sixth scenario they were the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago and water demand at current month it can be concluded that with lower number of input variables the constructed scenario will be very simple and therefore the predictive model will have less accuracy for example none of single variable and two variables scenarios provided appropriate results if the number of input variables is large the number of applied rules will increase significantly and the model becomes more complicated the fifth and sixth scenarios are actually completed forms of the second and third scenarios by considering the value of surface water at the beginning of current month as an input variable to the second and third scenarios their accuracy has reached a satisfactory level therefore it can be concluded that the surface water resources play a significant role in predicting the amount of groundwater withdrawal in reality if there is more surface water the withdrawn water from groundwater will be less and vice versa water demand was also an important predictor because in some cases surface water may be high but we need more water which should be provided by groundwater considering the groundwater drop at the end of the previous month in fact three variables including groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month the surface water at current month and the water demand at current month had a more important role than the rest of the variables to evaluate the effects of the membership function shape other shapes of fuzzy membership functions were compared for the two selected scenarios beside triangle common fuzzy membership function shapes include trapezoid gaussian and bell shaped therefore these membership function for input and output variables is shown in fig 13 results of evaluation criteria with different fuzzy membership functions for the fifth and sixth scenarios is presented in tables 7 and 8 among different fuzzy membership functions for the fifth scenario triangular fuzzy membership function with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 92 nrmse of 0 22 and mae of 3 50 for training data had the highest performance these criteria were 0 93 0 35 and 4 1 for test data respectively in the sixth scenario triangular fuzzy membership function resulted in a coefficient of determination equal to 0 92 nrmse of 0 21 and mae of 3 20 for training data had the highest performance these criteria were 0 94 0 28 and 4 1 for test data respectively as a result the triangular fuzzy membership was the most appropriate membership function for the fifth and sixth scenarios consequently using the fifth or sixth scenario with triangular fuzzy membership function the fuzzy inference system can predict the optimal groundwater withdrawal fig 14 in this situation fuzzy inference system can replace the combined optimization model for groundwater withdrawal 5 conclusions in this study a new approach is introduced for optimal conjunctive surface and ground water use applying fully fuzzy optimization and fuzzy inference system fully fuzzy optimization was used for optimal water withdrawal and fuzzy inference system was used to predict the optimal aquifer water withdrawal the results of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the average annual water shortage in the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method was lower than that of kumar et al 2010 as a result the jayalakshmi and pandian 2012 method is more appropriate for fully fuzzy combined optimization model than kumar et al 2010 method 2 in the fuzzy conjunctive use based on both methods the shortage of water resources was much lower than the current water withdrawal which shows the importance of the conjunctive use during the studied period 3 implementing the combined optimization model decreased groundwater evaporation about 13 million m3 per year and reduced groundwater withdrawal from drainage by about 50 million m3 per year in order to eliminate the problem of run offs and evaporation from groundwater 4 in the fuzzy rules designing scenarios with three input variables in the form of triangular membership functions performed the best prediction scenarios with lower input variables single variable and two variables scenarios resulted in the lowest performance because of their simplicity and not considering the actual conditions 5 fifth and sixth scenarios provided highest performance using predictive variables of the groundwater level drop at the end of the previous month and two months ago available surface water resources at current month and water demand at current month 6 fuzzy inference system had the ability to predict groundwater withdrawal based on the results of fuzzy optimization model generally the method presented in this study can help managers and stakeholders for better planning of surface and groundwater use and it can be evaluated in other study areas 
6954,water flow along or across the interfaces of contrasting materials is ubiquitous in hydrology and how to solve them in macroscopic models derived from volumetric average of the pore scale processes remains elusive while the change in the average velocity and pressure at water sediment interface has been well established for channel flow over porous beds whether a volumetric average alerts the pressure continuity when water flows across the interface of two porous materials is poorly understood despite its imperative implications in hydrological modelling the primary purpose of this paper is to provide evidences via pore scale simulations that volumetrically averaging the pore scale processes indeed yields a discontinuous pressure when water flows across a material interface we simulated two columns numerically reconstructed by filling them with stratified media one is an idealised two layer system and the other one is a 3d column filled by fine glass beads over coarse glass beads with their pore geometry acquired using x ray computed tomography the pore scale simulation is to mimic the column experiment by driving fluid to flow through the void space under an externally imposed pressure gradient once fluid flow reaches steady state its velocity and pressure in all voxels are sampled and they are then spatially averaged over each section perpendicular to the average flow direction the results show that the average pressure drops abruptly at the material interface no matter which direction the fluid flows compared with the effective permeability estimated from the homogenization methods well established in the literature the emerged discontinuous pressure at the interface reduces the combined ability of the two strata to conduct water it is also found that under certain circumstances fluid flow is direction dependant moving faster when flowing in the fine coarse direction than in the coarse to fine direction under the same pressure gradient although significant efforts are needed to incorporate these findings into practical models we do elicit the emergence of discontinuous pressure at material interface due to volumetric average as well as its consequent implications in modelling of flow in heterogeneous and stratified media keywords homogenization stratified media pore scale modelling pressure discontinuity upscaling 1 introduction water flow over or cross the interfaces of different materials is ubiquitous in both surface and subsurface hydrology and how to solve them is an issue that still attracts interest in modelling of flow in heterogeneous and stratified media strack 2017 physically the microscopic water pressure and velocity are continuous and there is no interface between the pore spaces in different materials in practical models for large scales however the delicate pore scale processes cannot be explicitly resolved and they are instead volumetrically averaged with the impact of the porous structure described by effective parameters such as permeability for fluid flow and dispersion coefficient for solute transport simunek et al 2003 material interfaces emerge as a result and need to be treated explicitly when solving for the volumetric average flow rate and pressure while mass conservation requires the average flow rate across the interfaces to be continuous there are no physical criteria for the average pressure to meet therefore it has long been speculated that a volumetric average could render what are continuous at pore space discontinuous at macroscopic scales berkowitz et al 2009 for example it has been found in channel flow over porous bed that the velocity jumps at the water sediment interface as evidenced from experimental data that compared to water flow over an impermeable bed a porous bed could greatly enhance the flow rate beavers and joseph 1967 beavers and joseph 1967 derived a formula to describe this velocity jump which known as beavers joseph model in the literate since nield 2016 has been used to simulate flows involving fluid sediment interfaces such as water flow in karst aquifers hu et al 2012 early applications of the beavers joseph model assumed a continuous pressure around the interface sahraoui and kaviany 1992 but recent work has revealed that this might not be true for example numerical simulations showed that the pressure at the water sediment interface is continuous only when the sediment is isotropic and becomes discontinuous if the sediment is anisotropic carraro et al 2013 for water infiltration into a sand bed from channel it was also found that the average pressure could become discontinuous carraro et al 2015 the aforementioned efforts were for channel flow over sediment beds with water flow in the sediments described by the darcy law for heterogeneous and stratified soils and aquifers water can move either along or across the interfaces of different materials how the pressure changes across such interfaces remains elusive and is poorly documented nick and matthai 2011 a common conjecture in most macroscopic models is that given that the fluid pressure in void space is continuous a volumetric average of the pore scale processes should not alter this continuity gohardoust et al 2017 this is the key assumption used in most homogenization methods such as the wavelet transformation method king 1989 moslehi et al 2016 to estimate the effective permeability of heterogeneous and stratified porous formations for example it has been well established and routinely used that the effective permeability of a saturated layered system equals to the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean of the individual permeability of each layer for flow parallel and perpendicular to the layers respectively mualem 1984 these were proven even applicable to estimate effective permeability of unsaturated stratified soils if the individual layers are not too thick yeh et al 1985 it is worth pointing out that the above conclusion is valid only if the pressure at the strata interfaces is continuous which has yet been proven to the contrary theoretical analysis of immiscible flow suggested a discontinuous pressure at material interface hassanizadeh and gray 1989 but evidences proving or disapproving such a discontinuity are lack even for single phase flow due to the difficulty associated with measuring fluid pressure on each side of a material interface in the meantime experimental and theoretical studies on chemical transport in stratified media have both found a mass accumulation when solute moves across material interfaces suggesting existence of a discontinuous concentration which renders chemical transport in stratified media direction dependant berkowitz et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 efforts have been made on how to incorporate such discontinuities into macroscopic model for solute transport by assuming the concentration discontinuity is solely caused by permeability difference in the strata zoia et al 2010 this is at odds with some pore scale simulations which showed that knowing the permeability difference alone is insufficient to quantity the concentration discontinuity and that it is the pore geometry of the adjacent strata that controls how the concentration changes in the proximity of their interface zhang et al 2010 given the importance of pressure continuity in modelling fluid flow in heterogeneous and stratified media and the difficulty of experimentally measuring it we investigated the pressure change across material interface via pore scale modelling in this paper we considered single phase flow and the pore scale simulations were to mimic column experiment by driving the fluid to flow under an externally imposed pressure gradient we simulated two columns with each packed by a fine medium and a coarse medium the first one was an idealised stratified column with a high porosity and the second one was a 3d column acquired using x ray computed tomography in each simulation when fluid flow was deemed to have reached steady state we sampled the fluid pressure and the velocity in each voxel and then spatially averaged them cross the sections perpendicular to the average flow direction considering that solute transport in two layer system had been found to be directionally dependant for each column we also simulated fluid flow in the fine coarse direction and the coarse fine direction respectively in attempts to examine if fluid flow in the two layer columns was also direction dependant 2 pore scale simulations the pore scale modelling is to test the conjecture that the pressure is continuous at material interfaces after a volumetric average figs 1a 3a show the two stratified systems we studied the first one is an idealised 2d column with high porosity and the second one is a column filled with fine glass beads and coarse glass beads the fine glass beads layer was acquired using x ray tomography and the coarse one was reconstructed numerically by enlarging the size of all fine glass beads and the pores between them two times equally in all directions chen et al 2009 chen et al 2008 the pore scale simulation is to mimic column experiment by driving fluid to flow under a pressure gradient imposed externally at the two ends of the columns fluid flow in the pore geometry is assumed to be laminar and described by the navier stokes equation it is simulated using the multiple relaxation time lattice boltzmann model as follows d humieres et al 2002 1 f i x δ t e i t δ t f i x t m 1 s m f i eq x t f i x t where f i x t is the particle distribution function at location x and time t moving at lattice velocity e i δx is the size of the voxels in the image δt is time step f i eq x t is equilibrium distribution function m is a transform matrix and s is the collision matrix the product mf in eq 1 transforms the particle distribution functions to a moment space in which the collision operation m s m f i eq x t f i x t is performed the post collision result in the moment space is then transformed back to particle distribution functions by m 1 m we use the d3q19 lattice model in this paper where the particle

is in steady state zou et al 1995 the bulk fluid density ρ and velocity u are updated after each time step by 4 ρ i 0 18 f i ρ 0 u i 1 18 f i e i implementation of the above model consists of two steps to advance one time step the first one is to calculate the collision in the moment space and then transform the results back to particle distribution functions i e to calculate f i f i x t m 1 s

hits a solid voxel it is bounced back to where it was before the streaming to give a non slip boundary where the bulk fluid velocity is zero in each simulation once flow is deemed to have reached steady state we sample fluid pressure and velocity at each voxel and then average them across each y z section as shown in fig 3a as follows 5 p x i 1 n xy p x y i z i n xy q x i 1 n xy u x x y i z i where nyz is the number of fluid voxels in the y z section located at x p x y i z i and u x x y i z i is the pressure and velocity component at voxel located at x yi zi respectively we also calculate the effective permeability of the column based on the simulated velocity field from 6 k μ ng i 1 n u x x i y i z i where k is the effective permeability n is the number of voxels including all solid and void voxels u x x i y i z i is the velocity component in the voxel centred at xi yi zi and g is the externally imposed pressure gradient along the column in addition to the effective permeability of the stratified media we also calculate the permeability of the fine and the coarse medium separately within each column shown in figs 1a 3a 3 result analysis after the above volumetric average the pore scale flow process in each of the columns is simplified as a one dimensional macroscopic flow as illustrated in fig 4 the two layer system can be further homogenized using an effective permeability to describe their combined ability to conduct water if the hydraulic conductivity of soil 1 and soil 2 is k 1 and k 2 and their thickness is l 1 and l 2 respectively the effective hydraulic conductivity k of the two soils can be estimated as follows if the pressure at their interface is continuous mualem 1984 7 l 1 l 2 k l 1 k 1 l 2 k 2 for the two examples studied in this work l 1 l 2 and the effective hydraulic conductivity is hence k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 we will call the permeability calculated from eq 7 theoretical permeability and compare it with those calculated directly from the pore scale simulations for ease of analysing the simulated results in what follows the space will be normalized to x x δ x time to t t μ δ x 2 density to ρ ρ ρ w and pressure to p p δ t 2 δ x 2 ρ w where ρw is the density of liquid water 3 1 the idealised 2d column figure 1b shows the average pressure distributions along the column for fluid flow in the fine coarse direction and the coarse fine direction respectively it is evident that the pressure is not continuous but endures an abrupt drop at the interface no matter which direction the fluid flowed except at the interface the pressure is continuous and approximately linearly distributed within each of the two strata in the column fig 1c plots the average flow rate along the column calculated from the pore scale simulations when the fluid flowed in the two opposite directions the figure shows that under the same pressure gradient the flow rate is higher when the fluid flowed in the fine coarse direction than in the coarse fine direction due to the energy loss and pressure drop across the interface the real effective permeability of the two soils calculated from pore scale simulations is smaller than estimated from eq 7 table 1 compares the results emergence of the discontinuous pressure at the interface reduced the effective permeability to 8 49 when the fluid flowed in the coarse fine direction and to 8 63 when it flowed in the fine coarse direction compared to the theoretical 9 08 when the pressure is assumed to be continuous the above example is for stratified media with a sharp cut interface stratified geological formations formed naturally usually have transition interfaces where the coarse medium in the proximity of the interface might contain some small size particles to elucidate how pressure changes in stratified media with such interfaces we simulated fluid flow in an idealized image shown in fig 2a the average pressure distribution calculated along the column is shown in fig 2b strictly speaking the pressure is more continuous compared to the example shown in fig 1a but it still endured a sharp change and such change cannot be described by eq 7 that assumes the pressure is continuous 3 2 the 3d column the porosity of both the fine and the coarse strata in the 3d column is approximately 37 much less than the porosity of the 2d idealised column fig 3b shows the average pressure distribution along the column when the fluid flowed in the fine coarse and the coarse fine directions compared to the 2d columns the pressure drop across the interface in the 3d column is more significant no matter which direction the fluid flowed probably because the 3d image is less porous and the energy loss thus the pressure drop associated with the flow through it is more significant than that in the 2d idealised example the key result in this example is that the pressure drop is approximately the same regardless of flow direction the example shown in fig 3b is for flow under pressure gradient of 0 0013 and the pressure drop over the interface is 0 056 again because the energy loss over the interface is almost the same when fluid flow in different directions their associated permeability is also comparable as shown in table 1 strictly speaking however the permeability calculated from the pore scale simulation for flow in the fine coarse direction is still higher than that in the coarse fine direction consistent with the results obtained from the 2d column physically the average macroscopic pressure at the strata interface should be continuous when fluid is stagnant and the pressure drop at the interface is hence solely caused by fluid flow it is therefore natural to examine how the pressure drop responds to flow rate fig 5 shows the change in the pressure drop as the average flow rate increases the pressure drop δp increases parabolically with the average flow rate q because of the pressure drop and energy loss over the interface the permeability calculated from the pore scale simulations decreases as the average flow rate increases as shown in fig 5 4 discussion and conclusions pore scale simulations of water flow in idealised 2d columns and a 3d column obtained using x ray tomography both revealed that volumetrically averaging the pore scale process resulted in a macroscopic pressure that is discontinuous at the material interface in the columns the emerged discontinuous pressure means extra energy loss and as a result reduces the combined ability of the two strata to conduct water compared to the prediction from the classical homogenization methods that assume a continuous pressure at the material interface the magnitude of the pressure drop across the interface varies with physical properties of the materials as well as water flow rate across the column for the columns we simulated the pressure drop increases parabolically with water flow rate furthermore depending on physical properties of the strata water flow could even become direction dependant in that water moved faster when flowing the fine coarse direction than in the coarse fine direction we also found that a sharp pressure drop existed even for transitional interface in which the coarse medium near the interface contains some small particles early study on channel flow over sediment bed has shown that the change in macroscopic pressure across the water sediment interface depended on the sediment being continuous if the sediment is isotropic and discontinuous if the sediment was anisotropic carraro et al 2013 marciniak czochra and mikelic 2012 our simulations suggested that this conclusion appear to be valid only for channel flow in parallel with sand bed and break down when water flows across the interface of two porous materials for water flow across material interface the mass conservation requires that the average flow rate calculated from eq 5 must be a constant along the column physically the pressure drop at the interface is the consequence of energy loss caused by viscous friction which increases with velocity the viscous friction depends on the water wall interfacial areas which differ in the fine and coarse media because the specific surface area in the former is bigger than that in the latter for the 3d column the porosity of the coarse and the fine medium shown in fig 3a is approximately the same and the average pore velocity in them is hence also the same as such under the same externally imposed pressure gradient the pressure drop in the 3d column is independent of flow direction as shown in fig 3b in contrast the porosity of the two media in figs 1a and 2a differs slightly and consequently the average pore water velocity in them is different therefore apart from energy loss caused by viscous friction inertial dissipation due to the abrupt increase or decrease in pore water velocity might also play a role in inducing the pressure drop theoretically the relative significance of the energy loss caused by viscous friction and inertial dissipation depends on flow rate however since water flow in porous materials is viscous in all columns we simulated the energy loss is dominated by viscous friction and the pressure drop is hence independent or only slightly dependant of flow direction as evidenced from the simulated results fluid flow in the proximity of material interfaces is ubiquitous in hydrology but complicated to be described the results presented in this paper might improve our understanding of water flow in heterogeneous and stratified media but incorporating them into macroscopic models needs substantial efforts even though numerical models capable of dealing with discontinuous pressure at material interfaces exist nick and matthai 2011 the challenge lies in that the pressure drop across the interface depends not only on material properties and flow rate but also on the flow direction quantifying these processes and then incorporating them into macroscopic models is not trivial especially when flow is transient kitanidis 1990 given these challenges assuming a continuous pressure at the material interface is postulated to be the dominant approach in the foreseeable future for modelling flow in heterogeneous and stratified media because of its simplicity in implementation especially for unsaturated flow which is far more complicated than saturated flow even under steady flow condition pruess 2004 notwithstanding these this work still has an important implication as it provides evidence that spatial average or upscaling does result in a discontinuous pressure at material interfaces and that the commonly used homogenization methods for estimating effective permeability and for calculating flow across material interfaces in heterogeneous and stratified porous formations could give rise to errors the significance of the errors depend on media property and flow rate and direction acknowledgements the

interfaces remains elusive and is poorly documented nick and matthai 2011 a common conjecture in most macroscopic models is that given that the fluid pressure in void space is continuous a volumetric average of the pore scale processes should not alter this continuity gohardoust et al 2017 this is the key assumption used in most homogenization methods such as the wavelet transformation method king 1989 moslehi et al 2016 to estimate the effective permeability of heterogeneous and stratified porous formations for example it has been well established and routinely used that the effective permeability of a saturated layered system equals to the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean of the individual permeability of each layer for flow parallel and perpendicular to the layers respectively mualem 1984 these were proven even applicable to estimate effective permeability of unsaturated stratified soils if the individual layers are not too thick yeh et al 1985 it is worth pointing out that the above conclusion is valid only if the pressure at the strata interfaces is continuous which has yet been proven to the contrary theoretical analysis of immiscible flow suggested a discontinuous pressure at material interface hassanizadeh and gray 1989 but evidences proving or disapproving such a discontinuity are lack even for single phase flow due to the difficulty associated with measuring fluid pressure on each side of a material interface in the meantime experimental and theoretical studies on chemical transport in stratified media have both found a mass accumulation when solute moves across material interfaces suggesting existence of a discontinuous concentration which renders chemical transport in stratified media direction dependant berkowitz et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 efforts have been made on how to incorporate such discontinuities into macroscopic model for solute transport by assuming the concentration discontinuity is solely caused by permeability difference in the strata zoia et al 2010 this is at odds with some pore scale simulations which showed that knowing the permeability difference alone is insufficient to quantity the concentration discontinuity and that it is the pore geometry of the adjacent strata that controls how the concentration changes in the proximity of their interface zhang et al 2010 given the importance of pressure continuity in modelling fluid flow in heterogeneous and stratified media and the difficulty of experimentally measuring it we investigated the pressure change across material interface via pore scale modelling in this paper we considered single phase flow and the pore scale simulations were to mimic column experiment by driving the fluid to flow under an externally imposed pressure gradient we simulated two columns with each packed by a fine medium and a coarse medium the first one was an idealised stratified column with a high porosity and the second one was a 3d column acquired using x ray computed tomography in each simulation when fluid flow was deemed to have reached steady state we sampled the fluid pressure and the velocity in each voxel and then spatially averaged them cross the sections perpendicular to the average flow direction considering that solute transport in two layer system had been found to be directionally dependant for each column we also simulated fluid flow in the fine coarse direction and the coarse fine direction respectively in attempts to examine if fluid flow in the two layer columns was also direction dependant 2 pore scale simulations the pore scale modelling is to test the conjecture that the pressure is continuous at material interfaces after a volumetric average figs 1a 3a show the two stratified systems we studied the first one is an idealised 2d column with high porosity and the second one is a column filled with fine glass beads and coarse glass beads the fine glass beads layer was acquired using x ray tomography and the coarse one was reconstructed numerically by enlarging the size of all fine glass beads and the pores between them two times equally in all directions chen et al 2009 chen et al 2008 the pore scale simulation is to mimic column experiment by driving fluid to flow under a pressure gradient imposed externally at the two ends of the columns fluid flow in the pore geometry is assumed to be laminar and described by the navier stokes equation it is simulated using the multiple relaxation time lattice boltzmann model as follows d humieres et al 2002 1 f i x δ t e i t δ t f i x t m 1 s m f i eq x t f i x t where f i x t is the particle distribution function at location x and time t moving at lattice velocity e i δx is the size of the voxels in the image δt is time step f i eq x t is equilibrium distribution function m is a transform matrix and s is the collision matrix the product mf in eq 1 transforms the particle distribution functions to a moment space in which the collision operation m s m f i eq x t f i x t is performed the post collision result in the moment space is then transformed back to particle distribution functions by m 1 m we use the d3q19 lattice model in this paper where the particle

hits a solid voxel it is bounced back to where it was before the streaming to give a non slip boundary where the bulk fluid velocity is zero in each simulation once flow is deemed to have reached steady state we sample fluid pressure and velocity at each voxel and then average them across each y z section as shown in fig 3a as follows 5 p x i 1 n xy p x y i z i n xy q x i 1 n xy u x x y i z i where nyz is the number of fluid voxels in the y z section located at x p x y i z i and u x x y i z i is the pressure and velocity component at voxel located at x yi zi respectively we also calculate the effective permeability of the column based on the simulated velocity field from 6 k μ ng i 1 n u x x i y i z i where k is the effective permeability n is the number of voxels including all solid and void voxels u x x i y i z i is the velocity component in the voxel centred at xi yi zi and g is the externally imposed pressure gradient along the column in addition to the effective permeability of the stratified media we also calculate the permeability of the fine and the coarse medium separately within each column shown in figs 1a 3a 3 result analysis after the above volumetric average the pore scale flow process in each of the columns is simplified as a one dimensional macroscopic flow as illustrated in fig 4 the two layer system can be further homogenized using an effective permeability to describe their combined ability to conduct water if the hydraulic conductivity of soil 1 and soil 2 is k 1 and k 2 and their thickness is l 1 and l 2 respectively the effective hydraulic conductivity k of the two soils can be estimated as follows if the pressure at their interface is continuous mualem 1984 7 l 1 l 2 k l 1 k 1 l 2 k 2 for the two examples studied in this work l 1 l 2 and the effective hydraulic conductivity is hence k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 we will call the permeability calculated from eq 7 theoretical permeability and compare it with those calculated directly from the pore scale simulations for ease of analysing the simulated results in what follows the space will be normalized to x x δ x time to t t μ δ x 2 density to ρ ρ ρ w and pressure to p p δ t 2 δ x 2 ρ w where ρw is the density of liquid water 3 1 the idealised 2d column figure 1b shows the average pressure distributions along the column for fluid flow in the fine coarse direction and the coarse fine direction respectively it is evident that the pressure is not continuous but endures an abrupt drop at the interface no matter which direction the fluid flowed except at the interface the pressure is continuous and approximately linearly distributed within each of the two strata in the column fig 1c plots the average flow rate along the column calculated from the pore scale simulations when the fluid flowed in the two opposite directions the figure shows that under the same pressure gradient the flow rate is higher when the fluid flowed in the fine coarse direction than in the coarse fine direction due to the energy loss and pressure drop across the interface the real effective permeability of the two soils calculated from pore scale simulations is smaller than estimated from eq 7 table 1 compares the results emergence of the discontinuous pressure at the interface reduced the effective permeability to 8 49 when the fluid flowed in the coarse fine direction and to 8 63 when it flowed in the fine coarse direction compared to the theoretical 9 08 when the pressure is assumed to be continuous the above example is for stratified media with a sharp cut interface stratified geological formations formed naturally usually have transition interfaces where the coarse medium in the proximity of the interface might contain some small size particles to elucidate how pressure changes in stratified media with such interfaces we simulated fluid flow in an idealized image shown in fig 2a the average pressure distribution calculated along the column is shown in fig 2b strictly speaking the pressure is more continuous compared to the example shown in fig 1a but it still endured a sharp change and such change cannot be described by eq 7 that assumes the pressure is continuous 3 2 the 3d column the porosity of both the fine and the coarse strata in the 3d column is approximately 37 much less than the porosity of the 2d idealised column fig 3b shows the average pressure distribution along the column when the fluid flowed in the fine coarse and the coarse fine directions compared to the 2d columns the pressure drop across the interface in the 3d column is more significant no matter which direction the fluid flowed probably because the 3d image is less porous and the energy loss thus the pressure drop associated with the flow through it is more significant than that in the 2d idealised example the key result in this example is that the pressure drop is approximately the same regardless of flow direction the example shown in fig 3b is for flow under pressure gradient of 0 0013 and the pressure drop over the interface is 0 056 again because the energy loss over the interface is almost the same when fluid flow in different directions their associated permeability is also comparable as shown in table 1 strictly speaking however the permeability calculated from the pore scale simulation for flow in the fine coarse direction is still higher than that in the coarse fine direction consistent with the results obtained from the 2d column physically the average macroscopic pressure at the strata interface should be continuous when fluid is stagnant and the pressure drop at the interface is hence solely caused by fluid flow it is therefore natural to examine how the pressure drop responds to flow rate fig 5 shows the change in the pressure drop as the average flow rate increases the pressure drop δp increases parabolically with the average flow rate q because of the pressure drop and energy loss over the interface the permeability calculated from the pore scale simulations decreases as the average flow rate increases as shown in fig 5 4 discussion and conclusions pore scale simulations of water flow in idealised 2d columns and a 3d column obtained using x ray tomography both revealed that volumetrically averaging the pore scale process resulted in a macroscopic pressure that is discontinuous at the material interface in the columns the emerged discontinuous pressure means extra energy loss and as a result reduces the combined ability of the two strata to conduct water compared to the prediction from the classical homogenization methods that assume a continuous pressure at the material interface the magnitude of the pressure drop across the interface varies with physical properties of the materials as well as water flow rate across the column for the columns we simulated the pressure drop increases parabolically with water flow rate furthermore depending on physical properties of the strata water flow could even become direction dependant in that water moved faster when flowing the fine coarse direction than in the coarse fine direction we also found that a sharp pressure drop existed even for transitional interface in which the coarse medium near the interface contains some small particles early study on channel flow over sediment bed has shown that the change in macroscopic pressure across the water sediment interface depended on the sediment being continuous if the sediment is isotropic and discontinuous if the sediment was anisotropic carraro et al 2013 marciniak czochra and mikelic 2012 our simulations suggested that this conclusion appear to be valid only for channel flow in parallel with sand bed and break down when water flows across the interface of two porous materials for water flow across material interface the mass conservation requires that the average flow rate calculated from eq 5 must be a constant along the column physically the pressure drop at the interface is the consequence of energy loss caused by viscous friction which increases with velocity the viscous friction depends on the water wall interfacial areas which differ in the fine and coarse media because the specific surface area in the former is bigger than that in the latter for the 3d column the porosity of the coarse and the fine medium shown in fig 3a is approximately the same and the average pore velocity in them is hence also the same as such under the same externally imposed pressure gradient the pressure drop in the 3d column is independent of flow direction as shown in fig 3b in contrast the porosity of the two media in figs 1a and 2a differs slightly and consequently the average pore water velocity in them is different therefore apart from energy loss caused by viscous friction inertial dissipation due to the abrupt increase or decrease in pore water velocity might also play a role in inducing the pressure drop theoretically the relative significance of the energy loss caused by viscous friction and inertial dissipation depends on flow rate however since water flow in porous materials is viscous in all columns we simulated the energy loss is dominated by viscous friction and the pressure drop is hence independent or only slightly dependant of flow direction as evidenced from the simulated results fluid flow in the proximity of material interfaces is ubiquitous in hydrology but complicated to be described the results presented in this paper might improve our understanding of water flow in heterogeneous and stratified media but incorporating them into macroscopic models needs substantial efforts even though numerical models capable of dealing with discontinuous pressure at material interfaces exist nick and matthai 2011 the challenge lies in that the pressure drop across the interface depends not only on material properties and flow rate but also on the flow direction quantifying these processes and then incorporating them into macroscopic models is not trivial especially when flow is transient kitanidis 1990 given these challenges assuming a continuous pressure at the material interface is postulated to be the dominant approach in the foreseeable future for modelling flow in heterogeneous and stratified media because of its simplicity in implementation especially for unsaturated flow which is far more complicated than saturated flow even under steady flow condition pruess 2004 notwithstanding these this work still has an important implication as it provides evidence that spatial average or upscaling does result in a discontinuous pressure at material interfaces and that the commonly used homogenization methods for estimating effective permeability and for calculating flow across material interfaces in heterogeneous and stratified porous formations could give rise to errors the significance of the errors depend on media property and flow rate and direction acknowledgements the
