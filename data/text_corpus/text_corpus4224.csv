engineering to investigate its seismic response the ccpf model with 2 2 and 3 3 pile groups embedded in homogeneous clayey silt or layered soil consisting of dry sand underlain by clayey silt were employed these being representative of different pile configurations and soil conditions respectively with the superstructure simplified as lumped mass and connecting column the horizontal acceleration and lateral displacement of the soil and superstructure as well as bending moment of piles were recorded during seismic shaking due to the complex soil ccpf structure interaction the composite caisson piles foundation with the two type pile groups in homogeneous or layered soil exhibited quite different behaviors under earthquake loading these centrifuge test results indicated that both soil condition and pile configuration played an important role in the seismic response of the ccpf and future studies combining experimental and numerical simulation should be conducted to

foundation ccpf was proposed in the pre construction investigation report for the highway channel across the qiongzhou straits in south china sea as suggested in the report the ccpf can be constructed

excitations furthermore zhong and huang 2014b originally performed dynamic centrifuge tests on the seismic response of the composite caisson 2 2 piles foundation in homogeneous sandy silt and the results also indicate that adding piles under the caisson could decrease the earthquake responses of both the foundation and structure still further experimental studies on this aspect are required to investigate more influential factors such as different pile configurations under the caisson and layered soil around the caisson in the present study a series of centrifuge shaking table tests were performed in the tongji university to advance the understanding of the dynamic response of the composite caisson piles foundation to earthquake waves the ccpf models with two different pile

was simplified as lumped mass and connecting column the chi chi earthquake wave which is of abundant frequency components was employed as the input motion the study aimed at monitoring the response of

clayey silt may be commonly encountered in practice of bridge foundation engineering naesgaard et al 2012 ng et al 2015 conti et al 2020 the dry sand and clayey silt obtained from the site in shanghai whose properties are familiar to the scholars and engineers and have been widely reported in the available literature e g xu et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2014 shen et al 2014 are selected to simulate the homogeneous or layered model soils for the ccpf specifically the sand used in the experiments is a dry and poorly graded sand with a non uniformity coefficient c u of 2 69 a curvature coefficient c c of 0 97 and a relative density d r of approximately 70 achieved through carefully controlled pluviation process moreover the clayey silt employed in the tests is a grey clayey silt of layer no 2 in shanghai with the specific penetration resistance p s of 2 25 and the standard penetration numbers n of 6 and similar properties of this kind of soil can also be found in xu et al 2011 2015 liu et al 2014 shen et al 2014 more detailed mechanical and physical properties of the sand and clayey silt used in study are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively and after the construction of homogeneous clayey silt or layered soil consisting of dry sand underlain by clayey silt the model is subjected to 2 h pre consolidation under a 50g gravity field 2 2 model geometry and instrumentation a caisson and a pile group rigidly connected to the caisson are installed in the homogeneous or layered soil stratum to form the ccpf model with different arrangements and numberings of piles shown in fig 1 and the superstructure installed on top of the ccpf is simplified as lumped mass and connecting columns the ccpf and the superstructure model are made of aluminum alloy with young s modulus of 70 gpa and with density of 2 7 g cm3 dimensions of the aluminum alloy test model for simulating concrete and steel as the prototype material are shown in table 3 calculated in accordance with the geometric scaling factor of 50 schofield 1980 bolton et al 1999 iai et al 2005 in addition the pile space in the 2 2 and 3 3 pile groups under the caisson are 3 6 and 2 4 times of the pile diameters respectively as shown in fig 1 the ccpf has plan dimensions of d 4 5 m d is the diameter of caisson accounting for only a fifth of the shear container length in the shaking direction and thus covering about 3 of the soil surface in plan according to ullah et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a ha et al 2019 yang et al 2019 fallahzadeh et al 2019 and liang et al 2020 the boundary effects can be ignored to some extent or deemed to be within reasonable limits an instrumentation system is applied as illustrated in fig 1 to observe the seismic response of the physical model in terms of horizontal acceleration and displacement recorded at different points as well as variations of bending moment along the piles specifically four accelerometers are placed at different locations for recording horizontal acceleration time history during the shaking event the input horizontal acceleration applied to the model is measured by installing acc1 at the bottom of soil acc2 and acc3 record the horizontal acceleration response at the soil near the caisson piles interface the layer interface and the surface respectively also signal recorded by acc4 is considered as the superstructure response three linear variable differential transformers lvdts transducers are horizontally installed to continuously scan the time history of horizontal displacement of soil from different depths and one oriented laser lvdt is fixed at a support frame above the soil container for measuring the horizontal displacement of superstructure during the shaking event in order to investigate the spatial variations of bending strain induced in the model pile in the group 4 pairs of strain gauges g1 g4 are installed at the top of pile 1 pile2 pile3 and pile4 of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups in the form of the half bridge meanwhile 4 pairs of half bridge circuited strain gauges g4 g7 are also installed on the surface of one pile pile4 of the ccpf model with 2 2 3 3 pile groups at four levels to record the bending strain along the pile the exact places where strain gauges are installed can be seen in fig 1 and then the bending moment of the pile generated at each level during an earthquake can be calculated from the strain as below 1 m p ε p e i y where m p is the bending moment of the pile ei is the rotational stiffness ε p is the bending strain at the outer fiber of the pile cross section y is the distance from the neutral axis to farthest fiber in the cross section i e radius of model pile note that ei y of the model pile is previously determined in a point loading test mashhoud et al 2018 2 3 experimental program and applied ground motions the seismic soil ccpf structure interaction centrifuge tests performed in this study comprise different permutations of the pile configurations and soil conditions as listed in table 4 in total 4 centrifuge tests are carried out specifically test01 and test03 are designed in order to monitor the dynamic performance of the ccpf to the earthquake events considered for this study and responses recorded in one of these experiments can be used as a benchmark for comparison and analysis purposes in the companion group of centrifuge tests denoted as test02 and test04 the effect of layered soil condition on the seismic response of the soil ccpf structure system are investigated the analysis of the abovementioned four events also gives some insights on the influence of pile configuration on the seismic response of the system the chi chi earthquake wave which has a significant duration with more high frequency contents wang et al 2020 and represents the type of shaking that may be experienced in coastal region of china is selected as the input motion and scaled to the peak ground acceleration pga of about 0 15g as shown in fig 2 the normalized spectral acceleration refers to the response spectral acceleration normalized by its peak value according to the treatment in zhang et al 2017a the prototype earthquake motions are further scaled by the g level used in the centrifuge tests 50g in this study and converted into digital signals that are fed into the servo actuator to prescribe the base motion for exciting the centrifuge models the acceleration time histories and fourier spectrums of the actual achieved input motions for the four centrifuge tests listed in table 4 are presented in fig 3 and in this figure the time histories and fourier spectrums of the achieved input motions are also compared with those of the target input motions it is found that although the acceleration time histories of the achieved input motions do not match the target motion well in the initial time frames which may be due to the technical performance and limitations of the acceleration sensor that was located at shaking table xu et al 2020 or a possible time lag of data acquisition channels in the initial time frames the acceleration amplitudes waveforms and main frequency components of the achieved input motions in the four tests are almost identical and generally consistent with the target input motions overall the tlj 150 centrifuge shaking table performed well in waveform replication and thus the comparisons among the four tests are reliable zhu et al 2020 3 results and discussion as explained before the results of acceleration and displacement as well as bending moment from test03 in which the actual input peak horizontal acceleration is very close to the target value are detailed in this section as a benchmark of this series of experiments then by comparing with the selected results of the other three tests the influence of layered soil condition and pile configuration on the seismic response of the ccpf are subsequently studied in this section 3 1 acceleration results fig 4 shows the accelerations measured at the base the soil near the caisson piles interface the soil surface close to the caisson and the superstructure this figure clearly shows that the recorded acceleration time histories are attenuated as the waves pass through the soil layers especially near the ground surface and then increased on the superstructure the peak acceleration of superstructure is about 1 4 times the input motion meanwhile fig 5 illustrates that the soil column reduces the propagation of high frequency acceleration components and the soil ccpf structure interaction amplify the input motion for frequencies between 0 1 and 3 hz which may result in the attenuation and amplification phenomenon of the accelerations fig 4 respectively similar results can be found in previous experimental studies curras et al 2001 zhong and huang 2014b liu et al 2018 3 2 displacement results the displacement time histories of the soil at different depths and of the superstructure are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the horizontal displacements are accumulated during shaking and significant residual values are observed within the soil and at the superstructure the recorded displacements fig 6 also show a progressive amplification of horizontal motions up through the soil profile and the superstructure moves more horizontally with its maximum value reaching 95 2 cm these observations are similar to previous centrifuge tests boulanger et al 1999 zhong 2013 and may be due to the characteristics of input motion that the displacements derived from many of the accelerogram recordings of the 1999 chi chi earthquake have the tendency to reach significant values boore 2001 lin et al 2018 luo et al 2019 3 3 bending moment results fig 7 a d show the bending moment time histories derived from the strain gauge measurements recorded at the head of the instrumented piles the maximum pile head bending moment of the four piles is found to occur at almost the same time and thus these peak values are further plotted in fig 7 e to analyze the spatial variation of bending moment in the group of piles under the caisson the results indicate that the maximum moment at the pile head is lower in the outer pile than the inner pile particularly there is the largest peak bending moment of 205 kn m induced in pile 3 located in the center of the pile group while the smallest peak bending moment equal to 168 kn m is measured at the head of instrumented corner pile pile 4 similar spatial variability of pile bending moment in the group is also observed in other studies such as yamashita et al 2012 s field measurements during the 2011 tohoku earthquake and liu et al 2018 s centrifuge shaking table tests on 4 4 pile groups such discrepancy in bending moment between inner and outer pile may be due to a uneven inertial force transferred from superstructure to the supporting piles huang et al 2004 zhang et al 2017b b not conspicuous shadowing effect for flexible hollow piles employed herein zhang et al 2017a c the predominant effect of the horizontal ground displacements rather than the inertia force of the superstructure yamashita et al 2012 or d the complex soil ccpf structure interaction that is very different from soil pile group foundation structure interaction in addition recorded bending moment time histories at different depths of the instrumented corner pile pile 4 and the corresponding instantaneous maximum bending moment profile i e the bending moment profile along the pile shaft at the instant when the uppermost strain gauge attains its maximum reading are presented in fig 8 the peak bending moments increases gradually from the pile tip to its head with the maximum value near the pile head reaching 190 kn m generally the observed distribution in figs 7 and 8 illustrate that for the ccpf with 3 3 pile groups in homogeneous soil set up in this study the internal piles within the pile groups under the caisson may experience greater bending moment during earthquakes compared with the external piles and the greatest moment may occur near the top of these piles 3 4 influence of soil condition fig 9 presents amplifications of acceleration in the soil layer and on the superstructure respectively for all the four test series amplification is obtained by normalizing maximum acceleration at different elevations divided by the maximum base acceleration evidently accelerations in all the test series are attenuated from the base to the upper layers of the soil still because the wave amplifies across the upper sand layer during shaking baziar et al 2018 curras et al 2001 relatively higher accelerations in layered soil is found from this figure fig 9 also indicates that the superstructure acceleration for the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups in layered soil is more amplified than that in homogeneous soil while an opposite trend can be observed in the case of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups fig 10 and fig 11 represent the frequency content of the accelerations measured near the soil surface and on the superstructure respectively for the ccpf model with 2 2 and 3 3 pile groups in homogeneous or layered soil it can be seen that the presence of the upper sand layer enhances the frequency components between 0 1 and 3 hz and thus the accelerations near the surface of the layered soil are somewhat higher than that of the homogeneous soil see fig 9 in addition compared with the case of homogeneous soil the horizontal acceleration measured at the superstructure of the ccpf model with 2 2 3 3 pile groups in layered soil contains more less energy near the frequency of 1 hz which can be used to explain the results observed in fig 9 to some extent amplifications of normalized displacement in terms of peak displacements relative to peak displacement at the pile tip are plotted versus depth in fig 12 fig 12 illustrates that in the case of layered soil less amplification of the displacements for the ccpf model especially at the superstructure can be observed from this figure this is because the upper sand layer may have enough resistance to inertial motion and rocking of the ccpf and the natural period of the ccpf superstructure system may be much closer to that of the homogeneous clayey silt fig 13 gives the time representation of the dynamic bending moment at different depths of pile 4 for the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups in homogeneous and layered soil respectively comparing the recorded results in the two different soil conditions the frequencies of pile responses in the layered soil condition tests are obviously lowered but the amplitude is significantly increased and the time when the strain gauges attain their maximum readings is lagged as shown in table 5 similar results is also found in the case of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups see table 5 which are not detailed for conciseness the distribution of peak pile head bending moment in test03 and test04 are plotted together in fig 14 similar distribution pattern that the piles arranged in the middle row pile 2 and pile 3 along the shaking direction experience greater bending moment compared to that arranged in the outer row pile 1 and pile 4 can be observed in these two tests however the peak pile head bending moment in test04 layered soil is greater than that in test03 homogeneous soil and the smallest peak pile head bending moment corresponding to these two tests are distributed in pile1 and pile 4 respectively fig 15 plots the bending moment profile along the pile shaft pile 4 at the instant when the uppermost strain gauge attains its maximum reading for all the tests carried out in this study the results show that in all these tests the moment profiles are generally similar with the maximum value occurs near the pile head as seen from figs 9 15 the presence of the upper sand layer does have a noticeable influence on the seismic response involving the acceleration dynamic displacement and bending moment of the ccpf model generally the horizontal acceleration and the dynamic vibration in terms of the lateral displacement in the superstructure of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups are both weakened due to the layered soil condition while the dynamic bending moments of the piles under the caisson are significantly amplified although the pile configuration and thus the fundamental frequency of the whole soil ccpf structure system is different similar results can be seen from the case of the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups except for the observed horizontal acceleration in the superstructure 3 5 influence of pile configuration the centrifuge test results shown in figs 9 15 also illustrate the influence of pile configuration on the seismic responses of the ccpf model in homogeneous and layered soil specifically it is found from fig 9 that the amplification of the acceleration at superstructure of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups is generally lower than that with 2 2 pile groups especially for layered soil condition this is due to the frequency components near 1 hz of the superstructure acceleration are more enhanced in the case of the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups as explained previously see figs 10 and 11 on the other hand the increased number of the pile under the caisson results in a higher amplification of the lateral dynamic displacement at the superstructure of the ccpf model as shown in fig 12 which may be attributed to the modification of the natural period of the ccpf superstructure system by increasing the pile number and thus decreasing the pile spacing comparing the recorded pile bending moment of the ccpf model with the two different pile configurations the peak bending moment along the pile shaft is weakened due to the configuration of 3 3 piles see fig 15 while the time when the bending moments attain their maximum values is more lagged by increasing the number of the pile under the condition of layered soil as shown in table 5 as seen depending on the number of the pile and the corresponding arrangement both favorable and unfavorable effects regarding seismic response involving the horizontal acceleration lateral displacement and the bending moment of the ccpf model can occur 4 conclusions a series of centrifuge shaking table tests were carried out to study the seismic response of composite caisson piles foundation ccpf a relatively novel foundation type the effects of soil condition and pile configuration on soil superstructure acceleration displacement and pile bending moment responses were also considered in the centrifuge tests the test results can be summarized as 1 in all the centrifuge tests acceleration and displacement attenuated and amplified respectively when the wave propagated across the clayey silt layer from the base to the surface however there was less attenuation amplification of the acceleration displacement in centrifuge testing due to the presence of the upper dry sand layer these results together illustrated the general features of the soil profile in this study 2 horizontal acceleration and lateral dynamic displacement at the superstructure of the ccpf model were both amplified due to the complex soil ccpf structure interaction under earthquake shaking nevertheless the presence of the upper dry sand layer generally mitigated the dynamic vibration in terms of acceleration and displacement in the superstructure of the ccpf model in addition although the superstructure acceleration can be weakened to some extent by increasing the number of piles under the caisson the ccpf model with the configuration of 3 3 piles in this study was more susceptible to the earthquake induced displacement comparing to that with the configuration of 2 2 piles 3 for the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups in this study the bending moment was greater for the internal piles within the pile group compared to the external piles moreover layered soil condition was found to somewhat modify the distribution of bending moment in the external piles within the pile group 4 both soil condition and pile configuration played an important role in the dynamic bending moment response along the pile shaft under the caisson with their peak values increased gradually from pile tip to its head owing to the presence of the upper dry sand layer the amplitude of the pile bending moment was significantly increased and the frequency of the pile response was obviously lowered as well as the time when the bending moment attain their maximum values was lagged compared with the configuration of 2 2 piles the configuration of 3 3 piles and thus increased number of the pile under the caisson induced significantly smaller bending moment in themselves the composite caisson piles foundation with various pile configurations in homogeneous or layered soil exhibited quite different behaviors under earthquake shaking and these derived results proved the need to conduct future experimental and numerical studies on more factors influencing the seismic response of the novel foundation type ccpf credit authorship contribution statement hao zhang methodology validation writing

acceleration and displacement recorded at different points as well as variations of bending moment along the piles specifically four accelerometers are placed at different locations for recording horizontal acceleration time history during the shaking event the input horizontal acceleration applied to the model is measured by installing acc1 at the bottom of soil acc2 and acc3 record the horizontal acceleration response at the soil near the caisson piles interface the layer interface and the surface respectively also signal recorded by acc4 is considered as the superstructure response three linear variable differential transformers lvdts transducers are horizontally installed to continuously scan the time history of horizontal displacement of soil from different depths and one oriented laser lvdt is fixed at a support frame above the soil container for measuring the horizontal displacement of superstructure during the shaking event in order to investigate the spatial variations of bending strain induced in the model pile in the group 4 pairs of strain gauges g1 g4 are installed at the top of pile 1 pile2 pile3 and pile4 of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups in the form of the half bridge meanwhile 4 pairs of half bridge circuited strain gauges g4 g7 are also installed on the surface of one pile pile4 of the ccpf model with 2 2 3 3 pile groups at four levels to record the bending strain along the pile the exact places where strain gauges are installed can be seen in fig 1 and then the bending moment of the pile generated at each level during an earthquake can be calculated from the strain as below 1 m p ε p e i y where m p is the bending moment of the pile ei is the rotational stiffness ε p is the bending strain at the outer fiber of the pile cross section y is the distance from the neutral axis to farthest fiber in the cross section i e radius of model pile note that ei y of the model pile is previously determined in a point loading test mashhoud et al 2018 2 3 experimental program and applied ground motions the seismic soil ccpf structure interaction centrifuge tests performed in this study comprise different permutations of the pile configurations and soil conditions as listed in table 4 in total 4 centrifuge tests are carried out specifically test01 and test03 are designed in order to monitor the dynamic performance of the ccpf to the earthquake events considered for this study and responses recorded in one of these experiments can be used as a benchmark for comparison and analysis purposes in the companion group of centrifuge tests denoted as test02 and test04 the effect of layered soil condition on the seismic response of the soil ccpf structure system are investigated the analysis of the abovementioned four events also gives some insights on the influence of pile configuration on the seismic response of the system the chi chi earthquake wave which has a significant duration with more high frequency contents wang et al 2020 and represents the type of shaking that may be experienced in coastal region of china is selected as the input motion and scaled to the peak ground acceleration pga of about 0 15g as shown in fig 2 the normalized spectral acceleration refers to the response spectral acceleration normalized by its peak value according to the treatment in zhang et al 2017a the prototype earthquake motions are further scaled by the g level used in the centrifuge tests 50g in this study and converted into digital signals that are fed into the servo actuator to prescribe the base motion for exciting the centrifuge models the acceleration time histories and fourier spectrums of the actual achieved input motions for the four centrifuge tests listed in table 4 are presented in fig 3 and in this figure the time histories and fourier spectrums of the achieved input motions are also compared with those of the target input motions it is found that although the acceleration time histories of the achieved input motions do not match the target motion well in the initial time frames which may be due to the technical performance and limitations of the acceleration sensor that was located at shaking table xu et al 2020 or a possible time lag of data acquisition channels in the initial time frames the acceleration amplitudes waveforms and main frequency components of the achieved input motions in the four tests are almost identical and generally consistent with the target input motions overall the tlj 150 centrifuge shaking table performed well in waveform replication and thus the comparisons among the four tests are reliable zhu et al 2020 3 results and discussion as explained before the results of acceleration and displacement as well as bending moment from test03 in which the actual input peak horizontal acceleration is very close to the target value are detailed in this section as a benchmark of this series of experiments then by comparing with the selected results of the other three tests the influence of layered soil condition and pile configuration on the seismic response of the ccpf are subsequently studied in this section 3 1 acceleration results fig 4 shows the accelerations measured at the base the soil near the caisson piles interface the soil surface close to the caisson and the superstructure this figure clearly shows that the recorded acceleration time histories are attenuated as the waves pass through the soil layers especially near the ground surface and then increased on the superstructure the peak acceleration of superstructure is about 1 4 times the input motion meanwhile fig 5 illustrates that the soil column reduces the propagation of high frequency acceleration components and the soil ccpf structure interaction amplify the input motion for frequencies between 0 1 and 3 hz which may result in the attenuation and amplification phenomenon of the accelerations fig 4 respectively similar results can be found in previous experimental studies curras et al 2001 zhong and huang 2014b liu et al 2018 3 2 displacement results the displacement time histories of the soil at different depths and of the superstructure are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the horizontal displacements are accumulated during shaking and significant residual values are observed within the soil and at the superstructure the recorded displacements fig 6 also show a progressive amplification of horizontal motions up through the soil profile and the superstructure moves more horizontally with its maximum value reaching 95 2 cm these observations are similar to previous centrifuge tests boulanger et al 1999 zhong 2013 and may be due to the characteristics of input motion that the displacements derived from many of the accelerogram recordings of the 1999 chi chi earthquake have the tendency to reach significant values boore 2001 lin et al 2018 luo et al 2019 3 3 bending moment results fig 7 a d show the bending moment time histories derived from the strain gauge measurements recorded at the head of the instrumented piles the maximum pile head bending moment of the four piles is found to occur at almost the same time and thus these peak values are further plotted in fig 7 e to analyze the spatial variation of bending moment in the group of piles under the caisson the results indicate that the maximum moment at the pile head is lower in the outer pile than the inner pile particularly there is the largest peak bending moment of 205 kn m induced in pile 3 located in the center of the pile group while the smallest peak bending moment equal to 168 kn m is measured at the head of instrumented corner pile pile 4 similar spatial variability of pile bending moment in the group is also observed in other studies such as yamashita et al 2012 s field measurements during the 2011 tohoku earthquake and liu et al 2018 s centrifuge shaking table tests on 4 4 pile groups such discrepancy in bending moment between inner and outer pile may be due to a uneven inertial force transferred from superstructure to the supporting piles huang et al 2004 zhang et al 2017b b not conspicuous shadowing effect for flexible hollow piles employed herein zhang et al 2017a c the predominant effect of the horizontal ground displacements rather than the inertia force of the superstructure yamashita et al 2012 or d the complex soil ccpf structure interaction that is very different from soil pile group foundation structure interaction in addition recorded bending moment time histories at different depths of the instrumented corner pile pile 4 and the corresponding instantaneous maximum bending moment profile i e the bending moment profile along the pile shaft at the instant when the uppermost strain gauge attains its maximum reading are presented in fig 8 the peak bending moments increases gradually from the pile tip to its head with the maximum value near the pile head reaching 190 kn m generally the observed distribution in figs 7 and 8 illustrate that for the ccpf with 3 3 pile groups in homogeneous soil set up in this study the internal piles within the pile groups under the caisson may experience greater bending moment during earthquakes compared with the external piles and the greatest moment may occur near the top of these piles 3 4 influence of soil condition fig 9 presents amplifications of acceleration in the soil layer and on the superstructure respectively for all the four test series amplification is obtained by normalizing maximum acceleration at different elevations divided by the maximum base acceleration evidently accelerations in all the test series are attenuated from the base to the upper layers of the soil still because the wave amplifies across the upper sand layer during shaking baziar et al 2018 curras et al 2001 relatively higher accelerations in layered soil is found from this figure fig 9 also indicates that the superstructure acceleration for the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups in layered soil is more amplified than that in homogeneous soil while an opposite trend can be observed in the case of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups fig 10 and fig 11 represent the frequency content of the accelerations measured near the soil surface and on the superstructure respectively for the ccpf model with 2 2 and 3 3 pile groups in homogeneous or layered soil it can be seen that the presence of the upper sand layer enhances the frequency components between 0 1 and 3 hz and thus the accelerations near the surface of the layered soil are somewhat higher than that of the homogeneous soil see fig 9 in addition compared with the case of homogeneous soil the horizontal acceleration measured at the superstructure of the ccpf model with 2 2 3 3 pile groups in layered soil contains more less energy near the frequency of 1 hz which can be used to explain the results observed in fig 9 to some extent amplifications of normalized displacement in terms of peak displacements relative to peak displacement at the pile tip are plotted versus depth in fig 12 fig 12 illustrates that in the case of layered soil less amplification of the displacements for the ccpf model especially at the superstructure can be observed from this figure this is because the upper sand layer may have enough resistance to inertial motion and rocking of the ccpf and the natural period of the ccpf superstructure system may be much closer to that of the homogeneous clayey silt fig 13 gives the time representation of the dynamic bending moment at different depths of pile 4 for the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups in homogeneous and layered soil respectively comparing the recorded results in the two different soil conditions the frequencies of pile responses in the layered soil condition tests are obviously lowered but the amplitude is significantly increased and the time when the strain gauges attain their maximum readings is lagged as shown in table 5 similar results is also found in the case of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups see table 5 which are not detailed for conciseness the distribution of peak pile head bending moment in test03 and test04 are plotted together in fig 14 similar distribution pattern that the piles arranged in the middle row pile 2 and pile 3 along the shaking direction experience greater bending moment compared to that arranged in the outer row pile 1 and pile 4 can be observed in these two tests however the peak pile head bending moment in test04 layered soil is greater than that in test03 homogeneous soil and the smallest peak pile head bending moment corresponding to these two tests are distributed in pile1 and pile 4 respectively fig 15 plots the bending moment profile along the pile shaft pile 4 at the instant when the uppermost strain gauge attains its maximum reading for all the tests carried out in this study the results show that in all these tests the moment profiles are generally similar with the maximum value occurs near the pile head as seen from figs 9 15 the presence of the upper sand layer does have a noticeable influence on the seismic response involving the acceleration dynamic displacement and bending moment of the ccpf model generally the horizontal acceleration and the dynamic vibration in terms of the lateral displacement in the superstructure of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups are both weakened due to the layered soil condition while the dynamic bending moments of the piles under the caisson are significantly amplified although the pile configuration and thus the fundamental frequency of the whole soil ccpf structure system is different similar results can be seen from the case of the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups except for the observed horizontal acceleration in the superstructure 3 5 influence of pile configuration the centrifuge test results shown in figs 9 15 also illustrate the influence of pile configuration on the seismic responses of the ccpf model in homogeneous and layered soil specifically it is found from fig 9 that the amplification of the acceleration at superstructure of the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups is generally lower than that with 2 2 pile groups especially for layered soil condition this is due to the frequency components near 1 hz of the superstructure acceleration are more enhanced in the case of the ccpf model with 2 2 pile groups as explained previously see figs 10 and 11 on the other hand the increased number of the pile under the caisson results in a higher amplification of the lateral dynamic displacement at the superstructure of the ccpf model as shown in fig 12 which may be attributed to the modification of the natural period of the ccpf superstructure system by increasing the pile number and thus decreasing the pile spacing comparing the recorded pile bending moment of the ccpf model with the two different pile configurations the peak bending moment along the pile shaft is weakened due to the configuration of 3 3 piles see fig 15 while the time when the bending moments attain their maximum values is more lagged by increasing the number of the pile under the condition of layered soil as shown in table 5 as seen depending on the number of the pile and the corresponding arrangement both favorable and unfavorable effects regarding seismic response involving the horizontal acceleration lateral displacement and the bending moment of the ccpf model can occur 4 conclusions a series of centrifuge shaking table tests were carried out to study the seismic response of composite caisson piles foundation ccpf a relatively novel foundation type the effects of soil condition and pile configuration on soil superstructure acceleration displacement and pile bending moment responses were also considered in the centrifuge tests the test results can be summarized as 1 in all the centrifuge tests acceleration and displacement attenuated and amplified respectively when the wave propagated across the clayey silt layer from the base to the surface however there was less attenuation amplification of the acceleration displacement in centrifuge testing due to the presence of the upper dry sand layer these results together illustrated the general features of the soil profile in this study 2 horizontal acceleration and lateral dynamic displacement at the superstructure of the ccpf model were both amplified due to the complex soil ccpf structure interaction under earthquake shaking nevertheless the presence of the upper dry sand layer generally mitigated the dynamic vibration in terms of acceleration and displacement in the superstructure of the ccpf model in addition although the superstructure acceleration can be weakened to some extent by increasing the number of piles under the caisson the ccpf model with the configuration of 3 3 piles in this study was more susceptible to the earthquake induced displacement comparing to that with the configuration of 2 2 piles 3 for the ccpf model with 3 3 pile groups in this study the bending moment was greater for the internal piles within the pile group compared to the external piles moreover layered soil condition was found to somewhat modify the distribution of bending moment in the external piles within the pile group 4 both soil condition and pile configuration played an important role in the dynamic bending moment response along the pile shaft under the caisson with their peak values increased gradually from pile tip to its head owing to the presence of the upper dry sand layer the amplitude of the pile bending moment was significantly increased and the frequency of the pile response was obviously lowered as well as the time when the bending moment attain their maximum values was lagged compared with the configuration of 2 2 piles the configuration of 3 3 piles and thus increased number of the pile under the caisson induced significantly smaller bending moment in themselves the composite caisson piles foundation with various pile configurations in homogeneous or layered soil exhibited quite different behaviors under earthquake shaking and these derived results proved the need to conduct future experimental and numerical studies on more factors influencing the seismic response of the novel foundation type ccpf credit authorship contribution statement hao zhang methodology validation writing

21121,bubble has significant applications in ocean engineering aiming at the difficulty of conducting the underwater explosion bubble experiment with large charge in deep water this paper adopts a new way to deal with this problem on the basis of similarity theory it is found that by considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water can be realized by changing the gravitational acceleration with the assumption that the liquid is inviscid and incompressible the bubble dynamics are solved by the euler equations with the finite volume method and the motion of the bubble interface is tracked by the front tracking method based on this model the bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments are studied systematically the results show that the bubble motion the formation position of the bubble jet the liquid jet velocity and the pressure induced by the bubble will change significantly under different hypergravity environments keywords bubble collapse hypergravity environment finite volume method front tracking method 1 introduction dynamic characteristics of bubble have been researched for many decades in different fields such as ocean engineering and military ge et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 bubble dynamics has a significant effect on the strength of the nearby structures which may lead to local and overall damage on the submarine when the submarine is subjected to the underwater explosion with large charge in deep water therefore for knowing more about the destruction mechanism of the bubble bubble dynamics near a wall should be investigated however for the underwater explosion experiment the researches on the bubble dynamics with large charge in deep water are always difficult due to the limitation of test methods so the scaled model test is a reasonable and feasible alternative in order to realize the transformation between the scaled model and the prototype some parameters of the scaled model test may be changed such as charge weight geometry size and ambient pressure on the basis of similarity theory it is found that by considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water can be realized by changing the gravitational acceleration although the bubble dynamics has been investigated for many researchers the bubble dynamics under different gravitational accelerations are not very clear consequently the bubble collapse near a solid wall with different gravitational accelerations is studied in this paper researches on underwater explosion problems have been lasting for a long time based on the previous work cole 1948 summarized the characteristics of the underwater explosion subsequently some analytical models about underwater explosion loads were proposed among these models a widely used model was proposed by geers and hunter 2002 where the underwater explosion loads were split into two parts the shock wave load and the bubble load and the initial conditions of the bubble phase were given by the shock wave phase the research of geers and hunter 2002 mainly focused on a moderately deep underwater explosion without considering the influence of nearby structure subsequently the underwater explosion experiments near some simple and complex structures were investigated by some researchers cui et al 2016 ge et al 2017 hung and hwangfu 2010 jin et al 2019 klaseboer et al 2005a zhang et al 2013 2017 in addition with the development of the software and hardware of the computer numerical investigations on the interaction between underwater explosion bubbles and structures were conducted extensively hsu et al 2014 huang et al 2015 klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b li et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2008 2014 2017 zhang and zong 2012 based on the above experimental and numerical results different underwater explosion features such as the deformation characteristics of bubble the pressure distribution in the flow field and the dynamic responses of structure were investigated to understand the mechanism of the bubble dynamics experimental researches mentioned above mainly focus on the underwater explosion with small charge in shallow water and the underwater explosion experiment with large charge in deep water was rarely studied in recent years the scaled model test is a useful method to realize the research on the underwater explosion with large charge in deep water in the scaled model test the mach similarity for shock wave and the froude similarity for bubble dynamics should be satisfied the peak pressure of the shock wave is gpa so the hydrostatic pressure has less effect on the similarity of the shock wave propagation in the scaled model and the prototype where the condition of the mach similarity can be satisfied gel fand and takayama 2004 hu et al 2017 the bubble dynamics are affected by the hydrostatic pressure so the froude similarity must be guaranteed most researches on the scaled model test are carried out with constant gravity environment but the mach similarity and the froude similarity are not realized simultaneously under the constant gravity environment hu et al 2017 fortunately the acceleration of the test system can be changed to meet the requirements for dimensionless similarity in centrifuge test where the mach similarity and the froude similarity can be satisfied simultaneously initially centrifuge tests were mainly used for underground explosion problems de 2008 fan et al 2012 hansen and pak 2016 and then the centrifuge test was introduced into the underwater explosion research de et al 2017 ge et al 2017 hu et al 2017 long et al 2017 vanadit ellis and davis 2010 vanadit ellis and davis 2010 investigated the dynamic response of the small scaled model of a concrete gravity dam subjected to the underwater explosion and the damage characteristics of the model dam were studied de et al 2017 studied the effects of an underwater explosion on a tunnel buried below submerged ground using a combination of physical model tests and the comparison between numerical and experimental results was conducted based on the dimensional analysis hu et al 2017 presented the similarity law of the underwater explosion where the mach similarity and the froude similarity are satisfied under the hypergravity environment the results of a series of tests indicate that the peak pressure and time constant of the shock wave were not affected by the change of hydrostatic pressure or gravitational acceleration when the number related to scaled distance is constant and the same conclusion can be drawn for dimensionless bubble parameters such as bubble maximum radius and pulsation period when the number related to the effect of buoyancy is constant according to the previous work of hu et al 2017 a group of tests were conducted by long et al 2017 to investigate the dynamic response of a fixed steel plate subjected to the underwater explosion under the hypergravity environment the researches of hu et al 2017 and long et al 2017 illustrated that the centrifuge apparatus is a meaningful and promising tool to study the underwater explosion at the same time the underwater explosion shock wave and bubble pulsation were investigated experimentally and numerically using the geotechnical centrifuge apparatus and ls dyna by ge et al 2017 where the shock wave and the bubble pulsation in accordance with the centrifugal similarity was proved in order to simulate the underwater explosion under different gravitational accelerations wang et al 2019 investigated the effects of equation state of water and mesh size on numerical results by using commercial software ansys autodyn so far a few researches had been done on the bubble dynamics near a structure under different hypergravity environments in addition the bubble dynamics near a structure under different hypergravity environments are significant for research on the underwater explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore in this paper the bubble collapse near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments is investigated 2 similarity law of underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments in order to study the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water by using the small charge in shallow water the similarity law of the underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments should be summarized first in this paper we are mainly concerned with the bubble collapse near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments so the shock wave stage is not considered the quantities characterizing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics mainly include the peak pressure p b m induced by bubble pulsation the bubble pulsation period t b the maximum radius of bubble r m and the jet velocity of bubble v j e t meanwhile the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are usually influenced by many quantities such as the charge density ρ c h arg e the radius of charge r c h arg e the explosion energy of charge q the position for the pressure and velocity in the liquid r d the distance between structure and charge centroid d the hydrostatic pressure in the flow field p s the depth of charge h the density of liquid ρ w a t e r and the gravitational acceleration g since the size of the explosion bubble is large the surface tension and the viscosity of liquid are neglected in the present study the quantities characterizing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are called as dependent variables and the quantities influencing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are called as independent variables table 1 presents the dimension of the independent and dependent variables relationship between independent variables and dependent variables can be written as follows

should satisfy the relationship ge et al 2017 hu et al 2017 tan 2011 3 π i m π i p where i 1 2 3 10 and the superscript p and m represent the prototype and the scaled model respectively usually the charge type and the liquid used in the scaled model and the prototype are same so the properties of the charge and the liquid are constant including the density of charge ρ c h arg e the explosion energy of charge q and the density of liquid ρ w a t e r in order to satisfy the geometric similarity an assumption that the similarity coefficient n l p l m is used so r c h arg e p r c h arg e m n from eq 3 the relationships of independent variables between the scaled model and the prototype can be derived 4a π 6 p π 6 m r d p r d m n 4b π 7 p π 7 m g p g m 1 n 4c π 8 p π 8 m p s p p s m 1 4d π

satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore in order to know more about the bubble dynamics in deep water it is valuable to investigate the bubble collapse under different hypergravity environments it should be noted that the similar relationships between the scaled model and the prototype in eqs 4a 4i are the general forms where the froude similarity is also satisfied 3 governing equations and numerical model 3 1 governing equations for liquid and gas the underwater explosion bubble belongs to the high pressure bubble so the bubble induced by the high pressure under different hypergravity environments will be studied in the present work because the velocity in liquid induced by the bubble is smaller than the sound speed in liquid the compressibility of liquid is not considered though the liquid jet velocity induced by the bubble can reach 100 200 m s in some conditions the duration of the liquid jet with high velocity is very short which has no significant effect on the bubble motion li et al 2016 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 with the incompressible assumption of liquid the spherical bubble expansion and contraction in the free filed without gravity can be expressed by the rayleigh plesset equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 which can used be illustrated the influence of the liquid viscosity on the bubble motion the rayleigh plesset equation is expressed as follows 5 r r 3 2 r 2 1 ρ p c p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ p 2 σ r 4 μ r r where r is the bubble radius r is the velocity of the bubble surface r is the acceleration of the bubble surface ρ is the density of liquid p c is the constant vapor pressure p 0 is initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble when the initial bubble radius is r 0 and ϑ denotes the ratio of specific heats p is the infinite pressure σ is the coefficient of surface tension μ is the coefficient of the liquid viscosity the influence of the liquid viscosity on the bubble motion is significantly associated with the bubble size when the bubble motion will not affected by the liquid viscosity the corresponding size range of the bubble can be determined using the rayleigh plesset equation in the present study the initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble p 0 7 5 10 6 pa the constant vapor pressure p c 2338pa the infinite pressure p 1 01 10 5 pa the ratio of specific heats ϑ 1 4 the coefficient of surface tension σ 0 072 k g s 2 and the coefficient of the liquid viscosity μ 0 001 k g m s by changing the initial bubble radius the influence of the liquid viscosity on the ratio r m 2 r m 1 is calculated using the rayleigh plesset equation in fig 1 where r m 1 denotes the maximum radius of the first pulsation of bubble and r m 2 denotes the maximum radius of the second pulsation of bubble when r m 2 r m 1 1 it indicates that the liquid viscosity has no influence on the bubble motion as shown in fig 1 when the initial bubble radius r 0 2 10 4 m the ratio r m 2 r m 1 1 so the liquid viscosity has no influence on the bubble motion when r 0 2 10 4 m in the present study the initial bubble radius chosen is much larger than 2 10 4 m so the liquid viscosity can be neglected therefore the incompressible euler equations are used to calculate the bubble dynamics as shown in fig 2 an axisymmetric bubble near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments is studied thus the euler equations in cylindrical coordinate system can be written as liu et al 2017a 6a 1 r r u r r u z z 0 6b u r t 1 r r u r 2 r u r u z z φ r 6c u z t 1 r r u r u z r u z 2 z φ z g n where u r and u z denote the velocity along the direction of coordinate axis r and z respectively φ p ρ where p is the pressure in liquid and ρ is the density of liquid and g n represents the acceleration in hypergravity environment whose subscript denotes n times of the gravitational acceleration g the pressure inside the bubble is obtained by using an equation of state instead of solving the euler equations which converts the two phase flow problem into the single phase flow problem the gas inside the bubble is considered to be homogeneous which consists of a constant vapor pressure and non condensable volume dependent gas pressure under the assumptions mentioned above a simple model with adiabatic process brujan et al 2002 liu et al 2017a 2020 is used to obtain the pressure inside the bubble which can be expressed as 7 p g p c p 0 v 0 v ϑ where p g denotes the pressure inside the bubble when the bubble volume is v p c is the constant vapor pressure p 0 is initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble when the initial bubble volume is v 0 and ϑ denotes the ratio of specific heats 3 2 the euler equations solver the incompressible euler equations are discretized by the finite volume method on a uniform cartesian mesh as shown in fig 3 a the strategy of staggered grid is used and the control volumes of pressure ω i j and velocities ω i 1 2 j ω i j 1 2 are presented in addition ω denotes the boundary of the control volume there are three types for the mesh cell full cell filled with liquid denoted by f empty cell without liquid denoted by e and surface cell that contains the interface between liquid and gas denoted by s for the sake of generality the discrete form of the euler equations in the surface cell s will be given as shown in fig 3 b the integral form of the euler equations can be expressed as 8a ω i j i n t r u z d z i n t r u z d z ω i j i n t r u r d r i n t r u r d r 0 8b t ω i

correspond to the center of the control volume of velocity and the subscript i n t denotes the integral along the interface in order to obtain the velocity at the next time step the forward euler scheme is utilized for the transient term moukalled et al 2015 and the process of solving the momentum equations is divided into two parts the first part computes the temporary velocities from eqs 8b and 8c without the pressure gradient terms but the contribution of the pressure along the interface is taken into account popinet and zaleski 2002 therefore the temporary velocities u i 1 2 j u i j 1 2 can be calculated based on the current velocities u i 1 2 j n u i j 1 2 n liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 9a u i 1 2 j u i 1 2 j n δ t ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j r u r n 2 d z ω i 1 2 j r u

rest pressure is added and the velocities in next time step u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 can be expressed as 10a u i 1 2 j n 1 u i 1 2 j δ t ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j i n t r φ n d z ω i 1 2 j φ n d r d z 10b u i j 1 2 n 1 u i j 1 2 δ t ξ i j 1 2 z ω i j 1 2 i n t r φ n d r where ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j r d r d z and ξ i j 1 2 z ω i j 1 2 r d r d z since the velocities are considered to be uniform in the control volume the velocities u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 obtained from eqs 10a and 10b should satisfy the non divergence condition substituting the velocities at time step n 1 into the continuity eq 8a and the pressure term φ n can be calculated by the discrete version of the continuity equation with boundary conditions the pressure term φ n can be obtained using multi grid accelerated gauss seidel relaxation method after that substituting the result of pressure gradient term into eqs 10a and 10b the velocity u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 can be obtained 3 3 interface tracking after the velocity field is obtained the interface of bubble should be updated here the interface consists of a series of marker particles and the position of the marker particle is calculated using the forward euler scheme liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 11 x m a r k e r n 1 x m a r k e r n δ t u m a r k e r n 1 where x m a r k e r n 1 denotes the position of the marker particle at time step n 1 x m a r k e r n denotes the position of the marker particle at time step n and u m a r k e r n 1 denotes the velocity of the corresponding marker particle at time step n 1 the velocity of the marker particle u m a r k e r n 1 is interpolated from flow field for example when a marker particle is located in the velocity control volume ω i 1 2 j the r component of the marker particle velocity can be expressed as 12a u m a r k e r r u i 1 2 j u i 1 2 j 2 h r i 1 r u i 1 2 j u i 3 2 j 2 h r r i similarly if a marker particle is located in the velocity control volume ω i j 1 2 the z component of the marker particle velocity can be expressed as 12b u m a r k e r z u i j 1 2 u i j 1 2 2 h z j 1 z u i j 1 2 u i j 3 2 2 h z z j where h is the height of the cell r and z are the position of the marker particle r i and z j denote the position of the gird sometimes the center of velocity control volume may be located in the empty cells cells marked by the symbol e in fig 3 where the velocity of the control volume is missing according to the work of popinet and zaleski 2002 the missing velocity can be obtained using lagrange multiplier method in the present work since the viscosity of liquid is not taken into account the missing velocity is obtained using the least square method utilized in liu et al 2017a after the marker particles are updated the distribution of the marker particles along the interface may become non uniform which may lead to interfacial instability therefore the redistribution of the marker particles should be done in the present work a cubic splines method popinet and zaleski 1999 is utilized at each time step for the redistribution of the marker particles in addition a liquid jet with high velocity will penetrate the bubble surface when bubble collapses and the topology of the marker particles along the interface will be changed the treatment of the topology change is done using a simplified method introduced by liu et al 2017a 4 validation for numerical model and similarity law 4 1 validation for numerical model in this section the rayleigh plesset equation for bubble motion is used to validate the numerical model adopted in the present study the initial conditions and boundary conditions for the numerical model need to be given the initial bubble radius r 0 0 01 the initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble p 0 1 01 10 6 pa the constant vapor pressure p c 2338pa the infinite pressure p 1 01 10 5 pa the ratio of specific heats ϑ 1 4 the bubble size we study is large so the liquid viscosity and the surface tension of the bubble are neglected the rayleigh plesset equation is derived under the assumption of infinite pressure so the boundary conditions for the other boundaries except for the symmetric axis boundary in the numerical model are set as the infinite pressure actually the size of computational domain in the numerical model cannot be set to infinity so the convergence for the size of computational domain also needs to be verified so the influence of the size of computational domain on the numerical results needs to be considered when verifying the numerical model the bubble is set in the center of the computational domain the governing equations are discretized in staggered uniform grids and the number of mesh can refer to the literatures liu et al 2020 which is set as 1026 1026 in fig 4 the comparison between the numerical results in different size of computational domain and the rayleigh plesset equation is displayed and the corresponding errors are displayed in table 2 the size of computational domain has little effect on the maximum radius r m and the maximum error for the maximum radius is less than 0 34 however the effect of the size of computational domain on the bubble pulsation period t b is evident the maximum error has 8 16 when the size of computational domain is set as 5 r m with the increase of the size of computational domain the maximum error for the bubble pulsation period decreases the maximum error for the bubble pulsation period only has 0 41 when the size of computational domain reaches 30 r m besides the maximum radius and the pulsation period the bubble radius with time between the numerical model and the rayleigh plesset equation also agrees well with each other when the size of computational domain reaches 30 r m so the results obtained by the numerical model are accurate when the size of computational domain is 30 r m all calculations for this paper the size of computational domain is set as 30 r m and the number of mesh is set as 1026 1026 4 2 validation for similarity law in this section based on the numerical model three cases are used to validate the similarity law in section 2 and the three cases are displayed in table 3 the case model 1 denotes the prototype and the cases model 2 and mode 4 denote the scaled model the initial conditions for the three cases in table 3 satisfy the relationships of independent variables between the prototype and the scaled model in eqs 4a 4e in fig 5 the comparison of the bubble motion in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 is displayed where the bubble shape and the corresponding time in the cases model 2 and model 4 have been transformed using the similarity coefficient n 2 and n 4 respectively the transformed bubble shapes in the cases model 2 and model 4 are identical with those in the case model 1 so the bubble shapes in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 satisfy the similarity law in fig 6 fig 9 the comparisons of the bubble radius the bubble centroid the jet velocity and the jet pressure in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 are displayed respectively the results in fig 6 a fig 9 a are not transformed and the results of the cases model 2 and model 4 in fig 6 b fig 9 b have been transformed using the similarity coefficient n 2 and n 4 respectively evidently the transformed results of the bubble radius the bubble centroid the jet velocity and the jet pressure in the cases model 2 and model 4 are identical with those in the case model 1 so the results in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 satisfy the similarity law so based on the similarity law in section 2 the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water when considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration 5 results and discussion for the sake of generalization non dimensionlization is conducted for numerical results using some fundamental quantities table 4 presents the fundamental quantities and dimensionless quantities here the maximum bubble radius r m is chosen as the fundamental quantity of length p ρ 1 2 represents the fundamental quantity of velocity r m ρ p 1 2 denotes the fundamental quantity of time and far field pressure p is chosen as the fundamental quantity of pressure in addition the strength parameter ε p 0 p represents the initial pressure inside bubble the gravity parameter β ρ g n r m p 1 2 represents gravitational acceleration the stand off distance parameter γ d r m is the dimensionless distance between the initial position of bubble and a solid wall the definition of gravity parameter β is similar to the buoyancy parameter δ used widely in research on the underwater explosion problems but the emphasis of the two parameters is different the buoyancy parameter is adjusted by changing the bubble radius however the gravity parameter is adjusted by changing the gravitational acceleration in centrifuge therefore the two parameters have different physical meanings and also have different guiding meanings for the experiment based on the similarity law in section 2 the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water when the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration is considered therefore in order to know more about the bubble dynamics in deep water the influences of the gravity parameter on the bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall are studied in this section the non dimensional initial bubble radius r 0 r 0 r m 0 1818 the strength parameter ε 74 3 and the stand off distance parameter γ 0 8 are used in the whole research the size of computational domain is 30 r m and the number of uniform mesh is set to 1026 1026 fig 10 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 2310 g n 20 g from the initial collapse of the bubble to the generation of the liquid jet due to the increase of the gravity parameter the upper shape of the bubble is different from the case with small gravity parameter in the case with small gravity parameter the upper shape of the bubble is approximates to spherical form liu et al 2017a but the upper shape of the bubble presents an inverted bowl like shape when gravitational acceleration is 20 g as shown in fig 10 a the reason for this phenomenon is that the velocity on both sides of the bubble top is relatively large in addition to the large velocity generated on the top of the bubble meanwhile the bubble bottom is flat due to the effect of the solid wall although the initial distance from the bubble centroid to the solid wall is smaller than the maximum bubble radius a water layer still exists between the solid wall and the bubble after that a local high pressure region is generated on the top of the bubble and a high speed liquid jet is formed due to the high pressure region as shown in fig 10 b and c at the same time the bubble top has an overall downward motion owing to the combined effects of both the liquid jet and the velocities on both sides of the bubble top subsequently the liquid jet continues developing inside the bubble under the effect of the high pressure region on the top of bubble as shown in fig 10 d finally the bubble bottom is penetrated by the liquid jet and a local high pressure region occurs on the solid wall as shown in fig 10 e from fig 10 a fig 10 d the shapes of the bubble bottom at different stages are similar except for the whole size the phenomenon indicates that the shape of the bubble bottom near wall is maintained from the initial collapse of the bubble to the moment when a liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom besides a high pressure region generated after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall the radial jet and the splash jet are also generated due to the existence of the solid wall subsequently a lateral liquid jet is generated after the splash jet acts on the bubble surface under the combined effect of both the liquid jet generated on bubble top and the lateral liquid jet the water layer between the bubble and the solid wall thickens gradually and a protrusion is also formed at the bubble bottom as shown in fig 10 f subsequently the protrusion moves away from the bubble centroid along the solid wall and the liquid jet impact region becomes wide gradually with the motion of the protrusion under the combined effect of both the radial liquid jet and the lateral liquid jet as shown in fig 10 g subsequently the bubble begins to re expand and the protrusion becomes longer under the combined effect of both the lateral liquid jet and the radial liquid jet as shown in fig 10 h and i meanwhile a local high pressure region in front of the protrusion is induced by the collision between the radial liquid jet and the outside flow with low velocity as shown in fig 10 i fig 11 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 4322 g n 70 g as shown in fig 11 a a local high pressure region is formed on the top of the bubble which is going to induce a liquid jet formed towards the solid wall at the same time the bubble presents a lamp like shape there are two reasons for the amp like shape on the one hand with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble gradually moves away from the wall during expansion therefore the effect of the solid wall on the bubble expansion becomes weak which leads to the approximate spherical shape for the bubble bottom on the other hand besides the large velocity produced on the top of the bubble the larger velocities occur on both sides of the bubble top so the bubble top move towards the solid wall and the two sides of the bubble top are squeezed toward the center which leads to the amp like shape presented in fig 11 a subsequently a thin liquid jet with high velocity is generated owing to the high pressure region on top of the bubble as shown in fig 11 b after the liquid jet penetrates the bubble a local high pressure is generated in the region where the liquid jet impacts on the liquid below the bubble as shown in fig 11 c then due to dragging of the liquid jet there is an obvious protrusion at the bubble bottom as shown in fig 11 d and the local high pressure region also moves toward the solid wall with the liquid jet motion subsequently the bubble begins to re expand and the protrusion becomes closer to the solid wall gradually although the velocity of the liquid jet decreases under the effect of the water layer there is still a high pressure produced after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall as shown in fig 11 e owing to the impediment of the solid wall the protrusion begins to move outward along the solid wall after reaches the solid wall meanwhile the liquid jet pressure decreases obviously with the decrease of the liquid jet velocity as shown in fig 11 f when the gravity parameter continues to increase the bubble motion will have different characteristics fig 12 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 6122 g n 140 g during the bubble collapse the hollow shape occurs not only at the top of the bubble but also occurs at the bottom and both sides as shown in fig 12 by comparing the bubble shapes in figs 11 and 12 a conclusion can be drawn that the larger the gravitational acceleration in the flow field the smaller the bubble volume when the liquid jet is generated as shown in fig 12 b the obvious liquid jets are generated at both ends top and bottom and sides of the bubble the liquid jets generated at sides of the bubble collide with each other first and split the bubble into two bubbles due to the collision an upward liquid jet and a downward liquid jet are generated at the collision region subsequently two toroidal bubbles occur because the upward and downward liquid jets induced by liquid jet at both sides collide with the downward and upward liquid jets generated at the ends of the bubble respectively as shown in fig 12 c the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 may also happen in other circumstances under the normal gravity environment including the bubble situated in the middle of two parallel plates the bubble below the free surface the bubble near the elastic structure the bubble near two fluid interface the bubble above the rigid wall and so on the bubble collapse shapes in different circumstances are significantly associated with the bubble size and the distance of the bubble to the boundary when the force acting on the bubble by the boundary balances with the buoyancy the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 will happen for the bubble near different boundaries there will be a certain relation between the bubble size and the distance of the bubble to the boundary to balance the boundary force acting on the bubble and the buoyancy the relations in different boundaries are described in detail by blake 1988 and blake et al 2015 using the kelvin impulse blake 1988 blake et al 2015 when the kelvin impulse equals to zeros the boundary force acting on the bubble balances with the buoyancy where the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 will happen fig 13 shows the collapse shape of the bubble with different gravity parameters when the liquid jet penetrates the bubble as shown in fig 13 a when the gravity parameter is small the attraction of the wall to the bubble is dominant therefore the bubble is close to the wall and the width of the liquid jet is relatively large as shown in fig 13 b fig 13 d with the increase of the gravity parameter the influence of the gravitational acceleration on the bubble becomes obvious and the width of the liquid jet decreases in addition the protrusion generated at the bubble bottom becomes obvious and the bubble moves away from the wall gradually fig 13 e presents the collapse shape of the bubble with the gravity parameter β 0 5418 where the liquid jet generated on the bubble top moves downward to penetrate the bubble bottom does not occur directly and the bubble is split into two bubbles by the liquid jets generated at both sides near the top of the bubble in addition since the upward liquid jet collides with the downward liquid jet formed on the bubble a small toroidal bubble is formed with the increase of the gravity parameter the positions where the side liquid jets formed are gradually shifted downward as shown in fig 13 f finally the liquid jets generated at the both ends and sides gather in the center of the bubble and the bubble is split into two toroidal bubbles with the approximate same volume fig 14 a shows the bubble radius with time at different gravity parameters in the case with the gravity parameter β 0 0517 the corresponding gravitational acceleration is equal to g the maximum bubble radius under the normal gravity environment is larger than that under hypergravity environments the difference is mainly caused by the change of the gravity parameter with the increase of the gravity parameter the ambient hydrostatic pressure in the liquid also increases the bubble motion mainly depends on the initial pressure inside the bubble and the ambient hydrostatic pressure in the liquid when the gravity parameter increases the bubble expansion will be affected by the high hydrostatic pressure in the liquid which will prevent the bubble from expanding therefore the maximum radius of the bubble under hypergravity environments is smaller than that under normal gravity environment fig 14 b presents the maximum bubble radius and minimum bubble radius under different gravity parameters under the same initial conditions the maximum bubble radius decreases with the increase of the gravity parameter for the minimum radius it decreases first and then tends to the initial radius of the bubble for the bubble with small gravity parameter the minimum radius cannot reach its initial radius due to energy dissipation when the gravity parameter is small the effect of solid wall is dominant so that a liquid jet towards the solid wall with high velocity is generated during the bubble collapse process after the bubble reaches its minimum volume the velocity of the liquid jet is still high which carries a lot of energy of the bubble so from the point of view of energy conservation the bubble cannot reach its initial radius when contracts when the gravity parameter increases to a certain range the minimum bubble radius tends to its initial radius gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble moves away from the solid wall gradually which leads to the reduction of the liquid jet strength therefore the velocity of the liquid at the minimum volume tends to its initial state gradually though the maximum radius and minimum radius under the larger gravity parameter are not presented in fig 14 b it can be concluded that the bubble will contract directly when the ambient pressure is larger than the initial pressure inside the bubble hence for the larger gravity parameter the maximum radius will equal to its initial radius and the minimum radius will decrease when the ambient pressure is larger than the initial pressure inside the bubble fig 15 presents the velocity of bubble jet tip with time under different gravity parameters as shown in fig 15 a the bubble accelerates first and then decelerates because the initial pressure inside bubbles is larger than the ambient pressure the bubble surface has an accelerated motion first as the bubble expands the pressure inside the bubble decreases and the bubble begins to decelerate when the pressure inside bubble is less than the ambient pressure since the ambient pressure increases with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble expands slowly for the large gravity parameter fig 15 b shows the liquid jet velocity with time during the bubble collapse stage under different gravity parameters the liquid jet velocity varies significantly for different gravity parameters with the increase of the gravity parameter the time of the liquid jet formation is gradually advanced and the velocity when the liquid jet penetrates the bubble is also gradually increased compared with the liquid jet under the normal gravity environment the liquid jet under the hypergravity environment takes shorter time from the formation to penetrating the bubble and has greater acceleration fig 16 presents the pressure on the center of the solid wall and the internal pressure of the bubble with time when β 0 0517 0 2829 0 4001 and 0 5166 respectively for the gravity parameter β 0 0517 a peak pressure occurs in a short time after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall subsequently the liquid jet pressure decreases gradually when the bubble approaches to its minimum volume the pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure becomes obvious gradually after the superimposition of both the pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure and the liquid jet pressure the pressure on the center of the solid wall begins to increase and appears another peak when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and then the pressure on the center of the solid wall decreases with the decrease of the bubble internal pressure when the gravity parameter β 0 2829 the time when the liquid jet impacts on solid wall is close to the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume the bubble quickly reaches its minimum volume after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall although the two peak pressure observed in fig 16 a does not occur there is a distinct slope of the pressure on the center of the solid wall near the minimum bubble volume during the pressure decreases when the gravity parameter β increases to 0 4001 the bubble reaches its minimum volume first and then a high peak pressure is generated on the center of the solid wall after both the pressure induced by the internal pressure and the pressure induced by the liquid jet are superimposed finally the pressure on the center of the solid wall decreases with exponential form when the gravity parameter β 0 5166 the time when bubble reaches its minimum volume is obviously different from the time when the liquid jet impacts on solid wall again and there are two peak pressures on the center of the solid wall the first peak pressure is induced by the bubble internal pressure when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and the second peak pressure is induced by the liquid jet when impacts on the solid wall among the results presented in fig 16 a fig 16 d the pressure on the center of the solid wall at the minimum bubble volume is less than the internal pressure of the bubble only when the buoyancy parameter β 0 5166 the first reason is that the bubble is far from the solid wall and the second reason is that the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall occurs after the bubble reaches its minimum volume so that the superposition of the two peak pressures the peak pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure and the peak pressure induced by the liquid jet when impacts on the solid wall does not occur fig 17 a presents the time when liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom the time when peak pressure is induced by liquid jet on the center of solid wall and the time when bubble reaches its minimum volume with different gravity parameters respectively and all of them decrease with the increase of the gravity parameter when β 0 3827 the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall first however when β 0 3827 the bubble reaches its minimum volume first and then the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall generally there are two obvious peak pressures if the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and the time when liquid jet impacts on the solid wall do not occur at the same time as shown in fig 17 a and fig 18 a when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 that the liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom occurs before the bubble reaches its minimum volume where the liquid jet velocity increases gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter however when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 that the liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom occurs after the bubble begins to re expand where the liquid jet velocity decreases gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble jet is associated with the gravity parameter and the distance between the bubble and the solid wall the distance is related to the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall and the gravity parameter is related to the buoyancy when the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall is dominant the bubble jet will be produced towards the solid wall when the buoyancy is dominant the bubble jet towards the solid wall will be weakened and even in severe cases it may not be produced the bubble jet velocity with different gravity parameter can be observed well using the velocity contours in fig 13 when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall is dominant where the bubble jet velocity is gradually fully developed with the increase of the gravity parameter when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the absolute value of the bubble jet velocity reaches the maximum when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the buoyancy is dominant so the bubble jet velocity is weakened gradually and when the gravity parameter β 0 5418 and 0 6735 the bubble jet towards the solid wall can no longer penetrate the bubble fig 17 b shows the pressure on the center of solid wall with different gravity parameters when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the bubble reaches its minimum volume respectively the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble when the bubble reaches its minimum volume are approximately equal when the gravity parameter β 0 0517 and 0 3827 the gravity parameter β 0 3827 is obtained by interpolating and for other gravity parameters the pressure induced by the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is larger than the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble when the bubble reaching its minimum volume when the gravity parameter β 0 3827 both the pressure at the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall and the pressure at the minimum bubble volume increase with the increase of the gravity parameter and the main reason for the increase of the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is that the velocity when the liquid jet reaches the solid wall is still very large although dissipated by the water layer the thickness of the water layer with different gravity parameters is shown in fig 18 b where the thickness of the water layer increases with the increase of the gravity parameter the main reason for the increase of the pressure at the minimum bubble volume is that the minimum bubble volume occurs after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall which results in the superimpose between the pressure induced by the liquid jet and the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble at its minimum volume when the gravity parameter β 0 3827 both the pressure at the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall and the pressure at the minimum bubble volume decrease obviously with the increase of the gravity parameter the main reason for the decrease of the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is that the dissipation of the water layer to the liquid jet velocity is obvious and the bubble expansion leads to the decrease of the liquid jet velocity there are two reasons for the decrease of the pressure at the minimum bubble volume one is that the bubble is relatively far from the solid wall the other is that the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble at its minimum volume occurs earlier than that induced by the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall which results in the less superposition of the two pressures as shown in fig 18 b the bubble centroid at its minimum volume with different gravity parameters is presented and the bubble centroid is gradually away from the solid wall with the increase of the gravity parameter 6 conclusions based on the similarity law of underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments the dynamic characteristics of explosion bubble with large weight in deep water can be simulated by the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water by changing the gravitational acceleration thus with the incompressible euler equations the collapse characteristics of bubble near a solid wall under different gravitational accelerations are studied by the finite volume method and the front tracking method the detailed conclusions are as follow 1 when the gravity parameter is small the bubble attaches to the solid wall tightly and a wider liquid jet is produced with the increase of the gravity parameter the width of the liquid jet decreases obviously besides the bubble moves away from the wall and the thickness of the water layer between the bubble and the wall increases gradually 2 with the change of the gravity parameter the formation position of the bubble jet will change the bubble will be split into two sub toroidal bubbles by the lateral jet the upward jet and the downward jet when the gravity parameter reaches a certain range 3 the time when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume decrease with the increase of the gravity parameter and if the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume is obviously different from the time when liquid jet impacts on the solid wall two peak pressures on the solid wall will be produced when β 0 3827 only one maximum peak pressure on the solid wall is produced that the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall occurs before the bubble reaches its minimum volume when β 0 3827 however both are contrary when β 0 3827 4 when β 0 4900 the liquid jet velocity increases with the increase of the gravity parameter and the liquid jet velocity reaches the maximum value when β 0 4900 however when β 0 4900 the liquid jet velocity decreases with the increase of the gravity parameter credit authorship contribution statement liangtao liu conceptualization methodology validation writing original draftwriting original draft ning gan software

21121,bubble has significant applications in ocean engineering aiming at the difficulty of conducting the underwater explosion bubble experiment with large charge in deep water this paper adopts a new way to deal with this problem on the basis of similarity theory it is found that by considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water can be realized by changing the gravitational acceleration with the assumption that the liquid is inviscid and incompressible the bubble dynamics are solved by the euler equations with the finite volume method and the motion of the bubble interface is tracked by the front tracking method based on this model the bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments are studied systematically the results show that the bubble motion the formation position of the bubble jet the liquid jet velocity and the pressure induced by the bubble will change significantly under different hypergravity environments keywords bubble collapse hypergravity environment finite volume method front tracking method 1 introduction dynamic characteristics of bubble have been researched for many decades in different fields such as ocean engineering and military ge et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 bubble dynamics has a significant effect on the strength of the nearby structures which may lead to local and overall damage on the submarine when the submarine is subjected to the underwater explosion with large charge in deep water therefore for knowing more about the destruction mechanism of the bubble bubble dynamics near a wall should be investigated however for the underwater explosion experiment the researches on the bubble dynamics with large charge in deep water are always difficult due to the limitation of test methods so the scaled model test is a reasonable and feasible alternative in order to realize the transformation between the scaled model and the prototype some parameters of the scaled model test may be changed such as charge weight geometry size and ambient pressure on the basis of similarity theory it is found that by considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water can be realized by changing the gravitational acceleration although the bubble dynamics has been investigated for many researchers the bubble dynamics under different gravitational accelerations are not very clear consequently the bubble collapse near a solid wall with different gravitational accelerations is studied in this paper researches on underwater explosion problems have been lasting for a long time based on the previous work cole 1948 summarized the characteristics of the underwater explosion subsequently some analytical models about underwater explosion loads were proposed among these models a widely used model was proposed by geers and hunter 2002 where the underwater explosion loads were split into two parts the shock wave load and the bubble load and the initial conditions of the bubble phase were given by the shock wave phase the research of geers and hunter 2002 mainly focused on a moderately deep underwater explosion without considering the influence of nearby structure subsequently the underwater explosion experiments near some simple and complex structures were investigated by some researchers cui et al 2016 ge et al 2017 hung and hwangfu 2010 jin et al 2019 klaseboer et al 2005a zhang et al 2013 2017 in addition with the development of the software and hardware of the computer numerical investigations on the interaction between underwater explosion bubbles and structures were conducted extensively hsu et al 2014 huang et al 2015 klaseboer et al 2005a 2005b li et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2008 2014 2017 zhang and zong 2012 based on the above experimental and numerical results different underwater explosion features such as the deformation characteristics of bubble the pressure distribution in the flow field and the dynamic responses of structure were investigated to understand the mechanism of the bubble dynamics experimental researches mentioned above mainly focus on the underwater explosion with small charge in shallow water and the underwater explosion experiment with large charge in deep water was rarely studied in recent years the scaled model test is a useful method to realize the research on the underwater explosion with large charge in deep water in the scaled model test the mach similarity for shock wave and the froude similarity for bubble dynamics should be satisfied the peak pressure of the shock wave is gpa so the hydrostatic pressure has less effect on the similarity of the shock wave propagation in the scaled model and the prototype where the condition of the mach similarity can be satisfied gel fand and takayama 2004 hu et al 2017 the bubble dynamics are affected by the hydrostatic pressure so the froude similarity must be guaranteed most researches on the scaled model test are carried out with constant gravity environment but the mach similarity and the froude similarity are not realized simultaneously under the constant gravity environment hu et al 2017 fortunately the acceleration of the test system can be changed to meet the requirements for dimensionless similarity in centrifuge test where the mach similarity and the froude similarity can be satisfied simultaneously initially centrifuge tests were mainly used for underground explosion problems de 2008 fan et al 2012 hansen and pak 2016 and then the centrifuge test was introduced into the underwater explosion research de et al 2017 ge et al 2017 hu et al 2017 long et al 2017 vanadit ellis and davis 2010 vanadit ellis and davis 2010 investigated the dynamic response of the small scaled model of a concrete gravity dam subjected to the underwater explosion and the damage characteristics of the model dam were studied de et al 2017 studied the effects of an underwater explosion on a tunnel buried below submerged ground using a combination of physical model tests and the comparison between numerical and experimental results was conducted based on the dimensional analysis hu et al 2017 presented the similarity law of the underwater explosion where the mach similarity and the froude similarity are satisfied under the hypergravity environment the results of a series of tests indicate that the peak pressure and time constant of the shock wave were not affected by the change of hydrostatic pressure or gravitational acceleration when the number related to scaled distance is constant and the same conclusion can be drawn for dimensionless bubble parameters such as bubble maximum radius and pulsation period when the number related to the effect of buoyancy is constant according to the previous work of hu et al 2017 a group of tests were conducted by long et al 2017 to investigate the dynamic response of a fixed steel plate subjected to the underwater explosion under the hypergravity environment the researches of hu et al 2017 and long et al 2017 illustrated that the centrifuge apparatus is a meaningful and promising tool to study the underwater explosion at the same time the underwater explosion shock wave and bubble pulsation were investigated experimentally and numerically using the geotechnical centrifuge apparatus and ls dyna by ge et al 2017 where the shock wave and the bubble pulsation in accordance with the centrifugal similarity was proved in order to simulate the underwater explosion under different gravitational accelerations wang et al 2019 investigated the effects of equation state of water and mesh size on numerical results by using commercial software ansys autodyn so far a few researches had been done on the bubble dynamics near a structure under different hypergravity environments in addition the bubble dynamics near a structure under different hypergravity environments are significant for research on the underwater explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore in this paper the bubble collapse near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments is investigated 2 similarity law of underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments in order to study the dynamic characteristics of the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water by using the small charge in shallow water the similarity law of the underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments should be summarized first in this paper we are mainly concerned with the bubble collapse near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments so the shock wave stage is not considered the quantities characterizing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics mainly include the peak pressure p b m induced by bubble pulsation the bubble pulsation period t b the maximum radius of bubble r m and the jet velocity of bubble v j e t meanwhile the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are usually influenced by many quantities such as the charge density ρ c h arg e the radius of charge r c h arg e the explosion energy of charge q the position for the pressure and velocity in the liquid r d the distance between structure and charge centroid d the hydrostatic pressure in the flow field p s the depth of charge h the density of liquid ρ w a t e r and the gravitational acceleration g since the size of the explosion bubble is large the surface tension and the viscosity of liquid are neglected in the present study the quantities characterizing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are called as dependent variables and the quantities influencing the underwater explosion bubble dynamics are called as independent variables table 1 presents the dimension of the independent and dependent variables relationship between independent variables and dependent variables can be written as follows

should satisfy the relationship ge et al 2017 hu et al 2017 tan 2011 3 π i m π i p where i 1 2 3 10 and the superscript p and m represent the prototype and the scaled model respectively usually the charge type and the liquid used in the scaled model and the prototype are same so the properties of the charge and the liquid are constant including the density of charge ρ c h arg e the explosion energy of charge q and the density of liquid ρ w a t e r in order to satisfy the geometric similarity an assumption that the similarity coefficient n l p l m is used so r c h arg e p r c h arg e m n from eq 3 the relationships of independent variables between the scaled model and the prototype can be derived 4a π 6 p π 6 m r d p r d m n 4b π 7 p π 7 m g p g m 1 n 4c π 8 p π 8 m p s p p s m 1 4d π

satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water therefore in order to know more about the bubble dynamics in deep water it is valuable to investigate the bubble collapse under different hypergravity environments it should be noted that the similar relationships between the scaled model and the prototype in eqs 4a 4i are the general forms where the froude similarity is also satisfied 3 governing equations and numerical model 3 1 governing equations for liquid and gas the underwater explosion bubble belongs to the high pressure bubble so the bubble induced by the high pressure under different hypergravity environments will be studied in the present work because the velocity in liquid induced by the bubble is smaller than the sound speed in liquid the compressibility of liquid is not considered though the liquid jet velocity induced by the bubble can reach 100 200 m s in some conditions the duration of the liquid jet with high velocity is very short which has no significant effect on the bubble motion li et al 2016 liu et al 2017b wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 with the incompressible assumption of liquid the spherical bubble expansion and contraction in the free filed without gravity can be expressed by the rayleigh plesset equation plesset and prosperetti 1977 which can used be illustrated the influence of the liquid viscosity on the bubble motion the rayleigh plesset equation is expressed as follows 5 r r 3 2 r 2 1 ρ p c p 0 r 0 r 3 ϑ p 2 σ r 4 μ r r where r is the bubble radius r is the velocity of the bubble surface r is the acceleration of the bubble surface ρ is the density of liquid p c is the constant vapor pressure p 0 is initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble when the initial bubble radius is r 0 and ϑ denotes the ratio of specific heats p is the infinite pressure σ is the coefficient of surface tension μ is the coefficient of the liquid viscosity the influence of the liquid viscosity on the bubble motion is significantly associated with the bubble size when the bubble motion will not affected by the liquid viscosity the corresponding size range of the bubble can be determined using the rayleigh plesset equation in the present study the initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble p 0 7 5 10 6 pa the constant vapor pressure p c 2338pa the infinite pressure p 1 01 10 5 pa the ratio of specific heats ϑ 1 4 the coefficient of surface tension σ 0 072 k g s 2 and the coefficient of the liquid viscosity μ 0 001 k g m s by changing the initial bubble radius the influence of the liquid viscosity on the ratio r m 2 r m 1 is calculated using the rayleigh plesset equation in fig 1 where r m 1 denotes the maximum radius of the first pulsation of bubble and r m 2 denotes the maximum radius of the second pulsation of bubble when r m 2 r m 1 1 it indicates that the liquid viscosity has no influence on the bubble motion as shown in fig 1 when the initial bubble radius r 0 2 10 4 m the ratio r m 2 r m 1 1 so the liquid viscosity has no influence on the bubble motion when r 0 2 10 4 m in the present study the initial bubble radius chosen is much larger than 2 10 4 m so the liquid viscosity can be neglected therefore the incompressible euler equations are used to calculate the bubble dynamics as shown in fig 2 an axisymmetric bubble near a solid wall under different hypergravity environments is studied thus the euler equations in cylindrical coordinate system can be written as liu et al 2017a 6a 1 r r u r r u z z 0 6b u r t 1 r r u r 2 r u r u z z φ r 6c u z t 1 r r u r u z r u z 2 z φ z g n where u r and u z denote the velocity along the direction of coordinate axis r and z respectively φ p ρ where p is the pressure in liquid and ρ is the density of liquid and g n represents the acceleration in hypergravity environment whose subscript denotes n times of the gravitational acceleration g the pressure inside the bubble is obtained by using an equation of state instead of solving the euler equations which converts the two phase flow problem into the single phase flow problem the gas inside the bubble is considered to be homogeneous which consists of a constant vapor pressure and non condensable volume dependent gas pressure under the assumptions mentioned above a simple model with adiabatic process brujan et al 2002 liu et al 2017a 2020 is used to obtain the pressure inside the bubble which can be expressed as 7 p g p c p 0 v 0 v ϑ where p g denotes the pressure inside the bubble when the bubble volume is v p c is the constant vapor pressure p 0 is initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble when the initial bubble volume is v 0 and ϑ denotes the ratio of specific heats 3 2 the euler equations solver the incompressible euler equations are discretized by the finite volume method on a uniform cartesian mesh as shown in fig 3 a the strategy of staggered grid is used and the control volumes of pressure ω i j and velocities ω i 1 2 j ω i j 1 2 are presented in addition ω denotes the boundary of the control volume there are three types for the mesh cell full cell filled with liquid denoted by f empty cell without liquid denoted by e and surface cell that contains the interface between liquid and gas denoted by s for the sake of generality the discrete form of the euler equations in the surface cell s will be given as shown in fig 3 b the integral form of the euler equations can be expressed as 8a ω i j i n t r u z d z i n t r u z d z ω i j i n t r u r d r i n t r u r d r 0 8b t ω i

i j 1 2 g n r d r d z ω i j 1 2 i n t r φ d r i n t r φ d r where the subscripts i and j denote the center of the cell the subscripts i 1 2 and j 1 2 denote the center of the cell faces which correspond to the center of the control volume of velocity and the subscript i n t denotes the integral along the interface in order to obtain the velocity at the next time step the forward euler scheme is utilized for the transient term moukalled et al 2015 and the process of solving the momentum equations is divided into two parts the first part computes the temporary velocities from eqs 8b and 8c without the pressure gradient terms but the contribution of the pressure along the interface is taken into account popinet and zaleski 2002 therefore the temporary velocities u i 1 2 j u i j 1 2 can be calculated based on the current velocities u i 1 2 j n u i j 1 2 n liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 9a u i 1 2 j u i 1 2 j n δ t ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j r u r n 2 d z ω i 1 2 j r u

rest pressure is added and the velocities in next time step u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 can be expressed as 10a u i 1 2 j n 1 u i 1 2 j δ t ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j i n t r φ n d z ω i 1 2 j φ n d r d z 10b u i j 1 2 n 1 u i j 1 2 δ t ξ i j 1 2 z ω i j 1 2 i n t r φ n d r where ξ i 1 2 j r ω i 1 2 j r d r d z and ξ i j 1 2 z ω i j 1 2 r d r d z since the velocities are considered to be uniform in the control volume the velocities u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 obtained from eqs 10a and 10b should satisfy the non divergence condition substituting the velocities at time step n 1 into the continuity eq 8a and the pressure term φ n can be calculated by the discrete version of the continuity equation with boundary conditions the pressure term φ n can be obtained using multi grid accelerated gauss seidel relaxation method after that substituting the result of pressure gradient term into eqs 10a and 10b the velocity u i 1 2 j n 1 u i j 1 2 n 1 can be obtained 3 3 interface tracking after the velocity field is obtained the interface of bubble should be updated here the interface consists of a series of marker particles and the position of the marker particle is calculated using the forward euler scheme liu et al 2017a 2018 popinet and zaleski 2002 11 x m a r k e r n 1 x m a r k e r n δ t u m a r k e r n 1 where x m a r k e r n 1 denotes the position of the marker particle at time step n 1 x m a r k e r n denotes the position of the marker particle at time step n and u m a r k e r n 1 denotes the velocity of the corresponding marker particle at time step n 1 the velocity of the marker particle u m a r k e r n 1 is interpolated from flow field for example when a marker particle is located in the velocity control volume ω i 1 2 j the r component of the marker particle velocity can be expressed as 12a u m a r k e r r u i 1 2 j u i 1 2 j 2 h r i 1 r u i 1 2 j u i 3 2 j 2 h r r i similarly if a marker particle is located in the velocity control volume ω i j 1 2 the z component of the marker particle velocity can be expressed as 12b u m a r k e r z u i j 1 2 u i j 1 2 2 h z j 1 z u i j 1 2 u i j 3 2 2 h z z j where h is the height of the cell r and z are the position of the marker particle r i and z j denote the position of the gird sometimes the center of velocity control volume may be located in the empty cells cells marked by the symbol e in fig 3 where the velocity of the control volume is missing according to the work of popinet and zaleski 2002 the missing velocity can be obtained using lagrange multiplier method in the present work since the viscosity of liquid is not taken into account the missing velocity is obtained using the least square method utilized in liu et al 2017a after the marker particles are updated the distribution of the marker particles along the interface may become non uniform which may lead to interfacial instability therefore the redistribution of the marker particles should be done in the present work a cubic splines method popinet and zaleski 1999 is utilized at each time step for the redistribution of the marker particles in addition a liquid jet with high velocity will penetrate the bubble surface when bubble collapses and the topology of the marker particles along the interface will be changed the treatment of the topology change is done using a simplified method introduced by liu et al 2017a 4 validation for numerical model and similarity law 4 1 validation for numerical model in this section the rayleigh plesset equation for bubble motion is used to validate the numerical model adopted in the present study the initial conditions and boundary conditions for the numerical model need to be given the initial bubble radius r 0 0 01 the initial non condensable gas pressure inside the bubble p 0 1 01 10 6 pa the constant vapor pressure p c 2338pa the infinite pressure p 1 01 10 5 pa the ratio of specific heats ϑ 1 4 the bubble size we study is large so the liquid viscosity and the surface tension of the bubble are neglected the rayleigh plesset equation is derived under the assumption of infinite pressure so the boundary conditions for the other boundaries except for the symmetric axis boundary in the numerical model are set as the infinite pressure actually the size of computational domain in the numerical model cannot be set to infinity so the convergence for the size of computational domain also needs to be verified so the influence of the size of computational domain on the numerical results needs to be considered when verifying the numerical model the bubble is set in the center of the computational domain the governing equations are discretized in staggered uniform grids and the number of mesh can refer to the literatures liu et al 2020 which is set as 1026 1026 in fig 4 the comparison between the numerical results in different size of computational domain and the rayleigh plesset equation is displayed and the corresponding errors are displayed in table 2 the size of computational domain has little effect on the maximum radius r m and the maximum error for the maximum radius is less than 0 34 however the effect of the size of computational domain on the bubble pulsation period t b is evident the maximum error has 8 16 when the size of computational domain is set as 5 r m with the increase of the size of computational domain the maximum error for the bubble pulsation period decreases the maximum error for the bubble pulsation period only has 0 41 when the size of computational domain reaches 30 r m besides the maximum radius and the pulsation period the bubble radius with time between the numerical model and the rayleigh plesset equation also agrees well with each other when the size of computational domain reaches 30 r m so the results obtained by the numerical model are accurate when the size of computational domain is 30 r m all calculations for this paper the size of computational domain is set as 30 r m and the number of mesh is set as 1026 1026 4 2 validation for similarity law in this section based on the numerical model three cases are used to validate the similarity law in section 2 and the three cases are displayed in table 3 the case model 1 denotes the prototype and the cases model 2 and mode 4 denote the scaled model the initial conditions for the three cases in table 3 satisfy the relationships of independent variables between the prototype and the scaled model in eqs 4a 4e in fig 5 the comparison of the bubble motion in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 is displayed where the bubble shape and the corresponding time in the cases model 2 and model 4 have been transformed using the similarity coefficient n 2 and n 4 respectively the transformed bubble shapes in the cases model 2 and model 4 are identical with those in the case model 1 so the bubble shapes in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 satisfy the similarity law in fig 6 fig 9 the comparisons of the bubble radius the bubble centroid the jet velocity and the jet pressure in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 are displayed respectively the results in fig 6 a fig 9 a are not transformed and the results of the cases model 2 and model 4 in fig 6 b fig 9 b have been transformed using the similarity coefficient n 2 and n 4 respectively evidently the transformed results of the bubble radius the bubble centroid the jet velocity and the jet pressure in the cases model 2 and model 4 are identical with those in the case model 1 so the results in the case model 1 the case model 2 and the case model 4 satisfy the similarity law so based on the similarity law in section 2 the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water when considering the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration 5 results and discussion for the sake of generalization non dimensionlization is conducted for numerical results using some fundamental quantities table 4 presents the fundamental quantities and dimensionless quantities here the maximum bubble radius r m is chosen as the fundamental quantity of length p ρ 1 2 represents the fundamental quantity of velocity r m ρ p 1 2 denotes the fundamental quantity of time and far field pressure p is chosen as the fundamental quantity of pressure in addition the strength parameter ε p 0 p represents the initial pressure inside bubble the gravity parameter β ρ g n r m p 1 2 represents gravitational acceleration the stand off distance parameter γ d r m is the dimensionless distance between the initial position of bubble and a solid wall the definition of gravity parameter β is similar to the buoyancy parameter δ used widely in research on the underwater explosion problems but the emphasis of the two parameters is different the buoyancy parameter is adjusted by changing the bubble radius however the gravity parameter is adjusted by changing the gravitational acceleration in centrifuge therefore the two parameters have different physical meanings and also have different guiding meanings for the experiment based on the similarity law in section 2 the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water can satisfy the similar relationship with the explosion bubble with large charge in deep water when the scaling relationship of gravitational acceleration is considered therefore in order to know more about the bubble dynamics in deep water the influences of the gravity parameter on the bubble collapse characteristics near a solid wall are studied in this section the non dimensional initial bubble radius r 0 r 0 r m 0 1818 the strength parameter ε 74 3 and the stand off distance parameter γ 0 8 are used in the whole research the size of computational domain is 30 r m and the number of uniform mesh is set to 1026 1026 fig 10 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 2310 g n 20 g from the initial collapse of the bubble to the generation of the liquid jet due to the increase of the gravity parameter the upper shape of the bubble is different from the case with small gravity parameter in the case with small gravity parameter the upper shape of the bubble is approximates to spherical form liu et al 2017a but the upper shape of the bubble presents an inverted bowl like shape when gravitational acceleration is 20 g as shown in fig 10 a the reason for this phenomenon is that the velocity on both sides of the bubble top is relatively large in addition to the large velocity generated on the top of the bubble meanwhile the bubble bottom is flat due to the effect of the solid wall although the initial distance from the bubble centroid to the solid wall is smaller than the maximum bubble radius a water layer still exists between the solid wall and the bubble after that a local high pressure region is generated on the top of the bubble and a high speed liquid jet is formed due to the high pressure region as shown in fig 10 b and c at the same time the bubble top has an overall downward motion owing to the combined effects of both the liquid jet and the velocities on both sides of the bubble top subsequently the liquid jet continues developing inside the bubble under the effect of the high pressure region on the top of bubble as shown in fig 10 d finally the bubble bottom is penetrated by the liquid jet and a local high pressure region occurs on the solid wall as shown in fig 10 e from fig 10 a fig 10 d the shapes of the bubble bottom at different stages are similar except for the whole size the phenomenon indicates that the shape of the bubble bottom near wall is maintained from the initial collapse of the bubble to the moment when a liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom besides a high pressure region generated after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall the radial jet and the splash jet are also generated due to the existence of the solid wall subsequently a lateral liquid jet is generated after the splash jet acts on the bubble surface under the combined effect of both the liquid jet generated on bubble top and the lateral liquid jet the water layer between the bubble and the solid wall thickens gradually and a protrusion is also formed at the bubble bottom as shown in fig 10 f subsequently the protrusion moves away from the bubble centroid along the solid wall and the liquid jet impact region becomes wide gradually with the motion of the protrusion under the combined effect of both the radial liquid jet and the lateral liquid jet as shown in fig 10 g subsequently the bubble begins to re expand and the protrusion becomes longer under the combined effect of both the lateral liquid jet and the radial liquid jet as shown in fig 10 h and i meanwhile a local high pressure region in front of the protrusion is induced by the collision between the radial liquid jet and the outside flow with low velocity as shown in fig 10 i fig 11 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 4322 g n 70 g as shown in fig 11 a a local high pressure region is formed on the top of the bubble which is going to induce a liquid jet formed towards the solid wall at the same time the bubble presents a lamp like shape there are two reasons for the amp like shape on the one hand with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble gradually moves away from the wall during expansion therefore the effect of the solid wall on the bubble expansion becomes weak which leads to the approximate spherical shape for the bubble bottom on the other hand besides the large velocity produced on the top of the bubble the larger velocities occur on both sides of the bubble top so the bubble top move towards the solid wall and the two sides of the bubble top are squeezed toward the center which leads to the amp like shape presented in fig 11 a subsequently a thin liquid jet with high velocity is generated owing to the high pressure region on top of the bubble as shown in fig 11 b after the liquid jet penetrates the bubble a local high pressure is generated in the region where the liquid jet impacts on the liquid below the bubble as shown in fig 11 c then due to dragging of the liquid jet there is an obvious protrusion at the bubble bottom as shown in fig 11 d and the local high pressure region also moves toward the solid wall with the liquid jet motion subsequently the bubble begins to re expand and the protrusion becomes closer to the solid wall gradually although the velocity of the liquid jet decreases under the effect of the water layer there is still a high pressure produced after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall as shown in fig 11 e owing to the impediment of the solid wall the protrusion begins to move outward along the solid wall after reaches the solid wall meanwhile the liquid jet pressure decreases obviously with the decrease of the liquid jet velocity as shown in fig 11 f when the gravity parameter continues to increase the bubble motion will have different characteristics fig 12 presents the collapse process of the bubble when the gravity parameter β 0 6122 g n 140 g during the bubble collapse the hollow shape occurs not only at the top of the bubble but also occurs at the bottom and both sides as shown in fig 12 by comparing the bubble shapes in figs 11 and 12 a conclusion can be drawn that the larger the gravitational acceleration in the flow field the smaller the bubble volume when the liquid jet is generated as shown in fig 12 b the obvious liquid jets are generated at both ends top and bottom and sides of the bubble the liquid jets generated at sides of the bubble collide with each other first and split the bubble into two bubbles due to the collision an upward liquid jet and a downward liquid jet are generated at the collision region subsequently two toroidal bubbles occur because the upward and downward liquid jets induced by liquid jet at both sides collide with the downward and upward liquid jets generated at the ends of the bubble respectively as shown in fig 12 c the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 may also happen in other circumstances under the normal gravity environment including the bubble situated in the middle of two parallel plates the bubble below the free surface the bubble near the elastic structure the bubble near two fluid interface the bubble above the rigid wall and so on the bubble collapse shapes in different circumstances are significantly associated with the bubble size and the distance of the bubble to the boundary when the force acting on the bubble by the boundary balances with the buoyancy the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 will happen for the bubble near different boundaries there will be a certain relation between the bubble size and the distance of the bubble to the boundary to balance the boundary force acting on the bubble and the buoyancy the relations in different boundaries are described in detail by blake 1988 and blake et al 2015 using the kelvin impulse blake 1988 blake et al 2015 when the kelvin impulse equals to zeros the boundary force acting on the bubble balances with the buoyancy where the similar split pattern of the bubble presented in fig 12 will happen fig 13 shows the collapse shape of the bubble with different gravity parameters when the liquid jet penetrates the bubble as shown in fig 13 a when the gravity parameter is small the attraction of the wall to the bubble is dominant therefore the bubble is close to the wall and the width of the liquid jet is relatively large as shown in fig 13 b fig 13 d with the increase of the gravity parameter the influence of the gravitational acceleration on the bubble becomes obvious and the width of the liquid jet decreases in addition the protrusion generated at the bubble bottom becomes obvious and the bubble moves away from the wall gradually fig 13 e presents the collapse shape of the bubble with the gravity parameter β 0 5418 where the liquid jet generated on the bubble top moves downward to penetrate the bubble bottom does not occur directly and the bubble is split into two bubbles by the liquid jets generated at both sides near the top of the bubble in addition since the upward liquid jet collides with the downward liquid jet formed on the bubble a small toroidal bubble is formed with the increase of the gravity parameter the positions where the side liquid jets formed are gradually shifted downward as shown in fig 13 f finally the liquid jets generated at the both ends and sides gather in the center of the bubble and the bubble is split into two toroidal bubbles with the approximate same volume fig 14 a shows the bubble radius with time at different gravity parameters in the case with the gravity parameter β 0 0517 the corresponding gravitational acceleration is equal to g the maximum bubble radius under the normal gravity environment is larger than that under hypergravity environments the difference is mainly caused by the change of the gravity parameter with the increase of the gravity parameter the ambient hydrostatic pressure in the liquid also increases the bubble motion mainly depends on the initial pressure inside the bubble and the ambient hydrostatic pressure in the liquid when the gravity parameter increases the bubble expansion will be affected by the high hydrostatic pressure in the liquid which will prevent the bubble from expanding therefore the maximum radius of the bubble under hypergravity environments is smaller than that under normal gravity environment fig 14 b presents the maximum bubble radius and minimum bubble radius under different gravity parameters under the same initial conditions the maximum bubble radius decreases with the increase of the gravity parameter for the minimum radius it decreases first and then tends to the initial radius of the bubble for the bubble with small gravity parameter the minimum radius cannot reach its initial radius due to energy dissipation when the gravity parameter is small the effect of solid wall is dominant so that a liquid jet towards the solid wall with high velocity is generated during the bubble collapse process after the bubble reaches its minimum volume the velocity of the liquid jet is still high which carries a lot of energy of the bubble so from the point of view of energy conservation the bubble cannot reach its initial radius when contracts when the gravity parameter increases to a certain range the minimum bubble radius tends to its initial radius gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble moves away from the solid wall gradually which leads to the reduction of the liquid jet strength therefore the velocity of the liquid at the minimum volume tends to its initial state gradually though the maximum radius and minimum radius under the larger gravity parameter are not presented in fig 14 b it can be concluded that the bubble will contract directly when the ambient pressure is larger than the initial pressure inside the bubble hence for the larger gravity parameter the maximum radius will equal to its initial radius and the minimum radius will decrease when the ambient pressure is larger than the initial pressure inside the bubble fig 15 presents the velocity of bubble jet tip with time under different gravity parameters as shown in fig 15 a the bubble accelerates first and then decelerates because the initial pressure inside bubbles is larger than the ambient pressure the bubble surface has an accelerated motion first as the bubble expands the pressure inside the bubble decreases and the bubble begins to decelerate when the pressure inside bubble is less than the ambient pressure since the ambient pressure increases with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble expands slowly for the large gravity parameter fig 15 b shows the liquid jet velocity with time during the bubble collapse stage under different gravity parameters the liquid jet velocity varies significantly for different gravity parameters with the increase of the gravity parameter the time of the liquid jet formation is gradually advanced and the velocity when the liquid jet penetrates the bubble is also gradually increased compared with the liquid jet under the normal gravity environment the liquid jet under the hypergravity environment takes shorter time from the formation to penetrating the bubble and has greater acceleration fig 16 presents the pressure on the center of the solid wall and the internal pressure of the bubble with time when β 0 0517 0 2829 0 4001 and 0 5166 respectively for the gravity parameter β 0 0517 a peak pressure occurs in a short time after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall subsequently the liquid jet pressure decreases gradually when the bubble approaches to its minimum volume the pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure becomes obvious gradually after the superimposition of both the pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure and the liquid jet pressure the pressure on the center of the solid wall begins to increase and appears another peak when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and then the pressure on the center of the solid wall decreases with the decrease of the bubble internal pressure when the gravity parameter β 0 2829 the time when the liquid jet impacts on solid wall is close to the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume the bubble quickly reaches its minimum volume after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall although the two peak pressure observed in fig 16 a does not occur there is a distinct slope of the pressure on the center of the solid wall near the minimum bubble volume during the pressure decreases when the gravity parameter β increases to 0 4001 the bubble reaches its minimum volume first and then a high peak pressure is generated on the center of the solid wall after both the pressure induced by the internal pressure and the pressure induced by the liquid jet are superimposed finally the pressure on the center of the solid wall decreases with exponential form when the gravity parameter β 0 5166 the time when bubble reaches its minimum volume is obviously different from the time when the liquid jet impacts on solid wall again and there are two peak pressures on the center of the solid wall the first peak pressure is induced by the bubble internal pressure when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and the second peak pressure is induced by the liquid jet when impacts on the solid wall among the results presented in fig 16 a fig 16 d the pressure on the center of the solid wall at the minimum bubble volume is less than the internal pressure of the bubble only when the buoyancy parameter β 0 5166 the first reason is that the bubble is far from the solid wall and the second reason is that the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall occurs after the bubble reaches its minimum volume so that the superposition of the two peak pressures the peak pressure induced by the bubble internal pressure and the peak pressure induced by the liquid jet when impacts on the solid wall does not occur fig 17 a presents the time when liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom the time when peak pressure is induced by liquid jet on the center of solid wall and the time when bubble reaches its minimum volume with different gravity parameters respectively and all of them decrease with the increase of the gravity parameter when β 0 3827 the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall first however when β 0 3827 the bubble reaches its minimum volume first and then the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall generally there are two obvious peak pressures if the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume and the time when liquid jet impacts on the solid wall do not occur at the same time as shown in fig 17 a and fig 18 a when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 that the liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom occurs before the bubble reaches its minimum volume where the liquid jet velocity increases gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter however when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 that the liquid jet penetrates the bubble bottom occurs after the bubble begins to re expand where the liquid jet velocity decreases gradually with the increase of the gravity parameter the bubble jet is associated with the gravity parameter and the distance between the bubble and the solid wall the distance is related to the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall and the gravity parameter is related to the buoyancy when the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall is dominant the bubble jet will be produced towards the solid wall when the buoyancy is dominant the bubble jet towards the solid wall will be weakened and even in severe cases it may not be produced the bubble jet velocity with different gravity parameter can be observed well using the velocity contours in fig 13 when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the force acting on the bubble by the solid wall is dominant where the bubble jet velocity is gradually fully developed with the increase of the gravity parameter when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the absolute value of the bubble jet velocity reaches the maximum when the gravity parameter β 0 4900 the buoyancy is dominant so the bubble jet velocity is weakened gradually and when the gravity parameter β 0 5418 and 0 6735 the bubble jet towards the solid wall can no longer penetrate the bubble fig 17 b shows the pressure on the center of solid wall with different gravity parameters when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the bubble reaches its minimum volume respectively the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble when the bubble reaches its minimum volume are approximately equal when the gravity parameter β 0 0517 and 0 3827 the gravity parameter β 0 3827 is obtained by interpolating and for other gravity parameters the pressure induced by the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is larger than the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble when the bubble reaching its minimum volume when the gravity parameter β 0 3827 both the pressure at the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall and the pressure at the minimum bubble volume increase with the increase of the gravity parameter and the main reason for the increase of the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is that the velocity when the liquid jet reaches the solid wall is still very large although dissipated by the water layer the thickness of the water layer with different gravity parameters is shown in fig 18 b where the thickness of the water layer increases with the increase of the gravity parameter the main reason for the increase of the pressure at the minimum bubble volume is that the minimum bubble volume occurs after the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall which results in the superimpose between the pressure induced by the liquid jet and the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble at its minimum volume when the gravity parameter β 0 3827 both the pressure at the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall and the pressure at the minimum bubble volume decrease obviously with the increase of the gravity parameter the main reason for the decrease of the pressure when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall is that the dissipation of the water layer to the liquid jet velocity is obvious and the bubble expansion leads to the decrease of the liquid jet velocity there are two reasons for the decrease of the pressure at the minimum bubble volume one is that the bubble is relatively far from the solid wall the other is that the pressure induced by the internal pressure of the bubble at its minimum volume occurs earlier than that induced by the liquid jet impacting on the solid wall which results in the less superposition of the two pressures as shown in fig 18 b the bubble centroid at its minimum volume with different gravity parameters is presented and the bubble centroid is gradually away from the solid wall with the increase of the gravity parameter 6 conclusions based on the similarity law of underwater explosion bubble in the hypergravity environments the dynamic characteristics of explosion bubble with large weight in deep water can be simulated by the explosion bubble with small charge in shallow water by changing the gravitational acceleration thus with the incompressible euler equations the collapse characteristics of bubble near a solid wall under different gravitational accelerations are studied by the finite volume method and the front tracking method the detailed conclusions are as follow 1 when the gravity parameter is small the bubble attaches to the solid wall tightly and a wider liquid jet is produced with the increase of the gravity parameter the width of the liquid jet decreases obviously besides the bubble moves away from the wall and the thickness of the water layer between the bubble and the wall increases gradually 2 with the change of the gravity parameter the formation position of the bubble jet will change the bubble will be split into two sub toroidal bubbles by the lateral jet the upward jet and the downward jet when the gravity parameter reaches a certain range 3 the time when the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall and the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume decrease with the increase of the gravity parameter and if the time when the bubble reaches its minimum volume is obviously different from the time when liquid jet impacts on the solid wall two peak pressures on the solid wall will be produced when β 0 3827 only one maximum peak pressure on the solid wall is produced that the liquid jet impacts on the solid wall occurs before the bubble reaches its minimum volume when β 0 3827 however both are contrary when β 0 3827 4 when β 0 4900 the liquid jet velocity increases with the increase of the gravity parameter and the liquid jet velocity reaches the maximum value when β 0 4900 however when β 0 4900 the liquid jet velocity decreases with the increase of the gravity parameter credit authorship contribution statement liangtao liu conceptualization methodology validation writing original draftwriting original draft ning gan software

results reveal the advantage and effectiveness of this work keywords underactuated underwater vehicles input quantization backstepping control neural network 1 introduction recently the autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have been extensively researched attributing to their promising application values in marine missions involving environmental monitoring marine culture ocean explorations etc being one of the most attractive technologies of auvs or other marine vehicles gao et al 2019 gao and guo 2020a tracking control technologies always enable the system to follow the desired trajectory with satisfactory performance however there still exist some obstacles to construct controllers for auvs on account of the highly coupled nonlinear hydrodynamics complex ocean disturbances and limited hardware performance despite of these challenges numerous efforts have been paid to solve this issue and fruitful results are obtained based on backstepping methods li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 sliding mode control approaches elmokadema et al 2017 yu et al 2014 patre et al 2018 liu et al 2016 gao and guo 2020b model predictive control schemes shen et al 2018 gan et al 2018 2019 gan et al 2018 fuzzy logic control technologies yu et al 2018 zhang and wu 2020 sun et al 2019 chen et al 2016 and neural network control architectures wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 elhaki and shojaei 2018 liu et al 2019a b cui et al 2017 from the aspects of ocean engineering it poses much challenge to acquire the accurate mathematical model of auvs when the highly coupled nonlinear dynamics and disturbances are taken into consideration if the accurate model information remains inaccessible various model dependent control approaches will cease to be effective thus it is of considerable significance to synthesize controllers with consideration of inaccurate model information to this end substantial effort involving robust control yu et al 2018 patre et al 2018 liu et al 2016 karkoub et al 2017 yan et al 2017 yang et al 2019 fuzzy control yu et al 2018 zhang and wu 2020 sun et al 2019 chen et al 2016 and neural network control lin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 has been paid to improve the controller s reliability and robustness in the presence of uncertain dynamics in zhang and wu 2020 sun et al 2019 the maximum overshoots of tracking errors were constrained such that auvs could move within the safety region by resorting to barrier lyapunov functions in order to achieve fast convergence speed finite time control methods and sliding mode control technologies were adopted in patre et al 2018 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 with the consideration of model uncertainties owing to the satisfactory performance in approximating system dynamics neural network was extensively employed for the controller development of auvs wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 2019a b rani and kumar 2020 by the combination of neural network and fuzzy logic systems input saturation constraints have been tackled on basis of the dynamic surface control method liu et al 2019a b in wang et al 2019 the command filter based approaches were applied to cope with the explosion of complexity eoc phenomenon inherent in backstepping technologies it is worthy to note that much computation complexity appeared in wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2019a b rani and kumar 2020 which was caused by estimating the weight matrix of neural network apart from the forgoing mentioned system uncertainties and disturbances the state or error constraints of marine vehicles require further investigation from the perspective of system s safety and performance guo and zhang 2019 peng et al 2018 if the output constraint is violated it may lead to collision problem performance degradation or even instability for the purpose of enhancing system s stability and safety barrier lyapunov function blf liu and tong 2017 sun et al 2019 nonlinear mapping method zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2019a b and prescribed performance control ppc strategies bechlioulis and rovithakis 2010 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 were extensively exploited under the circumstance of state constraints by resorting to the blf and neural network the tracking control problem was solved for auvs when the output constraints and system uncertainties were considered zheng et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in order to acquire better transient performance the ppc methods were devised for auvs tracking missions with transient performance constraints liu et al 2020 qin et al 2019 elhaki and shojaei 2018 li et al 2019 bechlioulis et al 2017 in qin et al 2019 baldini et al 2018 two fault tolerant controllers were proposed such that the system could maintain precise tracking results under the circumstance of uncertainties and actuator faults obviously these existing prescribed performance methods cease to be applicable when the input quantization is encountered in the design process as a typical networked system the actual control signals of the auv must be transformed from continuous ones to discrete ones before it can be transferred to the next network which is mainly attributed to the fact that the control modules are composed of digital processors while the auv is a continuous system considering the accuracy of sensors quantizers are always required in this transformation process simultaneously the quantizer always possess the superior property of low data transmission thus effectively saving the communication resource without sacrificing performance however the utilization of quantizers will inevitably introduce strong nonlinearity and quantization errors that cause much performance degradation for control systems which is the main obstacle for the implementation of quantizers thus far massive efforts on the application of quantizers have been put in aerospace engineering sun et al 2018 euler lagrange systems li et al 2020 formation systems liang et al 2019 and marine vehicle systems yan and yu 2018 hao et al 2019 though effective these quantized controllers cannot ensure predesigned performance for the systems inspired by the foregoing observation investigation of prescribed performance tracking control for underactuated auvs with input quantization is conducted in this paper by combining the neural network and command filter based backstepping control approach the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 different from pervious results zheng et al 2019 xie et al 2020 the presented method is proposed for auvs tracking missions with consideration of input quantization constraints and filtering errors the quantizer and the compensating signals will work together to reduce the data transmission frequency and filtering errors by integrating the parameters of the quantizers into the control algorithm the accuracy of the quantization process will be effectively guaranteed 2 in zheng et al 2019 the external disturbances have been ignored which is not always appropriate in real applications in this paper proper chattering free designs with good robustness to disturbances are presented additionally superior to these neural work based controllers wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 elhaki and shojaei 2018 liu et al 2019a b cui et al 2017 a single parameter rather than the whole weight matrix will be estimated through updating laws upon the utilization of mlp algorithm which will enhance the real time capability of the controller and save computational resource considerably 3 comparing with the existing ppc methods for auvs elhaki and shojaei 2018 bechlioulis et al 2017 the design process of the proposed controller possesses much more simplicity and intuitiveness more specifically the tracking errors with prescribed performance constraints should be transformed to the unconstrained ones firstly in the mentioned literatures only on basis of this can the control schemes be derived for the auv systems benefitting from the merit of nonlinear mapping technology the prescribed performance will be directly ensured in this paper without complex transformation on the constrained tracking errors this paper is organized as follows section 2 is the preliminaries and problem formulation in section 3 the nonlinear mapping method is conducted and the main results are given simulation verifications are given in section 4 to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme conclusions of this paper are arranged in section 5 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 mathematic modeling of the auv in this paper the trajectory tracking mission is studied for an underactuated auv via command filtered backstepping control method the 5 degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model of this auv can be described as follows zheng et al 2019 1 x u cos ϕ cos θ v sin ϕ w sin θ cos ϕ y u sin ϕ cos θ v cos ϕ w sin θ sin ϕ z u sin θ w cos θ θ q ϕ r cos θ 2 u f u 1 m 11 q τ u d u v f q d v w f w d w q f q 1

vehicle s velocity of surge sway heave pitch and yaw motion respects to the body fixed frame bf m i i i 1 6 denote the positive inertia masses of the vehicle d u d v d w d q and d r stand for the unknown environment disturbances caused by waves and ocean currents q τ i i u q r represent the quantized control inputs which are provided by thrusters and rudders f u f v f w f q and f r are defined as the follows 3 f u m 22 m 11 v r m 33 m 11 w q d 11 m 11 u f v m 11 m 22 u r d 22 m 22 v f w m 11 m 33 u q d 33 m 33 w f q m 33 m 11 m 55 u w d 55 m 55 q ρ g g m l sin θ m 55 f r m 11 m 22 m 66 u w d 66 m 66 r here d i i i 1 6 are the hydrodynamic coefficients ρ g is the buoyancy of the auv g m l stands for the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity to convert the actual continuous signal into a discrete one the following hysteresis quantizer is adopted 4 q τ j τ j i sign τ j τ j i 1 δ j τ j τ j i τ j 0 or τ j i τ j τ j i 1 δ j τ j 0 τ j i 1 δ j sign τ j τ j i τ j u i 1 δ j τ j 0 or τ j i 1 δ j τ j τ j i 1 δ j 1 δ j τ j 0 0 0 τ j τ j min 1 δ j τ j 0 or τ j min 1 δ j τ j τ j min τ j 0 q τ j t τ j 0 where j u q r i 1 2 τ j i ρ 1 i τ j min with parameter τ j min 0 denoting the dead zone of the this quantizer δ j is a positive constant satisfying 0 δ j 1 ρ is the quantized density defining as ρ 1 δ j 1 δ j and q τ j is always mapped in the set of 0 τ j i τ j i 1 δ j the detailed information of this quantizer could be found in the work wu and cao 2017 zhou et al 2018 remark 1 in this paper the 5 degree of freedom model of the auv is adopted for convenience the reason behind this lies in the assumptions that the auv works at low speed and in this case the roll oscillation is always stabilized by the restoring force consequently roll motion dynamics could be neglected in 1 and 2 the detailed information of this situation could be referred to the work of zheng et al 2019 remark 2 in the foregoing dynamic model 2 control inputs in the v and w directions are not provided i e v and w always remain uncontrollable in the tracking missions thus the studied auv is an underactuated one for tracking missions it is the other three channels that could be controlled by observing the expression of 2 3 and assuming that d v and d w are bounded disturbances we can conclude v and w can remain bounded as long as u q and r are stabilized remark 3 for engineering applications it is a challenging work to acquire accurate information of the hydrodynamic coefficients d i i and inertia masses m i i which renders it impossible to apply the expressions of f i i u v w q r for controller design on account of this the detailed information of f i is supposed to be inaccessible in this paper and they will be approximated by mlp algorithm remark 4 in practical applications continuous control signals must be converted to analog ones to impose on the auv plant as an effective approach for this kind of transformation quantization methods enjoy satisfactory properties of high accuracy and low frequency generally speaking both of the system inputs and the system states could be quantized for brevity only the input quantization realized by the hysteresis quantizer is considered in this paper remark 5 it must be emphasized that this quantizer will inevitably cause strong nonlinearity and quantization errors in the control system if the quantization errors are not properly dealt with it will lead to unexpected performance degradation or even instability in the subsequent design quantizer parameters are injected into the control gains to reduce the quantization errors 2 2 tracking error dynamics in this subsection the dynamics of trajectory tracking errors for underactuated auvs will be formulated firstly we define the smooth reference trajectory as x d y d z d thus the position errors related to bf can be defined as 5 x e y e z e t j x x d y y d z z d t where x d y d z d denote the desired position and j is the rotation matrix from irf to bf which is defined as follows 6 j cos θ cos ϕ cos θ sin ϕ sin θ sin ϕ cos ϕ 0 sin θ cos ϕ sin θ sin ϕ cos θ by combing 5 and 6 the position errors can be deduced as 7 x e x x d cos θ cos ϕ y y d cos θ sin ϕ z z d sin θ y e x x d sin ϕ y y d cos ϕ z e x x d sin θ cos ϕ y y d sin θ sin ϕ z z d cos θ taking the derivative on both sides of 7 yields 8 x e u q z e r y e x d cos θ cos ϕ y d cos θ sin ϕ z d sin θ y e v r x e z e tan θ x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ z e w q x e r y e tan θ x d sin θ cos ϕ y d sin θ sin ϕ z d cos θ then we can obtain the tracking error ρ e θ e and ϕ e as follows 9 ρ e x e 2 y e 2 z e 2 θ e atan 2 x e 2 y e 2 z e ϕ e atan 2 x e y e through the above analysis we can easily derive the position errors in the following expression 10 x e ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e y e ρ e cos θ e sin ϕ e z e ρ e sin θ e finally combining 8 and 10 the tracking error dynamics can be derived by differentiating 9 11 ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x θ e q cos ϕ e sign cos θ e φ q x sign cos θ e ϕ e r 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e φ r x where φ u x φ q x φ r x are known functions with the following form 12 φ u x v cos θ e sin ϕ e w sin θ e cos θ e sin ϕ e x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ sin θ e x d sin θ cos ϕ

remark 6 the following prescribed performance quantized controller will be deduced mainly rely on the error dynamics 11 performance constraints will be imposed on tracking error ρ e θ e and ϕ e φ u x φ q x and φ r x are defined for facilitating the further design 2 3 notations assumptions and lemmas in order to synthesize the tracking controller via command filtered backstepping design the following notations assumptions and lemmas are given notations throughout this article stands for the euclidean norm of a vector is the absolute value of a scalar sign denotes the sign function for an unknown constant μ μ ˆ is the estimation of this term and the estimation error is defined as μ μ μ ˆ assumption 1 the unknown environments disturbance d i i u v w q r is bounded and satisfies d i d i

inequality 13 θ π 2 remark 7 assumption 1 and assumption 2 always hold in practical applications inspired the analysis in zheng et al 2019 the pitch angle θ are always satisfying the constraint θ π 2 owing to the metacentric restoring forces thus assumption 3 is reasonable lemma 1 zhou et al 2018 for the quantizer q ς with control input ς the following property holds 14 q ς ς δ ς ς min where 0 δ 1 and u min 0 are quantization parameters lemma 2 hu et al 2019 for any ε 0 and x r the following inequality holds 15 0 x x 2 x 2 ε 2 x x 2 x ε ε 2 4 rbf neural networks and mlp algorithm the radial basis function neural network rbfnn is capable of approximating unknown smooth nonlinear functions with an arbitrary accuracy over a compact set and has been extensively applied in various fields consequently it is adopted here for the approximation of unmodeled system dynamics for any unknown smooth function f ℝ n ℝ it can be approximated as 16 f w t ξ x ε where w w 1 w 2 w p t and x x 1 x 2 x m are the weight vector and the input vector ε is a positive constant representing the approximation error p and m are the node number and input number ξ x ξ 1 x ξ p x t is the gaussian basis function vector with the following form 17 ξ i x exp x c i 2 2 β i 2 i 1 2 p where c i r m and β i r are the center vector and the gaussian basis function vector of ξ i x respectively considering 16 the unmodeled dynamics of auv in 2 can be approximated as 18 f j w j t ξ j x ο j where j u q r x x y z θ ϕ u v w q r t ο j denotes the approximating error satisfying ο j ο j with ο j to reduce the computational complexity mlp algorithm is applied here and 17 can be further written as 19 w j t ξ j x ο j w j t ξ j x ο j μ j ψ j x ο j where ψ j x ξ j x μ j w j as a result it is the constant μ j rather than the weight matrix w j that will be estimated in the controller design thus effectively reducing the computational burden and considerably improving the real time ability of the control system we define μ ˆ j as the estimation of μ j and μ j μ j μ ˆ j as the estimation error 2 5 control objective this paper mainly focuses on designing an adaptive control scheme that can force the auv

derivate of 22 yields 23 z α e p α e α e h α e where p α e α e 2 α e α e α e α e 2 α e α e 2 h α e α e 2 α e α e α e α e α e α e α e α e α e 2 α e α e 2 consequently we can obtain the transformed

bounded the satisfaction of prescribed performance for tracking errors will be fulfilled as long as the system initial states satisfy the performance constraint 20 3 2 controller design this section is devoted to designing adaptive trajectory tracking control schemes for underactuated auvs via command filter and neural network based backstepping approaches via the nonlinear mapping technology and mlp algorithm tracking errors will always satisfy the predefined performance even when there exist unmodeled dynamics and input quantization constraints the design process could be divided into three steps i e the virtual control command design the compensating signal design and the actual control input design to better show the design process we have depicted the schematic diagram of the proposed method in fig 1 step 1 to facilitate the following controller synthesis we rename the transformed tracking error z α as e α α ρ θ ϕ then the following relation is derived 25 e ρ p ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x h ρ e e θ p θ e q cos ϕ e φ q x h θ e e ϕ p ϕ e r 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e φ r x h ϕ e based on the backstepping procedure the virtual control commands λ j j u q r are designed as follows 26 λ

remark 9 for the virtual control commands λ j three points should be emphasized i according to assumption 3 we know that θ π 2 will not be violated which means that λ r is always tenable even in the presence of the term tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e ii control performance can be adjusted by tuning the design parameter k i iii repeated derivative of this virtual command will cause the phenomenon of explosion of complexity which will be handled by resorting to a first order filter in the following step step 2 taking the side effects of the explosion of complexity caused by the derivative of λ j into account a first order filter is introduced as 27 κ j λ j c λ j c λ j λ j c 0 λ j 0 where κ j is the designed parameter and λ j c is the output of this filter to reduce the filter error λ j λ j c the compensating signals ζ α are proposed as follows 28 ζ ρ k 1 ζ ρ p ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e ζ u p ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e λ u c λ u ζ θ k 2 ζ θ p θ e cos ϕ e ζ q p θ e cos ϕ e λ q c λ q ζ ϕ k 3 ζ ϕ p ϕ e 1

introduced to reduce filtering errors ζ j will be designed in the following text it must be mentioned that the design of ζ α mainly relies on the principle of compensating filtering errors which will be further illustrated in the following analysis then we define the error variables e j j λ j c and j e λ j j the compensated errors can be expressed as 29 v α e α ζ α v j e j ζ j recalling 2 the

10 in the above design compensating signals ζ α and ζ j work together to reduce the filtering errors in the existing dynamic surface methods baldini et al 2018 and liu et al 2019a b the filtering error is not concerned and this may affect the control accuracy to some extent completely different from these approaches the compensating signal is proposed here to remedy this drawback step 3 to further stabilized v α and v j the actual control inputs τ j j u q r are designed as 36 τ u m 11 1 δ u χ u τ q m 55 δ q 1 χ q τ r m 66 1 δ r χ r where δ j are the parameters of the quantizer defined

where k i 0 i 4 5 6 μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are estimations of μ j and ο j d j respectively adaptive laws for μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are designed as 39 with γ n 0 c n 0 n 1 2 39 μ ˆ j γ 1 v j ψ j c 1 μ ˆ j d ˆ j γ 2 v j c 2 d ˆ j remark 11 due to the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the quantizer parameters δ j are integrated into the auxiliary variables ε j in 36 to obtain desirable tracking performance chattering and control accuracy are mainly decided by parameters ε j i e larger ε j leads to less chattering and larger errors this fact will be elaborated in the stability analysis part thus designers must make a tradeoff between the control precision and chattering problem to obtain satisfactory performance remark 12 in 38 μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are updating laws designing for robustness improvement when disturbances and unmodeled dynamics are encountered together additionally estimating errors of the rbfnn and the disturbances are dealt with simultaneously for simplicity and intuitiveness upon utilizing the backstepping design e α are introduced to compensating filtering errors terms k i e j i 4 5 6 in 38 perform the function of stabilizing the errors v j remark 13 the advantage of this control algorithm can be summarized in three aspects firstly the quantization errors are considerably reduced via the implementation the parameters of the quantizer secondly this method is not only capable of endowing the tracking errors with prescribed performance guarantees but also can estimating uncertain dynamics with less computation complexity finally the compensating signals will improve the control precision effectively 3 3 stability analysis in the previous section the tracking controller in the case of input quantization and prescribed performance constraints is presented via integrating the command filter into the backstepping design under the constructed algorithm it comes to the conclusions in this section that asymptotic stability will be achieved for tracking errors under the proposed control scheme and that all the closed loop signals will remain bounded the following theorem is deduced through theoretical analysis theorem 1 considering the tracking issue for auv system expressed as 1 and 2 if assumptions 1 3 are tenable and the control schemes are designed as 36 37 38 39 all of the closed loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded additionally the prescribed performance will be achieved when the initial values of tracking errors satisfy the condition 20 proof to show the asymptotic stability of the closed loop signals we redefine the lyapunov

region v 2 v 2 δ k as time goes infinite thus signals v i j i u q r j 1 2 and the estimation errors μ i d i are all uniformly ultimately bounded through the command filter based backstepping design and according to the discussion in bribiesca argomedo et al 2015 we know that q i j i u q r j 1 2 are bounded then the boundedness of state tracking errors e i j i u q r j 1 2 is ensured from the analysis presented in remark 8 we know that the predefined performance α e α e α e α ρ θ ϕ will always be achieved as long as tracking errors e i j i u q r j 1 2 are bounded according to the conclusion stated above it is deduced that e i j are bounded thus the satisfaction of prescribed performance is always guaranteed under the proposed controllers this completes the proof remark 14 observing 50 we conclude that the convergence region of v 2 is mainly decided by control parameters k i i 1 2 6 c 1 γ 1 c 2 and γ 2 more specifically v 2 will decrease as k i become large parameters ε j not only have impact on the control precision but also decide the chattering phenomenon thus designers can obtain satisfaction on control performance through the adjustment of these parameters 4 simulation results numerical simulations are conducted on an underactuated auv in this section to manifest the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method the detailed model information of the experimental auv can be referred to the following table xie et al 2020 two simulation cases with the same design parameters are considered here firstly different system uncertainties and perturbative torques are considered under the same control parameters to illustrate the robustness of the developed controller then simulation results of the developed controller in this paper are compared to the existing literature zheng et al 2019 and the traditional backstepping control scheme under the same simulation situation for these two cases initial state vectors are set as x 0 y 0 z 0 θ 0 ϕ 0 8 8 m 5 m π 6 0 u v w q r 0 0 0 0 0 the desired trajectories are set as x d 5 sin 0 2 t 5 cos 0 1 t y d 5 sin 0 1 t 5 cos 0 2 t and z d 10 0 1 t parameters of the quantizer are chosen as σ u

u 3 3 m s v 1 1 m s w 1 1 m s q 0 5 0 5 rad s r 0 5 0 5 rad s parameters of the performance functions and controllers are given in the following table 4 1 case 1 three scenarios are adopted here to show the robustness of the presented controller while the parameters in table 2 remain unchanged we set three types of perturbative torques and system uncertainties for simulations which are given as the following expression scenario i parameters of the auv remain the same as table 1 and the disturbances are given as d k k 0 5 sign k 0 5 sin 0 1 t k u v w q r scenario ii parameters of the auv in table 1 have 5 uncertainties and the disturbances are given as d k k sign k sin 0 1 t k u v w q r scenario iii parameters of the auv in table 1 have 10 uncertainties and the disturbances are given as d k k 1 5 sign k 1 5 sin 0 1 t k u v w q r for brevity it is only the trajectories and tracking errors of these three scenarios that are depicted in figs 2 3 the other simulation results of scenario i are presented in figs 4 5 trajectories of these three scenarios and the reference trajectory are given in fig 2 which imply that the auv could be forced to the reference trajectory with satisfactory performance additionally it is obviously that system uncertainties and disturbances have scarce impacts on the tracking precision that is the proposed controller possess desirable robustness against uncertainties and disturbances time responses of ρ e θ e ϕ e and the partial enlarged detail of ρ e are depicted in fig 3 by utilizing the devised controller we find that tracking errors will be stabilized within the prescribed performance constraints and the partial enlarged detail means that best control performance is obtained under scenario i estimations of f j j u q r and μ j are plotted in fig 4 observing the results we jump to the conclusion that unknown system dynamics will be well approximated and the outputs of the adaptive laws always remain bounded thus the proposed mlp algorithm is effective for the auv system time responses of d ˆ j and the control torques are described by fig 5 it is observed that the outputs of the control algorithm are always within the allowable range of the actuators from the above analysis we conclude that the proposed method have excellent tracking performance when the prescribed performance constraints and input quantization are considered for auv system 4 2 case 2 scenario i has been adopted in this section for comparative simulations simulation results of the existing literature zheng et al 2019 and the traditional backstepping control scheme are compared with that of the proposed method fig 6 shows tracking errors and the prescribed performance constraints since the perturbative torques are considered the performance of the backstepping method has degraded evidently and the prescribed performance cannot be ensured under this controller from the partial enlarged detail of ρ e we find that the proposed controller in this paper have better control precision than that of zheng et al 2019 even in the consideration of input quantization in order to illustrate this point from the aspect of quantitative analysis the integrated absolute error iae defined as 0 t ϑ d t with ϑ ρ e θ e ϕ e will be given in table 3 by analyzing the value iae under these three methods we can easily obtain the conclusion that the proposed method in this paper possesses better tracking precision 5 conclusions in this paper the robust trajectory tracking control issue is solved for underactuated auvs by combining backstepping technology nonlinear mapping approach and rbfnn technology input quantization unmodeled dynamics and predefined performance constraints are considered together throughout the controller design process by resorting to the compensating signals and mlp algorithm filtering errors could be reduced considerably and unknown system dynamics are estimated with low computational complexity all

underwater vehicles auvs have been extensively researched attributing to their promising application values in marine missions involving environmental monitoring marine culture ocean explorations etc being one of the most attractive technologies of auvs or other marine vehicles gao et al 2019 gao and guo 2020a tracking control technologies always enable the system to follow the desired trajectory with satisfactory performance however there still exist some obstacles to construct controllers for auvs on account of the highly coupled nonlinear hydrodynamics complex ocean disturbances and limited hardware performance despite of these challenges numerous efforts have been paid to solve this issue and fruitful results are obtained based on backstepping methods li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019

et al 2019a b cui et al 2017 from the aspects of ocean engineering it poses much challenge to acquire the accurate mathematical model of auvs when the highly coupled nonlinear dynamics and disturbances are taken into consideration if the accurate model information remains inaccessible various model dependent control approaches will cease to be effective thus it is of considerable significance to synthesize controllers with consideration of inaccurate model information to this end substantial effort involving robust control yu et al 2018 patre et al 2018 liu et al 2016 karkoub

improve the controller s reliability and robustness in the presence of uncertain dynamics in zhang and wu 2020 sun et al 2019 the maximum overshoots of tracking errors were constrained such that auvs could move within the safety region by resorting to barrier lyapunov functions in order to achieve fast convergence speed finite time control methods and sliding mode control technologies were adopted in patre et al 2018 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 with the consideration of model uncertainties owing to the satisfactory performance in approximating system dynamics neural network was extensively employed for the controller development of auvs wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 2019a b rani and kumar 2020 by the combination of neural network and fuzzy logic systems input saturation constraints have been tackled on basis of the dynamic surface control method liu et al 2019a b in wang et al 2019 the command filter based approaches were applied to cope with the explosion of complexity eoc phenomenon inherent in backstepping technologies it is worthy to note that much computation complexity appeared in wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2019a b rani and kumar 2020 which was caused by estimating the weight matrix of neural network apart from the forgoing mentioned system uncertainties and disturbances the state or error constraints of marine vehicles require further investigation from the perspective of system s safety and performance guo and zhang 2019 peng et al 2018 if the output constraint is violated it may lead to collision problem performance degradation or even instability for the purpose of enhancing system s stability and safety barrier lyapunov function blf liu and tong 2017 sun et al 2019 nonlinear mapping method zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2019a b and prescribed performance control ppc strategies bechlioulis and rovithakis 2010 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 were extensively exploited under the circumstance of state constraints by resorting to the blf and neural network the tracking control problem was solved for auvs when the output constraints and system uncertainties were considered zheng et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in order to acquire better transient performance the ppc methods were devised for auvs tracking missions with transient performance constraints liu et al 2020 qin et al 2019 elhaki and shojaei 2018 li et al 2019 bechlioulis et al 2017 in qin et al 2019 baldini et al 2018 two fault tolerant controllers were proposed such that the system could maintain precise tracking results under the circumstance of uncertainties and actuator faults obviously these existing prescribed performance methods cease to be applicable when the input quantization is encountered in the design process as a typical networked system the actual control signals of the auv must be transformed from continuous ones to discrete ones before it can be transferred to the next network which is mainly attributed to the fact that the control modules are composed of digital processors while the auv is a continuous system considering the accuracy of sensors quantizers are always required in this transformation process simultaneously the quantizer always possess the superior property of low data transmission thus effectively saving the communication resource without sacrificing performance however the utilization of quantizers will inevitably introduce strong nonlinearity and quantization errors that cause much performance degradation for control systems which is the main obstacle for the implementation of quantizers thus far massive efforts on the application of quantizers have been put in aerospace engineering sun et al 2018 euler lagrange systems li et al 2020 formation systems liang et al 2019 and marine vehicle systems yan and yu 2018 hao et al 2019 though effective these quantized controllers cannot ensure predesigned performance for the systems inspired by the foregoing observation investigation of prescribed performance tracking control for underactuated auvs with input quantization is conducted in this paper by combining the neural network and command filter based backstepping control approach the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 different from pervious results zheng et al 2019 xie et al 2020 the presented method is proposed for auvs tracking missions with consideration of input quantization constraints and filtering errors the quantizer and the compensating signals will work together to reduce the data transmission frequency and filtering errors by integrating the parameters of the quantizers into the control algorithm the accuracy of the quantization process will be effectively guaranteed 2 in zheng et al 2019 the external disturbances have been ignored which is not always appropriate in real applications in this paper proper chattering free designs with good robustness to disturbances are presented additionally superior to these neural work based controllers wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 elhaki and shojaei 2018 liu et al 2019a b cui et al 2017 a single parameter rather than the whole weight matrix will be estimated through updating laws upon the utilization of mlp algorithm which will enhance the real time capability of the controller and save computational resource considerably 3 comparing with the existing ppc methods for auvs elhaki and shojaei 2018 bechlioulis et al 2017 the design process of the proposed controller possesses much more simplicity and intuitiveness more specifically the tracking errors with prescribed performance constraints should be transformed to the unconstrained ones firstly in the mentioned literatures only on basis of this can the control schemes be derived for the auv systems benefitting from the merit of nonlinear mapping technology the prescribed performance will be directly ensured in this paper without complex transformation on the constrained tracking errors this paper is organized as follows section 2 is the preliminaries and problem formulation in section 3 the nonlinear mapping method is conducted and the main results are given simulation verifications are given in section 4 to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme conclusions of this paper are arranged in section 5 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 mathematic modeling of the auv in this paper the trajectory tracking mission is studied for an underactuated auv via command filtered backstepping control method the 5 degree of freedom kinematic and dynamic model of this auv can be described as follows zheng et al 2019 1 x u cos ϕ cos θ v sin ϕ w sin θ cos ϕ y u sin ϕ cos θ v cos ϕ w sin θ sin ϕ z u sin θ w cos θ θ q ϕ r cos θ 2 u f u 1 m 11 q τ u d u v f q d v w f w d w q f q 1 m 55 q τ q d q r f r 1 m 66 q τ r d r where x y z denotes the east north and vertical position θ ϕ denotes the orientation of pitch and yaw in the inertia reference frame irf u v w q r stands for the vehicle s velocity of surge sway heave pitch and yaw motion respects to the body fixed frame bf m i i i 1 6 denote the positive inertia masses of the vehicle d u d v d w d q and d r stand for the unknown environment disturbances caused by waves and ocean currents q τ i i u q r represent the quantized control inputs which are provided by thrusters and rudders f u f v f w f q and f r are defined as the follows 3 f u m 22 m 11 v r m 33 m 11 w q d 11 m 11 u f v m 11 m 22 u r d 22 m 22 v f w m 11 m 33 u q d 33 m 33 w f q m 33 m 11 m 55 u w d 55 m 55 q ρ g g m l sin θ m 55 f r m 11 m 22 m 66 u w d 66 m 66 r here d i i i 1 6 are the hydrodynamic coefficients ρ g is the buoyancy of the auv g m l stands for the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity to convert the actual continuous signal into a discrete one the following hysteresis quantizer is adopted 4 q τ j τ j i sign τ j τ j i 1 δ j τ j τ j i τ j 0 or τ j i τ j τ j i 1 δ j τ j 0 τ j i 1 δ j sign τ j τ j i τ j u i 1 δ j τ j 0 or τ j i 1 δ j τ j τ j i 1 δ j 1 δ j τ j 0 0 0 τ j τ j min 1 δ j τ j 0 or τ j min 1 δ j τ j τ j min τ j 0 q τ j t τ j 0 where j u q r i 1 2 τ j i ρ 1 i τ j min with parameter τ j min 0 denoting the dead zone of the this quantizer δ j is a positive constant satisfying 0 δ j 1 ρ is the quantized density defining as ρ 1 δ j 1 δ j and q τ j is always mapped in the set of 0 τ j i τ j i 1 δ j the detailed information of this quantizer could be found in the work wu and cao 2017 zhou et al 2018 remark 1 in this paper the 5 degree of freedom model of the auv is adopted for convenience the reason behind this lies in the assumptions that the auv works at low speed and in this case the roll oscillation is always stabilized by the restoring force consequently roll motion dynamics could be neglected in 1 and 2 the detailed information of this situation could be referred to the work of zheng et al 2019 remark 2 in the foregoing dynamic model 2 control inputs in the v and w directions are not provided i e v and w always remain uncontrollable in the tracking missions thus the studied auv is an underactuated one for tracking missions it is the other three channels that could be controlled by observing the expression of 2 3 and assuming that d v and d w are bounded disturbances we can conclude v and w can remain bounded as long as u q and r are stabilized remark 3 for engineering applications it is a challenging work to acquire accurate information of the hydrodynamic coefficients d i i and inertia masses m i i which renders it impossible to apply the expressions of f i i u v w q r for controller design on account of this the detailed information of f i is supposed to be inaccessible in this paper and they will be approximated by mlp algorithm remark 4 in practical applications continuous control signals must be converted to analog ones to impose on the auv plant as an effective approach for this kind of transformation quantization methods enjoy satisfactory properties of high accuracy and low frequency generally speaking both of the system inputs and the system states could be quantized for brevity only the input quantization realized by the hysteresis quantizer is considered in this paper remark 5 it must be emphasized that this quantizer will inevitably cause strong nonlinearity and quantization errors in the control system if the quantization errors are not properly dealt with it will lead to unexpected performance degradation or even instability in the subsequent design quantizer parameters are injected into the control gains to reduce the quantization errors 2 2 tracking error dynamics in this subsection the dynamics of trajectory tracking errors for underactuated auvs will be formulated firstly we define the smooth reference trajectory as x d y d z d thus the position errors related to bf can be defined as 5 x e y e z e t j x x d y y d z z d t where x d y d z d denote the desired position and j is the rotation matrix from irf to bf which is defined as follows 6 j cos θ cos ϕ cos θ sin ϕ sin θ sin ϕ cos ϕ 0 sin θ cos ϕ sin θ sin ϕ cos θ by combing 5 and 6 the position errors can be deduced as 7 x e x x d cos θ cos ϕ y y d cos θ sin ϕ z z d sin θ y e x x d sin ϕ y y d cos ϕ z e x x d sin θ cos ϕ y y d sin θ sin ϕ z z d cos θ taking the derivative on both sides of 7 yields 8 x e u q z e r y e x d cos θ cos ϕ y d cos θ sin ϕ z d sin θ y e v r x e z e tan θ x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ z e w q x e r y e tan θ x d sin θ cos ϕ y d sin θ sin ϕ z d cos θ then we can obtain the tracking error ρ e θ e and ϕ e as follows 9 ρ e x e 2 y e 2 z e 2 θ e atan 2 x e 2 y e 2 z e ϕ e atan 2 x e y e through the above analysis we can easily derive the position errors in the following expression 10 x e ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e y e ρ e cos θ e sin ϕ e z e ρ e sin θ e finally combining 8 and 10 the tracking error dynamics can be derived by differentiating 9 11 ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x θ e q cos ϕ e sign cos θ e φ q x sign cos θ e ϕ e r 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e φ r x where φ u x φ q x φ r x are known functions with the following form 12 φ u x v cos θ e sin ϕ e w sin θ e cos θ e sin ϕ e x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ sin θ e x d sin θ cos ϕ y d sin θ sin ϕ z d cos θ cos θ e cos ϕ e x d cos θ cos ϕ y d cos θ sin ϕ z d sin θ φ q x r sin ϕ e tan θ sin θ e sin ϕ e v x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ ρ e cos θ e w x d sin θ cos ϕ y d sin θ sin ϕ z d cos θ ρ e sin θ e cos ϕ e u x d cos θ cos ϕ y d cos θ sin ϕ z d sin θ ρ e φ r x q tan θ e sin ϕ e cos ϕ e v x d sin ϕ y d cos ϕ ρ e cos θ e sin ϕ e u x d cos θ cos ϕ y d cos θ sin ϕ z d sin θ ρ e cos θ e remark 6 the following prescribed performance quantized controller will be deduced mainly rely on the error dynamics 11 performance constraints will be imposed on tracking error ρ e θ e and ϕ e φ u x φ q x and φ r x are defined for facilitating the further design 2 3 notations assumptions and lemmas in order to synthesize the tracking controller via command filtered backstepping design the following notations assumptions and lemmas are given notations throughout this article stands for the euclidean norm of a vector is the absolute value of a scalar sign denotes the sign function for an unknown constant μ μ ˆ is the estimation of this term and the estimation error is defined as μ μ μ ˆ assumption 1 the unknown environments disturbance d i i u v w q r is bounded and satisfies d i d i with d i being an unknown positive constant assumption 2 the inertia masses m 11 m 55 m 66 are positive constants and known to designers assumption 3 the pitch angle θ satisfies the following inequality 13 θ π 2 remark 7 assumption 1 and assumption 2 always hold in practical applications inspired the analysis in zheng et al 2019 the pitch angle θ are always satisfying the constraint θ π 2 owing to the metacentric restoring forces thus assumption 3 is reasonable lemma 1 zhou et al 2018 for the quantizer q ς with control input ς the following property holds 14 q ς ς δ ς ς min where 0 δ 1 and u min 0 are quantization parameters lemma 2 hu et al 2019 for any ε 0 and x r the following inequality holds 15 0 x x 2 x 2 ε 2 x x 2 x ε ε 2 4 rbf neural networks and mlp algorithm the radial basis function neural network rbfnn is capable of approximating unknown smooth nonlinear functions with an arbitrary accuracy over a compact set and has been extensively applied in various fields consequently it is adopted here for the approximation of unmodeled system dynamics for any unknown smooth function f ℝ n ℝ it can be approximated as 16 f w t ξ x ε where w w 1 w 2 w p t and x x 1 x 2 x m are the weight vector and the input vector ε is a positive constant representing the approximation error p and m are the node number and input number ξ x ξ 1 x ξ p x t is the gaussian basis function vector with the following form 17 ξ i x exp x c i 2 2 β i 2 i 1 2 p where c i r m and β i r are the center vector and the gaussian basis function vector of ξ i x respectively considering 16 the unmodeled dynamics of auv in 2 can be approximated as 18 f j w j t ξ j x ο j where j u q r x x y z θ ϕ u v w q r t ο j denotes the approximating error satisfying ο j ο j with ο j to reduce the computational complexity mlp algorithm is applied here and 17 can be further written as 19 w j t ξ j x ο j w j t ξ j x ο j μ j ψ j x ο j where ψ j x ξ j x μ j w j as a result it is the constant μ j rather than the weight matrix w j that will be estimated in the controller design thus effectively reducing the computational burden and considerably improving the real time ability of the control system we define μ ˆ j as the estimation of μ j and μ j μ j μ ˆ j as the estimation error 2 5 control objective this paper mainly focuses on designing an adaptive control scheme that can force the auv towards the desired trajectory x d y d z d with predefined transient and steady state performance in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and input quantization in other words the tracking error α e α ρ θ ϕ needs to satisfy the following constraint 20 α e t α e t α e t t 0 21 α e t α e 0 α e exp σ α t α e α e t α e 0 α e exp σ α t α e where α e 0 α e α e 0 α e and σ α are all positive constants satisfying α e α e 0 and α e α e 0 3 main results 3 1 error transformation with prescribed performance to endow tracking errors α e α ρ θ ϕ with the prescribed performance defined in 21 a mapping function is constructed to transfer the original constrained tracking errors into an unconstrained state the mapping function is defined as 22 z α e f α e α e α e α e α e α e α e α e then taking time derivate of 22 yields 23 z α e p α e α e h α e where p α e α e 2 α e α e α e α e 2 α e α e 2 h α e α e 2 α e α e α e α e α e α e α e α e α e 2 α e α e 2 consequently we can obtain the transformed error dynamics as follows from the foregoing transformation 24 z ρ e p ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x h ρ e z θ e p θ e q cos ϕ e sign cos θ e φ q x sign cos θ e h θ e z ϕ e p ϕ e r 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e φ r x h ϕ e remark 8 from the error system 22 we learn that z α e will approach to infinity when the tracking error α e reach the prescribed bounds thus if the transformed state z α e remains bounded the satisfaction of prescribed performance for tracking errors will be fulfilled as long as the system initial states satisfy the performance constraint 20 3 2 controller design this section is devoted to designing adaptive trajectory tracking control schemes for underactuated auvs via command filter and neural network based backstepping approaches via the nonlinear mapping technology and mlp algorithm tracking errors will always satisfy the predefined performance even when there exist unmodeled dynamics and input quantization constraints the design process could be divided into three steps i e the virtual control command design the compensating signal design and the actual control input design to better show the design process we have depicted the schematic diagram of the proposed method in fig 1 step 1 to facilitate the following controller synthesis we rename the transformed tracking error z α as e α α ρ θ ϕ then the following relation is derived 25 e ρ p ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x h ρ e e θ p θ e q cos ϕ e φ q x h θ e e ϕ p ϕ e r 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e φ r x h ϕ e based on the backstepping procedure the virtual control commands λ j j u q r are designed as follows 26 λ

remark 9 for the virtual control commands λ j three points should be emphasized i according to assumption 3 we know that θ π 2 will not be violated which means that λ r is always tenable even in the presence of the term tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e ii control performance can be adjusted by tuning the design parameter k i iii repeated derivative of this virtual command will cause the phenomenon of explosion of complexity which will be handled by resorting to a first order filter in the following step step 2 taking the side effects of the explosion of complexity caused by the derivative of λ j into account a first order filter is introduced as 27 κ j λ j c λ j c λ j λ j c 0 λ j 0 where κ j is the designed parameter and λ j c is the output of this filter to reduce the filter error λ j λ j c the compensating signals ζ α are proposed as follows 28 ζ ρ k 1 ζ ρ p ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e ζ u p ρ e cos θ e cos ϕ e λ u c λ u ζ θ k 2 ζ θ p θ e cos ϕ e ζ q p θ e cos ϕ e λ q c λ q ζ ϕ k 3 ζ ϕ p ϕ e 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e ζ r p ϕ e 1 tan θ tan θ e cos ϕ e λ r c λ r where ζ j j u q r are auxiliary variables that will be designed in the subsequent work here the term k i ζ α ζ j and λ j c λ j are introduced to reduce filtering errors ζ j will be designed in the following text it must be mentioned that the design of ζ α mainly relies on the principle of compensating filtering errors which will be further illustrated in the following analysis then we define the error variables e j j λ j c and j e λ j j the compensated errors can be expressed as 29 v α e α ζ α v j e j ζ j recalling 2 the derivative of v j are calculated as 30 v u f u 1 m 11 q τ u d u λ u c ζ u v q f q 1 m 55 q τ q d q λ q c ζ q v r f r 1 m 66 q τ r d r λ r c ζ r in the following design lyapunov stability theorem is employed to stabilize the compensated error signals v α and v j the following lyapunov candidate is chosen 31 v 1 1 2 v ρ 2 1 2 v u 2 1 2 v θ 2 1 2 v q 2 1 2 v ϕ 2 1 2 v r 2 by the combination of 25 28 29 and 30 the derivative of v 1 satisfies the following expression 32 v 1 v ρ e ρ ζ ρ v u e u ζ u v θ e θ ζ θ v q e q ζ q v ϕ e ϕ ζ ϕ v r e r ζ r v ρ p ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x h ρ e ζ ρ v u f u

nonlinear dynamics f j j u q r mlp algorithm is adopted to approximate it with less computation complexity in view of 19 we have 33 f j f j μ j ψ j ο j where ψ j ξ j x μ j w j and ο j is a positive constant denoting the upper bound of the approximating error according to 33 and assumption 1 32 is rewritten as follows 34 v 1 v ρ p ρ e u cos θ e cos ϕ e φ u x h ρ e ζ ρ v u μ u ψ u ο u d u v u 1 m

10 in the above design compensating signals ζ α and ζ j work together to reduce the filtering errors in the existing dynamic surface methods baldini et al 2018 and liu et al 2019a b the filtering error is not concerned and this may affect the control accuracy to some extent completely different from these approaches the compensating signal is proposed here to remedy this drawback step 3 to further stabilized v α and v j the actual control inputs τ j j u q r are designed as 36 τ u m 11 1 δ u χ u τ q m 55 δ q 1 χ q τ r m 66 1 δ r χ r where δ j are the parameters of the quantizer defined in the foregoing section χ j are the auxiliary variables defined as following 37 χ u v u η u 2 v u 2 η u 2 ε u 2 v u 2 τ umin 2 v u 2 τ umin 2 ε u 2 χ q v q η q 2 v q 2 η q 2 ε q 2 v q 2 2 τ qmin 2 v

where k i 0 i 4 5 6 μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are estimations of μ j and ο j d j respectively adaptive laws for μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are designed as 39 with γ n 0 c n 0 n 1 2 39 μ ˆ j γ 1 v j ψ j c 1 μ ˆ j d ˆ j γ 2 v j c 2 d ˆ j remark 11 due to the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the quantizer parameters δ j are integrated into the auxiliary variables ε j in 36 to obtain desirable tracking performance chattering and control accuracy are mainly decided by parameters ε j i e larger ε j leads to less chattering and larger errors this fact will be elaborated in the stability analysis part thus designers must make a tradeoff between the control precision and chattering problem to obtain satisfactory performance remark 12 in 38 μ ˆ j and d ˆ j are updating laws designing for robustness improvement when disturbances and unmodeled dynamics are encountered together additionally estimating errors of the rbfnn and the disturbances are dealt with simultaneously for simplicity and intuitiveness upon utilizing the backstepping design e α are introduced to compensating filtering errors terms k i e j i 4 5 6 in 38 perform the function of stabilizing the errors v j remark 13 the advantage of this control algorithm can be summarized in three aspects firstly the quantization errors are considerably reduced via the implementation the parameters of the quantizer secondly this method is not only capable of endowing the tracking errors with prescribed performance guarantees but also can estimating uncertain dynamics with less computation complexity finally the compensating signals will improve the control precision effectively 3 3 stability analysis in the previous section the tracking controller in the case of input quantization and prescribed performance constraints is presented via integrating the command filter into the backstepping design under the constructed algorithm it comes to the conclusions in this section that asymptotic stability will be achieved for tracking errors under the proposed control scheme and that all the closed loop signals will remain bounded the following theorem is deduced through theoretical analysis theorem 1 considering the tracking issue for auv system expressed as 1 and 2 if assumptions 1 3 are tenable and the control schemes are designed as 36 37 38 39 all of the closed loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded additionally the prescribed performance will be achieved when the initial values of tracking errors satisfy the condition 20 proof to show the asymptotic stability of the closed loop signals we redefine the lyapunov function as 40 v 2 v 1 1 2 γ 1 μ u 2 1 2 γ 2 d u 2 1 2 γ 3 μ q 2 1 2 γ 4 d q 2 1 2 γ 5 μ r 2 1 2 γ 6 d r 2 where μ j μ j μ ˆ j and d j ο j d j d ˆ j based on 34 we calculated the derivative of 40 as

region v 2 v 2 δ k as time goes infinite thus signals v i j i u q r j 1 2 and the estimation errors μ i d i are all uniformly ultimately bounded through the command filter based backstepping design and according to the discussion in bribiesca argomedo et al 2015 we know that q i j i u q r j 1 2 are bounded then the boundedness of state tracking errors e i j i u q r j 1 2 is ensured from the analysis presented in remark 8 we know that the predefined performance α e α e α e α ρ θ ϕ will always be achieved as long as tracking errors e i j i u q r j 1 2 are bounded according to the conclusion stated above it is deduced that e i j are bounded thus the satisfaction of prescribed performance is always guaranteed under the proposed controllers this completes the proof remark 14 observing 50 we conclude that the convergence region of v 2 is mainly decided by control parameters k i i 1 2 6 c 1 γ 1 c 2 and γ 2 more specifically v 2 will decrease as k i become large parameters ε j not only have impact on the control precision but also decide the chattering phenomenon thus designers can obtain satisfaction on control performance through the adjustment of these parameters 4 simulation results numerical simulations are conducted on an underactuated auv in this section to manifest the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method the detailed model information of the experimental auv can be referred to the following table xie et al 2020 two simulation cases with the same design parameters are considered here firstly different system uncertainties and perturbative torques are considered under the same control parameters to illustrate the robustness of the developed controller then simulation results of the developed controller in this paper are compared to the existing literature zheng et al 2019 and the traditional backstepping control scheme under the same simulation situation for these two cases initial state vectors are set as x 0 y 0 z

u 3 3 m s v 1 1 m s w 1 1 m s q 0 5 0 5 rad s r 0 5 0 5 rad s parameters of the performance functions and controllers are given in the following table 4 1 case 1 three scenarios are adopted here to show the robustness of the presented controller while the parameters in table 2 remain unchanged we set three types of perturbative torques and system uncertainties for simulations which are given as the following expression scenario i parameters of the auv remain the same as table 1 and the disturbances are given as d k k 0 5 sign k 0 5 sin 0 1 t k u v w q r scenario ii parameters of the auv in table 1 have 5 uncertainties and the disturbances are given as d k k sign k sin 0 1 t k u v w q r scenario iii parameters of the auv in table 1 have 10 uncertainties and the disturbances are given as d k k 1 5 sign k 1 5 sin 0 1 t k u v w q r for brevity it is only the trajectories and tracking errors of these three scenarios that are depicted in figs 2 3 the other simulation results of scenario i are presented in figs 4 5 trajectories of these three scenarios and the reference trajectory are given in fig 2 which imply that the auv could be forced to the reference trajectory with satisfactory performance additionally it is obviously that system uncertainties and disturbances have scarce impacts on the tracking precision that is the proposed controller possess desirable robustness against uncertainties and disturbances time responses of ρ e θ e ϕ e and the partial enlarged detail of ρ e are depicted in fig 3 by utilizing the devised controller we find that tracking errors will be stabilized within the prescribed performance constraints and the partial enlarged detail means that best control performance is obtained under scenario i estimations of f j j u q r and μ j are plotted in fig 4 observing the results we jump to the conclusion that unknown system dynamics will be well approximated and the outputs of the adaptive laws always remain bounded thus the proposed mlp algorithm is effective for the auv system time responses of d ˆ j and the control torques are described by fig 5 it is observed that the outputs of the control algorithm are always within the allowable range of the actuators from the above analysis we conclude that the proposed method have excellent tracking performance when the prescribed performance constraints and input quantization are considered for auv system 4 2 case 2 scenario i has been adopted in this section for comparative simulations simulation results of the existing literature zheng et al 2019 and the traditional backstepping control scheme are compared with that of the proposed method fig 6 shows tracking errors and the prescribed performance constraints since the perturbative torques are considered the performance of the backstepping method has degraded evidently and the prescribed performance cannot be ensured under this controller from the partial enlarged detail of ρ e we find that the proposed controller in this paper have better control precision than that of zheng et al 2019 even in the consideration of input quantization in order to illustrate this point from the aspect of quantitative analysis the integrated absolute error iae defined as 0 t ϑ d t with ϑ ρ e θ e ϕ e will be given in table 3 by analyzing the value iae under these three methods we can easily obtain the conclusion that the proposed method in this paper possesses better tracking precision 5 conclusions in this paper the robust trajectory tracking control issue is solved for underactuated auvs by combining backstepping technology nonlinear mapping approach and rbfnn technology input quantization unmodeled dynamics and predefined performance constraints are considered together throughout the controller design process by resorting to the compensating signals and mlp algorithm filtering errors could be reduced considerably and unknown system dynamics are estimated with low computational complexity all of the closed loop signals will remain uniformly ultimately bounded and the prescribed performance is achieved with the presented control scheme theorem analysis and numerical simulations have well

21123,the recently developed fsi sph model sun et al 2019c by combining the multi resolution δ sph scheme and a total lagrangian sph method is further extended for more complex three dimensional 3d fluid structure interaction fsi problems the fsi sph model is strengthened with advanced numerical techniques in which a combination of the particle shifting technique pst and the tensile instability control tic is adopted to prevent flow voids induced by the tensile instability the adaptive particle refinement apr is used to refine particles in the boundary layer region and coarsen particles in the far field to increase local accuracy but reduce overall computational cost moreover the δ sph and total lagrangian sph solvers are coupled through a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm which on one hand ensures the numerical accuracy and stability and on the other hand improves the efficiency when magnitudes of time steps between the two solvers differ from each other significantly in the numerical results challenging 2d and 3d fsi cases are simulated to test the accuracy of the proposed fsi sph model a new fsi benchmark with free surface is proposed to highlight the advantage of this fsi sph model in simulating free surface viscous flows in addition 3d effects in the fsi dam breaking and sloshing cases are investigated keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics δ sph fsi sph fluid structure interaction tensile instability viscous flow 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena are frequently encountered in different engineering problems in which the fluid evolution and structure deformation are tightly coupled on one hand the fluid part exerts unsteady hydrodynamic forces on the structure surface and on the other hand the structure response deformation vibration significantly affects the flow evolution taking examples from ocean engineering khayyer et al 2019 huge marine structures e g large container ships offshore platforms etc behave like elastic bodies in heavy sea conditions and therefore the hydroelastic effects are non negligible in the problems with water wave impacts or water entries the structure deformation significantly alerts the impact load iafrati et al 2019 in contrast for some small scale structures e g marine risers subsea pipelines small jacket platforms etc installed in currents the vortex shedding on the structure surface may excite the periodical vibration of the whole structure namely vortex induced vibration viv when the natural frequency of structure and the vortex shedding frequency are approximately equal the resonance may occur and threaten the structure safety therefore viv as a typical fsi problem has been widely investigated so far many experimental theoretical and numerical methods have been developed to solve these kinds of fsi problems williamson and govardhan 2004 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph has been developed for decades to solve complex fsi problems zhang et al 2017 liu and zhang 2019 sun et al 2019d oger et al 2020 tsurudome et al 2020 since sph doesn t need a mesh numerical errors due to the mesh distortion can be inherently avoided and therefore problems with large structure motions deformatons can be easily simulated besides the lagrangian characteristic of sph allows for a convenient tracking of free surface zheng et al 2017 sun et al 2018c tafuni et al 2018 he et al 2018 he et al 2019 he et al 2020 ni et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 water gas interface sun et al 2019c and fluid structure interface khayyer et al 2018 thanks to these advantages the development of sph models for solving fsi problems has been quite popular recently there are some advanced particle methods published to solve different fsi problems see e g sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 hermange et al 2019 gao et al 2018 sun et al 2019e zhang et al 2020 however sph also has some weaknesses that restrict its application to industrial applications for example the high frequency pressure oscillation is a main issue but it can be prevented with some advanced numerical techniques e g δ sph antuono et al 2010 density filtering technique colagrossi and landrini 2003 riemann ale sph marrone et al 2018 etc moreover sph accuracy decreases when the particle distribution becomes irregular which can be remedied using the particle shifting technique pst lind et al 2012 in addition the computational cost of three dimensional 3d sph simulation is usually very expensive peng et al 2019 but with the development of adaptive particle refinement apr see chiron et al 2018 the sph efficiency is much improved based on the way to solve the structure response sph models for modeling fsi problems can be divided into two categories the first is to couple the sph solver with a mesh based structure solver and the second is to develop a purely lagrangian particle method solving the fluid and structure portions within the same particle based framework in the first category the finite element method fem has been the most popular approach to couple with sph for example hu et al 2014 proposed a striped point in box pib algorithm to couple sph and fem in a high efficiency fourey et al 2017 compared the parallel and sequential staggered algorithms in sph fem coupling models and they found that the latter is more accurate and stable while the former is computationally more efficient zhang and wan 2018 proposed a mps fem algorithm which couples the moving particle semi implicit mps method a particle method similar to sph and fem for simulating sloshing problems they found that the hydrodynamic response of the fluid in an elastic tank is significantly different from the one in a rigid tank for more complex fsi problems towards industrial applications siemann et al 2018 proposed to use sph fem model to simulate ditching of flexible aircraft models ming et al 2016 adopted an sph fem method for the simulation of interaction between an underwater explosion and a ship hull the numerical results demonstrated apparent advantage of the coupled method for violent fsi problems with large deformations recently the eulerian smoothed particle hydrodynamics esph was coupled with other structure solvers for simulating interactions between a flexible slender body and viscous fluid see e g nasar et al 2019 esph maintains uniform particle distribution in the whole simulation and therefore it could offer higher accuracy however the lagrangian characteristic which is essential for free surface interfacial flow simulations no longer exists purely lagrangian particle methods have witnessed a rapid increase in popularity for fsi problems in the last few years zhan et al 2019 the superiority of the full particle methods with respect to sph fem couplings is that the fluid evolution and structure response can be solved in the unified framework of particle methods which share many procedures e g neighboring particle searching time stepping etc and therefore the parallel computation is straightforward and the efficiency of the fsi simulation is significantly improved a dual particle dynamics mps dpd mps was proposed for simulating the interaction between an incompressible fluid and a nonlinear elastic structure falahaty et al 2018 in the sph framework an isph sph coupled method was also reported recently for water slamming problems khayyer et al 2018 yang et al 2016 proposed an sph element bending group sph ebg method for modeling the impact of a dam breaking flow on an elastic structure he et al 2017 coupled the weakly compressible sph and total lagrangian sph for hydroelastic problems sun et al 2019c coupled the multiphase δ sph model with the total lagrangian sph method to investigate a two dimensional 2d fsi dam breaking case which was first experimentally investigated by liao et al 2015 however in that work sun et al 2019c only 2d simulations were conducted and for some cases e g the dam breaking with a shallow water depth the sph results showed some discrepancies with experimental data which implied that three dimensional 3d fsi simulations had to be further conducted to investigate 3d effects in most sph models for fsi simulations the structure boundaries are usually regarded as free slip walls for example in our previous work sun et al 2019c in that case the effect of viscous stress in the boundary layer and vortex shedding from the structure surface cannot be accurately considered and further the real structure response and flow evolution are not fully predicted in fact omitting the viscous stress in the boundary layer is fine for modeling large scale fsi problems in ocean engineering but for small scale problems e g viv sun et al 2019a the viscous stress in the fluid is quite relevant han and hu 2018 simulated viscous fsi problems and the results were validated by some classic fsi benchmarks however their model was not tested for flows of higher reynolds number where the boundary layer is thinner and the negative pressure is stronger which could lead to unphysical flow voids sun et al 2018a in addition cases with smaller density ratios between the structure and fluid should also be tested to evaluate the stability and robustness of the fsi coupling algorithm in this work a fsi sph model combining the multi resolution δ sph scheme sun et al 2017 and the total lagrangian sph method belytschko et al 2000 will be further extended from simulating 2d simple cases sun et al 2019c to more complex 3d fsi problems thanks to the addition of the tensile instability control tic in the δ sph scheme unphysical flow voids induced by negative pressure relative to the background pressure which is usually assumed to be zero in most sph simulations can be completely avoided even when the reynolds number is high besides the sph scheme is strengthened with apr to refine particles near the structure for improving local accuracy and coarsen far field particles for reducing the overall computational cost in addition the real viscous stress is accurately resolved inside the boundary layer and vortex generating and shedding downstream of the structure can be well simulated to accurately and efficiently couple the δ sph scheme with the total lagrangian sph method a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm is proposed based on the sequential staggered algorithm investigated by fourey et al 2017 as the total lagrangian sph method is explicit its time step is strictly limited by the bulk modulus whose magnitude is significantly larger than the reduced bulk modulus in the weakly compressible fluid linked to the sound speed solved by the δ sph scheme in order to match the δ sph and total lagrangian sph methods in an efficient manner a step and sub step coupling technique has been adopted in the mss algorithm that means within one time step of the fluid evolution the structure solver can advance continuously with several sub time steps until arriving at the same time instant as the fluid solver see in section 2 3 the step and sub step coupling technique allows an equilibrium accuracy with respect to the traditional step step coupling algorithm fourey et al 2017 in which the fluid and structure solvers share their minimum time step which would lead to expensive repeated calculations in the fluid part on these bases together with apr the fsi sph model can be easily extended for simulating three dimensional 3d fsi problems with the numerical code simply running on a desktop machine the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a brief introduction regarding to the δ sph scheme for viscous fluid simulation is presented firstly after which the advanced numerical techniques are briefly recalled to effectively avoid tensile instability and realize adaptive particle refinement and de refinement the total lagrangian sph method for the structure modeling is presented in section 2 2 in order to accurately and efficiently couple the fluid and structure solvers a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm is proposed in section 2 3 several validations for the fsi sph solver are presented in the section 3 including validations for viscous flows around solid bodies and fsi benchmarks with low and high density ratios after that a new benchmark with free surface is proposed to highlight the advantage of the fsi sph method in simulating free surface viscous flows thereafter 3d cases are tested with the first case involving a dam breaking flow impact on an elastic structure and the second involving a sloshing interaction with an elastic beam which were both designed towards marine oriented applications differences between 2d and 3d numerical results are discussed when comparing sph results with 3d experimental data in the last case a 3d fsi test is carried out towards the modeling of a more complex viscous fsi problem finally conclusions and future perspectives are presented at the end of the paper 2 multi resolution fsi sph model for fsi problems 2 1 the δ sph scheme the δ sph scheme antuono et al 2010 is an sph variant developed based on the classic sph model proposed by monaghan 2005 the main characteristic for δ sph is the δ term added in the continuity equation for preventing high frequency pressure oscillations recently in order to strengthen the capability of δ sph in modeling viscous flows considering the boundary layer effect at higher reynolds numbers a δ sph model was proposed in sun et al 2017 2018a 2019b the main characteristics of the δ sph are the adoption of particle shifting for regularizing particle distributions and the technique of tensile instability control tic to completely prevent numerical instability e g flow voids material fragmentation etc when the local pressure is negative we note that in sph simulations the void usually appearing in the region of strong negative pressure is a space without any particles empty region and this kind of flow void usually expands fast due to the zero internal pressure the occurrence of such an empty space is a numerical error unlike the physical cavitation for which the concerned zones should be occupied with vapor particles associated with the cavitation pressure furthermore to model the cavitation phenomena using sph a cavitation capturing technique was proposed recently by hammani 2020 in this technique when the pressure of some particles reaches the saturated vapor absolute pressure they are recognized as cavitation particles and their pressure is corrected with a modified equation of state however the cavitation effects are not addressed in the present work 2 1 1 discrete governing equations the governing equations of the δ sph scheme sun et al 2017 are written as 1 d ρ i d t ρ i j u j u i i w i j v j δ h c 0 j d i j i w i j v j d u i d t 1 ρ i j f p j p i i w i j v j g i 1 ρ i f i v d r i d t u i p i c 0 2 ρ i ρ 0 v i t m i ρ i t in the above equations the mass density volume pressure velocity and position of the i th particle are denoted by notations as m i ρ i v i p i u i and r i respectively f i v is the viscous force g i denotes the gravitational acceleration and ρ 0 is the reference density on the free surface where the pressure is zero from the last equation one can see that the mass of each particle is kept as constant while its density and volume vary in time therefore the total mass is accurately conserved the velocity divergence in the continuity equation is approximated using the particle approximation based on the kernel interpolation of the classic sph theory liu and liu 2010 indeed when the particles are uniformly distributed the accuracy of the classic sph operator is sufficient and more importantly the numerical stability is maintained even when the free surface breaking and splashing occur colagrossi et al 2009 the notation w i j w r i r j h represents the kernel function for which the wendland c2 kernel is adopted the smoothing length h i δ x i 2 will be adopted for two dimensional flows with δ x i being the initial particle spacing and h i δ x i 1 25 will be used for three dimensional flows to save computational costs in the momentum equation of traditional sph models the conservative form of pressure gradient f p j p i p i p j is usually adopted see e g monaghan 2005 while in this work in order to completely prevent the so called tensile instability a tic technique sun et al 2018a has been adopted with this technique f p j p i is written as 2 f p j p i p j p i p i is negative and i s f p j p i p i is positive or i s f where s f stands for the particle set in the free surface region which is formed by the free surface particles and their neighbors see more in sun et al 2017 according to the weakly compressible hypothesis which states that if the mach number m a u c 0 is less than 0 1 the weakly compressible flow simulation converges to the solution of an incompressible flow when acoustic frequencies are filtered out the artificial sound speed c 0 is set equal to 15 u where u is the characteristic velocity in this paper u can be the inflow velocity of a free stream flow or u equals to 2 g h in a dam breaking or sloshing flow where h is the initial water depth inside the numerical diffusive term antuono et al 2010 marrone et al 2011 of the continuity equation d i j is written as 3 d i j 2 ρ j ρ i 1 2 ρ i l ρ j l r i j r i j r i j 2 where r i j r j r i and l is the renormalized spatial gradient see more details in antuono et al 2010 specifically the coefficient δ 0 1 is adopted for the density diffusion which is independent of the specific problem and converges to zero with the increase of the particle resolution h 0 when simulating viscous flows the viscous force monaghan 2005 in the momentum equation is written as 4 f μ i v k μ j π i j i w i j v j π i j u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity and k 2 n 2 where n is the spacial dimension of the problem when modeling viscous flows considering the effects of the boundary layer the real dynamic viscosity μ is assigned for the fluid and the no slip boundary condition is enforced on the solid wall note that for high reynolds number flows the boundary layer is very thin so that sufficient particle resolution should be arranged inside the boundary layer where the particles can be refined using the technique of adaptive particle refinement chiron et al 2018 however for the sph modeling of impact flows for example the dam breaking flow in this work the physical viscosity of the fluid is less important but an extra artificial viscosity is needed to dissipate the compressible energy after strong flow impact marrone et al 2015 therefore instead of using the physical viscosity term in eq 4 we adopt the artificial viscosity see e g marrone et al 2011 as 5 f α i v α ρ 0 h c 0 j π i j i w i j v j π i j u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 where the parameter α is assigned as 0 1 for the dam breaking flow in this work in these impact flows the viscous force is less important and therefore a free slip boundary condition is imposed on the solid wall boundary marrone et al 2011 we note that the dam breaking test is the only test case in this work that uses these artificial viscosity and free slip boundary condition see section 3 4 when modeling viscous flows inside the viscous boundary layer near a no slip boundary the shear stress induced by large gradient of the velocity can lead to distortion of the particle distribution and further introduce spurious perturbations in the pressure and vorticity field therefore the particle shifting technique pst is necessary to ensure a uniform particle distribution during the simulation sun et al 2017 with this technique the particle position at every time step is modified as 6 r i r i δ r i where the repositioning vector δ r i is evaluated as 7 δ r i cfl ma 2 h i 2 i 1 r w i j w δ x i h i n i w i j m j ρ i ρ j this formula is inspired by the pst algorithm of lind et al 2012 but reformulated in a weakly compressible fashion the two parameters r 2 and n 4 are used in eq 7 to obtain a fast particle regularization pst has been proven in sun et al 2016 to be able to maintain a smooth vorticity field in the simulation of viscous flows the 4 t h order runge kutta method is used to integrate the governing equations in time with the time step δ t defined as 8 δ t cfl h c 0 where cfl 1 5 is used for confined viscous flows and cfl 1 0 for free surface impact flows where the free surface impact and splashing lead to severe truncation of the kernel function which requires a small courant number to ensure numerical stability 2 1 2 implementation of the solid wall boundary condition in this work the fixed ghost particle technique marrone et al 2011 adami et al 2012 is implemented thanks to its high accuracy in avoiding kernel truncation and modeling both free slip and no slip boundary conditions on one hand the fixed ghost particles serve to provide a boundary condition for the fluid simulation one the other hand the structure response is solved based on the same ghost particles which update their velocity and position in every time step in this way the fluid part and the structure are coupled with each other in addition to uniformly distribute fluid particles around the solid boundaries a particle packing algorithm colagrossi et al 2012 is implemented at the beginning of the sph simulation the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are implemented according to federico et al 2012 and a damping zone with higher viscosity is implemented before the out flow buffer zone to avoid the instability induced by the back flowing particles due to strong vortices sun et al 2018a 2 1 3 adaptive particle refinement apr the technique of adaptive particle refinement apr initially proposed by barcarolo et al 2014 and further improved in chiron et al 2018 is adopted in this work to achieve three main goals 1 improving numerical efficiency with apr refined particle resolution can be only used in a small region while in the other part of the domain coarse particles are used in this way the total particle number and hence the computational cost are significantly reduced especially for 3d simulations 2 improving local accuracy for resolving the viscous boundary layer as is well known in the literature whether for the simulation using mesh based or particle based methods viscous flows at high reynolds numbers usually lead to very thin boundary layers and the shedding of small eddies which require refined mesh particle resolutions to accurately calculate the viscous stress and capture the small scale flow features with apr the particle resolution in the sph simulation can be easily refined in the boundary layer region 3 accurate modeling of fsi problems with very thin structure thickness in the present fsi sph model the resolution of fluid and structure particles near the fluid structure interface is designed to be equal to ensure a high coupling accuracy when the structure thickness is very thin the structure particle resolution will be very high because the total lagrangian sph method solving the structure response requires to discretize the entire bulk of the structure into uniform particles with at least four particles in the thickness direction a very fine particle resolution in the structure further leads to a high particle resolution in the fluid fortunately with apr fluid particles in a small region near the structure can be locally refined to fit the resolution of structure particles and therefore ensure a high fsi coupling accuracy there while in the rest of the fluid region coarse particles can be used 2 2 total lagrangian sph method for modeling elastic structures different to the weakly compressible sph model used for the fluid in the total lagrangian sph method belytschko et al 2000 vignjevic et al 2006 for the structure the particle density is assumed as constant and therefore the solving of the continuity equation is unnecessary the second difference is the adoption of the lagrangian kernel which signifies that the searching for the neighboring particles is completed in the first time step based on the initial particle distribution in addition the evaluation of the kernel function and its gradients are also completed in the first time step and will be repeatedly used in each time step of the whole simulation the adoption of the lagrangian kernel not only saves the computational cost but also inherently avoids numerical instability issues e g tensile instability which are usually induced by distorted particle configuration in the region under tensile force while in the δ sph model introduced in the previous subsection even though a eulerian kernel was utilized with the tic technique the tensile instability in the negative pressure region can also be prevented we note that to be consistent with the designation adopted in the literature belytschko et al 2000 vignjevic et al 2006 the correct name of the solid solver should be total lagrangian sph method rather than total lagrangian particle tlp method used in our previous paper sun et al 2019c the cauchy equation is used as the governing equation in the total lagrangian sph method lin et al 2015 9 d u d t 1 ρ 0 s 0 p g where u denotes the velocity of the structure particle and ρ 0 s is the material density 0 is the divergence operator with subscript 0 indicating that a lagrangian kernel is used and the kernel function is evaluated with the initial particle configuration x p denotes the first piola kirchhoff stress tensor rudnicki 2014 and can be written with the cauchy stress tensor σ as 10 p det f σ f t where f is the tensor of deformation gradient det f indicates the determinant of f and the superscript t stands for the inverse of the transposed tensor rudnicki 2014 f can be evaluated with 11 f x x where the vector x denotes the current particle position in order to avoid the numerical error caused by the truncated kernel function on the structure surface the tensor of deformation gradient can be written using the corrected kernel approximation sun et al 2016 as 12 f i x x i j x j x i m 0 i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j m 0 x i j x j x i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j 1 where v 0 is the initial particle volume note that in eq 12 the kernel function and its gradients are all evaluated based on the initial particle configuration regarding the cauchy stress tensor σ rudnicki 2014 in two dimensions σ can be expanded as 13 σ 11 σ 22 σ 12 e s 1 ν s 2 1 ν s 0 ν s 1 0 0 0 1 ν s ε 11 ε 22 ε 12 where e s and ν s are the young modulus and the poisson ratio respectively according to rudnicki 2014 in three dimensions σ is expanded as 14 σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 σ 12 σ 23 σ 31 e s 1 ν s 1 2 ν s 1 ν s ν s ν s 0 0 0 ν s 1 ν s ν s 0 0 0 ν s ν s 1 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s ε 11 ε 22 ε 33 ε 12 ε 23 ε 31 the euler strain tensor ε rudnicki 2014 can be expanded as 15 ε f t e f t e 1 2 l l t l t l l v x v x x where e is the green lagrange strain tensor l is the displacement gradient tensor similar to eq 12 l can also be discretized by the corrected kernel approximation sun et al 2016 as 16 l i v x i j v j v i m 0 i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j m 0 x i j x j x i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j 1 based on eqs 12 and 16 the discretized form of the first piola kirchhoff stress tensor p can be obtained and then substituting it into eq 20 yields the discrete momentum equation in order to maintain the exact conservation of the momentum for the divergence operator the classic symmetric sph approximation is adopted see hereinafter in eq 18 as tested in belytschko et al 2000 tensile instability can be completely prevented after using the lagrangian kernel however total lagrangian sph has another instability named the hourglass instability due to the susceptibility to zero energy modes which are caused by the rank deficiency related to nodal integration see also ganzenmüller et al 2015 in the numerical cases presented in the paper the instability is not severe because we adopt two remedial treatments the first treatment is to reduce the ratio between smoothing length and particle spacing different to the fluid part solved by the δ sph model here we impose h s δ x 1 3 which is more effective than h s δ x 2 for preventing particle clumping in problems with large structure deformations the reduced smoothing length leads to a small time step for the structure solver but thanks to the modified fluid structure coupling algorithm which will be presented in the next subsection the overall efficiency of the fsi solver is not significantly affected the second treatment is to add a slight artificial viscosity into the momentum equation lin et al 2015 the artificial viscous force p ν i j applied by particle j on particle i is written as 17 p ν i j det f i j f t i j α s c s h s ρ 0 s v j v i x j x i x j x i 2 0 01 h s 2 this artificial viscosity converges to zero with the increase of the particle resolution h s 0 in this work the coefficient α s is set as 0 2 we note that the reduced smoothing length and the artificial viscosity prevented the occurrence of instability for the cases presented in the present work however techniques using stress points randles and libersky 2000 or the hourglass control proposed by ganzenmüller et al 2015 should be adopted to prevent the hourglass instability in the general case the discrete momentum equation lin et al 2015 in the total lagrangian sph model is finally written as 18 d v i d t 1 ρ 0 s j p i p j p ν i j 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j g this momentum equation is integrated in time using the 4 t h order runge kutta scheme as for the fluid part following lin et al 2015 the time step δ t ˆ s for the total lagrangian sph method is determined as 19 δ t ˆ s 0 8 h c s c s k s ρ 0 s where k s is the bulk modulus which can be evaluated as k s e s 3 1 2 ν s 2 3 efficient coupling between the δ sph scheme and the total lagrangian sph method for fsi problems in the fsi simulation the fluid evolution is affected by the boundary condition including the position and velocity from the deformable structure and in return the structure response is also affected by the hydrodynamic force exerted by the fluid particles in the present fsi sph solver the structure surface is discretized into uniformly distributed fixed ghost particles which have the same initial spacing as the nearby fluid particles the ghost particles on one hand serve for the calculation of the structure deformation in the total lagrangian sph solver and on the other hand serve as the boundary particles in the δ sph solver in the investigation of sph fem coupling fourey et al 2017 compared the conventional parallel staggered cps and conventional sequential staggered css algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency they found that in the weakly compressible sph model the time step is relatively small and therefore cps and css algorithms are both able to predict acceptable results however for challenging problems like quasi static cases with only hydrostatic pressure or dynamic cases with high frequency pressure oscillations the cps algorithm shows pressure noise while the css algorithm reveals better numerical stability but as a drawback it requires higher computational cost after numerical investigation of the total lagrangian sph solver we find that limited by the bulk modulus of the structure the time step denoted by δ t s of the total lagrangian sph model for the structure is much smaller than the time step denoted by δ t f of δ sph for the fluid since a hypothesis of weak compressibility is considered in the previous css algorithm fourey et al 2017 the overall time step equals to min δ t s δ t f where δ t s δ t f therefore directly applying the css algorithm of fourey et al 2017 would lead to repeated calculations in the fluid part within a δ t f to solve that problem we propose a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm in which a step and sub step coupling manner is adopted to improve the efficiency this strategy was already used in hermange et al 2019 where authors used a cps based scheme with multiple sub time steps in which the sub steps were used in the fluid rather than in the structure since the structure was modeled there with an implicit fem solver with quite large time steps the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 the fsi coupling starts from the instant when the fluid solution arrives at t n and the structure solution arrives at t k practically we have t n t k where subscripts n and k stand for the step numbers in the fluid and structure solvers respectively afterward the fsi coupling procedure is written as follows in step 1 see the red number in fig 1 the structure solver provides the position and velocity of the ghost particles for the fluid solver serving as the boundary condition the first layer of the ghost particle is distributed on the structure surface and other layers are extended along the inward normals into the structure the thickness of the ghost particle layers should be larger than the kernel radius in step 2 the fluid solution advances one time step δ t f and arrives at the time instant t n 1 in step 3 the structure solver receives the pressure p and viscous stress f v from the fluid portion at t n 1 in step 4 based on the fluid forces from the time instant t n 1 the structure solver advances for q sub steps until t k q and finally we have t n 1 t k q in the structure solution more specifically step 4 when taking the hydrodynamic force from the fluid part into account the momentum equation in the total lagrangian sph method becomes 20 d u i d t 1 ρ 0 s 0 p i g i f f l u i d the force f f l u i d exerted by the fluid on the structure can be measured by summating the interacting forces see bouscasse et al 2013b and sun et al 2015 between the fluid particles at t n 1 and ghost particles at t n when a no slip boundary condition is applied on the structure surface the viscous stress f v is also included in f f l u i d when the fsi coupling process within a time step δ t f starting from time step t n is finished the next loop starts from t n 1 in an analogous way from the above process one can see that within one time step of the fluid solution the structure solver advances for q sub steps and q can be determined by 21 q δ t f δ t ˆ s where the function gives the least integer greater than or equal to δ t f δ t ˆ s where δ t ˆ s is the time step determined by eq 19 finally the time step for the structure solver is determined as 22 δ t s δ t f q through the above process by efficiently coupling δ sph and total lagrangian sph models an efficient fsi sph model is established which will be thoroughly validated in the next section for fsi problems in two and three dimensions 3 numerical validations 3 1 validation of the viscous fluid solver a preliminary test cast is used to validate the viscous fluid solver based on the δ sph scheme without fsi this is a test case involving a viscous flow past a bluff body in this test a cylinder with diameter d 0 1 m and an attached plate are both treated as rigid bodies which are immersed in a viscous current with density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and kinematic viscosity ν f 10 3 m 2 s see the sketch in fig 2 the length of the fluid domain is l 2 2 5 m and the width is h 2 0 41 m the current enters from the left side and freely exits from the right side on all the solid walls including the lateral walls the cylinder and plate surfaces no slip boundary conditions are imposed the cylinder centre marked by c is located at 0 0 which is the origin of the reference frame and the tip point a of the plate is located at 0 25 m 0 the bottom of the flow is located at y 0 2 m and therefore the axis of symmetry of the immersed body is located slightly below the axis of symmetry of the fluid domain with a shifted distance of 0 005 m the velocity distribution along the y axis at the in flow boundary is given by turek and hron 2006 as 23 u f x 0 25 y 1 5 u y 0 2 h 2 y 0 2 0 5 h 2 2 u f y 0 25 y 0 where u 1 m s and the reynolds number for this problem can be calculated as r e u d ν f 100 the δ sph simulation is conducted with the initial particle spacing d δ x 100 the vorticity distribution in the flow is monitored during the sph simulation which is terminated after a steady state is reached the vorticity field at t 6 5 s is shown in fig 3 from which one may observe that the vorticity distribution is stable at this time instant and periodic vortex shedding is not observed this is because in this test the reynolds number is relatively low and the body is rigid however since the centre of the cylinder is not positioned at the horizontal symmetrical line of the fluid domain one can observe the unsymmetrical distribution of vorticity above and below the plate attached to the cylinder we can deduce that the cylinder is subjected to a lift force the time evolutions of the lift and drag forces on the rigid body are plotted in fig 4 still with the particle resolution d δ x 100 during the time duration of t 5 0 s 6 5 s the variation of drag and lift force on the body is very small which implies that the flow is stable at t 6 5 s and it verifies the conclusion obtained previously based on the vorticity field finally the lift force becomes steady at f l 10 77 n and the drag force converges to f d 137 51 n table 1 shows the comparison of the sph solution with the reference fem solution given by turek and hron 2006 and the relative error is only 2 2 and 0 59 for the lift and drag forces respectively fig 5 plots the convergence of the lift force for three different particle resolutions respectively d δ x 25 d δ x 50 and d δ x 100 one can see the convergence of the oscillation amplitude in the δ sph solutions with the increase of the particle resolution with the two particle resolutions d δ x 50 and d δ x 100 the average lift forces almost coincide 3 2 validation of the fsi sph model using classic fsi benchmarks in this section two classic benchmarks are simulated to test the capability of the established fsi sph model for fsi problems with different density ratios the two test cases correspond to the fsi2 and fsi3 cases by turek and hron 2006 the boundary conditions and parameters for the fluid are the same as those in section 3 1 while the attached plate to the cylinder is elastic here and therefore can oscillate under the forces induced by the vortex shedding we underline that fsi2 has been the most widely used case in the literature conversely fsi3 is less tested however since in fsi3 the density ratio between the structure and the fluid is only 1 which can be regarded as a small density ratio it makes fsi3 more challenging and requires a stronger fsi coupling algorithm in the numerical solver in addition in most of the literature only the displacement of the tip of the elastic plate point a in fig 2 is validated by comparing with the reference solution while for the fsi3 test in this section we will also show the comparison of the drag force coefficient and strouhal number to provide a more comprehensive validation 3 2 1 test case fsi2 in the test case fsi2 the density of the elastic plate is ρ 0 s 10 4 k g m 3 which leads to a density ratio between the structure and fluid of ρ 0 s ρ 0 f 10 the young modulus and poisson ratio are e s 1 4 10 6 p a and ν s 0 4 respectively due to the lift force see the previous section exerted by the viscous fluid on the elastic plate the plate deforms and vibrates under the periodic vortex shedding from the structure surface and finally a steady viv state is achieved in order to reduce the computational cost of this long duration periodic simulation adaptive particle refinement has been applied to discretize the fluid domain and the structure inside the rectangular fluid region of x y 0 15 0 85 0 16 0 16 the particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 50 while outside this region d δ x 25 is adopted to reduce the particle number and hence the computational cost such an arrangement is able to ensure refined particle resolution near the structure to accurately resolve the shear stress in the viscous boundary layer fig 6 depicts the distributions of the stress component σ 11 in the elastic plate and the vorticity ω f in the flow at four time instants a smooth vorticity field is obtained in the flow field with a good continuity at the interface between different particle resolutions the elastic plate is bent into different shapes under the hydrodynamic force generated by the vortical flow we measured the vertical displacement on the tip of the elastic plate and plotted it in fig 7 after a transitional stage the vertical vibration of the tip enters a steady state with a constant amplitude in the time period between 14 and 16 s the vertical displacement of point a see fig 2 is compared between different numerical solvers by bhardwaj and mittal 2012 li and favier 2017 turek and hron 2006 and the present fsi sph model in fig 8 we obtained a very close agreement with the lattice boltzmann method lbm solution by li and favier 2017 the similarity between the two methods sph and lbm is the solving of the incompressible flow with weakly compressible hypotheses the amplitudes of the vibration agree very well between the sph lbm and ib fem of bhardwaj and mittal 2012 but a phase shifting is observed in the solution of bhardwaj and mittal 2012 in addition the amplitudes of the three solutions are all slightly larger than the one given by turek and hron 2006 however the discrepancy is quite small 3 2 2 test case fsi3 in this subsection a more challenging test case named as fsi3 by turek and hron 2006 is considered by increasing the maximum velocity at the in flow boundary to be u 2 m s which leads to a larger reynolds number r e u d ν f 200 and increasing the young modulus of the elastic plate to be e s 5 6 10 6 p a which will lead to a higher vibrating frequency in addition the density ratio is reduced to be ρ 0 s ρ 0 f 1 in order to accurately resolve the viscous boundary layer near the structure inside the fluid region of x y 0 1 0 5 0 12 0 12 the initial particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 100 outside this region and inside x y 0 15 0 85 0 16 0 16 the initial particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 50 while in the rest of the flow d δ x 25 is adopted to reduce the particle number and hence the computational cost the vorticity in the flow and the stress component in the elastic plate are plotted in fig 9 at four time instants different from the previous case fsi2 in fsi3 the vorticity is stronger but due to a larger young modulus the vibrating amplitude of the elastic plate is smaller the vertical displacement of the point a is plotted in fig 10 as it can be seen here the vibrating frequency of the elastic plate is much higher since this test case is less adopted in the literature the full time evolution of the plate vibrating amplitude is less documented and therefore here we compare the time history of the fsi sph result with only one reference solution obtained with the regularized lattice boltzmann rlb method by li et al 2019 a good agreement is obtained as was also has been observed in the previous fsi2 case even though there is a 4 3 difference in the plate vibration period to give a wider comparison in the literature we found some other reference results including the maximum vertical displacement a m of the point a strouhal number s t and the drag force coefficient c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 d the strouhal number is defined as s t f a d u where f a is the vibrating frequency these numerical results are all listed in table 2 once again we found that the present sph results are very close to the other numerical solutions 3 3 proposing a new test fsi4 with the free surface effect in this section a new benchmark named fsi4 considering the free surface effect is proposed inspired by the classic benchmarks in turek and hron 2006 the proposing of this test is owing to the outstanding capability of the sph method for modeling free surface flows including the surface rolling breaking and even fragmentation since a free surface is included the gravity force has to be considered when designing this benchmark otherwise the froude number would be infinitely large as has been investigated by fourey et al 2017 in a quasi static problem with only hydrostatic pressure the accuracy of the numerical solution is quite sensitive to the stability property of the fsi coupling algorithm therefore before the hydrodynamic test a hydrostatic test is firstly carried out and the sph results are presented in appendix a which shows that the elastic plate can reach its equilibrium state in different rest conditions this test primarily verifies the stability and accuracy of the present fsi sph solver for hydrostatic cases when the gravity is only compensated by a static pressure gradient in the proposed benchmark fsi4 the same structure i e a rigid cylinder with an elastic plate see fig 2 is immersed in a free stream with a uniform velocity distribution u u 1 m s and v 0 at the inlet rather than the parabolic velocity profile used in the benchmark of turek and hron 2006 therefore a free slip solid wall boundary condition has been assigned to the fluid bottom while a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the structure surface the fluid region is occupied by a viscous fluid whose density is ρ f 1000 k g m 3 and kinematic viscosity is ν f 5 10 4 m 2 s the fluid domain length is l 3 6 m and its height h 0 6 m the cylinder centre is placed at x 0 y 0 5 m and it is 0 8 m far from the inlet and 2 8 m from the outlet y 0 denotes the fluid bottom and y 0 6 m locates the undisturbed free surface which means the initial submergence of the cylinder is d c 0 1 m a gravity force g 1 m s 2 is considered in this case therefore the froude number and reynolds number for this test are f r u g d 3 16 and r e u d ν f 200 respectively parameters for the elastic plate are ρ s 1000 k g m 3 e s 1 4 10 6 p a and ν s 0 4 the sph simulation is run with the particle resolution d δ x 50 different to the results of the classic fsi benchmark in turek and hron 2006 in this new case the elastic plate is subjected to a close to steady lift force and therefore it is always bent upward see fig 11 we note that this lift force is not due to the buoyancy force since when the density ratio is ρ s ρ f 1 the gravity force counteracts the buoyancy see more in appendix a from the velocity contours in fig 11 we find that the elastic plate is immersed in a low velocity region which is the wake of the flow past the circular cylinder from the bottom plot of fig 11 and knowing that the flow has reached a quasi steady regime around the cylinder and the plate which can be observed in fig 12 we can deduce that the global fluid mechanics of the flow is as such i the incoming flow is deflected by the cylinder presence on both sides up and down ii on both cylinder sides flow separation occurs due to the non profiled shape of the cylinder and the sufficiently high reynolds number iii in the upper side region of the cylinder free surface side the flow is relatively free to move since it is bounded by a free surface and thus it jumps over the mean free surface level and then falls down to it farther downstream iv the latter induces a bending of the flow between the free surface and the plate with pressures below the hydrostatic pressure there since we know that in a quasi steady flow the piezometric pressure p p ρ g z decays towards the center of curvature of the flow streamlines so the piezometric pressure decays from the free surface towards the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate meaning that the pressure at the limit between the active flow and the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate is quite lower than the hydrostatic pressure at this depth v inside the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate velocities are small which can be checked on the top plot of fig 11 and there is in a quasi static situation so p is almost constant there so the pressure on the upper side of the plate is quite below the hydrostatic pressure at this depth vi in the lower side region of the cylinder bottom side the flow is guided by the bottom and cannot deflect much so that streamlines keep quite straight with a pressure close to the level of the hydrostatic pressure there vii in the end there is thus a suction effect bending the plate upwards due to the difference between the upper side and lower side pressures along the plate the vorticity contour depicts the shape of a von kármán vortex street however due to the presence of the free surface the vortex street starts further downstream and is horizontally elongated and vertically compressed similar phenomena were also observed in sun et al 2016 the horizontal d x and vertical d y displacements of the tip of the elastic plate are measured and plotted in fig 12 as it can be seen after a transitional stage the plate tip oscillates around a horizontal deflection d x 5 5 10 3 m with an amplitude 1 7 10 3 m and oscillates around a vertical deflection d y 0 058 m with an amplitude 4 5 10 3 m the small oscillating amplitude is mainly because the vortex shedding from the elastic plate is delayed by the presence of the free surface and occurs downstream the tip of the plate contrary to what happens in the unbounded cases fsi2 and fsi3 3 4 3d fsi dam breaking test starting from this section the proposed fsi sph model will be tested on different 3d fsi cases firstly the fsi dam breaking case originally designed by liao et al 2015 is simulated in three dimensions to investigate the dimensional effect by comparing with the 2d results in sun et al 2019c the experimental data liao et al 2015 will be adopted to validate the sph results the numerical and experimental set ups are identical and the sketch is depicted in fig 13 the elastic plate is made of rubber whose thickness is t 0 004 m with density 1164 k g m 3 and elastic modulus as e s 3 5 10 6 p a in this work we firstly choose the case with an initial water depth h 0 2 m that is because according to the investigations in sun et al 2019c a shallower water depth implies a more obvious 3d effect in the 3d numerical test the horizontal displacements of two markers are tracked in the sph simulation one marker is located on the vertical centre line of the elastic plate and another marker on the side edge see fig 13 both markers have the initial height h 1 0 0875 m which corresponds to marker 1 in the experiment of liao et al 2015 the displacement of the marker reflects the deflection of the elastic plate it is worth noting that the accurate considering of the gate motion at the initial stage of the dam breaking test has an essential effect on the formation of the dam breaking flow and the impact force on the structure because the gradual lifting up of the gate slightly delays the collapse of the water column only when the gate motion is considered one may obtain a close agreement between the numerical result and the experimental data to accurately reproduce the gate motion in the sph model we discretize the gate with fixed ghost particles and allow these ghost particles moving upward with the following motion law sun et al 2019c 24 h g t 285 115 t 3 72 305 t 2 0 1463 t where h g t denotes the height of the gate bottom which is obtained through a polynomial fit based on the experimental data in liao et al 2015 different to the 2d multiphase simulations conducted in sun et al 2019c in this study single phase sph simulations are carried out until t 0 5 s after which the air effect becomes dominant when the air cavity is formed after the water tongue flows over the elastic plate and impacts the vertical wall see sun et al 2019c in the 3d sph simulations to save computational cost three particle resolutions are adopted for the particles close to the elastic plate i e within the pink dashed box see the middle snapshot in the first row of fig 14 the particle spacing is refined to δ x t 6 which is fine enough to obtain a converged sph simulation see sun et al 2019c for the particle outside of the blue dashed box the particles are de refined to δ x 2 t 3 in between the resolution is δ x t 3 with the adoption of the adaptive particle refinement the total particle number for this 3d test is reduced from 2 7 10 8 to 2 0 10 6 i e a reduction rate of 92 5 snapshots at five time instants of the 2d left column from sun et al 2019c and 3d middle column sph simulations are depicted in fig 14 where the experimental snapshots from liao et al 2015 are displayed on the right side one may find a good agreement between the three sets of results except the part of the splashing jets in addition at the multi resolution interface particle volume ratio is 1 8 in 3d a continuous pressure is observed without apparent disturbance when observing the horizontal displacements of the markers as shown in fig 15 one may find that the displacement of the marker on the side edge agrees better with the experimental data this is understandable because the experimental data was measured by a high speed camera set up at one side of the flow tank and therefore only the movement of the side edge of the elastic plate is recorded see liao et al 2015 from the comparison between the two 3d sph curves measured on the central line and on the edge one may find that the 3d effect is the most distinct at the initial stage of the flow impact during the duration when the plate deflects from vertical to the maximum deflection i e 0 28 s t 0 4 s it is also when the differences with the 2d results are the more marked to visually show the 3d flow features snapshots at three time instants are depicted in fig 16 with the fluid particles colored by pressure and the structure particles colored by the stress component σ 22 the flow variation in the z direction perpendicular to the flow orientation is not apparent except for the splashing part this is why in the numerical simulation of the classic dam breaking case dam breaking flow impact on a rigid wall see marrone et al 2011 2d simulations were proven to be sufficient however when observing the stress distribution on the plate clear stress variation in the z direction can be noticed at t 0 29 s and t 0 32 s the negative stress σ 22 close to the side edge of the plate is weaker when time goes to t 0 37 s the plate stress variation in z direction disappears which also agrees with the trend that the 3d effect gradually vanishes in fig 15 fig 17 shows the deformation of the elastic plate at different time instants one can see clearly the 3d characteristic during the plate deformation process however when the plate is fully bent the 3d characteristic vanishes further we conducted another simulation with initial water depth h 0 4 m and the displacement of the plate is plotted in fig 18 as it can be seen the two 3d sph results almost coincide with the 2d result which confirms that the 3d effect becomes weaker in the case with a larger initial water depth as mentioned in liao et al 2015 we deduce that a larger water depth leads to a much larger impact pressure and that this large directional fluid loading of the plate which is uniform in the transverse z direction leads to a plate response which is itself more in the x y plane with a weaker relative response in the z direction 3 5 sloshing with an elastic beam clamped on the tank bottom in this subsection the fsi sloshing problem experimentally studied by vera 2015 will be numerically investigated using the fsi sph model a sketch of the fsi sloshing problem is depicted in fig 19 where a local reference frame is fixed to the tank with its origin at the bottom center of an elastic beam the elastic beam is made of rubber with density 1100 kg m3 and is clamped on the middle of the tank bottom the beam length equals to the initial fluid depth thickness equals to 4 mm and width equals to 33 2 mm tank width equals to 39 mm young modulus of the elastic beam is e s 6 10 6 p a and poisson coefficient is ν s 0 45 two fluid depths were tested in the experimental study vera 2015 respectively d m 114 8 mm named mid depth hereinafter and d s 57 4 mm named shallow depth hereinafter with a forced periodical motion of the tank around origin of the reference frame see fig 20 liquid sloshing is induced and will bend the elastic beam left and right periodically time law of the inclination angle φ t of the tank is written as 25 φ t a sin 2 π ω t where a 4 for both the mid and shallow depth cases but the frequency is ω m 0 826 for the mid depth case and ω s 0 61 for the shallow depth case the tank height h is 334 5 mm length l is 609 mm while the tank width b is only 39 mm see fig 19 such a narrow tank induces significant damping effect due to the boundary layer on the tank wall especially when the liquid viscosity is high in the original experimental study both water and oil were used while in the present sph simulation we select the case with oil since it would present a more obvious 3d effect due to the viscous boundary layer on the tank wall the oil density is 917 kg m3 with a physical viscosity 5 10 5 m2s 1 considered in the sph simulation a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the tank wall and the beam surface to accurately consider the boundary layer effect further the width of the elastic beam b e is only 33 2 mm which means that two gaps exist between the beam edge and the tank wall see the side view of the problem in fig 19 b size of the gap is 2 9 mm which is large enough to allow viscous fluid to pass on the contrary in a 2d numerical simulation both the viscous boundary layer on the lateral tank wall and the gap between the beam edge and tank cannot be taken into account and therefore from this perspective this case should not be simplified into 2d in the sloshing experiment of vera 2015 time evolution of the x displacement of the beam extremity in the local reference frame was measured see the sketch in fig 20 and the data will be used to verify the present sph result in our sph simulation the tank motion fully follows eq 25 while at the initial stage of vera s experiment the tank was gradually accelerated to reach the desired sloshing motion of eq 25 the slow acceleration leads to a phase delay therefore when validating our sph results using the experimental data time instants of sph results will be shifted to counteract this delay in that way the numerical and experimental data will be in phase in this work 2d and 3d sph simulations are carried out for the mid depth and shallow depth cases respectively to investigate the dimension and oil depth effects an initial particle spacing δ x 1 mm is used for all the simulations according to the sph investigation recently conducted by hermange et al 2019 this particle spacing is enough to achieve a converged sph solution snapshots of the fluid evolution and beam deflection are depicted in fig 21 on the left side shows the results of mid depth oil case and on the right side shows the shallow depth results as it can be seen phenomena of 3d sph results are closer to the experimental snapshots vera 2015 especially in the mid depth case a wave breaking occurs in the 2d sph result while in both 3d sph simulation and experiment this kind of wave breaking is not observed moreover in the 2d sph result of shallow depth case the flow separation from the beam leads to a large flow void which is not apparent in the 3d sph simulation and experiment to further highlight the 3d effect in the fsi sloshing case distributions of the horizontal velocity in the sloshing flow are depicted in fig 22 one may observe that the velocity close to the tank wall i e inside the boundary layer is much smaller than the velocity in the middle of the flow in addition at the gap between the beam edge and the tank wall a high velocity current is observed which is another factor that contributes to the 3d characteristic of the problem in fact as also concluded by bouscasse et al 2013a the boundary layer leads to a global friction on the fluid and therefore large viscous damping to the liquid motion that s why in 2d sph simulations due to the lack of this damping the fluid sloshing is much more dynamic and even leads to wave breaking on the free surface finally in fig 23 time evolution of the local x displacement of the beam extremity see fig 20 is plotted one may observe that in both cases with mid and shallow depths 3d sph results are closer to the experimental data than 2d sph results a fair agreement is obtain between 3d sph result of the mid depth case and the experiment but for the shallow depth case a discrepancy still exists for the 3d sph result but the discrepancy is much smaller than 2d this discrepancy was also found in the numerical results using other methods see e g degroote et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 hermange et al 2019 despite the small discrepancy through the two fsi sloshing cases with different initial liquid depths a clear difference is observed in 3d and 2d sph simulations and results of the former is much closer to the experimental data 3 6 3d fsi test considering viscous stress and vortex shedding the established fsi sph model is tested in this section for a 3d problem considering viscous effects in this case a flexible beam with one end fixed on the ground is vertically exposed in a free stream viscous flow experimental data tian et al 2014 and other numerical solutions by an entropic lattice boltzmann method elbm see dorschner et al 2018 and immersed boundary fem ib fem see tian et al 2014 are available in the literature providing sufficient references for validating the fsi sph results the geometrical parameters for the elastic beam are l b 5 and h b 0 2 where l is the beam length in vertical direction b the width and h the thickness see fig 24 the structure parameters are e e s ρ f u 2 19054 9 ν s 0 4 and ρ ρ s ρ f 0 678 the dimensionless buoyancy force on the beam is f b ρ f ρ s g h ρ f u 2 0 2456 tian et al 2014 the buoyancy force is considered by applying a body force to the structure particles to avoid spurious pressure waves induced by a sudden acceleration of the flow from the inflow boundary at the initial stage a linear ramp with constant acceleration equal to u is adopted to accelerate the whole flow until reaching the stable free stream velocity u see sun et al 2018a in that way the flow velocity reaches u in 1 s the reynolds number for the present test is r e u b ν f 1600 which will lead to a chaotic vortex shedding behind the beam in the fsi sph simulation the size of the entire flow domain is 5 b 16 b 0 16 b 8 5 b 8 5 b where the bottom centre of the beam is located at the origin of the reference frame see the sketch depicted in fig 24 such a large computational domain in three dimensions requires the adoption of apr therefore three different particle resolutions are arranged in the fluid flow as the distance from the elastic beam gets further the particle resolution is de refined from l δ x 100 to l δ x 25 the finest resolution region is within 1 5 b 8 b 0 6 b 2 b 2 b which is large enough to cover most of the vortices shed from the elastic beam thanks to apr the particle number for this 3d test is reduced from 45 million uniform resolution to 3 5 million the displacement of the top centre of the beam is measured and plotted in fig 25 after a transitional stage when the stream flow gradually accelerates and the beam gradually bends a quasi steady state is achieved after t u b 20 the drag force coefficient defined as c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 b l is also measured to give a quantitative validation the comparison between the fsi sph result and the reference solutions are summarized in table 3 due to the complexity of the problem different particle mesh resolutions and different fluid hypotheses incompressible weakly compressible in the numerical models there are slight discrepancies between different solvers but the error is within 6 the vortical structures behind the beam extracted by the iso surfaces of q criterion at the time instant when the flow enters a steady state are plotted in fig 26 from two perspectives of observation the vortical structures are extracted by using the technique proposed by marrone et al 2010 who interpolate the particle based data to a cartesian grid and then analyze the flow features with a post processing software from the axonometric view on top of the figure one can see clearly the three dimensional chaotic vortices developed and detached from the bent beam the top view of the flow depicted on the bottom of fig 26 shows a global distribution of these small vortices which form a configuration of von kármán vortex street qualitatively the vortical structures obtained by the present sph model resembles the lbm solution presented by dorschner et al 2018 4 conclusions and future perspectives aiming at modeling fluid structure interaction problems considering effects of the free surface negative pressure viscous stress and vortex shedding the recently developed fsi sph model sun et al 2019c is further improved extended and validated in the present paper through a modified sequential staggered mss coupling algorithm the δ sph model is efficiently coupled with the total lagrangian sph model the mss coupling algorithm allows for a good numerical stability and improves the numerical efficiency when the time steps of the fluid solver and the structure solver considerably differ from each other thanks to the combination of adaptive particle refinement apr and mss the fsi sph model shows its capability to solve 3d fsi problems several test cases including basic benchmarks and practical applications in two and three dimensions are simulated good accuracy and numerical stability of the fsi sph model are demonstrated when comparing the sph results with reference results flow details in the viscous boundary layer and vortex shedding are properly simulated thanks to the apr refined particles near the structure surface help to improve the accuracy of modeling the shear stress in the boundary layer which becomes thinner in higher reynolds numbers besides the apr also makes the direct discretization of the thin thickness structure in 3d easier a new fsi test case named as fsi4 is proposed to extend the fsi benchmark of turek and hron 2006 to a free surface scenario in addition with 3d dam breaking and sloshing tests the importance of considering 3d effects in some typical fsi problems is highlighted the present sph model is capable of modelling viscous flows with high reynolds numbers but as the increase of the reynolds number the required particle resolution to capture small vortex structures has to be increased significantly sun et al 2018a which will further lead to substantial computational cost in 3d sph simulations therefore in future studies the present sph model should be coupled with appropriate turbulence models see e g mayrhofer et al 2015 di mascio et al 2017 to address 3d turbulence flows in real world engineering applications moreover a multi phase model considering the real gas compressibility should be developed to strengthen the 3d fsi sph model in modeling hydrodynamic problems involving air entrapments which in some ocean engineering applications play important roles in determining the flow evolution impact load and the resulted structure response in addition coupling of the present multi resolution fsi sph model with finite volume or boundary element solvers could further reduce the computational cost for simulating fsi problems in a large fluid domain credit authorship contribution statement peng nan sun methodology validation investigation data curation

hydrostatic test for an elastic cantilever under gravity and buoyancy in a quiescent fluid a hydrostatic test is carried out to test the stability of the fsi sph model for simulating quasi static problems indeed passing this test is a precondition when applying the model for hydrodynamic problems the test is set up with an irregular structure made of an elastic cantilever attached to a rigid cylinder which is the same as the one used in the classic fsi benchmark of turek and hron 2006 the structure is initially immersed in a static fluid tank with width w 0 8 m and height h 0 6 m the cylinder center is located at x 0 15 m y 0 3 m see fig a27 a particle packing algorithm has been applied before starting the simulation to avoid any numerical perturbation due to the nonuniform particle distribution around the structure three cases with different density ratios between the structure and fluid respectively ρ s ρ f 0 5 ρ s ρ f 1 0 ρ s ρ f 1 5 where ρ f 1000 k g m 3 are tested the other parameters are maintained to be identical among the cases i e e s 1 4 10 6 p a ν s 0 4 g 1 m s 2 and ν f 5 10 4 m 2 s in the case of ρ s ρ f 1 0 since the buoyancy force counteracts the gravity force the cantilever should keep a horizontal equilibrium state while in the other two cases the cantilever should be bent upward or downward respectively due to the larger buoyancy or gravity force further since the absolute values between the difference of the gravity and buoyancy forces in the first and third cases are identical the corresponding bending magnitudes should be identical but in opposite directions fig a 27 sph results for the three hydrostatic tests with different density ratios between the structure and fluid the flow field is colored by the pressure magnitude while the cantilever is colored by the stress component σ 11 fig a 27 fig a 28 time history of the vertical displacement at the right end of the elastic cantilever fig a 28 with the particle resolution d δ x 50 three simulations are conducted and the sph results at the time instant t 15 s are depicted in fig a27 the pressure contour in the fluid and the stress component σ 11 in the cantilever are shown firstly as one can see a stable hydrostatic pressure is reproduced by the sph solver secondly the cantilever bends upward and downward in the first and third tests as expected note that in the second test the phenomenon that the cantilever keeps horizontal with the stress component σ 11 close to zero is a sufficient validation of the stability and accuracy of the fsi sph model for quasi static problems to clearly investigate the bending magnitude the vertical displacements d y at the right end of the cantilever i e point a for the three tests are plotted in fig a28 one can observe that d y of the first and third tests are symmetric with respect to d y 0 which is the solution of the case ρ s ρ f 1 0 a quasi static state is achieved after t 15 s when the kinetic energy is dissipated by the viscous stress in the fluid 
21123,the recently developed fsi sph model sun et al 2019c by combining the multi resolution δ sph scheme and a total lagrangian sph method is further extended for more complex three dimensional 3d fluid structure interaction fsi problems the fsi sph model is strengthened with advanced numerical techniques in which a combination of the particle shifting technique pst and the tensile instability control tic is adopted to prevent flow voids induced by the tensile instability the adaptive particle refinement apr is used to refine particles in the boundary layer region and coarsen particles in the far field to increase local accuracy but reduce overall computational cost moreover the δ sph and total lagrangian sph solvers are coupled through a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm which on one hand ensures the numerical accuracy and stability and on the other hand improves the efficiency when magnitudes of time steps between the two solvers differ from each other significantly in the numerical results challenging 2d and 3d fsi cases are simulated to test the accuracy of the proposed fsi sph model a new fsi benchmark with free surface is proposed to highlight the advantage of this fsi sph model in simulating free surface viscous flows in addition 3d effects in the fsi dam breaking and sloshing cases are investigated keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics δ sph fsi sph fluid structure interaction tensile instability viscous flow 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena are frequently encountered in different engineering problems in which the fluid evolution and structure deformation are tightly coupled on one hand the fluid part exerts unsteady hydrodynamic forces on the structure surface and on the other hand the structure response deformation vibration significantly affects the flow evolution taking examples from ocean engineering khayyer et al 2019 huge marine structures e g large container ships offshore platforms etc behave like elastic bodies in heavy sea conditions and therefore the hydroelastic effects are non negligible in the problems with water wave impacts or water entries the structure deformation significantly alerts the impact load iafrati et al 2019 in contrast for some small scale structures e g marine risers subsea pipelines small jacket platforms etc installed in currents the vortex shedding on the structure surface may excite the periodical vibration of the whole structure namely vortex induced vibration viv when the natural frequency of structure and the vortex shedding frequency are approximately equal the resonance may occur and threaten the structure safety therefore viv as a typical fsi problem has been widely investigated so far many experimental theoretical and numerical methods have been developed to solve these kinds of fsi problems williamson and govardhan 2004 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph has been developed for decades to solve complex fsi problems zhang et al 2017 liu and zhang 2019 sun et al 2019d oger et al 2020 tsurudome et al 2020 since sph doesn t need a mesh numerical errors due to the mesh distortion can be inherently avoided and therefore problems with large structure motions deformatons can be easily simulated besides the lagrangian characteristic of sph allows for a convenient tracking of free surface zheng et al 2017 sun et al 2018c tafuni et al 2018 he et al 2018 he et al 2019 he et al 2020 ni et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 water gas interface sun et al 2019c and fluid structure interface khayyer et al 2018 thanks to these advantages the development of sph models for solving fsi problems has been quite popular recently there are some advanced particle methods published to solve different fsi problems see e g sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 hermange et al 2019 gao et al 2018 sun et al 2019e zhang et al 2020 however sph also has some weaknesses that restrict its application to industrial applications for example the high frequency pressure oscillation is a main issue but it can be prevented with some advanced numerical techniques e g δ sph antuono et al 2010 density filtering technique colagrossi and landrini 2003 riemann ale sph marrone et al 2018 etc moreover sph accuracy decreases when the particle distribution becomes irregular which can be remedied using the particle shifting technique pst lind et al 2012 in addition the computational cost of three dimensional 3d sph simulation is usually very expensive peng et al 2019 but with the development of adaptive particle refinement apr see chiron et al 2018 the sph efficiency is much improved based on the way to solve the structure response sph models for modeling fsi problems can be divided into two categories the first is to couple the sph solver with a mesh based structure solver and the second is to develop a purely lagrangian particle method solving the fluid and structure portions within the same particle based framework in the first category the finite element method fem has been the most popular approach to couple with sph for example hu et al 2014 proposed a striped point in box pib algorithm to couple sph and fem in a high efficiency fourey et al 2017 compared the parallel and sequential staggered algorithms in sph fem coupling models and they found that the latter is more accurate and stable while the former is computationally more efficient zhang and wan 2018 proposed a mps fem algorithm which couples the moving particle semi implicit mps method a particle method similar to sph and fem for simulating sloshing problems they found that the hydrodynamic response of the fluid in an elastic tank is significantly different from the one in a rigid tank for more complex fsi problems towards industrial applications siemann et al 2018 proposed to use sph fem model to simulate ditching of flexible aircraft models ming et al 2016 adopted an sph fem method for the simulation of interaction between an underwater explosion and a ship hull the numerical results demonstrated apparent advantage of the coupled method for violent fsi problems with large deformations recently the eulerian smoothed particle hydrodynamics esph was coupled with other structure solvers for simulating interactions between a flexible slender body and viscous fluid see e g nasar et al 2019 esph maintains uniform particle distribution in the whole simulation and therefore it could offer higher accuracy however the lagrangian characteristic which is essential for free surface interfacial flow simulations no longer exists purely lagrangian particle methods have witnessed a rapid increase in popularity for fsi problems in the last few years zhan et al 2019 the superiority of the full particle methods with respect to sph fem couplings is that the fluid evolution and structure response can be solved in the unified framework of particle methods which share many procedures e g neighboring particle searching time stepping etc and therefore the parallel computation is straightforward and the efficiency of the fsi simulation is significantly improved a dual particle dynamics mps dpd mps was proposed for simulating the interaction between an incompressible fluid and a nonlinear elastic structure falahaty et al 2018 in the sph framework an isph sph coupled method was also reported recently for water slamming problems khayyer et al 2018 yang et al 2016 proposed an sph element bending group sph ebg method for modeling the impact of a dam breaking flow on an elastic structure he et al 2017 coupled the weakly compressible sph and total lagrangian sph for hydroelastic problems sun et al 2019c coupled the multiphase δ sph model with the total lagrangian sph method to investigate a two dimensional 2d fsi dam breaking case which was first experimentally investigated by liao et al 2015 however in that work sun et al 2019c only 2d simulations were conducted and for some cases e g the dam breaking with a shallow water depth the sph results showed some discrepancies with experimental data which implied that three dimensional 3d fsi simulations had to be further conducted to investigate 3d effects in most sph models for fsi simulations the structure boundaries are usually regarded as free slip walls for example in our previous work sun et al 2019c in that case the effect of viscous stress in the boundary layer and vortex shedding from the structure surface cannot be accurately considered and further the real structure response and flow evolution are not fully predicted in fact omitting the viscous stress in the boundary layer is fine for modeling large scale fsi problems in ocean engineering but for small scale problems e g viv sun et al 2019a the viscous stress in the fluid is quite relevant han and hu 2018 simulated viscous fsi problems and the results were validated by some classic fsi benchmarks however their model was not tested for flows of higher reynolds number where the boundary layer is thinner and the negative pressure is stronger which could lead to unphysical flow voids sun et al 2018a in addition cases with smaller density ratios between the structure and fluid should also be tested to evaluate the stability and robustness of the fsi coupling algorithm in this work a fsi sph model combining the multi resolution δ sph scheme sun et al 2017 and the total lagrangian sph method belytschko et al 2000 will be further extended from simulating 2d simple cases sun et al 2019c to more complex 3d fsi problems thanks to the addition of the tensile instability control tic in the δ sph scheme unphysical flow voids induced by negative pressure relative to the background pressure which is usually assumed to be zero in most sph simulations can be completely avoided even when the reynolds number is high besides the sph scheme is strengthened with apr to refine particles near the structure for improving local accuracy and coarsen far field particles for reducing the overall computational cost in addition the real viscous stress is accurately resolved inside the boundary layer and vortex generating and shedding downstream of the structure can be well simulated to accurately and efficiently couple the δ sph scheme with the total lagrangian sph method a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm is proposed based on the sequential staggered algorithm investigated by fourey et al 2017 as the total lagrangian sph method is explicit its time step is strictly limited by the bulk modulus whose magnitude is significantly larger than the reduced bulk modulus in the weakly compressible fluid linked to the sound speed solved by the δ sph scheme in order to match the δ sph and total lagrangian sph methods in an efficient manner a step and sub step coupling technique has been adopted in the mss algorithm that means within one time step of the fluid evolution the structure solver can advance continuously with several sub time steps until arriving at the same time instant as the fluid solver see in section 2 3 the step and sub step coupling technique allows an equilibrium accuracy with respect to the traditional step step coupling algorithm fourey et al 2017 in which the fluid and structure solvers share their minimum time step which would lead to expensive repeated calculations in the fluid part on these bases together with apr the fsi sph model can be easily extended for simulating three dimensional 3d fsi problems with the numerical code simply running on a desktop machine the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a brief introduction regarding to the δ sph scheme for viscous fluid simulation is presented firstly after which the advanced numerical techniques are briefly recalled to effectively avoid tensile instability and realize adaptive particle refinement and de refinement the total lagrangian sph method for the structure modeling is presented in section 2 2 in order to accurately and efficiently couple the fluid and structure solvers a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm is proposed in section 2 3 several validations for the fsi sph solver are presented in the section 3 including validations for viscous flows around solid bodies and fsi benchmarks with low and high density ratios after that a new benchmark with free surface is proposed to highlight the advantage of the fsi sph method in simulating free surface viscous flows thereafter 3d cases are tested with the first case involving a dam breaking flow impact on an elastic structure and the second involving a sloshing interaction with an elastic beam which were both designed towards marine oriented applications differences between 2d and 3d numerical results are discussed when comparing sph results with 3d experimental data in the last case a 3d fsi test is carried out towards the modeling of a more complex viscous fsi problem finally conclusions and future perspectives are presented at the end of the paper 2 multi resolution fsi sph model for fsi problems 2 1 the δ sph scheme the δ sph scheme antuono et al 2010 is an sph variant developed based on the classic sph model proposed by monaghan 2005 the main characteristic for δ sph is the δ term added in the continuity equation for preventing high frequency pressure oscillations recently in order to strengthen the capability of δ sph in modeling viscous flows considering the boundary layer effect at higher reynolds numbers a δ sph model was proposed in sun et al 2017 2018a 2019b the main characteristics of the δ sph are the adoption of particle shifting for regularizing particle distributions and the technique of tensile instability control tic to completely prevent numerical instability e g flow voids material fragmentation etc when the local pressure is negative we note that in sph simulations the void usually appearing in the region of strong negative pressure is a space without any particles empty region and this kind of flow void usually expands fast due to the zero internal pressure the occurrence of such an empty space is a numerical error unlike the physical cavitation for which the concerned zones should be occupied with vapor particles associated with the cavitation pressure furthermore to model the cavitation phenomena using sph a cavitation capturing technique was proposed recently by hammani 2020 in this technique when the pressure of some particles reaches the saturated vapor absolute pressure they are recognized as cavitation particles and their pressure is corrected with a modified equation of state however the cavitation effects are not addressed in the present work 2 1 1 discrete governing equations the governing equations of the δ sph scheme sun et al 2017 are written as 1 d ρ i d t ρ i j u j u i i w i j v j δ h c 0 j d i j i w i j v j d u i d t 1 ρ i j f p j p i i w i j v j g i 1 ρ i f i v d r i d t u i p i c 0 2 ρ i ρ 0 v i t m i ρ i t in the above equations the mass density volume pressure velocity and position of the i th particle are denoted by notations as m i ρ i v i p i u i and r i respectively f i v is the viscous force g i denotes the gravitational acceleration and ρ 0 is the reference density on the free surface where the pressure is zero from the last equation one can see that the mass of each particle is kept as constant while its density and volume vary in time therefore the total mass is accurately conserved the velocity divergence in the continuity equation is approximated using the particle approximation based on the kernel interpolation of the classic sph theory liu and liu 2010 indeed when the particles are uniformly distributed the accuracy of the classic sph operator is sufficient and more importantly the numerical stability is maintained even when the free surface breaking and splashing occur colagrossi et al 2009 the notation w i j w r i r j h represents the kernel function for which the wendland c2 kernel is adopted the smoothing length h i δ x i 2 will be adopted for two dimensional flows with δ x i being the initial particle spacing and h i δ x i 1 25 will be used for three dimensional flows to save computational costs in the momentum equation of traditional sph models the conservative form of pressure gradient f p j p i p i p j is usually adopted see e g monaghan 2005 while in this work in order to completely prevent the so called tensile instability a tic technique sun et al 2018a has been adopted with this technique f p j p i is written as 2 f p j p i p j p i p i is negative and i s f p j p i p i is positive or i s f where s f stands for the particle set in the free surface region which is formed by the free surface particles and their neighbors see more in sun et al 2017 according to the weakly compressible hypothesis which states that if the mach number m a u c 0 is less than 0 1 the weakly compressible flow simulation converges to the solution of an incompressible flow when acoustic frequencies are filtered out the artificial sound speed c 0 is set equal to 15 u where u is the characteristic velocity in this paper u can be the inflow velocity of a free stream flow or u equals to 2 g h in a dam breaking or sloshing flow where h is the initial water depth inside the numerical diffusive term antuono et al 2010 marrone et al 2011 of the continuity equation d i j is written as 3 d i j 2 ρ j ρ i 1 2 ρ i l ρ j l r i j r i j r i j 2 where r i j r j r i and l is the renormalized spatial gradient see more details in antuono et al 2010 specifically the coefficient δ 0 1 is adopted for the density diffusion which is independent of the specific problem and converges to zero with the increase of the particle resolution h 0 when simulating viscous flows the viscous force monaghan 2005 in the momentum equation is written as 4 f μ i v k μ j π i j i w i j v j π i j u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity and k 2 n 2 where n is the spacial dimension of the problem when modeling viscous flows considering the effects of the boundary layer the real dynamic viscosity μ is assigned for the fluid and the no slip boundary condition is enforced on the solid wall note that for high reynolds number flows the boundary layer is very thin so that sufficient particle resolution should be arranged inside the boundary layer where the particles can be refined using the technique of adaptive particle refinement chiron et al 2018 however for the sph modeling of impact flows for example the dam breaking flow in this work the physical viscosity of the fluid is less important but an extra artificial viscosity is needed to dissipate the compressible energy after strong flow impact marrone et al 2015 therefore instead of using the physical viscosity term in eq 4 we adopt the artificial viscosity see e g marrone et al 2011 as 5 f α i v α ρ 0 h c 0 j π i j i w i j v j π i j u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 where the parameter α is assigned as 0 1 for the dam breaking flow in this work in these impact flows the viscous force is less important and therefore a free slip boundary condition is imposed on the solid wall boundary marrone et al 2011 we note that the dam breaking test is the only test case in this work that uses these artificial viscosity and free slip boundary condition see section 3 4 when modeling viscous flows inside the viscous boundary layer near a no slip boundary the shear stress induced by large gradient of the velocity can lead to distortion of the particle distribution and further introduce spurious perturbations in the pressure and vorticity field therefore the particle shifting technique pst is necessary to ensure a uniform particle distribution during the simulation sun et al 2017 with this technique the particle position at every time step is modified as 6 r i r i δ r i where the repositioning vector δ r i is evaluated as 7 δ r i cfl ma 2 h i 2 i 1 r w i j w δ x i h i n i w i j m j ρ i ρ j this formula is inspired by the pst algorithm of lind et al 2012 but reformulated in a weakly compressible fashion the two parameters r 2 and n 4 are used in eq 7 to obtain a fast particle regularization pst has been proven in sun et al 2016 to be able to maintain a smooth vorticity field in the simulation of viscous flows the 4 t h order runge kutta method is used to integrate the governing equations in time with the time step δ t defined as 8 δ t cfl h c 0 where cfl 1 5 is used for confined viscous flows and cfl 1 0 for free surface impact flows where the free surface impact and splashing lead to severe truncation of the kernel function which requires a small courant number to ensure numerical stability 2 1 2 implementation of the solid wall boundary condition in this work the fixed ghost particle technique marrone et al 2011 adami et al 2012 is implemented thanks to its high accuracy in avoiding kernel truncation and modeling both free slip and no slip boundary conditions on one hand the fixed ghost particles serve to provide a boundary condition for the fluid simulation one the other hand the structure response is solved based on the same ghost particles which update their velocity and position in every time step in this way the fluid part and the structure are coupled with each other in addition to uniformly distribute fluid particles around the solid boundaries a particle packing algorithm colagrossi et al 2012 is implemented at the beginning of the sph simulation the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are implemented according to federico et al 2012 and a damping zone with higher viscosity is implemented before the out flow buffer zone to avoid the instability induced by the back flowing particles due to strong vortices sun et al 2018a 2 1 3 adaptive particle refinement apr the technique of adaptive particle refinement apr initially proposed by barcarolo et al 2014 and further improved in chiron et al 2018 is adopted in this work to achieve three main goals 1 improving numerical efficiency with apr refined particle resolution can be only used in a small region while in the other part of the domain coarse particles are used in this way the total particle number and hence the computational cost are significantly reduced especially for 3d simulations 2 improving local accuracy for resolving the viscous boundary layer as is well known in the literature whether for the simulation using mesh based or particle based methods viscous flows at high reynolds numbers usually lead to very thin boundary layers and the shedding of small eddies which require refined mesh particle resolutions to accurately calculate the viscous stress and capture the small scale flow features with apr the particle resolution in the sph simulation can be easily refined in the boundary layer region 3 accurate modeling of fsi problems with very thin structure thickness in the present fsi sph model the resolution of fluid and structure particles near the fluid structure interface is designed to be equal to ensure a high coupling accuracy when the structure thickness is very thin the structure particle resolution will be very high because the total lagrangian sph method solving the structure response requires to discretize the entire bulk of the structure into uniform particles with at least four particles in the thickness direction a very fine particle resolution in the structure further leads to a high particle resolution in the fluid fortunately with apr fluid particles in a small region near the structure can be locally refined to fit the resolution of structure particles and therefore ensure a high fsi coupling accuracy there while in the rest of the fluid region coarse particles can be used 2 2 total lagrangian sph method for modeling elastic structures different to the weakly compressible sph model used for the fluid in the total lagrangian sph method belytschko et al 2000 vignjevic et al 2006 for the structure the particle density is assumed as constant and therefore the solving of the continuity equation is unnecessary the second difference is the adoption of the lagrangian kernel which signifies that the searching for the neighboring particles is completed in the first time step based on the initial particle distribution in addition the evaluation of the kernel function and its gradients are also completed in the first time step and will be repeatedly used in each time step of the whole simulation the adoption of the lagrangian kernel not only saves the computational cost but also inherently avoids numerical instability issues e g tensile instability which are usually induced by distorted particle configuration in the region under tensile force while in the δ sph model introduced in the previous subsection even though a eulerian kernel was utilized with the tic technique the tensile instability in the negative pressure region can also be prevented we note that to be consistent with the designation adopted in the literature belytschko et al 2000 vignjevic et al 2006 the correct name of the solid solver should be total lagrangian sph method rather than total lagrangian particle tlp method used in our previous paper sun et al 2019c the cauchy equation is used as the governing equation in the total lagrangian sph method lin et al 2015 9 d u d t 1 ρ 0 s 0 p g where u denotes the velocity of the structure particle and ρ 0 s is the material density 0 is the divergence operator with subscript 0 indicating that a lagrangian kernel is used and the kernel function is evaluated with the initial particle configuration x p denotes the first piola kirchhoff stress tensor rudnicki 2014 and can be written with the cauchy stress tensor σ as 10 p det f σ f t where f is the tensor of deformation gradient det f indicates the determinant of f and the superscript t stands for the inverse of the transposed tensor rudnicki 2014 f can be evaluated with 11 f x x where the vector x denotes the current particle position in order to avoid the numerical error caused by the truncated kernel function on the structure surface the tensor of deformation gradient can be written using the corrected kernel approximation sun et al 2016 as 12 f i x x i j x j x i m 0 i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j m 0 x i j x j x i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j 1 where v 0 is the initial particle volume note that in eq 12 the kernel function and its gradients are all evaluated based on the initial particle configuration regarding the cauchy stress tensor σ rudnicki 2014 in two dimensions σ can be expanded as 13 σ 11 σ 22 σ 12 e s 1 ν s 2 1 ν s 0 ν s 1 0 0 0 1 ν s ε 11 ε 22 ε 12 where e s and ν s are the young modulus and the poisson ratio respectively according to rudnicki 2014 in three dimensions σ is expanded as 14 σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 σ 12 σ 23 σ 31 e s 1 ν s 1 2 ν s 1 ν s ν s ν s 0 0 0 ν s 1 ν s ν s 0 0 0 ν s ν s 1 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ν s ε 11 ε 22 ε 33 ε 12 ε 23 ε 31 the euler strain tensor ε rudnicki 2014 can be expanded as 15 ε f t e f t e 1 2 l l t l t l l v x v x x where e is the green lagrange strain tensor l is the displacement gradient tensor similar to eq 12 l can also be discretized by the corrected kernel approximation sun et al 2016 as 16 l i v x i j v j v i m 0 i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j m 0 x i j x j x i 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j 1 based on eqs 12 and 16 the discretized form of the first piola kirchhoff stress tensor p can be obtained and then substituting it into eq 20 yields the discrete momentum equation in order to maintain the exact conservation of the momentum for the divergence operator the classic symmetric sph approximation is adopted see hereinafter in eq 18 as tested in belytschko et al 2000 tensile instability can be completely prevented after using the lagrangian kernel however total lagrangian sph has another instability named the hourglass instability due to the susceptibility to zero energy modes which are caused by the rank deficiency related to nodal integration see also ganzenmüller et al 2015 in the numerical cases presented in the paper the instability is not severe because we adopt two remedial treatments the first treatment is to reduce the ratio between smoothing length and particle spacing different to the fluid part solved by the δ sph model here we impose h s δ x 1 3 which is more effective than h s δ x 2 for preventing particle clumping in problems with large structure deformations the reduced smoothing length leads to a small time step for the structure solver but thanks to the modified fluid structure coupling algorithm which will be presented in the next subsection the overall efficiency of the fsi solver is not significantly affected the second treatment is to add a slight artificial viscosity into the momentum equation lin et al 2015 the artificial viscous force p ν i j applied by particle j on particle i is written as 17 p ν i j det f i j f t i j α s c s h s ρ 0 s v j v i x j x i x j x i 2 0 01 h s 2 this artificial viscosity converges to zero with the increase of the particle resolution h s 0 in this work the coefficient α s is set as 0 2 we note that the reduced smoothing length and the artificial viscosity prevented the occurrence of instability for the cases presented in the present work however techniques using stress points randles and libersky 2000 or the hourglass control proposed by ganzenmüller et al 2015 should be adopted to prevent the hourglass instability in the general case the discrete momentum equation lin et al 2015 in the total lagrangian sph model is finally written as 18 d v i d t 1 ρ 0 s j p i p j p ν i j 0 i w 0 i j v 0 j g this momentum equation is integrated in time using the 4 t h order runge kutta scheme as for the fluid part following lin et al 2015 the time step δ t ˆ s for the total lagrangian sph method is determined as 19 δ t ˆ s 0 8 h c s c s k s ρ 0 s where k s is the bulk modulus which can be evaluated as k s e s 3 1 2 ν s 2 3 efficient coupling between the δ sph scheme and the total lagrangian sph method for fsi problems in the fsi simulation the fluid evolution is affected by the boundary condition including the position and velocity from the deformable structure and in return the structure response is also affected by the hydrodynamic force exerted by the fluid particles in the present fsi sph solver the structure surface is discretized into uniformly distributed fixed ghost particles which have the same initial spacing as the nearby fluid particles the ghost particles on one hand serve for the calculation of the structure deformation in the total lagrangian sph solver and on the other hand serve as the boundary particles in the δ sph solver in the investigation of sph fem coupling fourey et al 2017 compared the conventional parallel staggered cps and conventional sequential staggered css algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency they found that in the weakly compressible sph model the time step is relatively small and therefore cps and css algorithms are both able to predict acceptable results however for challenging problems like quasi static cases with only hydrostatic pressure or dynamic cases with high frequency pressure oscillations the cps algorithm shows pressure noise while the css algorithm reveals better numerical stability but as a drawback it requires higher computational cost after numerical investigation of the total lagrangian sph solver we find that limited by the bulk modulus of the structure the time step denoted by δ t s of the total lagrangian sph model for the structure is much smaller than the time step denoted by δ t f of δ sph for the fluid since a hypothesis of weak compressibility is considered in the previous css algorithm fourey et al 2017 the overall time step equals to min δ t s δ t f where δ t s δ t f therefore directly applying the css algorithm of fourey et al 2017 would lead to repeated calculations in the fluid part within a δ t f to solve that problem we propose a modified sequential staggered mss algorithm in which a step and sub step coupling manner is adopted to improve the efficiency this strategy was already used in hermange et al 2019 where authors used a cps based scheme with multiple sub time steps in which the sub steps were used in the fluid rather than in the structure since the structure was modeled there with an implicit fem solver with quite large time steps the schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 the fsi coupling starts from the instant when the fluid solution arrives at t n and the structure solution arrives at t k practically we have t n t k where subscripts n and k stand for the step numbers in the fluid and structure solvers respectively afterward the fsi coupling procedure is written as follows in step 1 see the red number in fig 1 the structure solver provides the position and velocity of the ghost particles for the fluid solver serving as the boundary condition the first layer of the ghost particle is distributed on the structure surface and other layers are extended along the inward normals into the structure the thickness of the ghost particle layers should be larger than the kernel radius in step 2 the fluid solution advances one time step δ t f and arrives at the time instant t n 1 in step 3 the structure solver receives the pressure p and viscous stress f v from the fluid portion at t n 1 in step 4 based on the fluid forces from the time instant t n 1 the structure solver advances for q sub steps until t k q and finally we have t n 1 t k q in the structure solution more specifically step 4 when taking the hydrodynamic force from the fluid part into account the momentum equation in the total lagrangian sph method becomes 20 d u i d t 1 ρ 0 s 0 p i g i f f l u i d the force f f l u i d exerted by the fluid on the structure can be measured by summating the interacting forces see bouscasse et al 2013b and sun et al 2015 between the fluid particles at t n 1 and ghost particles at t n when a no slip boundary condition is applied on the structure surface the viscous stress f v is also included in f f l u i d when the fsi coupling process within a time step δ t f starting from time step t n is finished the next loop starts from t n 1 in an analogous way from the above process one can see that within one time step of the fluid solution the structure solver advances for q sub steps and q can be determined by 21 q δ t f δ t ˆ s where the function gives the least integer greater than or equal to δ t f δ t ˆ s where δ t ˆ s is the time step determined by eq 19 finally the time step for the structure solver is determined as 22 δ t s δ t f q through the above process by efficiently coupling δ sph and total lagrangian sph models an efficient fsi sph model is established which will be thoroughly validated in the next section for fsi problems in two and three dimensions 3 numerical validations 3 1 validation of the viscous fluid solver a preliminary test cast is used to validate the viscous fluid solver based on the δ sph scheme without fsi this is a test case involving a viscous flow past a bluff body in this test a cylinder with diameter d 0 1 m and an attached plate are both treated as rigid bodies which are immersed in a viscous current with density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and kinematic viscosity ν f 10 3 m 2 s see the sketch in fig 2 the length of the fluid domain is l 2 2 5 m and the width is h 2 0 41 m the current enters from the left side and freely exits from the right side on all the solid walls including the lateral walls the cylinder and plate surfaces no slip boundary conditions are imposed the cylinder centre marked by c is located at 0 0 which is the origin of the reference frame and the tip point a of the plate is located at 0 25 m 0 the bottom of the flow is located at y 0 2 m and therefore the axis of symmetry of the immersed body is located slightly below the axis of symmetry of the fluid domain with a shifted distance of 0 005 m the velocity distribution along the y axis at the in flow boundary is given by turek and hron 2006 as 23 u f x 0 25 y 1 5 u y 0 2 h 2 y 0 2 0 5 h 2 2 u f y 0 25 y 0 where u 1 m s and the reynolds number for this problem can be calculated as r e u d ν f 100 the δ sph simulation is conducted with the initial particle spacing d δ x 100 the vorticity distribution in the flow is monitored during the sph simulation which is terminated after a steady state is reached the vorticity field at t 6 5 s is shown in fig 3 from which one may observe that the vorticity distribution is stable at this time instant and periodic vortex shedding is not observed this is because in this test the reynolds number is relatively low and the body is rigid however since the centre of the cylinder is not positioned at the horizontal symmetrical line of the fluid domain one can observe the unsymmetrical distribution of vorticity above and below the plate attached to the cylinder we can deduce that the cylinder is subjected to a lift force the time evolutions of the lift and drag forces on the rigid body are plotted in fig 4 still with the particle resolution d δ x 100 during the time duration of t 5 0 s 6 5 s the variation of drag and lift force on the body is very small which implies that the flow is stable at t 6 5 s and it verifies the conclusion obtained previously based on the vorticity field finally the lift force becomes steady at f l 10 77 n and the drag force converges to f d 137 51 n table 1 shows the comparison of the sph solution with the reference fem solution given by turek and hron 2006 and the relative error is only 2 2 and 0 59 for the lift and drag forces respectively fig 5 plots the convergence of the lift force for three different particle resolutions respectively d δ x 25 d δ x 50 and d δ x 100 one can see the convergence of the oscillation amplitude in the δ sph solutions with the increase of the particle resolution with the two particle resolutions d δ x 50 and d δ x 100 the average lift forces almost coincide 3 2 validation of the fsi sph model using classic fsi benchmarks in this section two classic benchmarks are simulated to test the capability of the established fsi sph model for fsi problems with different density ratios the two test cases correspond to the fsi2 and fsi3 cases by turek and hron 2006 the boundary conditions and parameters for the fluid are the same as those in section 3 1 while the attached plate to the cylinder is elastic here and therefore can oscillate under the forces induced by the vortex shedding we underline that fsi2 has been the most widely used case in the literature conversely fsi3 is less tested however since in fsi3 the density ratio between the structure and the fluid is only 1 which can be regarded as a small density ratio it makes fsi3 more challenging and requires a stronger fsi coupling algorithm in the numerical solver in addition in most of the literature only the displacement of the tip of the elastic plate point a in fig 2 is validated by comparing with the reference solution while for the fsi3 test in this section we will also show the comparison of the drag force coefficient and strouhal number to provide a more comprehensive validation 3 2 1 test case fsi2 in the test case fsi2 the density of the elastic plate is ρ 0 s 10 4 k g m 3 which leads to a density ratio between the structure and fluid of ρ 0 s ρ 0 f 10 the young modulus and poisson ratio are e s 1 4 10 6 p a and ν s 0 4 respectively due to the lift force see the previous section exerted by the viscous fluid on the elastic plate the plate deforms and vibrates under the periodic vortex shedding from the structure surface and finally a steady viv state is achieved in order to reduce the computational cost of this long duration periodic simulation adaptive particle refinement has been applied to discretize the fluid domain and the structure inside the rectangular fluid region of x y 0 15 0 85 0 16 0 16 the particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 50 while outside this region d δ x 25 is adopted to reduce the particle number and hence the computational cost such an arrangement is able to ensure refined particle resolution near the structure to accurately resolve the shear stress in the viscous boundary layer fig 6 depicts the distributions of the stress component σ 11 in the elastic plate and the vorticity ω f in the flow at four time instants a smooth vorticity field is obtained in the flow field with a good continuity at the interface between different particle resolutions the elastic plate is bent into different shapes under the hydrodynamic force generated by the vortical flow we measured the vertical displacement on the tip of the elastic plate and plotted it in fig 7 after a transitional stage the vertical vibration of the tip enters a steady state with a constant amplitude in the time period between 14 and 16 s the vertical displacement of point a see fig 2 is compared between different numerical solvers by bhardwaj and mittal 2012 li and favier 2017 turek and hron 2006 and the present fsi sph model in fig 8 we obtained a very close agreement with the lattice boltzmann method lbm solution by li and favier 2017 the similarity between the two methods sph and lbm is the solving of the incompressible flow with weakly compressible hypotheses the amplitudes of the vibration agree very well between the sph lbm and ib fem of bhardwaj and mittal 2012 but a phase shifting is observed in the solution of bhardwaj and mittal 2012 in addition the amplitudes of the three solutions are all slightly larger than the one given by turek and hron 2006 however the discrepancy is quite small 3 2 2 test case fsi3 in this subsection a more challenging test case named as fsi3 by turek and hron 2006 is considered by increasing the maximum velocity at the in flow boundary to be u 2 m s which leads to a larger reynolds number r e u d ν f 200 and increasing the young modulus of the elastic plate to be e s 5 6 10 6 p a which will lead to a higher vibrating frequency in addition the density ratio is reduced to be ρ 0 s ρ 0 f 1 in order to accurately resolve the viscous boundary layer near the structure inside the fluid region of x y 0 1 0 5 0 12 0 12 the initial particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 100 outside this region and inside x y 0 15 0 85 0 16 0 16 the initial particle spacing is characterized by d δ x 50 while in the rest of the flow d δ x 25 is adopted to reduce the particle number and hence the computational cost the vorticity in the flow and the stress component in the elastic plate are plotted in fig 9 at four time instants different from the previous case fsi2 in fsi3 the vorticity is stronger but due to a larger young modulus the vibrating amplitude of the elastic plate is smaller the vertical displacement of the point a is plotted in fig 10 as it can be seen here the vibrating frequency of the elastic plate is much higher since this test case is less adopted in the literature the full time evolution of the plate vibrating amplitude is less documented and therefore here we compare the time history of the fsi sph result with only one reference solution obtained with the regularized lattice boltzmann rlb method by li et al 2019 a good agreement is obtained as was also has been observed in the previous fsi2 case even though there is a 4 3 difference in the plate vibration period to give a wider comparison in the literature we found some other reference results including the maximum vertical displacement a m of the point a strouhal number s t and the drag force coefficient c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 d the strouhal number is defined as s t f a d u where f a is the vibrating frequency these numerical results are all listed in table 2 once again we found that the present sph results are very close to the other numerical solutions 3 3 proposing a new test fsi4 with the free surface effect in this section a new benchmark named fsi4 considering the free surface effect is proposed inspired by the classic benchmarks in turek and hron 2006 the proposing of this test is owing to the outstanding capability of the sph method for modeling free surface flows including the surface rolling breaking and even fragmentation since a free surface is included the gravity force has to be considered when designing this benchmark otherwise the froude number would be infinitely large as has been investigated by fourey et al 2017 in a quasi static problem with only hydrostatic pressure the accuracy of the numerical solution is quite sensitive to the stability property of the fsi coupling algorithm therefore before the hydrodynamic test a hydrostatic test is firstly carried out and the sph results are presented in appendix a which shows that the elastic plate can reach its equilibrium state in different rest conditions this test primarily verifies the stability and accuracy of the present fsi sph solver for hydrostatic cases when the gravity is only compensated by a static pressure gradient in the proposed benchmark fsi4 the same structure i e a rigid cylinder with an elastic plate see fig 2 is immersed in a free stream with a uniform velocity distribution u u 1 m s and v 0 at the inlet rather than the parabolic velocity profile used in the benchmark of turek and hron 2006 therefore a free slip solid wall boundary condition has been assigned to the fluid bottom while a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the structure surface the fluid region is occupied by a viscous fluid whose density is ρ f 1000 k g m 3 and kinematic viscosity is ν f 5 10 4 m 2 s the fluid domain length is l 3 6 m and its height h 0 6 m the cylinder centre is placed at x 0 y 0 5 m and it is 0 8 m far from the inlet and 2 8 m from the outlet y 0 denotes the fluid bottom and y 0 6 m locates the undisturbed free surface which means the initial submergence of the cylinder is d c 0 1 m a gravity force g 1 m s 2 is considered in this case therefore the froude number and reynolds number for this test are f r u g d 3 16 and r e u d ν f 200 respectively parameters for the elastic plate are ρ s 1000 k g m 3 e s 1 4 10 6 p a and ν s 0 4 the sph simulation is run with the particle resolution d δ x 50 different to the results of the classic fsi benchmark in turek and hron 2006 in this new case the elastic plate is subjected to a close to steady lift force and therefore it is always bent upward see fig 11 we note that this lift force is not due to the buoyancy force since when the density ratio is ρ s ρ f 1 the gravity force counteracts the buoyancy see more in appendix a from the velocity contours in fig 11 we find that the elastic plate is immersed in a low velocity region which is the wake of the flow past the circular cylinder from the bottom plot of fig 11 and knowing that the flow has reached a quasi steady regime around the cylinder and the plate which can be observed in fig 12 we can deduce that the global fluid mechanics of the flow is as such i the incoming flow is deflected by the cylinder presence on both sides up and down ii on both cylinder sides flow separation occurs due to the non profiled shape of the cylinder and the sufficiently high reynolds number iii in the upper side region of the cylinder free surface side the flow is relatively free to move since it is bounded by a free surface and thus it jumps over the mean free surface level and then falls down to it farther downstream iv the latter induces a bending of the flow between the free surface and the plate with pressures below the hydrostatic pressure there since we know that in a quasi steady flow the piezometric pressure p p ρ g z decays towards the center of curvature of the flow streamlines so the piezometric pressure decays from the free surface towards the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate meaning that the pressure at the limit between the active flow and the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate is quite lower than the hydrostatic pressure at this depth v inside the bound vortex along the upper side of the plate velocities are small which can be checked on the top plot of fig 11 and there is in a quasi static situation so p is almost constant there so the pressure on the upper side of the plate is quite below the hydrostatic pressure at this depth vi in the lower side region of the cylinder bottom side the flow is guided by the bottom and cannot deflect much so that streamlines keep quite straight with a pressure close to the level of the hydrostatic pressure there vii in the end there is thus a suction effect bending the plate upwards due to the difference between the upper side and lower side pressures along the plate the vorticity contour depicts the shape of a von kármán vortex street however due to the presence of the free surface the vortex street starts further downstream and is horizontally elongated and vertically compressed similar phenomena were also observed in sun et al 2016 the horizontal d x and vertical d y displacements of the tip of the elastic plate are measured and plotted in fig 12 as it can be seen after a transitional stage the plate tip oscillates around a horizontal deflection d x 5 5 10 3 m with an amplitude 1 7 10 3 m and oscillates around a vertical deflection d y 0 058 m with an amplitude 4 5 10 3 m the small oscillating amplitude is mainly because the vortex shedding from the elastic plate is delayed by the presence of the free surface and occurs downstream the tip of the plate contrary to what happens in the unbounded cases fsi2 and fsi3 3 4 3d fsi dam breaking test starting from this section the proposed fsi sph model will be tested on different 3d fsi cases firstly the fsi dam breaking case originally designed by liao et al 2015 is simulated in three dimensions to investigate the dimensional effect by comparing with the 2d results in sun et al 2019c the experimental data liao et al 2015 will be adopted to validate the sph results the numerical and experimental set ups are identical and the sketch is depicted in fig 13 the elastic plate is made of rubber whose thickness is t 0 004 m with density 1164 k g m 3 and elastic modulus as e s 3 5 10 6 p a in this work we firstly choose the case with an initial water depth h 0 2 m that is because according to the investigations in sun et al 2019c a shallower water depth implies a more obvious 3d effect in the 3d numerical test the horizontal displacements of two markers are tracked in the sph simulation one marker is located on the vertical centre line of the elastic plate and another marker on the side edge see fig 13 both markers have the initial height h 1 0 0875 m which corresponds to marker 1 in the experiment of liao et al 2015 the displacement of the marker reflects the deflection of the elastic plate it is worth noting that the accurate considering of the gate motion at the initial stage of the dam breaking test has an essential effect on the formation of the dam breaking flow and the impact force on the structure because the gradual lifting up of the gate slightly delays the collapse of the water column only when the gate motion is considered one may obtain a close agreement between the numerical result and the experimental data to accurately reproduce the gate motion in the sph model we discretize the gate with fixed ghost particles and allow these ghost particles moving upward with the following motion law sun et al 2019c 24 h g t 285 115 t 3 72 305 t 2 0 1463 t where h g t denotes the height of the gate bottom which is obtained through a polynomial fit based on the experimental data in liao et al 2015 different to the 2d multiphase simulations conducted in sun et al 2019c in this study single phase sph simulations are carried out until t 0 5 s after which the air effect becomes dominant when the air cavity is formed after the water tongue flows over the elastic plate and impacts the vertical wall see sun et al 2019c in the 3d sph simulations to save computational cost three particle resolutions are adopted for the particles close to the elastic plate i e within the pink dashed box see the middle snapshot in the first row of fig 14 the particle spacing is refined to δ x t 6 which is fine enough to obtain a converged sph simulation see sun et al 2019c for the particle outside of the blue dashed box the particles are de refined to δ x 2 t 3 in between the resolution is δ x t 3 with the adoption of the adaptive particle refinement the total particle number for this 3d test is reduced from 2 7 10 8 to 2 0 10 6 i e a reduction rate of 92 5 snapshots at five time instants of the 2d left column from sun et al 2019c and 3d middle column sph simulations are depicted in fig 14 where the experimental snapshots from liao et al 2015 are displayed on the right side one may find a good agreement between the three sets of results except the part of the splashing jets in addition at the multi resolution interface particle volume ratio is 1 8 in 3d a continuous pressure is observed without apparent disturbance when observing the horizontal displacements of the markers as shown in fig 15 one may find that the displacement of the marker on the side edge agrees better with the experimental data this is understandable because the experimental data was measured by a high speed camera set up at one side of the flow tank and therefore only the movement of the side edge of the elastic plate is recorded see liao et al 2015 from the comparison between the two 3d sph curves measured on the central line and on the edge one may find that the 3d effect is the most distinct at the initial stage of the flow impact during the duration when the plate deflects from vertical to the maximum deflection i e 0 28 s t 0 4 s it is also when the differences with the 2d results are the more marked to visually show the 3d flow features snapshots at three time instants are depicted in fig 16 with the fluid particles colored by pressure and the structure particles colored by the stress component σ 22 the flow variation in the z direction perpendicular to the flow orientation is not apparent except for the splashing part this is why in the numerical simulation of the classic dam breaking case dam breaking flow impact on a rigid wall see marrone et al 2011 2d simulations were proven to be sufficient however when observing the stress distribution on the plate clear stress variation in the z direction can be noticed at t 0 29 s and t 0 32 s the negative stress σ 22 close to the side edge of the plate is weaker when time goes to t 0 37 s the plate stress variation in z direction disappears which also agrees with the trend that the 3d effect gradually vanishes in fig 15 fig 17 shows the deformation of the elastic plate at different time instants one can see clearly the 3d characteristic during the plate deformation process however when the plate is fully bent the 3d characteristic vanishes further we conducted another simulation with initial water depth h 0 4 m and the displacement of the plate is plotted in fig 18 as it can be seen the two 3d sph results almost coincide with the 2d result which confirms that the 3d effect becomes weaker in the case with a larger initial water depth as mentioned in liao et al 2015 we deduce that a larger water depth leads to a much larger impact pressure and that this large directional fluid loading of the plate which is uniform in the transverse z direction leads to a plate response which is itself more in the x y plane with a weaker relative response in the z direction 3 5 sloshing with an elastic beam clamped on the tank bottom in this subsection the fsi sloshing problem experimentally studied by vera 2015 will be numerically investigated using the fsi sph model a sketch of the fsi sloshing problem is depicted in fig 19 where a local reference frame is fixed to the tank with its origin at the bottom center of an elastic beam the elastic beam is made of rubber with density 1100 kg m3 and is clamped on the middle of the tank bottom the beam length equals to the initial fluid depth thickness equals to 4 mm and width equals to 33 2 mm tank width equals to 39 mm young modulus of the elastic beam is e s 6 10 6 p a and poisson coefficient is ν s 0 45 two fluid depths were tested in the experimental study vera 2015 respectively d m 114 8 mm named mid depth hereinafter and d s 57 4 mm named shallow depth hereinafter with a forced periodical motion of the tank around origin of the reference frame see fig 20 liquid sloshing is induced and will bend the elastic beam left and right periodically time law of the inclination angle φ t of the tank is written as 25 φ t a sin 2 π ω t where a 4 for both the mid and shallow depth cases but the frequency is ω m 0 826 for the mid depth case and ω s 0 61 for the shallow depth case the tank height h is 334 5 mm length l is 609 mm while the tank width b is only 39 mm see fig 19 such a narrow tank induces significant damping effect due to the boundary layer on the tank wall especially when the liquid viscosity is high in the original experimental study both water and oil were used while in the present sph simulation we select the case with oil since it would present a more obvious 3d effect due to the viscous boundary layer on the tank wall the oil density is 917 kg m3 with a physical viscosity 5 10 5 m2s 1 considered in the sph simulation a no slip boundary condition is enforced on the tank wall and the beam surface to accurately consider the boundary layer effect further the width of the elastic beam b e is only 33 2 mm which means that two gaps exist between the beam edge and the tank wall see the side view of the problem in fig 19 b size of the gap is 2 9 mm which is large enough to allow viscous fluid to pass on the contrary in a 2d numerical simulation both the viscous boundary layer on the lateral tank wall and the gap between the beam edge and tank cannot be taken into account and therefore from this perspective this case should not be simplified into 2d in the sloshing experiment of vera 2015 time evolution of the x displacement of the beam extremity in the local reference frame was measured see the sketch in fig 20 and the data will be used to verify the present sph result in our sph simulation the tank motion fully follows eq 25 while at the initial stage of vera s experiment the tank was gradually accelerated to reach the desired sloshing motion of eq 25 the slow acceleration leads to a phase delay therefore when validating our sph results using the experimental data time instants of sph results will be shifted to counteract this delay in that way the numerical and experimental data will be in phase in this work 2d and 3d sph simulations are carried out for the mid depth and shallow depth cases respectively to investigate the dimension and oil depth effects an initial particle spacing δ x 1 mm is used for all the simulations according to the sph investigation recently conducted by hermange et al 2019 this particle spacing is enough to achieve a converged sph solution snapshots of the fluid evolution and beam deflection are depicted in fig 21 on the left side shows the results of mid depth oil case and on the right side shows the shallow depth results as it can be seen phenomena of 3d sph results are closer to the experimental snapshots vera 2015 especially in the mid depth case a wave breaking occurs in the 2d sph result while in both 3d sph simulation and experiment this kind of wave breaking is not observed moreover in the 2d sph result of shallow depth case the flow separation from the beam leads to a large flow void which is not apparent in the 3d sph simulation and experiment to further highlight the 3d effect in the fsi sloshing case distributions of the horizontal velocity in the sloshing flow are depicted in fig 22 one may observe that the velocity close to the tank wall i e inside the boundary layer is much smaller than the velocity in the middle of the flow in addition at the gap between the beam edge and the tank wall a high velocity current is observed which is another factor that contributes to the 3d characteristic of the problem in fact as also concluded by bouscasse et al 2013a the boundary layer leads to a global friction on the fluid and therefore large viscous damping to the liquid motion that s why in 2d sph simulations due to the lack of this damping the fluid sloshing is much more dynamic and even leads to wave breaking on the free surface finally in fig 23 time evolution of the local x displacement of the beam extremity see fig 20 is plotted one may observe that in both cases with mid and shallow depths 3d sph results are closer to the experimental data than 2d sph results a fair agreement is obtain between 3d sph result of the mid depth case and the experiment but for the shallow depth case a discrepancy still exists for the 3d sph result but the discrepancy is much smaller than 2d this discrepancy was also found in the numerical results using other methods see e g degroote et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 hermange et al 2019 despite the small discrepancy through the two fsi sloshing cases with different initial liquid depths a clear difference is observed in 3d and 2d sph simulations and results of the former is much closer to the experimental data 3 6 3d fsi test considering viscous stress and vortex shedding the established fsi sph model is tested in this section for a 3d problem considering viscous effects in this case a flexible beam with one end fixed on the ground is vertically exposed in a free stream viscous flow experimental data tian et al 2014 and other numerical solutions by an entropic lattice boltzmann method elbm see dorschner et al 2018 and immersed boundary fem ib fem see tian et al 2014 are available in the literature providing sufficient references for validating the fsi sph results the geometrical parameters for the elastic beam are l b 5 and h b 0 2 where l is the beam length in vertical direction b the width and h the thickness see fig 24 the structure parameters are e e s ρ f u 2 19054 9 ν s 0 4 and ρ ρ s ρ f 0 678 the dimensionless buoyancy force on the beam is f b ρ f ρ s g h ρ f u 2 0 2456 tian et al 2014 the buoyancy force is considered by applying a body force to the structure particles to avoid spurious pressure waves induced by a sudden acceleration of the flow from the inflow boundary at the initial stage a linear ramp with constant acceleration equal to u is adopted to accelerate the whole flow until reaching the stable free stream velocity u see sun et al 2018a in that way the flow velocity reaches u in 1 s the reynolds number for the present test is r e u b ν f 1600 which will lead to a chaotic vortex shedding behind the beam in the fsi sph simulation the size of the entire flow domain is 5 b 16 b 0 16 b 8 5 b 8 5 b where the bottom centre of the beam is located at the origin of the reference frame see the sketch depicted in fig 24 such a large computational domain in three dimensions requires the adoption of apr therefore three different particle resolutions are arranged in the fluid flow as the distance from the elastic beam gets further the particle resolution is de refined from l δ x 100 to l δ x 25 the finest resolution region is within 1 5 b 8 b 0 6 b 2 b 2 b which is large enough to cover most of the vortices shed from the elastic beam thanks to apr the particle number for this 3d test is reduced from 45 million uniform resolution to 3 5 million the displacement of the top centre of the beam is measured and plotted in fig 25 after a transitional stage when the stream flow gradually accelerates and the beam gradually bends a quasi steady state is achieved after t u b 20 the drag force coefficient defined as c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 b l is also measured to give a quantitative validation the comparison between the fsi sph result and the reference solutions are summarized in table 3 due to the complexity of the problem different particle mesh resolutions and different fluid hypotheses incompressible weakly compressible in the numerical models there are slight discrepancies between different solvers but the error is within 6 the vortical structures behind the beam extracted by the iso surfaces of q criterion at the time instant when the flow enters a steady state are plotted in fig 26 from two perspectives of observation the vortical structures are extracted by using the technique proposed by marrone et al 2010 who interpolate the particle based data to a cartesian grid and then analyze the flow features with a post processing software from the axonometric view on top of the figure one can see clearly the three dimensional chaotic vortices developed and detached from the bent beam the top view of the flow depicted on the bottom of fig 26 shows a global distribution of these small vortices which form a configuration of von kármán vortex street qualitatively the vortical structures obtained by the present sph model resembles the lbm solution presented by dorschner et al 2018 4 conclusions and future perspectives aiming at modeling fluid structure interaction problems considering effects of the free surface negative pressure viscous stress and vortex shedding the recently developed fsi sph model sun et al 2019c is further improved extended and validated in the present paper through a modified sequential staggered mss coupling algorithm the δ sph model is efficiently coupled with the total lagrangian sph model the mss coupling algorithm allows for a good numerical stability and improves the numerical efficiency when the time steps of the fluid solver and the structure solver considerably differ from each other thanks to the combination of adaptive particle refinement apr and mss the fsi sph model shows its capability to solve 3d fsi problems several test cases including basic benchmarks and practical applications in two and three dimensions are simulated good accuracy and numerical stability of the fsi sph model are demonstrated when comparing the sph results with reference results flow details in the viscous boundary layer and vortex shedding are properly simulated thanks to the apr refined particles near the structure surface help to improve the accuracy of modeling the shear stress in the boundary layer which becomes thinner in higher reynolds numbers besides the apr also makes the direct discretization of the thin thickness structure in 3d easier a new fsi test case named as fsi4 is proposed to extend the fsi benchmark of turek and hron 2006 to a free surface scenario in addition with 3d dam breaking and sloshing tests the importance of considering 3d effects in some typical fsi problems is highlighted the present sph model is capable of modelling viscous flows with high reynolds numbers but as the increase of the reynolds number the required particle resolution to capture small vortex structures has to be increased significantly sun et al 2018a which will further lead to substantial computational cost in 3d sph simulations therefore in future studies the present sph model should be coupled with appropriate turbulence models see e g mayrhofer et al 2015 di mascio et al 2017 to address 3d turbulence flows in real world engineering applications moreover a multi phase model considering the real gas compressibility should be developed to strengthen the 3d fsi sph model in modeling hydrodynamic problems involving air entrapments which in some ocean engineering applications play important roles in determining the flow evolution impact load and the resulted structure response in addition coupling of the present multi resolution fsi sph model with finite volume or boundary element solvers could further reduce the computational cost for simulating fsi problems in a large fluid domain credit authorship contribution statement peng nan sun methodology validation investigation data curation

hydrostatic test for an elastic cantilever under gravity and buoyancy in a quiescent fluid a hydrostatic test is carried out to test the stability of the fsi sph model for simulating quasi static problems indeed passing this test is a precondition when applying the model for hydrodynamic problems the test is set up with an irregular structure made of an elastic cantilever attached to a rigid cylinder which is the same as the one used in the classic fsi benchmark of turek and hron 2006 the structure is initially immersed in a static fluid tank with width w 0 8 m and height h 0 6 m the cylinder center is located at x 0 15 m y 0 3 m see fig a27 a particle packing algorithm has been applied before starting the simulation to avoid any numerical perturbation due to the nonuniform particle distribution around the structure three cases with different density ratios between the structure and fluid respectively ρ s ρ f 0 5 ρ s ρ f 1 0 ρ s ρ f 1 5 where ρ f 1000 k g m 3 are tested the other parameters are maintained to be identical among the cases i e e s 1 4 10 6 p a ν s 0 4 g 1 m s 2 and ν f 5 10 4 m 2 s in the case of ρ s ρ f 1 0 since the buoyancy force counteracts the gravity force the cantilever should keep a horizontal equilibrium state while in the other two cases the cantilever should be bent upward or downward respectively due to the larger buoyancy or gravity force further since the absolute values between the difference of the gravity and buoyancy forces in the first and third cases are identical the corresponding bending magnitudes should be identical but in opposite directions fig a 27 sph results for the three hydrostatic tests with different density ratios between the structure and fluid the flow field is colored by the pressure magnitude while the cantilever is colored by the stress component σ 11 fig a 27 fig a 28 time history of the vertical displacement at the right end of the elastic cantilever fig a 28 with the particle resolution d δ x 50 three simulations are conducted and the sph results at the time instant t 15 s are depicted in fig a27 the pressure contour in the fluid and the stress component σ 11 in the cantilever are shown firstly as one can see a stable hydrostatic pressure is reproduced by the sph solver secondly the cantilever bends upward and downward in the first and third tests as expected note that in the second test the phenomenon that the cantilever keeps horizontal with the stress component σ 11 close to zero is a sufficient validation of the stability and accuracy of the fsi sph model for quasi static problems to clearly investigate the bending magnitude the vertical displacements d y at the right end of the cantilever i e point a for the three tests are plotted in fig a28 one can observe that d y of the first and third tests are symmetric with respect to d y 0 which is the solution of the case ρ s ρ f 1 0 a quasi static state is achieved after t 15 s when the kinetic energy is dissipated by the viscous stress in the fluid 
21124,rubble mound breakwaters are the most commonly constructed marine structures for various port structures with different areas of usage local scour around these structures which leads to stability losses or even failure has great importance for the design of these structures both economical and safety perspectives within the scope of this paper wave induced local scour at the toe of rubble mound breakwaters placed on an erodible seabed was studied both experimentally and numerically experiments were carried out on the wave channel in hydraulics laboratory of dokuz eylul university time dependent scour depth and wave characteristics were observed with ultrasonic methods an equivalent numerical wave channel was used to compare and observe scour mechanism regular waves were generated by using flow3d one of the advanced computational fluid dynamics cfd software scour patterns were investigated for relatively coarse and fine seabed material with 1 85 mm and 0 55 mm grain median diameters under various wave scenarios with a breakwater slope of 1 1 5 and 1 1 75 which are widely used in construction from the experimental and numerical findings obtained from the study it is understood that the numerical model was found to be compatible with experiments keywords wave local scour scour process rubble mound breakwater experimental and numerical investigation 1 introduction coastal structures such as breakwaters are built for different purposes to create a calm water zone the construction of breakwaters under difficult sea conditions can be complicated and costly therefore it is important to understand the occurrence of scour around breakwaters one of the major failure reasons of coastal structures the breakwaters may be exposed to uneven and rippled seabed conditions during operation period and various scour patterns can be formed around the structure sumer and fredsoe 2002 thus understanding these processes is necessary for optimum design of breakwaters project feasibility and cost efficiency the breakwaters are mostly located on an erodible seabed and local scour occurs due to wave and current effects scour depends on wave characteristics seabed material and port configuration the previous experimental studies were conducted only for live bed conditions so clear water scour conditions could not be observed although there is no significant movement on the seabed under the current wave conditions in the undisturbed environment sediment movement will occur around the breakwater after construction of the structure and this situation will affect the stability harmfully sumer and fredsoe 2002 since the scour around marine structures is a complex phenomenon some researchers have conducted a number of experimental studies to determine maximum scour depth the previous studies in the literature were carried out for fine grained seabed material and studies with coarse seabed material is not available in the limited number of studies available in the literature the breakwater head and trunk sections was considered separately the majority of these studies are about the scour around the trunk section of breakwaters xie 1981 obtained his formulas by carrying out a series of laboratory tests for vertical wall breakwaters under non breaking wave conditions sumer and fredsoe 2000 investigated wave induced scour around the trunk section of a rubble mound breakwater experimentally from the tests which were conducted with both regular and random waves it was understood that the scour deposition pattern at the toe of the rubble mound breakwater appears similar to vertical wall breakwater case depending on the experimental studies for the median grain diameter of seabed material d 50 0 2 mm sumer and fredsoe 2000 described a function f α in the xie 1981 equation with respect to the slope of rubble mound breakwater sumer et al 2001 presents a compilation of studies in which the studies on the scour around the coastal structures are examined and provide literature information on this subject torum et al 2003 performed the experiments of stability of multilayer berm breakwaters in this study scour and wave overtopping were investigated for erodible seabed condition the results of homogenous berm breakwaters have been compared with the results of other types of multilayer berm breakwaters an experimental equation has been developed for homogeneous berm breakwaters and external protective layer classification and water depth effect have been taken into consideration the scour around the breakwater and the erosion protection against scour were investigated for the cases of wave overtopping myrhaug et al 2004 study provides an approach to determine scour depth and protection layer width around the head of vertical wall breakwaters and the head of rubble mound breakwaters in irregular waves formulas by sumer and fredsoe 1997 for vertical wall breakwater are combined with describing the waves as a stationary gaussian narrow band random process to derive the scour and deposition depths as well as protection layer widths in random waves comparisons are made between the present approach and the sumer and fredsoe 1997 random wave scour data for rubble mound breakwaters the results shows that the scour variable formulas for regular waves can be applied for random waves if the random waves are represented by the mean of the one third and the one tenth highest wave variables as obtained from a rayleigh distribution lee and mizutani 2008 investigated the sand transport for submerged vertical wall breakwater in case of non breaking waves and developed a formula for the maximum scour depth depends on the reflection coefficient of the submerged breakwater the maximum scour depth normalized by the incident wave height is found to decrease exponentially with relative water depth gislason et al 2009 studied wave induced scour development and flow characteristics around the breakwater by changing the steepness of the breakwater both experimentally and numerically a vertical wall breakwater and sloping wall breakwater with a thickness of d50 0 44 mm base material similar to the previous studies at the end of the study the numerical modeling of the scour deposition process is concretized with experimental data within the scope of this paper local seabed movements were examined both numerically and experimentally for relatively coarse seabed material d 50 0 55 and 1 85 mm the findings and the compliance of the scour regimes were interpreted 2 experimental setup and measurement devices in the experimental studies measurement equipments were used to determine time dependent investigation of the scour in front of the rubble mound breakwater these equipments works according to high frequency sound wave principle and are available in deu hydraulic laboratory inventory uls ultralab level system and uss ultralab sound sensor sensors are used in the experiment to determine the characteristics of the waves generated in the wave channel the sensors are placed in the vertical position during the experiment and not to enter the water high frequency sound waves are sent to the water surface by the sensors connected to the main device and the vertical distance between the water surface and the tip of the sensor can be measured by detecting the returning sound waves the data obtained with this device is simultaneously transferred to the computer and stored and does not require calibration the uls device has two sensors available uss635 and uss20130 two uss20130 sensors in deu hydraulic laboratory were used simultaneously in the experiments within the scope of the study thus in addition to the wave period tw and wave height hw values in the section where the breakwater is located the length lw of the waves in the channel can also be determined precisely by using these two sensors together uvp ultrasonic velocity profiler and integrated sensors are the other measuring instruments used in the experiments within the scope of the study the device operates on the principle that high frequency sound waves strike and return to a particle moving in the fluid and this occurs repeatedly it is based on the principle of return and recurrence of this situation it is aimed to obtain the velocity profile at any cross section of the free surface flow by directly intended measurements with the help of the uvp device and sensors uvp a five different types of sensors that can work with the uvp device these sensors are classified according to the frequencies of the sound waves they send and is selected according to the scope of the work to be performed the available types of uvp sensors are the frequencies of 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 mhz and 20 sensors can be connected at the same time under the same frequency condition time dependent scour and deposition can be determined using a second feature of the uvp device within the scope of the experimental study time dependent scour depths were measured using two numbers of 4 mhz uvp sensors uvp also enables to measure the horizontal component of the water particle velocity um the practices and methodology of scour depth measurement with uvp transducers were given in the study of guney et al 2013 in fig 1 the section and the plan of the physical wave channel for measuring the scour around the breakwater trunk are shown in fig 2 the schematic view of the measuring device and sensors in the physical wave channel is given 3 experimental results before interpreting the experimental results an overview of the characteristic properties and non dimensional parameters in the study sumer and fredsoe 2000 is provided in the experimental study of sumer and fredsoe 2000 the breakwater with 0 6 m width and 0 8 m depth is located 22 m away from the wave generator in the wave channel in the experiments two types of breakwater trunk sections were analyzed under regular and irregular wave effects sumer and fredsoe 2000 examined the smax h0 and h l0 ratios by combining the wave characteristics h0 l0 and water depth h effect on the maximum scour

were performed in the wave channel shown in fig 3 the wave channel has a length of 33 m and a depth of 1 2 m and has a width of 3 6 m located in the hydraulics laboratory of the dokuz eylul university the rubble mound breakwater has been built up on the onshore side of the channel the wave generator produces regular waves on the offshore side of the channel with different wave characteristics after each experiment the bed material was rearranged to get a plane surface a wave absorption system has been located behind the rubble mound breakwater in order to moderate the effects of reflection for all of the experiments still water depth in the channel is 0 55 m as a constant in the experiments where regular waves generated two types of seabed material with a grain median diameter of 1 85 mm and 0 55 mm was placed in front of the 1 1 5 and 1 1 75 sloped rubble mound breakwater the accuracy of the slope of the breakwater was confirmed by a laser meter during the experiments the wave characteristics were determined from the time series of surface elevation from the measurement equipment in addition time dependent bed level changes were determined by measuring equipment the characteristic properties about the experimental studies carried out within the scope of the study are given in table 1 table 2 includes the non dimensional parameters and scour regime information about individual experiments as it is seen from the table all the experiments were carried out under live bed scour conditions θ θ cr all corresponding experiment results are given from figs 4 6 4 numerical approach a numerical model was performed to simulate the scour deposition pattern in front of a rubble mound breakwater in regular and irregular waves with flow3d the flow3d is a computational fluid dynamics software that enables flow modeling and produces current simulation solutions for engineers who study dynamic behavior of liquids and gases for physical processes and industrial applications it specializes in the solution of time dependent one two or three dimensional free surface problems and additionally solve the steady state and limited flow problems since flow3d is based on the fundamental laws of continuity momentum and energy it can be applied to almost all types of fluid mechanics problems it uses a system of differential equations consisting of three dimensional continuity and motion rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations three dimensional continuity and motion equations can be solved simultaneously in the software continuity and

tab in the flow3d also can be imported as a stereolithography stl file in models that can be created in programs like autocad 3ds max and transferred to flow 3d as a result of the modeling study the changes in the seabed levels and the spatial scour patterns were determined numerical wave flume model with 11 m length 3 6 m width and 1 2 m height was created the mesh condensation was tested to get its optimum value by making alterations that results were not affected the zone from the toe of the breakwater to the end of breakwater 4 cm the packed sediment zone 4 cm from wave boundary to sediment zone 8 cm was defined in the grid system shown in fig 7 although the breakwater in the model is considered to be a rubble mound breakwater in this study the rubble mound breakwater has taken into consideration and defined as porous in the model wave boundary conditions can be defined according to wave characteristics and different wave theories xmin boundary is defined as wave wv and zmax boundary conditions is defined as pressure p the pressure value in the zmax boundary condition is defined as 0 as in the air pressure in order to reduce the analysis time in half the symmetry s boundary conditions were applied on the y axis in the middle line of the model ymax ymin and zmin boundaries are defined as wall w because of the similarity with physical wave channel xmax boundary

some experiments give higher scatter index relatively than other experiments the wave scenarios with smaller wave period and coarse bed material performed in the experiments have lower scour depths comparing the scenarios with higher wave periods the amount of scour and deposition in lower wave periods is quite similar and unpredictable however wave scenarios with higher wave periods give consistent and smooth time dependent scour profiles both experimentally and numerically from the time dependent scour depth graphs the final scour depths of the numerical model are very close to the experimental data however the temporal evolution of the scour calculated by the numerical model can be rarely different with the corresponding experimental measurements as it is well known in case of live bed scour any change in shields parameter correspond changes in sediment transport thus changes occur both inside and outside of the scour hole and oscillations are monitored by the time series of the scour so the differences between experimental and numerical results for the scour developing period might be explained by the case that the numerical model is not exactly proper in modeling the scour depth oscillations however the statistical analyses listed above also show that the prepared numerical model is quite sufficient for the numerical analysis of the rubble mound breakwater scour the effect of bed material size can be interpreted from the results of the experiments with different bed materials under the same wave and breakwater slope conditions when the results are examined it is seen that smaller final scour depths and shorter time scale parameters occur in all experiments with 1 85 mm bed material than in experiments with 0 55 mm bed material under same conditions time scale parameter can be defined as the time it takes for the substantial amount of scour develops besides eq 7 proposed by the sumer and fredsoe 200 study with 0 2 mm bed material was applied it appears that experiments with 0 55 mm bed material in the presented study are compatible with the final scour depths this compliance was not determined for 1 85 mm bed material results as expected because of eq 7 is not sensitive to grain material this can also be explained by the effect of the flow intensity θ θ cr with the comparison of results for same experimental conditions when table 2 and time dependent scour depth graphs are evaluated together it is observed that the final scour depth and time scale parameter increase as the flow intensity increases under the same wave and breakwater slope conditions 6 conclusion in this study time dependent local scour behavior at the trunk section of a breakwater was investigated experimentally and numerically the experiments were carried out with two different seabed materials two different breakwater steepness and three different wave characteristics in the experiments the breakwater model was exposed to non breaking waves the data obtained with the help of the numerical model were compared with the experimental findings statistical methods were used to interpret the results experimental results presented within the scope of the study and the results of the numerical model under the same conditions comprise the live bed scour condition in the light of the experimental findings the results listed below were obtained similar to the process of wave induced scour around the underwater pipe and pile it is seen that the scour at the toe of the sloped breakwater occur in two different processes as the scour development and the equilibrium stages it is understood that as the grain size of bed material increases the maximum scour depth decreases as expected but in the case of coarse grain diameter the scour development ends earlier in other words in the case of coarse grain diameter the time scale parameter defined as the time it takes for the substantial amount of scour to take place decreases compared to the results with the fine grain analyses with the increase of the slope of the breakwater the final scour depth decreases and the time scale also declines the reduction of the breakwater slope approaching the bed under the same experimental conditions diminishes the time it takes for the formation of a large amount of scouring it is understood from the experiments that the flow

21124,rubble mound breakwaters are the most commonly constructed marine structures for various port structures with different areas of usage local scour around these structures which leads to stability losses or even failure has great importance for the design of these structures both economical and safety perspectives within the scope of this paper wave induced local scour at the toe of rubble mound breakwaters placed on an erodible seabed was studied both experimentally and numerically experiments were carried out on the wave channel in hydraulics laboratory of dokuz eylul university time dependent scour depth and wave characteristics were observed with ultrasonic methods an equivalent numerical wave channel was used to compare and observe scour mechanism regular waves were generated by using flow3d one of the advanced computational fluid dynamics cfd software scour patterns were investigated for relatively coarse and fine seabed material with 1 85 mm and 0 55 mm grain median diameters under various wave scenarios with a breakwater slope of 1 1 5 and 1 1 75 which are widely used in construction from the experimental and numerical findings obtained from the study it is understood that the numerical model was found to be compatible with experiments keywords wave local scour scour process rubble mound breakwater experimental and numerical investigation 1 introduction coastal structures such as breakwaters are built for different purposes to create a calm water zone the construction of breakwaters under difficult sea conditions can be complicated and costly therefore it is important to understand the occurrence of scour around breakwaters one of the major failure reasons of coastal structures the breakwaters may be exposed to uneven and rippled seabed conditions during operation period and various scour patterns can be formed around the structure sumer and fredsoe 2002 thus understanding these processes is necessary for optimum design of breakwaters project feasibility and cost efficiency the breakwaters are mostly located on an erodible seabed and local scour occurs due to wave and current effects scour depends on wave characteristics seabed material and port configuration the previous experimental studies were conducted only for live bed conditions so clear water scour conditions could not be observed although there is no significant movement on the seabed under the current wave conditions in the undisturbed environment sediment movement will occur around the breakwater after construction of the structure and this situation will affect the stability harmfully sumer and fredsoe 2002 since the scour around marine structures is a complex phenomenon some researchers have conducted a number of experimental studies to determine maximum scour depth the previous studies in the literature were carried out for fine grained seabed material and studies with coarse seabed material is not available in the limited number of studies available in the literature the breakwater head and trunk sections was considered separately the majority of these studies are about the scour around the trunk section of breakwaters xie 1981 obtained his formulas by carrying out a series of laboratory tests for vertical wall breakwaters under non breaking wave conditions sumer and fredsoe 2000 investigated wave induced scour around the trunk section of a rubble mound breakwater experimentally from the tests which were conducted with both regular and random waves it was understood that the scour deposition pattern at the toe of the rubble mound breakwater appears similar to vertical wall breakwater case depending on the experimental studies for the median grain diameter of seabed material d 50 0 2 mm sumer and fredsoe 2000 described a function f α in the xie 1981 equation with respect to the slope of rubble mound breakwater sumer et al 2001 presents a compilation of studies in which the studies on the scour around the coastal structures are examined and provide literature information on this subject torum et al 2003 performed the experiments of stability of multilayer berm breakwaters in this study scour and wave overtopping were investigated for erodible seabed condition the results of homogenous berm breakwaters have been compared with the results of other types of multilayer berm breakwaters an experimental equation has been developed for homogeneous berm breakwaters and external protective layer classification and water depth effect have been taken into consideration the scour around the breakwater and the erosion protection against scour were investigated for the cases of wave overtopping myrhaug et al 2004 study provides an approach to determine scour depth and protection layer width around the head of vertical wall breakwaters and the head of rubble mound breakwaters in irregular waves formulas by sumer and fredsoe 1997 for vertical wall breakwater are combined with describing the waves as a stationary gaussian narrow band random process to derive the scour and deposition depths as well as protection layer widths in random waves comparisons are made between the present approach and the sumer and fredsoe 1997 random wave scour data for rubble mound breakwaters the results shows that the scour variable formulas for regular waves can be applied for random waves if the random waves are represented by the mean of the one third and the one tenth highest wave variables as obtained from a rayleigh distribution lee and mizutani 2008 investigated the sand transport for submerged vertical wall breakwater in case of non breaking waves and developed a formula for the maximum scour depth depends on the reflection coefficient of the submerged breakwater the maximum scour depth normalized by the incident wave height is found to decrease exponentially with relative water depth gislason et al 2009 studied wave induced scour development and flow characteristics around the breakwater by changing the steepness of the breakwater both experimentally and numerically a vertical wall breakwater and sloping wall breakwater with a thickness of d50 0 44 mm base material similar to the previous studies at the end of the study the numerical modeling of the scour deposition process is concretized with experimental data within the scope of this paper local seabed movements were examined both numerically and experimentally for relatively coarse seabed material d 50 0 55 and 1 85 mm the findings and the compliance of the scour regimes were interpreted 2 experimental setup and measurement devices in the experimental studies measurement equipments were used to determine time dependent investigation of the scour in front of the rubble mound breakwater these equipments works according to high frequency sound wave principle and are available in deu hydraulic laboratory inventory uls ultralab level system and uss ultralab sound sensor sensors are used in the experiment to determine the characteristics of the waves generated in the wave channel the sensors are placed in the vertical position during the experiment and not to enter the water high frequency sound waves are sent to the water surface by the sensors connected to the main device and the vertical distance between the water surface and the tip of the sensor can be measured by detecting the returning sound waves the data obtained with this device is simultaneously transferred to the computer and stored and does not require calibration the uls device has two sensors available uss635 and uss20130 two uss20130 sensors in deu hydraulic laboratory were used simultaneously in the experiments within the scope of the study thus in addition to the wave period tw and wave height hw values in the section where the breakwater is located the length lw of the waves in the channel can also be determined precisely by using these two sensors together uvp ultrasonic velocity profiler and integrated sensors are the other measuring instruments used in the experiments within the scope of the study the device operates on the principle that high frequency sound waves strike and return to a particle moving in the fluid and this occurs repeatedly it is based on the principle of return and recurrence of this situation it is aimed to obtain the velocity profile at any cross section of the free surface flow by directly intended measurements with the help of the uvp device and sensors uvp a five different types of sensors that can work with the uvp device these sensors are classified according to the frequencies of the sound waves they send and is selected according to the scope of the work to be performed the available types of uvp sensors are the frequencies of 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 mhz and 20 sensors can be connected at the same time under the same frequency condition time dependent scour and deposition can be determined using a second feature of the uvp device within the scope of the experimental study time dependent scour depths were measured using two numbers of 4 mhz uvp sensors uvp also enables to measure the horizontal component of the water particle velocity um the practices and methodology of scour depth measurement with uvp transducers were given in the study of guney et al 2013 in fig 1 the section and the plan of the physical

were performed in the wave channel shown in fig 3 the wave channel has a length of 33 m and a depth of 1 2 m and has a width of 3 6 m located in the hydraulics laboratory of the dokuz eylul university the rubble mound breakwater has been built up on the onshore side of the channel the wave generator produces regular waves on the offshore side of the channel with different wave characteristics after each experiment the bed material was rearranged to get a plane surface a wave absorption system has been located behind the rubble mound breakwater in order to moderate the effects of reflection for all of the experiments still water depth in the channel is 0 55 m as a constant in the experiments where regular waves generated two types of seabed material with a grain median diameter of 1 85 mm and 0 55 mm was placed in front of the 1 1 5 and 1 1 75 sloped rubble mound breakwater the accuracy of the slope of the breakwater was confirmed by a laser meter during the experiments the wave

numerical approach a numerical model was performed to simulate the scour deposition pattern in front of a rubble mound breakwater in regular and irregular waves with flow3d the flow3d is a computational fluid dynamics software that enables flow modeling and produces current simulation solutions for engineers who study dynamic behavior of liquids and gases for physical processes and industrial applications it specializes in the solution of time dependent one two or three dimensional free surface problems and additionally solve the steady state and limited flow problems since flow3d is based on the fundamental laws of continuity momentum and energy it can be applied to almost all types of fluid mechanics problems it uses a system of differential equations consisting of

according to the turbulence closure scheme chosen in the solution of convective turbulence closure schemes such as k ε a wall function is used which gives the velocity distribution within the boundary

tab in the flow3d also can be imported as a stereolithography stl file in models that can be created in programs like autocad 3ds max and transferred to flow 3d as a result of the modeling study the changes in the seabed levels and the spatial scour patterns were determined numerical wave flume model with 11 m length 3 6 m width and 1 2 m height was created the mesh condensation was tested to get its optimum value by making alterations that results were not affected the zone from the toe of the breakwater to the end of breakwater 4 cm the packed sediment zone 4 cm from wave boundary to sediment zone 8 cm was defined in the grid system shown in fig 7 although the breakwater in the model is considered to be a rubble mound breakwater in this study the rubble mound breakwater has taken into consideration and defined as porous in the model wave boundary conditions can be defined according to wave characteristics and different wave theories xmin boundary is defined as wave wv and zmax boundary conditions is defined as pressure p the pressure value in the zmax boundary condition is defined as 0 as in the air pressure in order to reduce the analysis time in half the symmetry s boundary conditions were applied on the y axis in the middle line of the model ymax ymin and zmin boundaries are defined as wall w because of the similarity with physical wave channel xmax boundary
