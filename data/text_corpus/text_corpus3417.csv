17085,toxic cyanobacteria bloom is a ubiquitous phenomenon worldwide in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs microcystis is a cosmopolitan genus in cyanobacteria and exists in many different forms microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa can produce microcystins mcs with strong liver toxicity during its growth and decomposition phosphorus p is a typical growth limiting factor of m aeruginosa though different forms and concentrations of p are common in natural water the molecular responses in the growth and mcs formation of m aeruginosa remain unclear in this study laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the uptake of p cell activity mcs release and related gene expression under different concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop we found that the growth of m aeruginosa was promoted by increasing dip concentration but coerced under high concentration 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l of dop after p starvation the growth stress was not related to the alkaline phosphatase activity apa although alkaline phosphatase ap could convert dop into algae absorbable dip the growth status of m aeruginosa mainly depended on the response mechanism of phosphate transporter expression to the extracellular p concentration high concentration dip promoted mcs production in m aeruginosa while high concentration dop triggered the release of intracellular mcs rather than affecting mcs production our study revealed the molecular responses of algal growth and toxin formation under different p sources and provided a theoretical basis and

freshwater ecosystems worldwide chen et al 2019 the enrichment of nutrient input is an important factor for frequent and severe cyanobacterial bloom paerl et al 2011 paerl and otten 2013 a 37 year long term experiment confirmed that the algae abundance is determined by the phosphorus p concentration and nitrogen n input would aggravate the dominance of cyanobacteria schindler et al 2008 p is considered a critical element that causes eutrophication in most lake ecosystems schelske 2009 p is washed into lakes due to the extensive use of p containing fertilizers and washing agents in agriculture and discharge of industrial wastewater and municipal sewage the increase in p significantly promotes the development of cyanobacterial bloom conley et al 2009 burberg et al 2020 p is also an essential biological element that is required for the synthesis of ribosomes dna and cell membranes for algal growth in aquatic habitats martin et al 2014 muscarella et al 2014 on the basis of chemical classification the dominant forms of p are dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved organic phosphorus dop orchard et al 2009 dip exists as orthophosphate ions h2po4 2 hpo4 2 and po4 p pi at oxidation state of 5 which can be directly absorbed and utilized by algae and promote the growth of m aeruginosa luo et al 2017 huang et al 2019 furthermore m aeruginosa usually obtains pi from dop when dip is insufficient harke et al 2012 dop is predominant p sources in aquatic ecosystem including two important bond classes ester c o p phosphomonoesters and carbon phosphorus c p phosphonate bonds teikari et al 2018 low concentrations dop would promote the algae growth after hydrolyzed by ap which is encoded by phoa and phox genes moore et al 2005 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 alkaline phosphatase ap is needed to hydrolyze dop to pi before being absorbed by algae wetzel 2001 ap is an inducible enzyme and alkaline phosphatase activity apa is related to p status in the aquatic environment and usually located in the extracytoplasmic region this enzyme can catalyze phosphomonoester hydrolysis to produce pi which is supply for algae absorption and utilization dyhrman et al 2007 p has been regarded as a limiting nutrient for the large scale production of cyanobacteria because it is commonly precipitated as insoluble salts conley et al 2009 tekile et al 2015 ye et al 2018 the p specific transporter pst system comprised by the periplasmic phosphate binding protein psts is responsible for the transport of pi into the membrane pitt et al 2010 hudek et al 2016 some of the cyanobacteria contains an additional sphx an abc type p specific transporter which is also a high affinity phosphate binding protein harke et al 2012 tiwari et al 2015 the algae can regulate p uptake capacity under different p forms ren et al 2017 surface water usually becomes warm in temperate lakes during summer which causes thermo stratification and the availability of dip decreasing wilhelm et al 2003 cyanobacteria have developed several strategies to cope with low dip replenishment conditions such as inducing the high affinity phosphate scavenging systems and regulating the gene expressions of p specific transporters dyhrman and haley 2006 orchard et al 2009 however it is difficult to predict how the p specific transporter would respond to different p forms and concentrations the regulatory mechanism of p acquisition has not been adequately elucidated and the molecular responses to different concentrations p sources in the growth of m aeruginosa need further study microcystins mcs are one of the most serious cyanotoxins sabart et al 2010 kuniyoshi et al 2013 that affect drinking water quality pérez carrascal et al 2019 they enter the food chain damage the liver of aquatic organisms and potentially threaten human health sajeela et al 2017 mcs inhibit the activity of eukaryotic protein phosphatase 1 and 2a in hepatic cells wang et al 2019 they can cause cytomorphosis cell structure damage and necrosis after long term exposure honkanen et al 1990 peters et al 1999 mcs are synthesized non ribosomally via a large enzyme complex which is encoded by a cluster of 10 genes mcya j he et al 2020 the results of early studies indicated that p does not regulate the synthesis of mcs directly but regulate the synthesis and transform of the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp although the energy supply of mcs production is strongly associated with atp synthase he et al 2020 the process of synthesis and release of mcs under different p concentrations is still unknown the effects of different forms and concentrations of p sources on mcs is also not clear natural water is a complex ecosystem with different forms and concentrations of p sources that affect algal growth and mcs synthesis however the study on examining available dop and its mechanism for microcystis access to dop is rarely reported moreover the effect of p form dip vs dop on the toxicity level of m aeruginosa remains unclear here multi group incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dip and dop on algal growth and toxin formation and their molecular mechanisms photosynthetic activity extracellular microcystins emcs and intracellular microcystins imcs concentrations apa and transcripts of the target genes sphx psts phox mcya and mcyd were determined and statistically evaluated the study aimed to 1 analyze the effects of different concentrations of dip and dop on the growth of algae 2 determine the effects of different concentrations of dip and dop on mcs formation and 3 illustrate the intracellular response of m aeruginosa under different concentrations of dip and dop the study is expected to provide a relevant theoretical basis for a comprehensive management and control of mcs in eutrophication lakes and reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiments the unicellular strain of m aeruginosa

significant 3 results 3 1 growth and photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa at the dip treatment of 0 02 mg p l the increase in m aeruginosa density was slow and cell growth entered a decline phase after 14 days of culture fig 1 a rapid cell division occurred during 6 14 days of culture under 0 2 mg p l dip treatment and the rate of cell division decreased and plateaued rapid cell division occurred and continued until 18 days of culture and the maximum cell density reached 1 25 107 and 1 39 107 cells ml until the end of the experiment under the 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dip treatments respectively the growth of m aeruginosa was inhibited when the source of p was changed to dop and the maximum cell density was only 15 of that in corresponding treatments of dip the higher the exogenous p concentration the slower the growth of algae density when dop was used as a sole p source fig 1b algae cells did not enter the logarithmic phase during 0 14 days of incubation in all treatments and then declined progressively the maximum cell density was 2 10 106 cells ml in the dop treatment which was significantly lower than those in dip until the end of the experiment illustrating that m aeruginosa had poor ability to utilize dop the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa is presented in figs 1c and d under different concentrations of p treatments when dip was used as a sole p source the fv fm ratio increased significantly at any concentration within 0 4 days of culture the fv fm ratio continued to decrease and showed a gradual decline after 12 days of culture at 0 02 mg p l it was relatively stable at 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l when dop was used as a sole p source the fv fm ratio continued to decline at 1 0 mg p l at the beginning of cultivation it first increased and then decreased in other concentration treatments the fv fm ratio was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l than in the other treatments until the end of cultivation 3 2 variation in p concentration and expression levels of target genes the concentrations of tp and pi in the culture media were measured to indicate the absorption of p by m aeruginosa fig 2 the tp and pi concentrations in dip treatments decreased slowly in the first 4 days of incubation in all treatments and then rapidly declined thereafter the tp dropped below 0 2 mg p l after 8 and 16 days in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l respectively when dop was used as a sole p source the tp decreased slowly during 0 8 days in 0 02 mg p l treatment and then increased slowly moreover the tp slowly decreased in 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments the tp decreased to 0 02 0 04 0 39 and 0 74 mg p l until the end of culture in 0 02 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments respectively pi increased slowly at 0 02 and 0 2 mg p l dop treatments whereas pi was maintained at a high concentration in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments the pi concentration increased to 0 01 0 03 0 11 and 0 14 mg p l the relative expression levels of target genes were analyzed by qpcr fig 3 when dip was used as a sole p source the expression levels of sphx and psts genes were significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in the control 0 2 mg p l and 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments when dop was used as a p source the expression levels of sphx and psts genes were significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in the control and 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments after 8 and 18 days of culture compared with the control 0 2 mg p l the transcripts of sphx and psts genes were significantly upregulated by about 12 times in 0 02 mg p l treatment after 8 days of culture 3 3 apa and its gene expression the apa of m aeruginosa increased gradually at 0 02 mg p l treatment during cultivation when dip was used as a sole p source low concentration of p stimulated higher apa which was a response of algae cells to p deficiency in the other treatments the apa only changed marginally during 0 10 days and then increased slightly fig 4 a when dop was used as a sole p source the apa increased significantly in all treatments at the beginning of cultivation compared with the initial apa cultured for 2 days apa in 0 02 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dip increased by four three two and two fold respectively until the end of cultivation meanwhile the increase of apa in the dop treatments was 11 14 9 and 11 fold fig 4b the relative expression of the ap gene was analyzed by qpcr which revealed that the gene expression of phox was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments figs 4c and d 3 4 imcs emcs

contents in 1 0 mg p l was significantly higher than that in 0 02 and 0 2 mg p l dip treatments on day 8 anova p 0 05 the cells cultured in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dip treatments showed significantly higher levels of emc than those in 0 02 mg p l dip treatment on day 18 anova p 0 05 compared with 8 days of culture the emc levels in all dip treatments increased significantly at 18 days t test p 0 05 when dop was used as a sole p source fig 5d the emc concentrations were not significantly different after 8 and 18 days of culture anova p 0 05 the emc levels at 8 days showed slightly increase than that at 18 days under different concentrations of dop treatment whereas that in 0 02 mg p l dop treatment at 18 days increased significantly t test p 0 05 emcs and imcs and their responses to single cell toxin production were shown in fig 6 at each concentration of dip treatment the concentrations of emcs and imcs followed similar trends to single cell toxin production the variations in imc contents were consistent with single cell toxin production under the dop treatment group the emc concentrations in 0 02 and 0 2 mg p l dop treatments were similar to single cell toxin production whereas the emcs concentrations decreased and single cell toxin production slightly increased under 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments the relative expression levels of genes related to mc biosynthesis mcya and mcyd were analyzed by qpcr the expression levels of mcya and mcyd did not change significantly with increasing p concentration under dip or dop treatments fig 7 after 8 days of culture mcya gene expression was not significantly different between dip and dop treatments the transcription of mcyd under 0 6 mg p l was significantly higher than that under 0 02 mg p l anova p 0 05 and no significant difference was found among dop treatments anova p 0 05 after 18 days of culture the transcripts of the mcya genes in 0 02 mg p l dip and dop treatments were significantly higher than that in 1 0 mg p l anova p 0 05 no significant difference in mcyd gene expression was observed between dip and dop treatments anova p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different p sources on growth of m aeruginosa m aeruginosa could grow at a low concentration of dip 0 02 mg p l but the growth rate slowed down and the photosynthetic activity decreased with the concentration of dip being gradually consumed to 0 01 mg p l figs 1a 1c 2a and 2c the energy metabolism and cell synthesis could not be met at such a low concentration of p like the energy recovery and use ribosides formation for nucleic acid metabolism and phospholipids synthesis for membranes and chlorophyll li et al 2018 the increase in dip concentration could significantly boost algae cell growth until the 6th day after the dip had been consumed at the concentration exceeded 0 2 mg p l fig 1c however the algae cell growth was not promoted by the increase in dop concentration the high concentration of dop exceeded 0 6 mg p l in the medium inhibited the growth even the medium contained pi at a concentration of about 0 12 mg p l which could be uptake directly by the algae cell fig 2d the 0 6 mg p l and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments have hydrolyzed dop into pi by ap in the media while the algae cell did not absorb and utilize the pi this is mainly because phosphate transporter decrease pi probably cannot transport into the cell the pi in dop medium came from apa of algae cell our study showed that the apa was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l dip treatment than that in other treatments and gradually increased with the continuous absorption and utilization of dip meanwhile the apa in dop treatments was significantly higher than that in dip treatments at every concentration during the experimental period figs 4a and b these were because the algae cell could upregulate the ap synthesis gene under low environmental concentrations of dip luo et al 2009 to satisfy the planktonic p requirement by liberating dip from dop zhang et al 2018 thereby the phox encoding the ap synthesis showed high expression at low p concentration 0 02 mg p l and low expression at high p concentration exceeded 0 6 mg p l in both dip and dop treatments figs 4c and d cellular p metabolism has a complex system and it also needs numerous proteins for coordinated activities in this work we found an interesting phenomenon that the expressions of psts and sphx showed a consistent trend no matter dip or dop was used as the sole p source the expressions of psts and sphx in 0 02 mg p l treatment were significantly higher than those in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l at dop treatments fig 3 the psts are encoding the phosphate substrate binding protein and the sphx are regulating phosphate binding periplasmic protein both of these two genes are sensitive to p deficiency and participate in phosphate metabolism controlled by the two component signal regulatory system phob phor known as pho regulon tiwari et al 2015 the pst system responds to pi limitation and acts as a repressor under high phosphate condition lamarche et al 2008 stasi et al 2019 external orthophosphate concentrations regulate two high affinity p transport proteins sphx and psts due to the expression of genes harke et al 2012 our results showed that the concentration of pi was about 0 12 mg p l at the high concentration of dop 0 2 and 0 6 mg p l fig 2d but the expressions of psts and sphx were lower than that in the concentration of pi at about 0 2 mg p l in the dip medium figs 3c and 3d the pstabcs operon belongs to the pho regulon and can import pi from the periplasm into the cytoplasm which would be activated by autophosphorylation under low p level it is speculated that there are other ways regulating the transport system for pi uptake such as the pit transport system and npt transport system teikari et al 2018 kamennaya et al 2020 under the high concentration of dop thereby the expressions of psts and sphx did not increase when the extracellular pi concentration went low in the high dop concentration as a result the decrease of expressions led to the deficiency of phosphate transporters the pi in the dop medium could not be absorbed by algal cell and thus cell density showed a decrease under the high dop concentration 4 2 effects of different p sources on toxin production of m aeruginosa high concentration dip promoted the growth of m aeruginosa and increased the emc concentrations fig 5c dip also promoted singe cell toxin production fig 6c a positive correlation between phosphate concentration and mc content in natural ecosystems illustrates that increasing p level enhances its contribution to toxin production srivastava et al 2016 the dop made limited contribution to toxin production mainly due to the weak utilization by m aeruginosa inhibition of algae cell growth and decline in mc concentrations single cell toxin production increased because high concentrations of dop 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l inhibited m aeruginosa growth and reduced the number of algal cells fig 6d mcs are cell bound toxins and intra toxins are released to the extracellular environment when the cells are damaged and lysed tilahun et al 2019 which explained the increase in single cell toxin production in this study although single cell toxin production increased under dop treatment on day 8 it did not contribute to the toxin production of m aeruginosa no matter dip or dop was served as the sole p source there was no significant difference in the imc concentrations between the treatment groups after 8 days and 18 days of culture figs 5a and b significant differences were not found regarding the transcripts of mcya and mcyd genes associated with mcs biosynthesis fig 7 indicating that the p concentration does not affect the biosynthetic pathway of mcs production when it meets the need for the growth orr et al 1998 however the rate of toxin production was positively correlated to the growth rate of algal cells the emc levels were consistent with the algal density and the increase in p concentrations which illustrated that high concentration dip potentially stimulated toxin production by adjusting the algal density m aeruginosa had a complex regulatory mechanism for the absorption and utilization of p high concentration dip could promote the growth of algal cells and toxin production while high concentration dop could not imcs tend to be released into water during cell apoptosis and death therefore controlling p concentration is crucial for non diazotrophic organisms such as m aeruginosa different views on preventing the harmful cyanobacterial blooms by reducing p alone n alone or controlling the ratio of n and p have caused large debates while our study emphasized the significance of p level in controlling though the dip is regarded as the preferred p source the dop usually represents the most of environmental p pool in aquatic ecosystems rofner et al 2016 and the results from our study demonstrated that low concentration dop could promote the growth of m aeruginosa not only the concentration of dissolved p but also the composition of different p species in aquatic ecosystem needs to be paid attentions to in managing eutrophication and controlling microcystin production from cyanobacterial blooms in the future 5 conclusions m aeruginosa growth was inhibited under low concentration of dip 0 02 mg p l but was promoted by high concentrations of dip 0 2 mg p l m aeruginosa could not grow under dop regardless of low or high concentrations ap on the cell surface could hydrolyze dop into dip under sufficient substrate concentration dop concentrations were 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l however m aeruginosa did not absorb dip that hydrolyzed by itself due to insufficient phosphate transporter because the expression of phosphate transporter is not only relate to the extracellular dip concentration when the concentration of extracellular dop was high the expression of phosphate transporter decreased and the ability of transporting p decreased resulting in the inhibition of cell growth high concentrations of dip promoted the production of mcs whereas the concentration of dop did not affect mcs production however part of m aeruginosa died and lysed due to insufficient p uptake at high concentrations of dop resulting in the small amount of release of intracellular mcs to the extracellular membrane our study re examined the roles of p in m aeruginosa growth and mcs production providing novel insights to control strategies for cyanobacteria outbreaks in eutrophic lakes

p pi at oxidation state of 5 which can be directly absorbed and utilized by algae and promote the growth of m aeruginosa luo et al 2017 huang et al 2019 furthermore m aeruginosa usually obtains pi from dop when dip is insufficient harke et al 2012 dop is predominant p sources in aquatic ecosystem including two important bond classes ester c o p phosphomonoesters and carbon phosphorus c p phosphonate bonds teikari et al 2018 low concentrations dop would promote the algae growth after hydrolyzed by ap which is encoded by phoa and phox genes moore et al 2005 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 alkaline phosphatase ap is needed to hydrolyze dop to pi before being absorbed by algae wetzel 2001 ap is an inducible enzyme and alkaline phosphatase activity apa is related to p status in the aquatic environment and usually located in the extracytoplasmic region this enzyme can catalyze phosphomonoester hydrolysis to produce pi which is supply for algae absorption and utilization dyhrman et al 2007 p has been regarded as a limiting nutrient for the large scale production of cyanobacteria because it is commonly precipitated as insoluble salts conley et al 2009 tekile et al 2015 ye et al 2018 the p specific transporter pst system comprised by the periplasmic phosphate binding protein psts is responsible for the transport of pi into the membrane pitt et al 2010 hudek et al 2016 some of the cyanobacteria contains an additional sphx an abc type p specific transporter which is also a high affinity phosphate binding protein harke et al 2012 tiwari et al 2015 the algae can regulate p uptake capacity under different p forms ren et al 2017 surface water usually becomes warm in temperate lakes during summer which causes thermo stratification and the availability of dip decreasing wilhelm et al 2003 cyanobacteria have developed several strategies to cope with low dip replenishment conditions such as inducing the high affinity phosphate scavenging systems and regulating the gene expressions of p specific transporters dyhrman and haley 2006 orchard et al 2009 however it is difficult to predict how the p specific transporter would respond to different p forms and concentrations the regulatory mechanism of p acquisition has not been adequately elucidated and the molecular responses to different concentrations p sources in the growth of m aeruginosa need further study microcystins mcs are one of the most serious cyanotoxins sabart et al 2010 kuniyoshi et al 2013 that affect drinking water quality pérez carrascal et al 2019 they enter the food chain damage the liver of aquatic organisms and potentially threaten human health sajeela et al 2017 mcs inhibit the activity of eukaryotic protein phosphatase 1 and 2a in hepatic cells wang et al 2019 they can cause cytomorphosis cell structure damage and necrosis after long term exposure honkanen et al 1990 peters et al 1999 mcs are synthesized non ribosomally via a large enzyme complex which is encoded by a cluster of 10 genes mcya j he et al 2020 the results of early studies indicated that p does not regulate the synthesis of mcs directly but regulate the synthesis and transform of the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp although the energy supply of mcs production is strongly associated with atp synthase he et al 2020 the process of synthesis and release of mcs under different p concentrations is still unknown the effects of different forms and concentrations of p sources on mcs is also not clear natural water is a complex ecosystem with different forms and concentrations of p sources that affect algal growth and mcs synthesis however the study on examining available dop and its mechanism for microcystis access to dop is rarely reported moreover the effect of p form dip vs dop on the toxicity level of m aeruginosa remains unclear here multi group incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dip and dop on algal growth and toxin formation and their molecular mechanisms photosynthetic activity extracellular microcystins emcs and intracellular microcystins imcs concentrations apa and transcripts of the target genes sphx psts phox mcya and mcyd were determined and statistically evaluated the study aimed to 1 analyze the effects of different concentrations of dip and dop on the growth of algae 2 determine the effects of different concentrations of dip and dop on mcs formation and 3 illustrate the intracellular response of m aeruginosa under different concentrations of dip and dop the study is expected to provide a relevant theoretical basis for a comprehensive management and control of mcs in eutrophication lakes and reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiments the unicellular strain of m aeruginosa

significant 3 results 3 1 growth and photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa at the dip treatment of 0 02 mg p l the increase in m aeruginosa density was slow and cell growth entered a decline phase after 14 days of culture fig 1 a rapid cell division occurred during 6 14 days of culture under 0 2 mg p l dip treatment and the rate of cell division decreased and plateaued rapid cell division occurred and continued until 18 days of culture and the maximum cell density reached 1 25 107 and 1 39 107 cells ml until the end of the experiment under the 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dip treatments respectively the growth of m aeruginosa was inhibited when the source of p was changed to dop and the maximum cell density was only 15 of that in corresponding treatments of dip the higher the exogenous p concentration the slower the growth of algae density when dop was used as a sole p source fig 1b algae cells did not enter the logarithmic phase during 0 14 days of incubation in all treatments and then declined progressively the maximum cell density was 2 10 106 cells ml in the dop treatment which was significantly lower than those in dip until the end of the experiment illustrating that m aeruginosa had poor ability to utilize dop the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa is presented in figs 1c and d under different concentrations of p treatments when dip was used as a sole p source the fv fm ratio increased significantly at any concentration within 0 4 days of culture the fv fm ratio continued to decrease and showed a gradual decline after 12 days of culture at 0 02 mg p l it was relatively stable at 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l when dop was used as a sole p source the fv fm ratio continued to decline at 1 0 mg p l at the beginning of cultivation it first increased and then decreased in other concentration treatments the fv fm ratio was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l than in the other treatments until the end of cultivation 3 2 variation in p concentration and expression levels of target genes the concentrations of tp and pi in the culture media were measured to indicate the absorption of p by m aeruginosa fig 2 the tp and pi concentrations in dip treatments decreased slowly in the first 4 days of incubation in all treatments and then rapidly declined thereafter the tp dropped below 0 2 mg p l after 8 and 16 days in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l respectively when dop was used as a sole p source the tp decreased slowly during 0 8 days in 0 02 mg p l treatment and then increased slowly moreover the tp slowly decreased in 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments the tp decreased to 0 02 0 04 0 39 and 0 74 mg p l until the end of culture in 0 02 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments respectively pi increased slowly at 0 02 and 0 2 mg p l dop treatments whereas pi was maintained at a high concentration in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments the pi concentration increased to 0 01 0 03 0 11 and 0 14 mg p l the relative expression levels of target genes were analyzed by qpcr fig 3 when dip was used as a sole p source the expression levels of sphx and psts genes were significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in the control 0 2 mg p l and 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments when dop was used as a p source the expression levels of sphx and psts genes were significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in the control and 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments after 8 and 18 days of culture compared with the control 0 2 mg p l the transcripts of sphx and psts genes were significantly upregulated by about 12 times in 0 02 mg p l treatment after 8 days of culture 3 3 apa and its gene expression the apa of m aeruginosa increased gradually at 0 02 mg p l treatment during cultivation when dip was used as a sole p source low concentration of p stimulated higher apa which was a response of algae cells to p deficiency in the other treatments the apa only changed marginally during 0 10 days and then increased slightly fig 4 a when dop was used as a sole p source the apa increased significantly in all treatments at the beginning of cultivation compared with the initial apa cultured for 2 days apa in 0 02 0 2 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l dip increased by four three two and two fold respectively until the end of cultivation meanwhile the increase of apa in the dop treatments was 11 14 9 and 11 fold fig 4b the relative expression of the ap gene was analyzed by qpcr which revealed that the gene expression of phox was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l treatment than in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments figs 4c and d 3 4 imcs emcs

than that at 18 days under different concentrations of dop treatment whereas that in 0 02 mg p l dop treatment at 18 days increased significantly t test p 0 05 emcs and imcs and their responses to single cell toxin production were shown in fig 6 at each concentration of dip treatment the concentrations of emcs and imcs followed similar trends to single cell toxin production the variations in imc contents were consistent with single cell toxin production under the dop treatment group the emc concentrations in 0 02 and 0 2 mg p l dop treatments were similar to single cell toxin production whereas the emcs concentrations decreased and single cell toxin production slightly increased under 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l treatments the relative expression levels of genes related to mc biosynthesis mcya and mcyd were analyzed by qpcr the expression levels of mcya and mcyd did not change significantly with increasing p concentration under dip or dop treatments fig 7 after 8 days of culture mcya

significant difference was found among dop treatments anova p 0 05 after 18 days of culture the transcripts of the mcya genes in 0 02 mg p l dip and dop treatments were significantly higher than that in 1 0 mg p l anova p 0 05 no significant difference in mcyd gene expression was observed between dip and dop treatments anova p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different p sources on growth of m aeruginosa m aeruginosa could grow at a low concentration of dip 0 02 mg p l but the growth rate slowed down and the photosynthetic activity decreased with the concentration of dip being gradually consumed to 0 01 mg p l figs 1a 1c 2a and 2c the energy metabolism and cell synthesis could not be met at such a low concentration of p like the energy recovery and use ribosides formation for nucleic acid metabolism and phospholipids synthesis for membranes and chlorophyll li et al 2018 the increase in dip concentration could significantly boost algae cell growth until the 6th day after the dip had been consumed at the concentration exceeded 0 2 mg p l fig 1c however the algae cell growth was not promoted by the increase in dop concentration the high concentration of dop exceeded 0 6 mg p l in the medium inhibited the growth even the medium contained pi at a concentration of about 0 12 mg p l which could be uptake directly by the algae cell fig 2d the 0 6 mg p l and 1 0 mg p l dop treatments have hydrolyzed dop into pi by ap in the media while the algae cell did not absorb and utilize the pi this is mainly because phosphate transporter decrease pi probably cannot transport into the cell the pi in dop medium came from apa of algae cell our study showed that the apa was significantly higher in 0 02 mg p l dip treatment than that in other treatments and gradually increased with the continuous absorption and utilization of dip meanwhile the apa in dop treatments was significantly higher than that in dip treatments at every concentration during the experimental period figs 4a and b these were because the algae cell could upregulate the ap synthesis gene under low environmental concentrations of dip luo et al 2009 to satisfy the planktonic p requirement by liberating dip from dop zhang et al 2018 thereby the phox encoding the ap synthesis showed high expression at low p concentration 0 02 mg p l and low expression at high p concentration exceeded 0 6 mg p l in both dip and dop treatments figs 4c and d cellular p metabolism has a complex system and it also needs numerous proteins for coordinated activities in this work we found an interesting phenomenon that the expressions of psts and sphx showed a consistent trend no matter dip or dop was used as the sole p source the expressions of psts and sphx in 0 02 mg p l treatment were significantly higher than those in 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l at dop treatments fig 3 the psts are encoding the phosphate substrate binding protein and the sphx are regulating phosphate binding periplasmic protein both of these two genes are sensitive to p deficiency and participate in phosphate metabolism controlled by the two component signal regulatory system phob phor known as pho regulon tiwari et al 2015 the pst system responds to pi limitation and acts as a repressor under high phosphate condition lamarche et al 2008 stasi et al 2019 external orthophosphate concentrations regulate two high affinity p transport proteins sphx and psts due to the expression of genes harke et al 2012 our results showed that the concentration of pi was about 0 12 mg p l at the high concentration of dop 0 2 and 0 6 mg p l fig 2d but the expressions of psts and sphx were lower than that in the concentration of pi at about 0 2 mg p l in the dip medium figs 3c and 3d the pstabcs operon belongs to the pho regulon and can import pi from the periplasm into the cytoplasm which would be activated by autophosphorylation under low p level it is speculated that there are other ways regulating the transport system for pi uptake such as the pit transport system and npt transport system teikari et al 2018 kamennaya et al 2020 under the high concentration of dop thereby the expressions of psts and sphx did not increase when the extracellular pi concentration went low in the high dop concentration as a result the decrease of expressions led to the deficiency of phosphate transporters the pi in the dop medium could not be absorbed by algal cell and thus cell density showed a decrease under the high dop concentration 4 2 effects of different p sources on toxin production of m aeruginosa high concentration dip promoted the growth of m aeruginosa and increased the emc concentrations fig 5c dip also promoted singe cell toxin production fig 6c a positive correlation between phosphate concentration and mc content in natural ecosystems illustrates that increasing p level enhances its contribution to toxin production srivastava et al 2016 the dop made limited contribution to toxin production mainly due to the weak utilization by m aeruginosa inhibition of algae cell growth and decline in mc concentrations single cell toxin production increased because high concentrations of dop 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l inhibited m aeruginosa growth and reduced the number of algal cells fig 6d mcs are cell bound toxins and intra toxins are released to the extracellular environment when the cells are damaged and lysed tilahun et al 2019 which explained the increase in single cell toxin production in this study although single cell toxin production increased under dop treatment on day 8 it did not contribute to the toxin production of m aeruginosa no matter dip or dop was served as the sole p source there was no significant difference in the imc concentrations between the treatment groups after 8 days and 18 days of culture figs 5a and b significant differences were not found regarding the transcripts of mcya and mcyd genes associated with mcs biosynthesis fig 7 indicating that the p concentration does not affect the biosynthetic pathway of mcs production when it meets the need for the growth orr et al 1998 however the rate of toxin production was positively correlated to the growth rate of algal cells the emc levels were consistent with the algal density and the increase in p concentrations which illustrated that high concentration dip potentially stimulated toxin production by adjusting the algal density m aeruginosa had a complex regulatory mechanism for the absorption and utilization of p high concentration dip could promote the growth of algal cells and toxin production while high concentration dop could not imcs tend to be released into water during cell apoptosis and death therefore controlling p concentration is crucial for non diazotrophic organisms such as m aeruginosa different views on preventing the harmful cyanobacterial blooms by reducing p alone n alone or controlling the ratio of n and p have caused large debates while our study emphasized the significance of p level in controlling though the dip is regarded as the preferred p source the dop usually represents the most of environmental p pool in aquatic ecosystems rofner et al 2016 and the results from our study demonstrated that low concentration dop could promote the growth of m aeruginosa not only the concentration of dissolved p but also the composition of different p species in aquatic ecosystem needs to be paid attentions to in managing eutrophication and controlling microcystin production from cyanobacterial blooms in the future 5 conclusions m aeruginosa growth was inhibited under low concentration of dip 0 02 mg p l but was promoted by high concentrations of dip 0 2 mg p l m aeruginosa could not grow under dop regardless of low or high concentrations ap on the cell surface could hydrolyze dop into dip under sufficient substrate concentration dop concentrations were 0 6 and 1 0 mg p l however m aeruginosa did not absorb dip that hydrolyzed by itself due to insufficient phosphate transporter because the expression of phosphate transporter is not only relate to the extracellular dip concentration when the concentration of extracellular dop was high the expression of phosphate transporter decreased and the ability of transporting p decreased resulting in the inhibition of cell growth high concentrations of dip promoted the production of mcs whereas the concentration of dop did not affect mcs production however part of m aeruginosa died and lysed due to insufficient p uptake at high concentrations of dop resulting in the small amount of release of intracellular mcs to the extracellular membrane our study re examined the roles of p in m aeruginosa growth and mcs production providing novel insights to control strategies for cyanobacteria outbreaks in eutrophic lakes

17086,potable groundwater contamination by human enteric viruses poses serious health risks our understanding of virus subsurface transport has largely depended on studying bacteriophages as surrogates few studies have compared the transport behaviour of enteric viruses especially norovirus with phage surrogates we conducted laboratory column experiments to investigate norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 ms2 filtration in alluvial sand and rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial gravel aquifer media in 2 mm nacl ph 6 6 6 9 with pore velocities of 4 6 5 4 m day the data were analysed using colloid filtration theory and hydrus 1d 2 site attachment detachment modelling norovirus removal was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in alluvial sand the removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than ms2 removal in alluvial gravel these findings concurred with the log10 reduction values mass recoveries attachment efficiencies and irreversible deposition rate constants the modelling results suggested that the ms2 detachment rates were in the same order of magnitude as norovirus but they were 1 order of magnitude faster than those of rotavirus and adenovirus the attachment of viruses and ms2 was largely reversible with faster detachment than attachment rates favouring free virus transport these findings highlight the risk associated with continual virus transport through subsurface media if viruses are not inactivated and remobilising previously attached viruses could trigger contamination events thus virus attachment reversibility should be considered in virus transport predictions in subsurface media further research is needed to compare surrogates with enteric viruses especially norovirus regarding their transport behaviours under different experimental conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words norovirus rotavirus adenovirus subsurface transport attachment groundwater 1 introduction norovirus rotavirus and adenovirus are the most common human enteric viruses of greatest health significance gibson 2014 and they are frequently found in contaminated groundwater bradbury et al 2013 borchardt et al 2011 their presence in water supply wells have often caused disease outbreaks worldwide borchardt et al 2011 norovirus is most frequently associated with groundwater related outbreaks rotavirus is extremely infective and is often used as a model virus to determine setback distances for groundwater protection molin et al 2010 moore et al 2010 adenovirus is the best marker of human faecal viral contamination farkas et al 2020 hewitt et al 2013 because it is prevalent in surface waters and groundwater bradbury et al 2013 thus studies of the attenuation and transport of these enteric viruses in subsurface environments can help predict potential contamination risks associated with potable groundwater supplies and develop preventive measures to safeguard public health most information describing the fate of viruses in subsurface environments originates from studies that have used bacteriophages as surrogates for enteric viruses collins et al 2006 f rna bacteriophage ms2 ms2 is the most used virus surrogate because it has a very low isoelectric point and it is therefore negatively charged in most conditions schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 however bacteriophages may behave differently from enteric viruses because their physiochemical properties differ and they may interact differently with subsurface media and groundwater chemistry thus more validation studies are needed that compare the attenuation and transport characteristics of enteric viruses and bacteriophages to provide more accurate predictions of the groundwater contamination risks from enteric viruses however such studies are sparse in the literature and very few relevant data are available for rotavirus and adenovirus and especially for norovirus due to the lack of a simple cell culture system that would enable norovirus infectivity studies virus attenuation and transport in groundwater are influenced by virus physiochemical properties e g particle size surface charge hydrophobicity the properties and structure of porous media e g grain size porosity heterogeneity and groundwater flow and chemistry e g flow velocity ionic strength organic carbon virus removal in subsurface media is largely controlled by kinetic attachment detachment and inactivation processes schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and attachment can be irreversible and reversible murphy and ginn 2000 microbial transport in heterogeneous subsurface media often displays velocity enhancement where exclusion from small pore networks and the restriction of transport to more conductive large pore networks cause faster colloid transport than solute transport bradford et al 2006 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 ginn 2002 this study aimed to compare norovirus rotavirus and adenovirus with ms2 regarding their attenuation and transport in natural aquifer media under laboratory conditions we present 2 studies conducted at different times under similar experimental conditions the data are from studies of norovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial sand and of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial gravel 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus preparation human norovirus gii 4 sydney 2012 which is

rakaia bridge on state highway 1 in canterbury new zealand the riverine sand materials were deposited recently in a high energy environment the sand was medium coarse with an effective grain size d10 of 0 25 mm and a mean grain size d50 of 0 60 mm and the sand grains were irregularly shaped the d10 and d50 values represent the diameters in the grain size distribution curve and they correspond with

sodium 1 1 and magnesium 1 glass columns 30 cm long with a 3 5 cm inner diameter were uniformly wet packed with pre washed oven dried sand the same quantities of sand and water were used in all the packed columns giving a porosity of 0 39 cm3 cm3 and a bulk density of 1 59 g cm3 flow was supplied upwards from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic milligat pump global fia inc fox island wa

norovirus and ms2 concentrations were quantified using the methods detailed in section 2 2 2 5 rotavirus adenovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial gravel alluvial gravel d10 2 mm d50 3 mm was fractionated from the alluvial gravel aquifer materials obtained during well drilling at the burnham groundwater experimental site near christchurch new zealand the aquifer materials were slightly weathered fluvioglacial outwash gravels derived from greywacke sandstone the gravels were irregularly shaped x ray fluorescence analysis suggested that the major chemical components of the gravel material were sio2 70 64 al2o3 13 66 fe2o3 3 89 na2o 3 57 k2o 2 62 and cao 1 20 the organic carbon content of the gravels was not determined in this study but it was extremely low in the original aquifer materials 0 04 pang et al 2005 the same setup was used for the gravel column experiments as that used for the sand column experiments eleven columns were wet packed with pre washed alluvial gravel that was oven dried at 104 c overnight the porosity was 0 40 0 41 cm3 cm3 and mean bulk density was 1 57 0 01 g cm3 to stabilise the flow rate the columns were flushed with 3 pvs of the background solution 2 mm nacl at ph 7 before each experiment each virus type was injected into separate columns and the experiments were performed in triplicate at least as the results from the rotavirus experiments showed large variations 5 experiments were conducted for each experiment 20 ml of the injection solution containing rotavirus or adenovirus 108 gc ml or ms2 104 106 pfu ml and a non reactive tracer potassium bromide kbr 46 5 75 mg l were applied immediately before an injection the tracer solution was filtered through 0 22 µm and 0 1 µm millipore filters sequentially to generate a monodispersed particle solution after the injections the columns were flushed with the background solution at a constant flow rate of 1 34 0 02 ml min for 400 min 4 5 pv the ph remained relatively constant at 6 76 0 15 during the experiments table 3 shows the experimental conditions the samples were analysed using the methods described in section 2 2 for the viruses and ms2 and high performance liquid chromatography for br 2 6 data analysis and modelling initially virus attenuation was directly estimated from the observed data using the log10 reduction values lrvs of the peak breakthrough concentrations mass recoveries m and normalised mass recoveries relative to the nonreactive solute tracer rb the lrv was calculated from lrv log10 cmax c0 where cmax and c0 are the peak effluent concentration and input solution concentration respectively note that lrvs include concentration reductions because of attachment and hydrodynamic dispersion assuming a single grain size with perfect sphericity and smoothness colloid filtration theory cft was used to calculate the virus attachment sticking efficiency α single collector contact efficiency η0 and irreversible deposition rate constant k the attachment efficiency α was calculated from the following equation pieper et al 1997 1 α d 1 2 λ x ln r b 2 1 6 1 θ η 0 λ where d is the effective grain size d10 of the porous media l where l is the length dimension λ is the hydrodynamic dispersivity l x is the transport distance l θ is the porosity l3 l3 and η0 is the single collector contact efficiency due to brownian diffusion ηd interception ηi and sedimentation ηg as follows tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2 η 0 η d η i η g the η0 values were calculated using the equations given in tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and a hamaker constant of 7 5 10 21 j for virus solid water interactions murray and parks 1978 by incorporating a darcy flow rate u l t where t is the time dimension the first order irreversible deposition rate constant k t 1 was also calculated using the equation given in tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 k 3 1 θ u α η 0 2 d θ although the aforementioned attenuation parameters are useful for describing virus attachment they do not account for virus detachment virus attenuation and transport are dominated by attachment detachment kinetics schijven et al 2002 assuming there are 2 attachment sites with different attachment and detachment rates a 2 site attachment detachment kinetic model schijven et al 2002 was used to simulate the experimental data 4 c t ρ θ s 1 t s 2 t d 2 c x 2 v c x 5 ρ θ s 1 t k a 1 c k d 1 ρ θ s 1 6 ρ θ s 2 t k a 2 c k d 2 ρ θ s 2 where c is the concentration m l3 where m is the mass dimension t is the time t ρ is the bulk density m l3 s 1 and s2 are the virus concentrations m m retained at sites 1 and 2 respectively d λv is the dispersion coefficient l2 t v u θ is the pore water velocity l t ka1 and ka2 are the virus attachment rates t 1 to sites 1 and 2 respectively and kd1 and kd2 are the detachment rates t 1 from sites 1 and 2 respectively we considered that virus inactivation was negligible as the experiments lasted for a few hours only the above model contains 4 kinetic rate constants to avoid over fitting the experimental data during parameter optimisation we reduced the number of rate constants to be optimised by assuming reversible attachment to site 1 and irreversible attachment to site 2 thus kd2 0 this approach is reasonable as microbial attachment can be irreversible and reversible murphy and ginn 2000 and some attached viruses would not detach during short experiments other researchers e g knappett et al 2014 have used a similar approach the 2 site attachment detachment model of hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 is often used to simulate breakthrough curves btcs of microbial transport gamazo et al 2020 knappett et al 2014 stevenson et al 2015 and it was used in this study to simulate the experimental data the values of u and λ were first optimised from the non reactive tracers these parameter values were then fixed while θ k a1 k a2 and k d1 were optimised for the virus data using the internal hydrus 1d optimisation routine θ was optimised to allow for a smaller effective porosity accessible by virus particles than that accessible by solutes due to size exclusion a modelling approach discussed in ginn 2002 3 results 3 1 norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial sand fig 1 and tables 4 and 5 show the results from the sand column experiments based on darcy velocities u 0 13 0 00 cm min optimised from the nacl btcs the pore velocities were estimated as v u θ 4 8 m day which concurs with the flow rate calculation section 2 4 compared with the nacl tracer norovirus and ms2 transport showed velocity enhancement as indicated by their earlier btcs shorter peak breakthrough times and lower optimised effective porosities for norovirus and ms2 the degrees of velocity enhancement were similar their peak breakthrough times were about 13 min earlier than that of nacl and their average porosity was 0 36 the average porosity for nacl was 0 39 norovirus showed very little removal in the sand as indicated by its concentration reductions and mass recovery the norovirus lrv 0 29 0 02 was only slightly higher than that of nacl 0 24 0 02 and its mass recovery 86 5 was marginally lower than that of nacl 88 7 the findings from the triplicate experiments involving norovirus and nacl showed little variation ms2 removal was somewhat greater than norovirus removal as shown by its lrv 0 33 0 21 mass recovery 79 35 and results from the cft analysis compared with norovirus the ms2 attachment efficiency α and irreversible deposition rate constant k were 5 7 times higher cft analysis suggested that the predominant mechanism underlying collision was brownian diffusion for norovirus 99 99 and ms2 100 the modelling results suggested that the attachment of norovirus and ms2 to river sand involved reversible and irreversible processes norovirus attachment to the reversible sites was faster than its attachment to the irreversible sites conversely ms2 attachment to the reversible sites was slower than its attachment to the irreversible sites both norovirus and ms2 attached very weakly to the river sand and their detachment rates were faster than their corresponding reversible attachment rates especially ms2 these trends were consistent in the replicate experiments compared with the irreversible deposition rate constants k estimated using cft the model derived irreversible attachment rate coefficients ka2 were comparatively higher 3 2 rotavirus adenovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial gravel fig 2 and tables 5 and 6 show the results from the gravel column experiments based on darcy velocities u 0 13 0 15 cm min optimised from the kbr btcs the pore velocities were estimated as v u θ 4 6 5 4 m day compared with kbr the transport of rotavirus and adenovirus was largely retarded as indicated by their later btcs and the longer times required for the peak breakthroughs conversely ms2 transport showed velocity enhancement mostly as indicated by the earlier btcs and the shorter times required for the peak breakthroughs compared with kbr the modelling results suggested that the average degrees of size exclusion were similar rotavirus and ms2 θ 0 35 adenovirus 0 31 br 0 40 0 41 rotavirus showed the greatest filtration removal while ms2 displayed the least filtration removal this is indicated by their lrvs rotavirus 1 28 adenovirus 1 06 ms2 0 46 mass recoveries rotavirus 35 adenovirus 53 ms2 87 and irreversible attachment rates rotavirus 1 85 10 2 min 1 adenovirus 1 25 10 2 min 1 ms2 5 03 10 4 min 1 the cft analysis also showed filtration removal was in the order of rotavirus adenovirus ms2 rotavirus showed the greatest α and k values and ms2 displayed the lowest α and k values which were mostly 1 order of magnitude lower than those of rotavirus and adenovirus compared with the model derived ka2 coefficients the k values determined from the cft analysis were very similar for rotavirus but they deviated by 1 order of magnitude mostly for adenovirus and ms2 the cft analysis revealed brownian diffusion was the dominant collision mechanism for ms2 99 99 adenovirus 99 90 and rotavirus 99 87 and that the input from sedimentation was minimal rotavirus 0 13 adenovirus 0 10 ms2 0 01 the modelling results suggested that rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 differed markedly regarding their attachment and detachment kinetics the rotavirus reversible and irreversible attachment and detachment rates were all of the same order of magnitude 10 2 min 1 the adenovirus irreversible attachment and detachment rates were of the same order of magnitude 10 1 min 1 but its reversible attachment rate 10 1 min 1 was 1 order of magnitude greater unlike rotavirus and adenovirus the ms2 detachment rate 10 1 min 1 was at least 1 order of magnitude greater than its attachment rate and the ms2 irreversible attachment rate 10 4 min 1 was 2 orders of magnitude lower than its reversible attachment rate 10 2 min 1 all the viruses displayed higher reversible attachment rates than their corresponding irreversible attachment rates compared with their corresponding irreversible attachment rates the reversible attachment rates were about twice as fast for rotavirus 10 times faster for adenovirus and 62 times faster for ms2 these findings suggest that virus attachment especially ms2 attachment was largely reversible ms2 had the highest detachment rate 5 61 10 1 min 1 followed by adenovirus 9 23 10 2 min 1 and rotavirus 6 38 10 2 min 1 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the attenuation and transport characteristics of norovirus and ms2 in alluvial sand ms2 removal in the alluvial sand column experiments seemed somewhat greater than that of norovirus despite ms2 being more negatively charged than norovirus unlike norovirus which is hydrophilic whitehead and mccue 2010 ms2 is highly hydrophobic schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 its hydrophobicity is 98 farkas et al 2015b thus ms2 has a strong affinity for organic carbon in riverbank sand although the energy dispersive x ray analysis did not quantify the organic carbon level we believe that organic carbon was present in the riverbank sand used in the experiments because oven drying the sand at 104 c would not burn off organic carbons hydrophobic interactions could increase virus attachment and at high ph levels when both the viruses and the grains are negatively charged hydrophobic interactions may be the major factor that maintains virus attachment schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 another possible explanation for the greater removal of ms2 may relate to it being smaller 26 nm than norovirus 33 34 nm hence it would collide more frequently with grain surfaces due to brownian motion we also considered whether the different norovirus and ms2 input concentrations may have contributed to the observed differences in their removal the actual ms2 particle input concentrations may have been higher than those used in the norovirus experiments c0 3 58 108 gc ml because the concentrations derived from the plaque assays c0 5 27 107 1 16 108 pfu ml represented infectious ms2 only and one plaque could contain a cluster of infectious ms2 wong et al 2014 using the ms2 stock prepared in the same laboratory farkas et al 2015a found that compared with qpcr analysis the plaque assay underestimated the ms2 particle number by 3 30 times thus the actual ms2 particle concentration could be up to 1 order of magnitude higher in clean porous media increasing the colloid input concentrations were observed to reduce colloid retention bradford et al 2009 tan et al 1994 because colloids occupied the favourable retention sites but this concentration effect appeared to occur at intermediate ionic strengths iss in the study of bradford et al 2009 at is 6 mm increasing the input colloid concentration by 3 orders of magnitude did not affect colloid retention but at is 31 mm and is 56 mm increasing the input colloid concentration by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude caused less deposition and higher mass recoveries in the effluent they hypothesised that at is 31 or 56 mm colloids were weakly associated with the solid phase by a shallow secondary energy minima and higher input concentration increased the numbers of collisions that knock weakly associated colloids off the solid phase thus producing less retention likewise tan et al 1994 observed that increasing the bacterial input concentration by 1 order of magnitude did not change bacterial retention in experiments involving deionised water but it reduced bacterial retention in experiments involving a 10 mm nacl solution as the is was only 2 mm in our experiments with clean sand we considered that the impact of the input concentration was probably minimal or if there was any impact the results should have been contrary to those observed norovirus and ms2 transport showed similar degrees of velocity enhancement compared with the nacl tracer section 3 1 unlike solutes which travel through all pore networks pathogen transport is dominated by preferential flow paths hunt and johnson 2017 typically earlier colloid breakthroughs occur compared with conservative solute tracer breakthroughs in heterogeneous porous media due to colloid size exclusion bradford et al 2006 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 ginn 2002 and even in relatively uniform media colloids may be transported somewhat more quickly than solutes hunt and johnson 2017 as the size of the riverbank sand media used was not uniform section 2 4 virus transport may be excluded from small pore networks and be limited to more conductive large pore networks this would explain the earlier virus breakthroughs and lower effective porosity compared with the nacl tracer compared with the norovirus results the ms2 results contained greater variations that were probably caused by analytical errors associated with plaque counting which involves many dilution steps when high concentration ms2 samples are assayed a mass recovery 100 suggests that aggregation caused the underestimation of the injection concentration because while the plaque assay counts a single plaque as a single ms2 particle a plaque can contain many ms2 particles 4 2 comparison of the attenuation and transport characteristics of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 in alluvial gravel as described in section 3 2 ms2 showed the least attenuation and rotavirus displayed the greatest attenuation in the alluvial gravel column experiments these observations could be explained in relation to virus attachment reversibility and the isoelectric point hydrus 1d modelling suggested that the attachment reversibility and detachment were highest for ms2 and lowest for rotavirus although ms2 should collide with grains more frequently than rotavirus and adenovirus due to its smaller size its isoelectric point ph 3 75 was lower than those of adenovirus ph 4 5 and rotavirus ph 5 25 5 28 which implies it should experience greater electrostatic repulsion from the grains surfaces although virus attachment could also be affected by hydrophobic interactions the organic carbon level in the gravel aquifer media was extremely low 0 04 thus interactions between the viruses and the solids were probably mediated through the electrical charge mainly likewise dowd et al 1998 found that in the absence of hydrophobic interactions the isoelectric point of a virus was the predetermining factor that controlled viral attachment within aquifer media we also considered the potential effect of the input concentration on the results the ms2 input concentrations were 104 106 pfu ml while the rotavirus and adenovirus input concentrations were 106 108 gc ml since the plaque assay can underestimate ms2 particle numbers by 3 30 times farkas et al 2015a the actual ms2 particle concentrations could be up to 1 order of magnitude higher which is closer to the virus input concentrations regardless we considered that the impact of the input concentration on the experimental results was minimal as discussed in section 4 1 at a very low is the concentration effect is not sensitive to colloid retention the model optimised effective porosities suggested that the average degrees of size exclusion were similar for rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 as the rotavirus and adenovirus attachment rates were sufficiently high the retardation effects caused by attachment probably overrode the velocity enhancements effect induced by size exclusion hence the transport of rotavirus and adenovirus was retarded overall conversely as the ms2 irreversible attachment rate was very low the effect of the velocity enhancement induced by size exclusion was apparent compared with the adenovirus and ms2 results the rotavirus results showed higher levels of variability fig 2 table 6 sample contamination did not occur because the negative qpcr controls were always negative btcs from microbial transport experiments in heterogeneous porous media often show high levels of variability silliman et al 2001 we believe that despite the variations the results from the 5 replicate rotavirus experiments were reasonably representative 4 3 comparison of the attachment rate constants determined using hydrus 1d modelling and colloid filtration theory in general the irreversible deposition rate constants k calculated using cft were up to 5 times lower than the irreversible attachment rate coefficients ka2 optimised from hydrus 1d modelling several factors could have contributed to this discrepancy cft assumes the presence of idealised porous media with a single grain size and perfect sphericity and smoothness in reality the grain sizes in the sand and gravel media we used were not uniform and they were irregularly shaped the single collector contact efficiency η0 is sensitive to variations in collector shape and roughness saiers and ryan 2005 cft accounts for irreversible attachment only it does not consider detachment hydrophobic interactions and size exclusion and its calculation is independent of the input concentration in contrast the modelling approach we used optimises transport parameters by fitting the model to the observed time series concentration data which incorporate the effects of all the processes and factors that control virus attenuation and transport despite this the irreversible deposition rates determined using cft showed similar trends as the hydrus 1d derived irreversible attachment rates 4 4 comparisons with other studies the attachment and detachment kinetics of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 determined in alluvial gravel concur with the findings from our earlier study in coastal sand pang et al 2014 that used the same glass columns background electrolyte 2 mm nacl at ph 7 and flow velocity 0 15 cm min both studies demonstrated filtration removal in the order of rotavirus adenovirus ms2 and virus attachment was largely reversible particularly ms2 attachment our findings suggest that norovirus removal was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in the filtration experiments involving alluvial sand and that it was significantly lower than the filtration removal of rotavirus and adenovirus under similar experimental conditions gamazo et al 2020 also observed lower norovirus gii removal lrv 1 7 than rotavirus a removal lrv 2 in a column experiment with quartz sand and deionised water 1 mm nacl at ph 7 but they found much greater norovirus removal lrv 4 than rotavirus removal lrv 2 6 in an experiment involving aquifer sand and groundwater 15 1 mm ca mg hco3 2 at ph 7 2 they considered that norovirus may be more sensitive to ionic strength increases than rotavirus like our findings the results from other studies that involved organic matter showed greater ms2 removal than norovirus removal kauppinen et al 2014 spiked raw domestic effluent to pilot scale sand filters and found that bacteriophage removal was consistently greater than norovirus gii and adenovirus removal in the leachate similarly humphries et al 2020 found that ms2 removal was consistently higher than norovirus and rotavirus removal in unsaturated laboratory filtration experiments involving coral sand and domestic effluent the findings from our experiments with alluvial gravel showed that the filtration removal rates of rotavirus and adenovirus were markedly greater than that of ms2 these findings concur with those from other studies of rotavirus clemens et al 2020 wang et al 2016 and adenovirus wong et al 2014 shi et al 2012 in porous media however in the presence of multivalent cations and organic matter the relationship can be very different stevenson et al 2015 reported greater ms2 lrv 4 0 5 4 than adenovirus lrv 3 3 4 2 removal in filtration experiments involving limestone aquifer media farkas et al 2015b found that the ms2 reduction in hydrophobically modified sand was at least 1 order of magnitude greater than that of rotavirus because the ms2 hydrophobicity 98 was much greater than that of rotavirus 42 ogorzaly et al 2010 showed that the ms2 inactivation rates were about 6 and 25 times faster than those of adenovirus type 2 in ca mg hco3 type groundwater at 4 c and 25 c respectively 4 5 study limitations and future work while the results from well defined and controlled laboratory experiments can help improve our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying virus transport and removal caution is advised when extrapolating laboratory results to predictions of field problems because virus transport in field conditions will be controlled by the preferential flow path in aquifer media and the transport scale for example spatial microbial removal rates in log m in sand and gravel media determined from laboratory column studies are often 1 order of magnitude greater than those determined from field studies pang 2009 microbial transport in the natural subsurface environment is affected by many dynamic environmental factors and complex physical chemical and biological processes thus the results obtained from laboratory studies may not be directly applicable to landscape level settings moreover direct comparisons of surrogates and viruses in faecally polluted groundwater could be complicated by many unknown factors for example bacteriophage indicators surrogates are often absent when enteric viruses are present thus they may underestimate virus occurrence fout et al 2017 there is no direct correlation between the numbers of bacteriophage indicators surrogates and enteric viruses thus phages cannot be used to estimate virus numbers in polluted water grabow 2001 of note the virus reduction rates and their relationships with ms2 reduction rates determined in this study were derived from simple experimental conditions as enteric viruses behave very differently in different systems research findings from one system cannot be extrapolated to other systems without experimental validations hence future work should compare the attenuation and transport characteristics of human enteric viruses and surrogates in subsurface media under a range of experimental conditions 4 conclusions the removal of norovirus by filtration was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in the alluvial sand while the removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than ms2 removal in the alluvial gravel the degree of filtration removal under similar experimental conditions was in the order norovirus ms2 adenovirus rotavirus the modelling results indicated that virus attachment was largely reversible and that while the rotavirus and adenovirus attachment rates were 1 order of magnitude greater than the norovirus attachment rate their detachment rates were of the same order of magnitude the virus detachment rates were faster than their corresponding attachment rates and the reversible attachment rates were higher than their corresponding irreversible attachment rates the reversibility of virus attachment favours the transport of free viruses and the release of viruses that are attached to porous media poses a considerable groundwater contamination risk information that describes virus attachment detachment kinetics will help to generate more accurate predictions of groundwater contamination risks from enteric viruses although some of our observations concur with other studies findings converse relationships in different systems have been reported especially in the presence of multivalent cations and organic matter because viruses behave very differently in different systems our understanding of the mobility and removal of enteric viruses is very limited and information derived from bacteriophages may not describe enteric virus behaviour accurately therefore more research is needed to investigate the transport of enteric viruses especially norovirus in different subsurface media under a variety of experimental conditions

17086,potable groundwater contamination by human enteric viruses poses serious health risks our understanding of virus subsurface transport has largely depended on studying bacteriophages as surrogates few studies have compared the transport behaviour of enteric viruses especially norovirus with phage surrogates we conducted laboratory column experiments to investigate norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 ms2 filtration in alluvial sand and rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial gravel aquifer media in 2 mm nacl ph 6 6 6 9 with pore velocities of 4 6 5 4 m day the data were analysed using colloid filtration theory and hydrus 1d 2 site attachment detachment modelling norovirus removal was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in alluvial sand the removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than ms2 removal in alluvial gravel these findings concurred with the log10 reduction values mass recoveries attachment efficiencies and irreversible deposition rate constants the modelling results suggested that the ms2 detachment rates were in the same order of magnitude as norovirus but they were 1 order of magnitude faster than those of rotavirus and adenovirus the attachment of viruses and ms2 was largely reversible with faster detachment than attachment rates favouring free virus transport these findings highlight the risk associated with continual virus transport through subsurface media if viruses are not inactivated and remobilising previously attached viruses could trigger contamination events thus virus attachment reversibility should be considered in virus transport predictions in subsurface media further research is needed to compare surrogates with enteric viruses especially norovirus regarding their transport behaviours

et al 2011 their presence in water supply wells have often caused disease outbreaks worldwide borchardt et al 2011 norovirus is most frequently associated with groundwater related outbreaks rotavirus is extremely infective and is often used as a model virus to determine setback distances for groundwater protection molin et al 2010 moore et al 2010 adenovirus is the best marker of human faecal viral contamination farkas et al 2020 hewitt et al 2013 because it is prevalent in surface waters and groundwater bradbury et al 2013 thus studies of the attenuation and transport of these enteric viruses in subsurface environments can help predict potential contamination risks associated with potable groundwater supplies and develop preventive measures to safeguard public health most information describing the fate of viruses in subsurface environments originates from studies that have used bacteriophages as surrogates for enteric viruses collins et al 2006 f rna bacteriophage ms2 ms2 is the most used virus surrogate because it has a very low isoelectric point and it is therefore negatively charged in most conditions schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 however bacteriophages may behave differently from enteric viruses because their physiochemical properties differ and they may interact differently with subsurface media and groundwater chemistry thus more validation studies are needed that compare the attenuation and transport characteristics of enteric viruses and bacteriophages to provide more accurate predictions of the groundwater contamination risks from enteric viruses however such studies are sparse in the literature and very few relevant data are available for rotavirus and adenovirus and especially for norovirus due to the lack of a simple cell culture system that would enable norovirus infectivity studies virus attenuation and transport in groundwater are influenced by virus physiochemical properties e g particle size surface charge hydrophobicity the properties and structure of porous media e g grain size porosity heterogeneity and groundwater flow and chemistry e g flow velocity ionic strength organic carbon virus removal in subsurface media is largely controlled by kinetic attachment detachment and inactivation processes schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and attachment can be irreversible and reversible murphy and ginn 2000 microbial transport in heterogeneous subsurface media often displays velocity enhancement where exclusion from small pore networks and the restriction of transport to more conductive large pore networks cause faster colloid transport than solute transport bradford et al 2006 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 ginn 2002 this study aimed to compare norovirus rotavirus and adenovirus with ms2 regarding their attenuation and transport in natural aquifer media under laboratory conditions we present 2 studies conducted at different times under similar experimental conditions the data are from studies of norovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial sand and of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 filtration in alluvial gravel 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus preparation human norovirus gii 4 sydney 2012 which is

eindhoven the netherlands at the university of otago new zealand for health and safety reasons the specimens were exposed to ultraviolet light for 0 5 h and negatively stained with uranyl acetate using the successive droplet method the tem images showed the norovirus particles were 33 34 nm this finding is consistent with collins et al 2006 who reported norovirus particle sizes of 35 39 nm we previously determined other virus particles sizes using tem as follows rotavirus 70 75 nm adenovirus 68 nm and ms2 26 nm pang et al 2014 the zeta potentials of norovirus rotavirus adenovirus and ms2

value of 3 75 for ms2 strain 15 597 b1 pang et al 2009 2 4 norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial sand alluvial sand was collected from a bank of the rakaia river under the rakaia bridge on state highway 1 in canterbury new zealand the riverine sand materials were deposited recently in a high energy environment the sand was medium coarse with an effective grain size d10 of 0 25 mm and a mean grain size d50 of 0 60 mm and the sand grains were irregularly shaped the d10 and d50 values represent the diameters in the grain size distribution curve and they correspond with 10 and 50 finer grains respectively the major components of the sand determined using energy dispersive x ray analysis were oxygen 53 9 silica 25 6 aluminium 6 4 carbon 6 2 iron 3 2 potassium 2 1 sodium 1 1 and magnesium 1 glass columns 30 cm long with a 3 5 cm inner diameter were uniformly wet packed with pre washed oven dried sand the same quantities of sand and water were used in all the packed columns giving a porosity of 0 39 cm3 cm3 and a bulk density of 1 59 g cm3 flow was supplied upwards from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic milligat pump global fia inc fox island wa usa to minimise the amount of any trapped air and to avoid preferential flow along the column walls the same background solution 2 mm nacl at ph 7 was used throughout the study before each experiment the columns were flushed with 3 4 pore volumes pvs of the background solution to stabilise the flow rate a constant mean flow rate of 1 24 0 01 ml min was applied to the columns during the experiments which was equivalent to a pore water velocity of 4 8 m day the injection solutions were prepared by vortexing then sonicating the purified norovirus or ms2 stocks for 2 min before adding them to 2 mm

fraction collector the ph values of the injection solutions and 5 selected samples were measured and they remained relatively constant at ph 6 65 0 16 during the experiments each tracer experiment was performed in triplicate and each salt tracer run was carried out after every ms2 run in the same column after each run the columns were re packed with fresh sand table 2 shows the experimental conditions all experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 c the conductivities of the salt tracer samples were measured by using a portable conductivity metre hq40d hach loveland co usa the norovirus and ms2 concentrations were quantified using the methods detailed in section 2 2 2 5 rotavirus adenovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial gravel alluvial gravel d10 2 mm d50 3 mm was fractionated from the alluvial gravel aquifer materials obtained during well drilling at the burnham groundwater experimental site near christchurch new zealand the aquifer materials were slightly weathered fluvioglacial outwash gravels derived from greywacke sandstone the gravels were irregularly shaped x ray fluorescence analysis suggested that the major chemical components of the gravel material were sio2 70 64 al2o3 13 66 fe2o3 3 89 na2o 3 57 k2o 2 62 and cao 1 20 the organic carbon content of the gravels was not determined in this study but it was extremely low in the original aquifer materials 0 04 pang et al 2005 the same setup was used for the gravel column experiments as that used for the sand column experiments eleven columns were wet packed with pre washed alluvial gravel that was oven dried at 104 c overnight the porosity was 0 40 0 41 cm3 cm3 and mean bulk density was 1 57 0 01 g cm3 to stabilise the flow rate the columns were flushed with 3 pvs of the background solution 2 mm nacl at ph 7 before each experiment each virus type was injected into separate columns and the experiments were performed in triplicate at least as the results from the rotavirus experiments showed large variations 5 experiments were conducted for each experiment 20 ml of the injection solution containing rotavirus or adenovirus 108 gc ml or ms2 104 106 pfu ml and a non reactive tracer potassium bromide kbr 46 5 75 mg l were applied immediately before an injection the tracer solution was filtered through 0 22 µm and 0 1 µm millipore filters sequentially to generate a monodispersed particle solution after the injections the columns were flushed with the background solution at a constant flow rate of 1 34 0 02 ml min for 400 min 4 5 pv the ph remained relatively constant at 6 76 0 15 during the experiments table 3 shows the experimental conditions the samples were analysed using the methods described in section 2 2 for the viruses and ms2 and high performance liquid chromatography for br 2 6 data analysis and modelling initially virus attenuation was directly estimated from the observed data using the log10 reduction values lrvs of the peak breakthrough concentrations mass recoveries m and normalised mass recoveries relative to the nonreactive solute tracer rb the lrv was calculated from lrv log10 cmax c0 where cmax and c0 are the peak effluent concentration and input solution concentration respectively note that lrvs include concentration reductions because of attachment and hydrodynamic dispersion assuming a single grain size with perfect sphericity and smoothness colloid filtration theory cft was used to calculate the virus attachment sticking efficiency α single collector contact efficiency η0 and irreversible deposition rate constant k the attachment efficiency α was calculated from the following equation pieper et al 1997 1 α d 1 2 λ x ln r b 2 1 6 1 θ η 0 λ where d is the effective grain size d10 of the porous media l where l is the length dimension λ is the hydrodynamic dispersivity l x is the transport distance l θ is the porosity l3 l3 and η0 is the single collector contact efficiency due to brownian diffusion ηd interception ηi and sedimentation ηg as follows tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2 η 0 η d η i η g the η0 values were calculated using the equations given in tufenkji and elimelech 2004 and a hamaker constant of 7 5 10 21 j for virus solid water interactions murray and parks 1978 by incorporating a darcy flow rate u l t where t is the time dimension the first order irreversible deposition rate constant k t 1 was also calculated using the equation given in tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 k 3 1 θ u α η 0 2 d θ although the aforementioned attenuation parameters are useful for describing virus attachment they do not account for virus detachment virus attenuation and transport are dominated by attachment detachment kinetics schijven et al 2002 assuming there are 2 attachment sites with different attachment and detachment rates a 2 site attachment detachment kinetic model schijven et al 2002 was used to simulate the experimental data 4 c t ρ θ s 1 t s 2 t d 2 c x 2 v c x 5 ρ θ s 1 t k a 1 c k d 1 ρ θ s 1 6 ρ θ s 2 t k a 2 c k d 2 ρ θ s 2 where c is the concentration m l3 where m is the mass dimension t is the time t ρ is the bulk density m l3 s 1 and s2 are the virus concentrations m m retained at sites 1 and 2 respectively d λv is the dispersion coefficient l2 t v u θ is the pore water velocity l t ka1 and ka2 are the virus attachment rates t 1 to sites 1 and 2 respectively and kd1 and kd2 are the detachment rates t 1 from sites 1 and 2 respectively we considered that virus inactivation was negligible as the experiments lasted for a few hours only the above model contains 4 kinetic rate constants to avoid over fitting the experimental data during parameter optimisation we reduced the number of rate constants to be optimised by assuming reversible attachment to site 1 and irreversible attachment to site 2 thus kd2 0 this approach is reasonable as microbial attachment can be irreversible and reversible murphy and ginn 2000 and some attached viruses would not detach during short experiments other researchers e g knappett et al 2014 have used a similar approach the 2 site attachment detachment model of hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 is often used to simulate breakthrough curves btcs of microbial transport gamazo et al 2020 knappett et al 2014 stevenson et al 2015 and it was used in this study to simulate the experimental data the values of u and λ were first optimised from the non reactive tracers these parameter values were then fixed while θ k a1 k a2 and k d1 were optimised for the virus data using the internal hydrus 1d optimisation routine θ was optimised to allow for a smaller effective porosity accessible by virus particles than that accessible by solutes due to size exclusion a modelling approach discussed in ginn 2002 3 results 3 1 norovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial sand fig 1 and tables 4 and 5 show the results from the sand column experiments based on darcy velocities u 0 13 0 00 cm min optimised from the nacl btcs the pore velocities were estimated as v u θ 4 8 m day which concurs with the flow rate calculation section 2 4 compared with the nacl tracer norovirus and ms2 transport showed velocity enhancement as indicated by their earlier btcs shorter peak breakthrough times and lower optimised effective porosities for norovirus and ms2 the degrees of velocity enhancement were similar their peak breakthrough times were about 13 min earlier than that of nacl and their average porosity was 0 36 the average porosity for nacl was 0 39 norovirus showed very little removal in the sand as indicated by its concentration reductions and mass recovery the norovirus lrv 0 29 0 02 was only slightly higher than that of nacl 0 24 0 02 and its mass recovery 86 5 was marginally lower than that of nacl 88 7 the findings from the triplicate experiments involving norovirus and nacl showed little variation ms2 removal was somewhat greater than norovirus removal as shown by its lrv 0 33 0 21 mass recovery 79 35 and results from the cft analysis compared with norovirus the ms2 attachment efficiency α and irreversible deposition rate constant k were 5 7 times higher cft analysis suggested that the predominant mechanism underlying collision was brownian diffusion for norovirus 99 99 and ms2 100 the modelling results suggested that the attachment of norovirus and ms2 to river sand involved reversible and irreversible processes norovirus attachment to the reversible sites was faster than its attachment to the irreversible sites conversely ms2 attachment to the reversible sites was slower than its attachment to the irreversible sites both norovirus and ms2 attached very weakly to the river sand and their detachment rates were faster than their corresponding reversible attachment rates especially ms2 these trends were consistent in the replicate experiments compared with the irreversible deposition rate constants k estimated using cft the model derived irreversible attachment rate coefficients ka2 were comparatively higher 3 2 rotavirus adenovirus and bacteriophage ms2 filtration experiments in alluvial gravel fig 2 and tables 5 and 6 show the results from the gravel column experiments based on darcy velocities u 0 13 0 15 cm min optimised from the kbr btcs the pore velocities were estimated as v u θ 4 6 5 4 m day compared with kbr the transport of rotavirus and adenovirus was largely retarded as indicated by their later btcs and the longer times required for the peak breakthroughs conversely ms2 transport showed velocity enhancement mostly as indicated by the earlier btcs and the shorter times required for the peak breakthroughs compared with kbr the modelling results suggested that the average degrees of size exclusion were similar rotavirus and ms2 θ 0 35 adenovirus 0 31 br 0 40 0 41 rotavirus showed the greatest filtration removal while ms2 displayed the least filtration removal this is indicated by their lrvs rotavirus 1 28 adenovirus 1 06 ms2 0 46 mass recoveries rotavirus 35 adenovirus 53 ms2 87 and irreversible attachment rates rotavirus 1 85 10 2 min 1 adenovirus 1 25 10 2 min 1 ms2 5 03 10 4 min 1 the cft analysis also showed filtration removal was in the order of rotavirus adenovirus ms2 rotavirus showed the greatest α and k values and ms2 displayed the lowest α and k values which were mostly 1 order of magnitude lower than those of rotavirus and adenovirus compared with the model derived ka2 coefficients the k values determined from the cft analysis were very similar for rotavirus but they deviated by 1 order of magnitude mostly for adenovirus and ms2 the cft analysis revealed brownian diffusion was the dominant collision mechanism for ms2 99 99 adenovirus 99 90 and rotavirus 99 87 and that the input from sedimentation was minimal rotavirus 0 13 adenovirus 0 10 ms2 0 01 the modelling results suggested that rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 differed markedly regarding their attachment and detachment kinetics the rotavirus reversible and irreversible attachment and detachment rates were all of the same order of magnitude 10 2 min 1 the adenovirus irreversible attachment and detachment rates were of the same order of magnitude 10 1 min 1 but its reversible attachment rate 10 1 min 1 was 1 order of magnitude greater unlike rotavirus and adenovirus the ms2 detachment rate 10 1 min 1 was at least 1 order of magnitude greater than its attachment rate and the ms2 irreversible attachment rate 10 4 min 1 was 2 orders of magnitude lower than its reversible attachment rate 10 2 min 1 all the viruses displayed higher reversible attachment rates than their corresponding irreversible attachment rates compared with their corresponding irreversible attachment rates the reversible attachment rates were about twice as fast for rotavirus 10 times faster for adenovirus and 62 times faster for ms2 these findings suggest that virus attachment especially ms2 attachment was largely reversible ms2 had the highest detachment rate 5 61 10 1 min 1 followed by adenovirus 9 23 10 2 min 1 and rotavirus 6 38 10 2 min 1 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the attenuation and transport characteristics of norovirus and ms2 in alluvial sand ms2 removal in the alluvial sand column experiments seemed somewhat greater than that of norovirus despite ms2 being more negatively charged than norovirus unlike norovirus which is hydrophilic whitehead and mccue 2010 ms2 is highly hydrophobic schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 its hydrophobicity is 98 farkas et al 2015b thus ms2 has a strong affinity for organic carbon in riverbank sand although the energy dispersive x ray analysis did not quantify the organic carbon level we believe that organic carbon was present in the riverbank sand used in the experiments because oven drying the sand at 104 c would not burn off organic carbons hydrophobic interactions could increase virus attachment and at high ph levels when both the viruses and the grains are negatively charged hydrophobic interactions may be the major factor that maintains virus attachment schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 another possible explanation for the greater removal of ms2 may relate to it being smaller 26 nm than norovirus 33 34 nm hence it would collide more frequently with grain surfaces due to brownian motion we also considered whether the different norovirus and ms2 input concentrations may have contributed to the observed differences in their removal the actual ms2 particle input concentrations may have been higher than those used in the norovirus experiments c0 3 58 108 gc ml because the concentrations derived from the plaque assays c0 5 27 107 1 16 108 pfu ml represented infectious ms2 only and one plaque could contain a cluster of infectious ms2 wong et al 2014 using the ms2 stock prepared in the same laboratory farkas et al 2015a found that compared with qpcr analysis the plaque assay underestimated the ms2 particle number by 3 30 times thus the actual ms2 particle concentration could be up to 1 order of magnitude higher in clean porous media increasing the colloid input concentrations were observed to reduce colloid retention bradford et al 2009 tan et al 1994 because colloids occupied the favourable retention sites but this concentration effect appeared to occur at intermediate ionic strengths iss in the study of bradford et al 2009 at is 6 mm increasing the input colloid concentration by 3 orders of magnitude did not affect colloid retention but at is 31 mm and is 56 mm increasing the input colloid concentration by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude caused less deposition and higher mass recoveries in the effluent they hypothesised that at is 31 or 56 mm colloids were weakly associated with the solid phase by a shallow secondary energy minima and higher input concentration increased the numbers of collisions that knock weakly associated colloids off the solid phase thus producing less retention likewise tan et al 1994 observed that increasing the bacterial input concentration by 1 order of magnitude did not change bacterial retention in experiments involving deionised water but it reduced bacterial retention in experiments involving a 10 mm nacl solution as the is was only 2 mm in our experiments with clean sand we considered that the impact of the input concentration was probably minimal or if there was any impact the results should have been contrary to those observed norovirus and ms2 transport showed similar degrees of velocity enhancement compared with the nacl tracer section 3 1 unlike solutes which travel through all pore networks pathogen transport is dominated by preferential flow paths hunt and johnson 2017 typically earlier colloid breakthroughs occur compared with conservative solute tracer breakthroughs in heterogeneous porous media due to colloid size exclusion bradford et al 2006 sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 ginn 2002 and even in relatively uniform media colloids may be transported somewhat more quickly than solutes hunt and johnson 2017 as the size of the riverbank sand media used was not uniform section 2 4 virus transport may be excluded from small pore networks and be limited to more conductive large pore networks this would explain the earlier virus breakthroughs and lower effective porosity compared with the nacl tracer compared with the norovirus results the ms2 results contained greater variations that were probably caused by analytical errors associated with plaque counting which involves many dilution steps when high concentration ms2 samples are assayed a mass recovery 100 suggests that aggregation caused the underestimation of the injection concentration because while the plaque assay counts a single plaque as a single ms2 particle a plaque can contain many ms2 particles 4 2 comparison of the attenuation and transport characteristics of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 in alluvial gravel as described in section 3 2 ms2 showed the least attenuation and rotavirus displayed the greatest attenuation in the alluvial gravel column experiments these observations could be explained in relation to virus attachment reversibility and the isoelectric point hydrus 1d modelling suggested that the attachment reversibility and detachment were highest for ms2 and lowest for rotavirus although ms2 should collide with grains more frequently than rotavirus and adenovirus due to its smaller size its isoelectric point ph 3 75 was lower than those of adenovirus ph 4 5 and rotavirus ph 5 25 5 28 which implies it should experience greater electrostatic repulsion from the grains surfaces although virus attachment could also be affected by hydrophobic interactions the organic carbon level in the gravel aquifer media was extremely low 0 04 thus interactions between the viruses and the solids were probably mediated through the electrical charge mainly likewise dowd et al 1998 found that in the absence of hydrophobic interactions the isoelectric point of a virus was the predetermining factor that controlled viral attachment within aquifer media we also considered the potential effect of the input concentration on the results the ms2 input concentrations were 104 106 pfu ml while the rotavirus and adenovirus input concentrations were 106 108 gc ml since the plaque assay can underestimate ms2 particle numbers by 3 30 times farkas et al 2015a the actual ms2 particle concentrations could be up to 1 order of magnitude higher which is closer to the virus input concentrations regardless we considered that the impact of the input concentration on the experimental results was minimal as discussed in section 4 1 at a very low is the concentration effect is not sensitive to colloid retention the model optimised effective porosities suggested that the average degrees of size exclusion were similar for rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 as the rotavirus and adenovirus attachment rates were sufficiently high the retardation effects caused by attachment probably overrode the velocity enhancements effect induced by size exclusion hence the transport of rotavirus and adenovirus was retarded overall conversely as the ms2 irreversible attachment rate was very low the effect of the velocity enhancement induced by size exclusion was apparent compared with the adenovirus and ms2 results the rotavirus results showed higher levels of variability fig 2 table 6 sample contamination did not occur because the negative qpcr controls were always negative btcs from microbial transport experiments in heterogeneous porous media often show high levels of variability silliman et al 2001 we believe that despite the variations the results from the 5 replicate rotavirus experiments were reasonably representative 4 3 comparison of the attachment rate constants determined using hydrus 1d modelling and colloid filtration theory in general the irreversible deposition rate constants k calculated using cft were up to 5 times lower than the irreversible attachment rate coefficients ka2 optimised from hydrus 1d modelling several factors could have contributed to this discrepancy cft assumes the presence of idealised porous media with a single grain size and perfect sphericity and smoothness in reality the grain sizes in the sand and gravel media we used were not uniform and they were irregularly shaped the single collector contact efficiency η0 is sensitive to variations in collector shape and roughness saiers and ryan 2005 cft accounts for irreversible attachment only it does not consider detachment hydrophobic interactions and size exclusion and its calculation is independent of the input concentration in contrast the modelling approach we used optimises transport parameters by fitting the model to the observed time series concentration data which incorporate the effects of all the processes and factors that control virus attenuation and transport despite this the irreversible deposition rates determined using cft showed similar trends as the hydrus 1d derived irreversible attachment rates 4 4 comparisons with other studies the attachment and detachment kinetics of rotavirus adenovirus and ms2 determined in alluvial gravel concur with the findings from our earlier study in coastal sand pang et al 2014 that used the same glass columns background electrolyte 2 mm nacl at ph 7 and flow velocity 0 15 cm min both studies demonstrated filtration removal in the order of rotavirus adenovirus ms2 and virus attachment was largely reversible particularly ms2 attachment our findings suggest that norovirus removal was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in the filtration experiments involving alluvial sand and that it was significantly lower than the filtration removal of rotavirus and adenovirus under similar experimental conditions gamazo et al 2020 also observed lower norovirus gii removal lrv 1 7 than rotavirus a removal lrv 2 in a column experiment with quartz sand and deionised water 1 mm nacl at ph 7 but they found much greater norovirus removal lrv 4 than rotavirus removal lrv 2 6 in an experiment involving aquifer sand and groundwater 15 1 mm ca mg hco3 2 at ph 7 2 they considered that norovirus may be more sensitive to ionic strength increases than rotavirus like our findings the results from other studies that involved organic matter showed greater ms2 removal than norovirus removal kauppinen et al 2014 spiked raw domestic effluent to pilot scale sand filters and found that bacteriophage removal was consistently greater than norovirus gii and adenovirus removal in the leachate similarly humphries et al 2020 found that ms2 removal was consistently higher than norovirus and rotavirus removal in unsaturated laboratory filtration experiments involving coral sand and domestic effluent the findings from our experiments with alluvial gravel showed that the filtration removal rates of rotavirus and adenovirus were markedly greater than that of ms2 these findings concur with those from other studies of rotavirus clemens et al 2020 wang et al 2016 and adenovirus wong et al 2014 shi et al 2012 in porous media however in the presence of multivalent cations and organic matter the relationship can be very different stevenson et al 2015 reported greater ms2 lrv 4 0 5 4 than adenovirus lrv 3 3 4 2 removal in filtration experiments involving limestone aquifer media farkas et al 2015b found that the ms2 reduction in hydrophobically modified sand was at least 1 order of magnitude greater than that of rotavirus because the ms2 hydrophobicity 98 was much greater than that of rotavirus 42 ogorzaly et al 2010 showed that the ms2 inactivation rates were about 6 and 25 times faster than those of adenovirus type 2 in ca mg hco3 type groundwater at 4 c and 25 c respectively 4 5 study limitations and future work while the results from well defined and controlled laboratory experiments can help improve our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying virus transport and removal caution is advised when extrapolating laboratory results to predictions of field problems because virus transport in field conditions will be controlled by the preferential flow path in aquifer media and the transport scale for example spatial microbial removal rates in log m in sand and gravel media determined from laboratory column studies are often 1 order of magnitude greater than those determined from field studies pang 2009 microbial transport in the natural subsurface environment is affected by many dynamic environmental factors and complex physical chemical and biological processes thus the results obtained from laboratory studies may not be directly applicable to landscape level settings moreover direct comparisons of surrogates and viruses in faecally polluted groundwater could be complicated by many unknown factors for example bacteriophage indicators surrogates are often absent when enteric viruses are present thus they may underestimate virus occurrence fout et al 2017 there is no direct correlation between the numbers of bacteriophage indicators surrogates and enteric viruses thus phages cannot be used to estimate virus numbers in polluted water grabow 2001 of note the virus reduction rates and their relationships with ms2 reduction rates determined in this study were derived from simple experimental conditions as enteric viruses behave very differently in different systems research findings from one system cannot be extrapolated to other systems without experimental validations hence future work should compare the attenuation and transport characteristics of human enteric viruses and surrogates in subsurface media under a range of experimental conditions 4 conclusions the removal of norovirus by filtration was somewhat lower than ms2 removal in the alluvial sand while the removal of rotavirus and adenovirus was markedly greater than ms2 removal in the alluvial gravel the degree of filtration removal under similar experimental conditions was in the order norovirus ms2 adenovirus rotavirus the modelling results indicated that virus attachment was largely reversible and that while the rotavirus and adenovirus attachment rates were 1 order of magnitude greater than the norovirus attachment rate their detachment rates were of the same order of magnitude the virus detachment rates were faster than their corresponding attachment rates and the reversible attachment rates were higher than their corresponding irreversible attachment rates the reversibility of virus attachment favours the transport of free viruses and the release of viruses that are attached to porous media poses a considerable groundwater contamination risk information that describes virus attachment detachment kinetics will help to generate more accurate predictions of groundwater contamination risks from enteric viruses although some of our observations concur with other studies findings converse relationships in different systems have been reported especially in the presence of multivalent cations and organic matter because viruses behave very differently in different systems our understanding of the mobility and removal of enteric viruses is very limited and information derived from bacteriophages may not describe enteric virus behaviour accurately therefore more research is needed to investigate the transport of enteric viruses especially norovirus in different subsurface media under a variety of experimental conditions

17087,with questions emerging on the presence and risks associated with metabolites and transformation products tps of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment progress has been made in terms of monitoring and regulation of pesticide metabolites however less interest is shown for pharmaceutical residues although their pseudo persistence and adverse effects on non target organisms are proven this study provides original knowledge about the contamination of ten sites located along three french rivers water sediments biofilms clams by pharmaceutical metabolites and tps as well as a preliminary environmental risk assessment studied compounds included carbamazepine with five metabolites and tps and diclofenac with three metabolites and tps results show that metabolites and tps are present in all studied compartments with mean concentrations up to 0 52 µg l 1 in water 229 ng g 1 in sediments 2153 ng g 1 in biofilms and 1149 ng g 1 in clams qsar estimations oecd toolbox were involved to predict the studied compounds ecotoxicities qsar models showed that diclofenac and its metabolites and tps could be more toxic than carbamazepine and its metabolites and tps to three aquatic species representing green algae invertebrates and fish however real ecotoxicological effects are still to be determined the environmental risk assessment showed that hydroxydiclofenac 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde and dibenzazepine could present a greater risk than other studied compounds for aquatic organisms in addition the risk associated with a mixture of diclofenac and its related metabolites and tps has been found to be greater than that of the compounds considered individually graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products ecotoxicity risk assessment rivers 1 introduction pharmaceuticals enter into rivers mainly through wastewater discharge wastewater treatment plants wwtps or septic tanks and to a lesser extent from livestock daughton ternes 1999 fent et al 2006 these compounds are biologically active and are selected for their specific actions on the human or animal organism therefore an exposure outside the medical or veterinary setting may lead to unwanted effects toxic or disruptive effects on living organisms many studies have already reported developmental disorders in frog tadpoles foster et al 2010 fish feminization petrovic et al 2002 changes in diversity and abundance of microbial communities liebig et al 2010 etc related to the exposure to pharmaceutical residues at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to µg l 1 via the aquatic environment in the long term all these effects could have major consequences on biodiversity and water use bathing drinking water resources in relation to human health e g exposure to endocrine disruptors or resistant pathogenic microorganisms amarasiri et al 2020 gonsioroski et al 2020 in the environment pharmaceuticals are found not only as active molecules i e parent compounds but also as metabolites and biotic or abiotic transformation products tps patel et al 2019 pharmaceuticals are first transformed in the human or animal body after uptake they are partially metabolized into more polar and soluble forms pharmacologically active or not by a variety of oxidative and conjugative enzymes glucuronide conjugation sulfoconjugation acetylation amino acid conjugation glutathione conjugation and methylation jančová šiller 2012 these transformations facilitate their elimination through urine and faeces other transformation pathways occur in wastewaters during their treatment in wwtps pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites are transformed by biodegradation and physicochemical reactions e g hydrolytic cleavage of amide bonds ether cleavage demethylation hydroxylation during secondary treatment quintana et al 2005 barra caracciolo et al 2015 once released in the environment pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites are further transformed by direct photodegradation initiated by sunlight or indirect photodegradation in the presence of free radicals or singlet oxygen generated by the action of uv rays on natural organic matter andreozzi et al 2003 chemical hydrolysis and oxydo reduction reactions can also lead to their transformation as a function of ph and temperature another main transformation route in the aquatic environment involves biodegradation by different families of microorganisms if the molecules toxicities do not inhibit microbial activity barra caracciolo et al 2015 while the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in natural waters has been demonstrated since the 1980s patel et al 2019 many studies report an accumulation of these contaminants in other aquatic compartments kümmerer 2004 thus sediments can accumulate pharmaceutical compounds or their metabolites and tps li et al 2014 tamtam et al 2011 but also favor microbial degradation processes kunkel radke 2008 several studies have reported significant accumulation of pharmaceuticals in benthic organisms river biofilms aubertheau et al 2017 huerta et al 2016 and invertebrates burket et al 2019 de solla et al 2016 du et al 2015 xie et al 2019 as well as in fish brooks et al 2005 huerta et al 2013 xie et al 2019 only aquatic plants seem not to accumulate these compounds or only weakly wilkinson et al 2018 such a widespread presence of pharmaceuticals makes it evident that metabolites and tps of pharmaceutical residues could also be present in many of these compartments the issue is all the more important because metabolites and tps can exhibit toxicity to living organisms which can be lower similar or even higher than the parent compounds bleeker et al 1999 bort et al 1999 bourgeois wad 1984 schulze et al 2010 however the risks associated with these metabolites and tps as well as their presence in the environment are still very little studied due to their very large number and the absence of analytical standards for their quantification questioning relating to the presence of organic contaminants metabolites and tps in natural waters and drinking water are emerging more and more worldwide this is largely due to the knowledge gained on pesticide metabolites and their incidence on health in france and other european countries the presence of pesticide residues and their metabolites in water intended for human consumption is regulated by council directive 98 83 ec which sets quality limits for pesticides and their relevant metabolites of 0 1 µg l 1 per individual substance and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum of these molecules european council 1998 to date no regulation relating to the quality of natural waters includes pharmaceutical residues however six molecules or families of molecules 17 alpha ethinylestradiol 17 beta estradiol estrone macrolide antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin are included on the watch list of substances for union wide monitoring established in 2018 by implementing decision eu 2018 840 european commission 2018 the issue of risk assessment is today very important because of the rise of all sorts of emerging pollutants that form an environmental soup of a multitude of compounds in large majority at low concentrations indeed it has been shown that organic pollutants may have unpredictable biochemical interactions when mixed together leading to different effects of what might be observed when evaluating the toxicity of a single molecule filby et al 2007 sumpter johnson 2005 the present work draws up a first assessment of the contamination of the aquatic environment by pharmaceutical metabolites and tps thus two iconic pharmaceutical compounds carbamazepine cbz and diclofenac dcf and eight of their associated metabolites and tps were quantified in water sediments biofilms and clams corbicula fluminea from rivers of western france then the qsar toolbox oecd european chemicals agency 2020 was used to predict the missing toxicity data for these compounds considered individually or in mixtures this allowed a first environmental risk assessment in french waters and sediments and then to open the discussion about the relevance of considering pharmaceutical metabolites and tps for future guidelines and regulations 2 material and methods 2 1 target compounds carbamazepine diclofenac and the metabolites and tps considered in this work are presented in table 1 analytical grade standards of carbamazepine cbz 3 hydroxycarbamazepine 3oh cbz 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz epox dibenzazepine dibenz acridone acrid diclofenac dcf 4 hydroxydiclofenac 4 oh dcfbz and 5 hydroxydiclofenac 5oh dcf were purchased from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany while standards of 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans dihydroxycarbamazepine trans cbz and 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde benz were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology heidelberg germany and synchem ug co kg altenburg germany respectively individual stock solutions were prepared in lc ms grade methanol carlo erba reagents val de reuil france at 200 mg l 1 and stored at 20 c 2 2 study area and sampling strategy a sampling campaign was conducted in september 2018 along three rivers vienne clain and thouet located in the same part of western france north of the vienne and south of the deux sèvres french departments figure 1 their watersheds present close rural urban occupation agricultural socio economic activities and hydro climatic conditions they are typical of this part of france the sampling took place at the end of summer during the low water flow period thus facilitating accessibility to the studied compartments ten different sampling sites were selected based on their location upstream or downstream from urban areas figure 1 on each site a surface of 20 m2 was prospected to collect samples of all four compartments of interest thus 2 l of water were grab sampled in a high density polyethylene pehd bottle biofilms were collected from ten rocks chosen randomly at a depth of 50 to 100 cm for that rock surface was scrapped with a clean toothbrush and ultrapure water milli q iq 7000 merck kgaa darmstadt

performance was assessed via linearity limits of detection and quantification repeatability and reproducibility according to the french afnor xp t90 210 standard afnor 1999 detailed methods are presented in si 6 and table si 7 all limits of detection and quantification are summarized in table si 8 2 5 metabolites and tps ecotoxicity 2 5 1 prediction of ecotoxicity data ecotoxicity data of pharmaceutical metabolites or transformation products are often rare or even not available at all for this reason the oecd quantitative structure activity relationship qsar toolbox version 4 4 was used to generate environmental toxicity endpoints this toolbox was developed by the laboratory of mathematical chemistry oasis lmc bourgas bulgaria for the oecd in collaboration with the european chemicals agency echa its main objective is to use qsar methodologies to group chemicals into categories depending on their structure and or modes of action this helps to fill data gaps for a given compound based on the data available for its analogues by read across used for qualitative endpoints trend analysis used for quantitative endpoints if a high number of analogues with experimental results are identified or qsar models blázquez et al 2020 determined the acute toxicity for aquatic organisms of a biocidal active substance and its metabolites to assess the suitability of available qsar models to predict the obtained values the advantages of the oecd qsar toolbox were also detailed by schultz et al 2018 in this study the trend analysis approach was used to estimate acute toxicities of individual compounds with respect to the green algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ec50 growth rate 96 h the invertebrate daphnia magna lc50 mortality 48 h and the fish pimephales promelas lc50 mortality 96 h this approach involves modeling the relationship between the considered toxicity endpoint and a physicochemical property by default the log kow using the experimental data available for the compound s analogues the toxicity estimations obtained for the individual molecules were also used for the prediction of the acute toxicity of a mixture of parent molecule and its associated metabolites and tps respecting the molar fractions observed from the average concentrations measured in the studied waters oecd 2020 for the two mixtures considered cbz and its metabolites and tps dcf and its metabolites and tps it appears that the compounds exhibit different modes of action according to the acute aquatic toxicity classification by verhaar modified the ecosar ecosar is the ecological structure activity relationships predictive model developed by the us epa classification for aquatic toxicity and the acute aquatic toxicity modes of action classification by oasis oasis is the laboratory that developed the qsar toolbox consequently trend analysis calculations were performed considering an independent modes of action approach oecd 2020 2 5 2 environmental risk assessment according to the echa guidelines european chemicals agency 2008 experimental or calculated toxicity endpoints cannot be directly used for an environmental risk assessment because natural conditions are different than laboratory test conditions indeed ecosystems are more sensitive to chemical compounds than individual organisms in a laboratory environment for this reason these endpoints lc50 or ec50 are used for the estimation of predicted no effect concentrations in water pnecwater pnecwater are obtained by dividing the lowest ecotoxicity value by an appropriate assessment factor the scarcer the available data the higher is the applied assessment factor in this study only short term toxicity data were available the estimation of effects on organisms throughout their life cycle was therefore less realistic than with long term data hence a high assessment factor of 1000 was applied european chemicals agency 2008 then the hazard quotient hq was calculated by dividing the maximal environmental concentration mec measured in water by the calculated pnecwater when the hq is less than 0 1 the concerned compound does not present any risk for aquatic organisms an hq between 0 1 and 1 indicates a medium risk while a value above 1 means that the studied molecule exhibits a high risk for the aquatic ecosystem straub 2002 for the sediment no ecotoxicity parameter could be predicted by the qsar toolbox therefore the equilibrium partitioning method epm described in the european chemicals bureau technical guidance document european chemicals bureau 2003 was used to derive a pnecsediment from the pnecwater thus p n e c s e d i m e n t 0 783 0 0217 k o c p n e c w a t e r where k o c represents the organic carbon water partition coefficient hence providing an estimate of the ability of a compound to be adsorbed on the organic matter of the sediment indeed a log koc greater than 3 indicates potentially significant adsorption on the sediment tissier et al 2005 therefore the pnecsediment value is associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment the mec is expressed in micrograms of pollutant per gram of dry sediment without consideration of organic carbon content which is of 1 on average for this study s sediments for the calculation of hq the corrected mec was used to consider the part of organic carbon present in the sediment 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in rivers all studied metabolites and tps and their parent compounds were found in all samples from the three rivers this finding highlights the large occurrence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment figure 2 and figure 3 show mean concentrations standard deviation of dcf and cbz with their associated metabolites and tps in waters biofilms sediments and clams n b full data are presented in table si 9 for the cbz family mean concentrations in water range from 0 18 0 09 µg l 1 for trans cbz to 0 52 0 13 µg l 1 for cbz in biofilms concentrations are between 258 181 ng g 1 for trans cbz and 1735 811 ng g 1 for dibenz in sediments concentrations are between 48 25 ng g 1 for 3oh cbz and 128 56 ng g 1 for dibenz finally in clams levels range from 345 218 ng g 1 for trans cbz to 1066 566 ng g 1 for acrid these results show that mean concentrations of dibenz are higher than those of cbz in most matrices acrid is also found at levels close to those of cbz the other metabolites and tps are generally less concentrated for the dcf family the data show that metabolites and tps are more concentrated than the parent compound thus mean concentrations in waters range from 0 19 0 27 µg l 1 for benz to 0 26 0 15 µg l 1 for oh dcf in biofilms levels vary from 348 349 ng g 1 for dcf to 2153 1532 ng g 1 for benz in sediments concentrations range from 51 55 ng g 1 for dcf to 229 250 ng g 1 for benz finally in clams concentrations are between 493 428 ng g 1 for dcf and 1149 916 ng g 1 for oh dcf it is worth noting that cbz and its metabolites and tps are generally present at higher concentrations than dcf and its metabolites and tps in water and sediments while dcf and its metabolites and tps are more accumulated than cbz and its metabolites and tps in biofilms especially benz and clams as shown in table 2 in waters cbz concentrations are close to the levels determined by koba et al 2018 in a czech pond used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent 290 560 ng l 1 but higher than the concentrations measured by du et al 2014 in a watercourse impacted by wwtp releases in central texas united states 370 14 ng l 1 dcf levels are of the same order of magnitude as those determined by koba et al 2018 22 870 ng l 1 or by wilkinson et al 2017 in three rivers of southern england 0 96 253 ng l 1 but higher than those measured by du et al 2014 86 55 ng l 1 then in biofilms the levels of cbz are higher than those measured by aubertheau et al 2017 in the vienne river for example at the downstream site of the châtellerault wwtp the cbz concentration in this study is 1095 28 ng g 1 while in the study by aubertheau et al 2017 it was 583 5 ng g 1 likewise for the dcf concentration which amounts to 64 26 ng g 1 at the downstream site of the châtellerault wwtp in this study and to 37 2 ng g 1 in the study by aubertheau et al 2017 in addition in sediments koba et al 2018 determined much lower levels of cbz 5 1 16 ng g 1 and dcf 2 6 30 ng g 1 finally cbz was not detected in clams from taihu lake in china xie et al 2015 and dcf concentrations 1 41 5 42 ng g 1 were lower than those measured in this study 493 428 ng g 1 metabolites and tps are much less studied than their related parent pharmaceuticals table 2 stülten et al 2008 detected 4 oh dcf and 5oh dcf in wwtp effluents in germany at concentrations higher than the levels measured in this study up to 0 71 µg l 1 and 0 45 µg l 1 respectively in their study of a canadian river miao metcalfe 2003 did not detect 3oh cbz or cbz epox in any sample but determined concentrations of trans cbz of 2 2 0 3 ng l 1 much lower than those measured in this study koba et al 2018 detected cbz epox and trans cbz in a lagoon water at concentrations up to 71 ng l 1 lower than in this study and 490 ng l 1 higher than in this study respectively and in the sediment at concentrations lower than the limit of quantification finally aubertheau et al 2017 detected cbz epox in the vienne river biofilms with a maximal concentration estimated at 5 3 ng g 1 which is lower than those determined in this study the distributions observed for the different compartments can be explained by several parameters conditions which probably interact between them first the contamination of biofilms sediments and clams depends on the compounds carried by water however the composition of water can change rapidly ort et al 2010 while that of solid matrices is constrained by sorption desorption kinetics gonzalez et al 2012 therefore concentrations measured in water samples represent an image of the contamination over a short period of time while those determined in solid matrices are the result of accumulation over a certain exposure period this could explain the significant difference observed in the distribution of compounds in water compared to the other matrices especially for the dcf family for which sediments and biofilms are characterized by a larger presence of benz in comparison with water the differences are less significant for cbz and its metabolites and tps especially between water and sediment but some compounds like dibenz may have significant variations in distributions another important parameter to consider is the partitioning of molecules which is generally linked to their hydrophobicity expressed via the octanol water partition coefficient kow kow is frequently used to predict the adsorption of pollutants to solids and thus their bioaccumulation rogers 1996 provided a general rule for the application of kow to the estimation of sorption a log kow lower than 2 5 indicates a low sorption potential a log kow between 2 5 and 4 indicates a medium sorption potential and a log kow greater than 4 a high sorption potential therefore the significant presence of dcf and its metabolites and tps in benthic organisms biofilms clams is consistent with their higher log kow those compounds are more hydrophobic than cbz and its metabolites and tps which exhibit higher levels in water and sediments dibenz presents an exception log kow 4 06 and this is reflected in its high accumulation in biofilms finally the presence of metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment is also linked to pharmaceutical compounds degradation pathways for example phototransformation is the main degradation pathway for dcf in the environment boreen et al 2003 and it takes place rapidly t1 2 9 6 1 2 h poirier larabie et al 2016 with benz identified as the most stable product eriksson et al 2010 this could explain the low proportion of dcf compared to its metabolites and tps moreover it is worth noting that benz is more abundant in matrices exposed to sunlight biofilms sediments than in clams flesh cbz on the other hand is known to be persistent in the environment loos et al 2009 this compound is one of the least degraded eliminated in wastewater treatment processes 32 7 17 9 luo et al 2014 0 23 jekel et al 2015 but leads to the formation of dibenz and acrid kosjek et al 2009 these properties may explain the similarity between the distributions 3 2 individual compounds ecotoxicities ecotoxicity of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps was assessed for three different aquatic trophic levels algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata invertebrates daphnia magna and fish pimephales promelas figure 4 values obtained from the qsar toolbox highlight that dcf and its metabolites and tps benz and oh dcf have similar toxicities towards green algae ec50 6 01 mg l 1 for d magna oh dcf lc50 2 3 mg l 1 is found to be about 40 times more toxic than dcf lc50 80 1 mg l 1 while an abnormally high ec50 value was found for benz 2 88 1015 mg l 1 demonstrating the actual limitations of qsar models to predict the toxicity of all compounds for all organisms boxall et al 2004 benz is 4 times more toxic lc50 2 71 mg l 1 for p promelas than its parent compound lc50 11 2 mg l 1 while oh dcf has the same toxicity than dcf lc50 10 7 mg l 1 in the cbz family dibenz stands out from all the other compounds being the most toxic for the three studied species the other metabolites and tps exhibit toxicities that are slightly higher of the same order of magnitude or lower than that of the parent compound hence for green algae 3oh cbz is as toxic as cbz ec50 19 55 mg l 1 while the other compounds are 10 to 70 times less toxic likewise for p promelas cbz epox exhibits an lc50 value of the same order of magnitude as the parent compound 44 7 mg l 1 while the other metabolites and tps are 3 to 6 times less toxic on the other hand for daphnids 3oh cbz and cbz epox lc50 36 5 mg l 1 are about 3 times more toxic than cbz acrid is as toxic lc50 105 45 mg l 1 and trans cbz 65 times less toxic all these results are in agreement with the study of pereira et al 2020 indeed in their systematic review on the experimental and estimated toxicities of selected pharmaceuticals in different aquatic compartments these authors found that dcf and its metabolite 4oh dcf have similar toxicities to invertebrates and fish in addition they highlighted the higher toxicities of anti inflammatory drugs including dcf as compared to antiepileptics such as cbz however results differ regarding the most sensitive species indeed while in our study results show that green algae is the most sensitive followed by fish and daphnids pereira et al 2020 observed that the most sensitive species were fish followed by invertebrates and algae nevertheless their observation was explained by the fact that part of the experimental data for fish was obtained through cell line or tissue testing making it difficult to extrapolate the values to the entire organism 3 3 mixtures ecotoxicities qsar predictions were also used to assess mixtures ecotoxicities including parent compound and its corresponding metabolites and tps since field data revealed their simultaneous presence in water and benthic organisms biofilms clams figure 4 also reports the predicted toxicities of mixtures of parent compounds with their associated metabolites and tps the results show that the toxicity values of dcf or cbz and their metabolites and tps mixtures are overall in the middle range of the individual values predicted for the compounds thus for pimephales promelas the mixture of cbz and metabolites and tps lc50 41 5 mg l 1 is approximately 12 times less toxic than dibenz alone lc50 3 27 mg l 1 however the mixture is 3 to 5 times more toxic than the other metabolites and tps when considered individually according to the qsar model the mixture s toxicity is lower than cbz s individual toxicity for pimephales promelas 41 5 mg l 1 versus 37 3 mg l 1 and especially for the algae p subcapitata 37 mg l 1 versus 10 4 mg l 1 on the contrary the model predicts a higher toxicity of the mixture for daphnids this highlights the importance of completing experimental ecotoxicological data to confirm mixture effects and hence the interest of considering metabolites and tps along with their associated parent pharmaceutical compounds in the assessment of ecological risks it is now known that effects resulting from the exposure to a mixture of organic contaminants can be very different from observations when evaluating the toxicity of a single compound as it was already demonstrated for endocrine disruptors for example filby et al 2007 sumpter johnson 2005 until now few studies have been interested in this mixture effect with many pharmaceutical compounds and even less with metabolites and tps cleuvers 2003 showed that a mixture of cbz and a lipid lowering agent clofibric acid exhibited a higher toxicity than the single compounds at the same concentration during immobilization tests of d magna the same author cleuvers 2004 observed acute toxicity of a mixture of anti inflammatories including dcf at lower concentrations than for the individual chemicals wang et al 2020 were the first to develop a qsar model to predict mixture ecotoxicities of fluoroquinolone antibiotics with their photodegradation products for escherichia coli their results showed that the mixture toxicity of fluoroquinolones derivatives is a concentration addition of their individual toxicities qin et al 2018 developed a qsar model to predict acute mixture ecotoxicities of two antibiotics and four pesticides towards aliivibrio fischeri the 45 studied mixtures exhibited additive synergistic and antagonistic effects the authors also showed that compared to traditional concentration additive and independent action models their qsar model better predicted mixture toxicities 3 4 comparison with pesticide metabolites ecotoxicity values were also predicted for a common pesticide atrazine atz and some of its main metabolites desethylatrazine dea deisopropylatrazine dia desethyldeisopropylatrazine dedia hydroxyatrazine oh atz and aniline to compare with cbz dcf and their metabolites and tps figure 4 atrazine was banned in france in 2001 but is still found in waters and river sediments moreover atz and its metabolite dea are frequently responsible for the downgrading of surface waters or groundwater quality the comparison with atz and its metabolites shows that although dcf and cbz are less toxic to the three species of interest than this pesticide their metabolites and tps exhibit ec50 and lc50 values broadly comparable to those of atz metabolites as mentioned before in france the presence of pesticide residues and their metabolites in waters is regulated by european directive 98 83 ec european council 1998 relating to the quality of waters intended for human consumption this text sets quality limits at 0 1 µg l 1 per individual substance and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum water quality controls are increasingly revealing situations where regulatory quality limits are exceeded for metabolites thus the french directorate general of health approached the french agency for food environmental and occupational health safety anses to define a methodology for identifying relevant metabolites anses 2019 considering the possible effects of certain pharmaceutical metabolites and tps this approach should be transposed to identify the most relevant metabolites and tps for human and or environmental health 3 5 risk assessment of target compounds in the studied rivers a methodology was developed to associate both ecotoxicity and persistence data to assess the risk related to the presence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in the sampled rivers therefore pnecwater were calculated from the predicted ecotoxicity endpoints for each individual compound as well as for mixtures then hqs were obtained by dividing the mec observed in waters during this study by the pnecwater n b a mixture s mec is expressed as the parent molecule s mass and corresponds to the sum of the individual compounds mecs persistence was evaluated with the ultimate biodegradation index obtained with the episuite biowin3 survey model included in the qsar toolbox environmental protection agency 2012 it should be noted that in this case only biodegradation is considered in the persistence while other processes hydrolysis photolysis etc may also transform degrade the compounds for mixtures the ultimate biodegradation index was obtained by calculating the mixture s constituents indexes weighted average biodegradation indexes vary between 2 25 and 2 75 for the cbz and dcf metabolites and tps which means half life of a few weeks to a few months with the exception of trans cbz between 2 75 and 3 25 that presents a slightly faster biodegradation than the other molecules figure 5 provides a classification of compounds according to their associated risk hq for the studied rivers and their biodegradation index target compounds can be divided in 4 groups 1 compounds already worrying regarding their persistence and their high concentrations oh dcf benz and dibenz these compounds have an hq lower than 1 qualified as medium risk for aquatic organisms and are therefore of concern only when compared to the other studied compounds the same applies for the notion of persistence in water 2 compounds to watch out for because of their persistence in the dissolved phase these molecules could become of concern if their levels tend to increase dcf cbz 3oh cbz cbz epox and acrid 3 compounds to watch out for because of how far they have exceeded the pnecwater no compound identified in this study and 4 compounds not of concern including compounds with a level of contamination below pnecwater hq 0 1 and low persistence in dissolved phase trans cbz the same methodology was also involved to assess risk regarding the sediment compartment pnecsediment were derived from the pnecwater by the equilibrium partitioning method the koc of a mixture is its constituents koc values weighted average the data thus calculated as well as the mec values measured in the sediments of the three sampled rivers were used to deduce the hqs of each compound with respect to benthic organisms figure 6 presents the classification of compounds according to their associated risk in the sediments of the studied rivers and their biodegradation index consequently oh dcf and benz are classified as compounds already worrying dcf cbz 3oh cbz cbz epox and dibenz are compounds to watch out for group 2 and trans cbz is considered as a compound not of concern comparison between risks in water and sediments suggests that dibenz is of higher concern for aquatic species than for benthic organisms the rest of the compounds present the same risk in sediment and in water in addition the same behaviour is observed for the mixtures in particular that of dcf and its metabolites and tps which is of more concern than the parent compound alone the results also show the importance of considering mixtures and not only the parent compounds as illustrated by the case of dcf indeed this compound considered individually does not seem to represent a risk i e group 2 figures 5 and 6 while its mixture with its metabolites and tps is already worrying for the aquatic environment because of their persistence and their high levels however this remark is not fully generalized since cbz alone and its mixture with metabolites and tps show the same level of risk this finding suggests that it would be necessary to only identify compounds for which it is relevant 4 conclusion unsurprisingly pharmaceutical metabolites and tps have been found in waters sediments biofilms and clams of the studied rivers obviously in varying concentrations but in all samples this widespread distribution and occurrence presumably requires special attention at least as much as the presence of pesticide metabolites indeed the use of qsar models made it possible to address the lack of experimental ecotoxicological data and to highlight that some of cbz or dcf metabolites and tps could be more toxic than their parent compounds for aquatic species thus oh dcf benz and dibenz could represent a risk for aquatic wildlife because of their relatively high hazard quotients and their relatively slow biodegradation the large number of possible metabolites and tps and the possibility of individual toxicity also raises questions about a cocktail effect indeed compounds may have unpredictable biochemical interactions when considered in a mixture resulting in different cumulative or not effects than individual molecules as shown by qsar predictions of mixtures it appears that the risk for the aquatic environment is higher when one considers dcf along with its metabolites and tps nevertheless our results also show that this is not generalizable for all parent compounds e g cbz consequently it is urgent to identify the most relevant metabolites and tps as is done for pesticides to better prioritize risk assessment for future works it is important to complete the collected data by conducting sampling campaigns at different times of the year and not only in summer this would help better understand the impact of seasonal variations on pharmaceutical molecules degradation pathways and the presence and distribution of their metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment furthermore it is important to acknowledge that qsar modelling constitutes a first estimation of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps ecotoxicities as well as mixture effects experimental data still need to be generated to confirm these calculations our findings constitute a starting point for further research aimed to determine the risks coming from the presence of pharmaceutical compounds along with their metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment with the purpose of potentially including them in water management policies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17087,with questions emerging on the presence and risks associated with metabolites and transformation products tps of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment progress has been made in terms of monitoring and regulation of pesticide metabolites however less interest is shown for pharmaceutical residues although their pseudo persistence and adverse effects on non target organisms are proven this study provides original knowledge about the contamination of ten sites located along three french rivers water sediments biofilms clams by pharmaceutical metabolites and tps as well as a preliminary environmental risk assessment studied compounds included carbamazepine with five metabolites and tps and diclofenac with three metabolites and tps results show that metabolites and tps are present in all studied compartments with mean concentrations up to 0 52 µg l 1 in water 229 ng g 1 in sediments 2153 ng g 1 in biofilms and 1149 ng g 1 in clams qsar estimations oecd toolbox were involved to predict the studied compounds ecotoxicities qsar models showed that diclofenac and its metabolites and tps could be more toxic than carbamazepine and its metabolites and tps to three aquatic species representing green algae invertebrates and fish however real ecotoxicological effects are still to be determined the environmental risk assessment showed that hydroxydiclofenac 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde and dibenzazepine could present a greater risk than other studied compounds for aquatic organisms in addition the risk associated with a mixture of diclofenac and its related metabolites and tps has been found to be greater than that of the compounds considered individually graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products ecotoxicity risk assessment rivers 1 introduction pharmaceuticals enter into rivers mainly through wastewater discharge wastewater treatment plants wwtps or septic tanks and to a lesser extent from livestock daughton ternes 1999 fent et al 2006 these compounds are biologically active and are selected for their specific actions on the human or animal organism therefore an exposure outside the medical or veterinary setting may lead to unwanted effects toxic or disruptive effects on living organisms many studies have already reported developmental disorders in frog tadpoles foster et al 2010 fish feminization petrovic et al 2002 changes in diversity and abundance of microbial communities liebig et al 2010 etc related to the exposure to pharmaceutical residues at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to µg l 1 via the aquatic environment in the long term all these effects could have major consequences on biodiversity and water use bathing drinking water resources in relation to human health e g exposure to endocrine disruptors or resistant pathogenic microorganisms amarasiri et al 2020 gonsioroski et al 2020 in the environment pharmaceuticals are found not only as active molecules i e parent compounds but also as metabolites and biotic or abiotic transformation products tps patel et al 2019 pharmaceuticals are first transformed in the human or animal body after uptake they are partially metabolized into more polar and soluble forms pharmacologically active or not by a variety of oxidative and conjugative enzymes glucuronide conjugation sulfoconjugation acetylation amino acid conjugation glutathione conjugation and methylation jančová šiller 2012 these transformations facilitate their elimination through urine and faeces other transformation pathways occur in wastewaters during their treatment in wwtps pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites are transformed by biodegradation and physicochemical reactions e g hydrolytic cleavage of amide bonds ether cleavage demethylation hydroxylation during secondary treatment quintana et al 2005 barra caracciolo et al 2015 once released in the environment pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites are further transformed by direct photodegradation initiated by sunlight or indirect photodegradation in the presence of free radicals or singlet oxygen generated by the action of uv rays on natural organic matter andreozzi et al 2003 chemical hydrolysis and oxydo reduction reactions can also lead to their transformation as a function of ph and temperature another main transformation route in the aquatic environment involves biodegradation by different families of microorganisms if the molecules toxicities do not inhibit microbial activity barra caracciolo et al 2015 while the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in natural waters has been demonstrated since the 1980s patel et al 2019 many studies report an accumulation of these contaminants in other aquatic compartments kümmerer 2004 thus sediments can accumulate pharmaceutical compounds or their metabolites and tps li et al 2014 tamtam et al 2011 but also favor microbial degradation processes kunkel radke 2008 several studies have reported significant accumulation of pharmaceuticals in benthic organisms river biofilms aubertheau et al 2017 huerta et al 2016 and invertebrates burket et al 2019 de solla et al 2016 du et al 2015 xie et al 2019 as well as in fish brooks et al 2005 huerta et al 2013 xie et al 2019 only aquatic plants seem not to accumulate these compounds or only weakly wilkinson et al 2018 such a widespread presence of pharmaceuticals makes it evident that metabolites and tps of pharmaceutical residues could also be present in many of these compartments the issue is all the more important because metabolites and tps can exhibit toxicity to living organisms which can be lower similar or even higher than the parent compounds bleeker et al 1999 bort et al 1999 bourgeois wad 1984 schulze et al 2010 however the risks associated with these metabolites and tps as well as their presence in the environment are still very little studied due to their very large number and the absence of analytical standards for their quantification questioning relating to the presence of organic contaminants metabolites and tps in natural waters and drinking water are emerging more and more worldwide this is largely due to the knowledge gained on pesticide metabolites and their incidence on health in france and other european countries the presence of pesticide residues and their metabolites in water intended for human consumption is regulated by council directive 98 83 ec which sets quality limits for pesticides and their relevant metabolites of 0 1 µg l 1 per individual substance and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum of these molecules european council 1998 to date no regulation relating to the quality of natural waters includes pharmaceutical residues however six molecules or families of molecules 17 alpha ethinylestradiol 17 beta estradiol estrone macrolide antibiotics amoxicillin ciprofloxacin are included on the watch list of substances for union wide monitoring established in 2018 by implementing decision eu 2018 840 european commission 2018 the issue of risk assessment is today very important because of the rise of all sorts of emerging pollutants that form an environmental soup of a multitude of compounds in large majority at low concentrations indeed it has been shown that organic pollutants may have unpredictable biochemical interactions when mixed together leading to different effects of what might be observed when evaluating the toxicity of a single molecule filby et al 2007 sumpter johnson 2005 the present work draws up a first assessment of the contamination of the aquatic environment by pharmaceutical metabolites and tps thus two iconic pharmaceutical compounds carbamazepine cbz and diclofenac dcf and eight of their associated metabolites and tps were quantified in water sediments biofilms and clams corbicula fluminea from rivers of western france then the qsar toolbox oecd european chemicals agency 2020 was used to predict the missing toxicity data for these compounds considered individually or in mixtures this allowed a first environmental risk assessment in french waters and sediments and then to open the discussion about the relevance of considering pharmaceutical metabolites and tps for future guidelines and regulations 2 material and methods 2 1 target compounds carbamazepine diclofenac and the metabolites and tps considered in this work are presented in table 1 analytical grade standards of carbamazepine cbz 3 hydroxycarbamazepine 3oh cbz 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz epox dibenzazepine dibenz acridone acrid diclofenac dcf 4 hydroxydiclofenac 4 oh dcfbz and 5 hydroxydiclofenac 5oh dcf were purchased from sigma aldrich darmstadt germany while standards of 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans dihydroxycarbamazepine trans cbz and 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde benz were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology heidelberg germany and synchem ug co kg altenburg germany respectively individual stock solutions were prepared in lc ms grade methanol carlo erba reagents val de reuil france at 200 mg l 1 and stored at 20 c 2 2 study area and sampling strategy a sampling campaign was conducted in september 2018 along three rivers vienne clain and thouet located in the same part of western france north of the vienne and south of the deux sèvres french departments figure 1 their watersheds present close rural urban occupation agricultural socio economic activities and hydro climatic conditions they are typical of this part of france the sampling took place at the end of summer during the low water flow period thus facilitating accessibility to the studied compartments ten different sampling sites were selected based on their location upstream or downstream from urban areas figure 1 on each site a surface of 20 m2 was prospected to collect samples of all four compartments of interest thus 2 l of water were grab sampled in a high density polyethylene pehd bottle biofilms were collected from ten rocks chosen randomly at a depth of 50 to 100 cm for that rock surface was scrapped with a clean toothbrush and ultrapure water milli q iq 7000 merck kgaa darmstadt

performance was assessed via linearity limits of detection and quantification repeatability and reproducibility according to the french afnor xp t90 210 standard afnor 1999 detailed methods are presented in si 6 and table si 7 all limits of detection and quantification are summarized in table si 8 2 5 metabolites and tps ecotoxicity 2 5 1 prediction of ecotoxicity data ecotoxicity data of pharmaceutical metabolites or transformation products are often rare or even not available at all for this reason the oecd quantitative structure activity relationship qsar toolbox version 4 4 was used to generate environmental toxicity endpoints this toolbox was developed by the laboratory of mathematical chemistry oasis lmc bourgas bulgaria for the oecd in collaboration with the european chemicals agency echa its main objective is to use qsar methodologies to group chemicals into categories depending on their structure and or modes of action this helps to fill data gaps for a given compound based on the data available for its analogues by read across used for qualitative endpoints trend analysis used for quantitative endpoints if a high number of analogues with experimental results are identified or qsar models blázquez et al 2020 determined the acute toxicity for aquatic organisms of a biocidal active substance and its metabolites to assess the suitability of available qsar models to predict the obtained values the advantages of the oecd qsar toolbox were also detailed by schultz et al 2018 in this study the trend analysis approach was used to estimate acute toxicities of individual compounds with respect to the green algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ec50 growth rate 96 h the invertebrate daphnia magna lc50 mortality 48 h and the fish pimephales promelas lc50 mortality 96 h this approach involves modeling the relationship between the considered toxicity endpoint and a physicochemical property by default the log kow using the experimental data available for the compound s analogues the toxicity estimations obtained for the individual molecules were also used for the prediction of the acute toxicity of a mixture of parent molecule and its associated metabolites and tps respecting the molar fractions observed from the average concentrations measured in the studied waters oecd 2020 for the two mixtures considered cbz and its metabolites and tps dcf and its metabolites and tps it appears that the compounds exhibit different modes of action according to the acute aquatic toxicity classification by verhaar modified the ecosar ecosar is the ecological structure activity relationships predictive model developed by the us epa classification for aquatic toxicity and the acute aquatic toxicity modes of action classification by oasis oasis is the laboratory that developed the qsar toolbox consequently trend analysis calculations were performed considering an independent modes of action approach oecd 2020 2 5 2 environmental risk assessment according to the echa guidelines european chemicals agency 2008 experimental or calculated toxicity endpoints cannot be directly used for an environmental risk assessment because natural conditions are different than laboratory test conditions indeed ecosystems are more sensitive to chemical compounds than individual organisms in a laboratory environment for this reason these endpoints lc50 or ec50 are used for the estimation of predicted no effect concentrations in water pnecwater pnecwater are obtained by dividing the lowest ecotoxicity value by an appropriate assessment factor the scarcer the available data the higher is the applied assessment factor in this study only short term toxicity data were available the estimation of effects on organisms throughout their life cycle was therefore less realistic than with long term data hence a high assessment factor of 1000 was applied european chemicals agency 2008 then the hazard quotient hq was calculated by dividing the maximal environmental concentration mec measured in water by the calculated pnecwater when the hq is less than 0 1 the concerned compound does not present any risk for aquatic organisms an hq between 0 1 and 1 indicates a medium risk while a value above 1 means that the studied molecule exhibits a high risk for the aquatic ecosystem straub 2002 for the sediment no ecotoxicity parameter could be predicted by the qsar toolbox therefore the equilibrium partitioning method epm described in the european chemicals bureau technical guidance document european chemicals bureau 2003 was used to derive a pnecsediment from the pnecwater thus p n e c s e d i m e n t 0 783 0 0217 k o c p n e c w a t e r where k o c represents the organic carbon water partition coefficient hence providing an estimate of the ability of a compound to be adsorbed on the organic matter of the sediment indeed a log koc greater than 3 indicates potentially significant adsorption on the sediment tissier et al 2005 therefore the pnecsediment value is associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment the mec is expressed in micrograms of pollutant per gram of dry sediment without consideration of organic carbon content which is of 1 on average for this study s sediments for the calculation of hq the corrected mec was used to consider the part of organic carbon present in the sediment 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in rivers all studied metabolites and tps and their parent compounds were found in all samples from the three rivers this finding highlights the large occurrence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment figure 2 and figure 3 show mean concentrations standard deviation of dcf and cbz with their associated metabolites and tps in waters biofilms sediments and clams n b full data are presented in table si 9 for the cbz family mean concentrations in water range from 0 18 0 09 µg l 1 for trans cbz to 0 52 0 13 µg l 1 for cbz in biofilms concentrations are between 258 181 ng g 1 for trans cbz and 1735 811 ng g 1 for dibenz in sediments concentrations are between 48 25 ng g 1 for 3oh cbz and 128 56 ng g 1 for dibenz finally in clams levels range from 345 218 ng g 1 for trans cbz to 1066 566 ng g 1 for acrid these results show that mean concentrations of dibenz are higher than those of cbz in most matrices acrid is also found at levels close to those of cbz the other metabolites and tps are generally less concentrated for the dcf family the data show that metabolites and tps are more concentrated than the parent compound thus mean concentrations in waters range from 0 19 0 27 µg l 1 for benz to 0 26 0 15 µg l 1 for oh dcf in biofilms levels vary from 348 349 ng g 1 for dcf to 2153 1532 ng g 1 for benz in sediments concentrations range from 51 55 ng g 1 for dcf to 229 250 ng g 1 for benz finally in clams concentrations are between 493 428 ng g 1 for dcf and 1149 916 ng g 1 for oh dcf it is worth noting that cbz and its metabolites and tps are generally present at higher concentrations than dcf and its metabolites and tps in water and sediments while dcf and its metabolites and tps are more accumulated than cbz and its metabolites and tps in biofilms especially benz and clams as shown in table 2 in waters cbz concentrations are close to the levels determined by koba et al 2018 in a czech pond used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater effluent 290 560 ng l 1 but higher than the concentrations measured by du et al 2014 in a watercourse impacted by wwtp releases in central texas united states 370 14 ng l 1 dcf levels are of the same order of magnitude as those determined by koba et al 2018 22 870 ng l 1 or by wilkinson et al 2017 in three rivers of southern england 0 96 253 ng l 1 but higher than those measured by du et al 2014 86 55 ng l 1 then in biofilms the levels of cbz are higher than those measured by aubertheau et al 2017 in the vienne river for example at the downstream site of the châtellerault wwtp the cbz concentration in this study is 1095 28 ng g 1 while in the study by aubertheau et al 2017 it was 583 5 ng g 1 likewise for the dcf concentration which amounts to 64 26 ng g 1 at the downstream site of the châtellerault wwtp in this study and to 37 2 ng g 1 in the study by aubertheau et al 2017 in addition in sediments koba et al 2018 determined much lower levels of cbz 5 1 16 ng g 1 and dcf 2 6 30 ng g 1 finally cbz was not detected in clams from taihu lake in china xie et al 2015 and dcf concentrations 1 41 5 42 ng g 1 were lower than those measured in this study 493 428 ng g 1 metabolites and tps are much less studied than their related parent pharmaceuticals table 2 stülten et al 2008 detected 4 oh dcf and 5oh dcf in wwtp effluents in germany at concentrations higher than the levels measured in this study up to 0 71 µg l 1 and 0 45 µg l 1 respectively in their study of a canadian river miao metcalfe 2003 did not detect 3oh cbz or cbz epox in any sample but determined concentrations of trans cbz of 2 2 0 3 ng l 1 much lower than those measured in this study koba et al 2018 detected cbz epox and trans cbz in a lagoon water at concentrations up to 71 ng l 1 lower than in this study and 490 ng l 1 higher than in this study respectively and in the sediment at concentrations lower than the limit of quantification finally aubertheau et al 2017 detected cbz epox in the vienne river biofilms with a maximal concentration estimated at 5 3 ng g 1 which is lower than those determined in this study the distributions observed for the different compartments can be explained by several parameters conditions which probably interact between them first the contamination of biofilms sediments and clams depends on the compounds carried by water however the composition of water can change rapidly ort et al 2010 while that of solid matrices is constrained by sorption desorption kinetics gonzalez et al 2012 therefore concentrations measured in water samples represent an image of the contamination over a short period of time while those determined in solid matrices are the result of accumulation over a certain exposure period this could explain the significant difference observed in the distribution of compounds in water compared to the other matrices especially for the dcf family for which sediments and biofilms are characterized by a larger presence of benz in comparison with water the differences are less significant for cbz and its metabolites and tps especially between water and sediment but some compounds like dibenz may have significant variations in distributions another important parameter to consider is the partitioning of molecules which is generally linked to their hydrophobicity expressed via the octanol water partition coefficient kow kow is frequently used to predict the adsorption of pollutants to solids and thus their bioaccumulation rogers 1996 provided a general rule for the application of kow to the estimation of sorption a log kow lower than 2 5 indicates a low sorption potential a log kow between 2 5 and 4 indicates a medium sorption potential and a log kow greater than 4 a high sorption potential therefore the significant presence of dcf and its metabolites and tps in benthic organisms biofilms clams is consistent with their higher log kow those compounds are more hydrophobic than cbz and its metabolites and tps which exhibit higher levels in water and sediments dibenz presents an exception log kow 4 06 and this is reflected in its high accumulation in biofilms finally the presence of metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment is also linked to pharmaceutical compounds degradation pathways for example phototransformation is the main degradation pathway for dcf in the environment boreen et al 2003 and it takes place rapidly t1 2 9 6 1 2 h poirier larabie et al 2016 with benz identified as the most stable product eriksson et al 2010 this could explain the low proportion of dcf compared to its metabolites and tps moreover it is worth noting that benz is more abundant in matrices exposed to sunlight biofilms sediments than in clams flesh cbz on the other hand is known to be persistent in the environment loos et al 2009 this compound is one of the least degraded eliminated in wastewater treatment processes 32 7 17 9 luo et al 2014 0 23 jekel et al 2015 but leads to the formation of dibenz and acrid kosjek et al 2009 these properties may explain the similarity between the distributions 3 2 individual compounds ecotoxicities ecotoxicity of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps was assessed for three different aquatic trophic levels algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata invertebrates daphnia magna and fish pimephales promelas figure 4 values obtained from the qsar toolbox highlight that dcf and its metabolites and tps benz and oh dcf have similar toxicities towards green algae ec50 6 01 mg l 1 for d magna oh dcf lc50 2 3 mg l 1 is found to be about 40 times more toxic than dcf lc50 80 1 mg l 1 while an abnormally high ec50 value was found for benz 2 88 1015 mg l 1 demonstrating the actual limitations of qsar models to predict the toxicity of all compounds for all organisms boxall et al 2004 benz is 4 times more toxic lc50 2 71 mg l 1 for p promelas than its parent compound lc50 11 2 mg l 1 while oh dcf has the same toxicity than dcf lc50 10 7 mg l 1 in the cbz family dibenz stands out from all the other compounds being the most toxic for the three studied species the other metabolites and tps exhibit toxicities that are slightly higher of the same order of magnitude or lower than that of the parent compound hence for green algae 3oh cbz is as toxic as cbz ec50 19 55 mg l 1 while the other compounds are 10 to 70 times less toxic likewise for p promelas cbz epox exhibits an lc50 value of the same order of magnitude as the parent compound 44 7 mg l 1 while the other metabolites and tps are 3 to 6 times less toxic on the other hand for daphnids 3oh cbz and cbz epox lc50 36 5 mg l 1 are about 3 times more toxic than cbz acrid is as toxic lc50 105 45 mg l 1 and trans cbz 65 times less toxic all these results are in agreement with the study of pereira et al 2020 indeed in their systematic review on the experimental and estimated toxicities of selected pharmaceuticals in different aquatic compartments these authors found that dcf and its metabolite 4oh dcf have similar toxicities to invertebrates and fish in addition they highlighted the higher toxicities of anti inflammatory drugs including dcf as compared to antiepileptics such as cbz however results differ regarding the most sensitive species indeed while in our study results show that green algae is the most sensitive followed by fish and daphnids pereira et al 2020 observed that the most sensitive species were fish followed by invertebrates and algae nevertheless their observation was explained by the fact that part of the experimental data for fish was obtained through cell line or tissue testing making it difficult to extrapolate the values to the entire organism 3 3 mixtures ecotoxicities qsar predictions were also used to assess mixtures ecotoxicities including parent compound and its corresponding metabolites and tps since field data revealed their simultaneous presence in water and benthic organisms biofilms clams figure 4 also reports the predicted toxicities of mixtures of parent compounds with their associated metabolites and tps the results show that the toxicity values of dcf or cbz and their metabolites and tps mixtures are overall in the middle range of the individual values predicted for the compounds thus for pimephales promelas the mixture of cbz and metabolites and tps lc50 41 5 mg l 1 is approximately 12 times less toxic than dibenz alone lc50 3 27 mg l 1 however the mixture is 3 to 5 times more toxic than the other metabolites and tps when considered individually according to the qsar model the mixture s toxicity is lower than cbz s individual toxicity for pimephales promelas 41 5 mg l 1 versus 37 3 mg l 1 and especially for the algae p subcapitata 37 mg l 1 versus 10 4 mg l 1 on the contrary the model predicts a higher toxicity of the mixture for daphnids this highlights the importance of completing experimental ecotoxicological data to confirm mixture effects and hence the interest of considering metabolites and tps along with their associated parent pharmaceutical compounds in the assessment of ecological risks it is now known that effects resulting from the exposure to a mixture of organic contaminants can be very different from observations when evaluating the toxicity of a single compound as it was already demonstrated for endocrine disruptors for example filby et al 2007 sumpter johnson 2005 until now few studies have been interested in this mixture effect with many pharmaceutical compounds and even less with metabolites and tps cleuvers 2003 showed that a mixture of cbz and a lipid lowering agent clofibric acid exhibited a higher toxicity than the single compounds at the same concentration during immobilization tests of d magna the same author cleuvers 2004 observed acute toxicity of a mixture of anti inflammatories including dcf at lower concentrations than for the individual chemicals wang et al 2020 were the first to develop a qsar model to predict mixture ecotoxicities of fluoroquinolone antibiotics with their photodegradation products for escherichia coli their results showed that the mixture toxicity of fluoroquinolones derivatives is a concentration addition of their individual toxicities qin et al 2018 developed a qsar model to predict acute mixture ecotoxicities of two antibiotics and four pesticides towards aliivibrio fischeri the 45 studied mixtures exhibited additive synergistic and antagonistic effects the authors also showed that compared to traditional concentration additive and independent action models their qsar model better predicted mixture toxicities 3 4 comparison with pesticide metabolites ecotoxicity values were also predicted for a common pesticide atrazine atz and some of its main metabolites desethylatrazine dea deisopropylatrazine dia desethyldeisopropylatrazine dedia hydroxyatrazine oh atz and aniline to compare with cbz dcf and their metabolites and tps figure 4 atrazine was banned in france in 2001 but is still found in waters and river sediments moreover atz and its metabolite dea are frequently responsible for the downgrading of surface waters or groundwater quality the comparison with atz and its metabolites shows that although dcf and cbz are less toxic to the three species of interest than this pesticide their metabolites and tps exhibit ec50 and lc50 values broadly comparable to those of atz metabolites as mentioned before in france the presence of pesticide residues and their metabolites in waters is regulated by european directive 98 83 ec european council 1998 relating to the quality of waters intended for human consumption this text sets quality limits at 0 1 µg l 1 per individual substance and 0 5 µg l 1 for the sum water quality controls are increasingly revealing situations where regulatory quality limits are exceeded for metabolites thus the french directorate general of health approached the french agency for food environmental and occupational health safety anses to define a methodology for identifying relevant metabolites anses 2019 considering the possible effects of certain pharmaceutical metabolites and tps this approach should be transposed to identify the most relevant metabolites and tps for human and or environmental health 3 5 risk assessment of target compounds in the studied rivers a methodology was developed to associate both ecotoxicity and persistence data to assess the risk related to the presence of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps in the sampled rivers therefore pnecwater were calculated from the predicted ecotoxicity endpoints for each individual compound as well as for mixtures then hqs were obtained by dividing the mec observed in waters during this study by the pnecwater n b a mixture s mec is expressed as the parent molecule s mass and corresponds to the sum of the individual compounds mecs persistence was evaluated with the ultimate biodegradation index obtained with the episuite biowin3 survey model included in the qsar toolbox environmental protection agency 2012 it should be noted that in this case only biodegradation is considered in the persistence while other processes hydrolysis photolysis etc may also transform degrade the compounds for mixtures the ultimate biodegradation index was obtained by calculating the mixture s constituents indexes weighted average biodegradation indexes vary between 2 25 and 2 75 for the cbz and dcf metabolites and tps which means half life of a few weeks to a few months with the exception of trans cbz between 2 75 and 3 25 that presents a slightly faster biodegradation than the other molecules figure 5 provides a classification of compounds according to their associated risk hq for the studied rivers and their biodegradation index target compounds can be divided in 4 groups 1 compounds already worrying regarding their persistence and their high concentrations oh dcf benz and dibenz these compounds have an hq lower than 1 qualified as medium risk for aquatic organisms and are therefore of concern only when compared to the other studied compounds the same applies for the notion of persistence in water 2 compounds to watch out for because of their persistence in the dissolved phase these molecules could become of concern if their levels tend to increase dcf cbz 3oh cbz cbz epox and acrid 3 compounds to watch out for because of how far they have exceeded the pnecwater no compound identified in this study and 4 compounds not of concern including compounds with a level of contamination below pnecwater hq 0 1 and low persistence in dissolved phase trans cbz the same methodology was also involved to assess risk regarding the sediment compartment pnecsediment were derived from the pnecwater by the equilibrium partitioning method the koc of a mixture is its constituents koc values weighted average the data thus calculated as well as the mec values measured in the sediments of the three sampled rivers were used to deduce the hqs of each compound with respect to benthic organisms figure 6 presents the classification of compounds according to their associated risk in the sediments of the studied rivers and their biodegradation index consequently oh dcf and benz are classified as compounds already worrying dcf cbz 3oh cbz cbz epox and dibenz are compounds to watch out for group 2 and trans cbz is considered as a compound not of concern comparison between risks in water and sediments suggests that dibenz is of higher concern for aquatic species than for benthic organisms the rest of the compounds present the same risk in sediment and in water in addition the same behaviour is observed for the mixtures in particular that of dcf and its metabolites and tps which is of more concern than the parent compound alone the results also show the importance of considering mixtures and not only the parent compounds as illustrated by the case of dcf indeed this compound considered individually does not seem to represent a risk i e group 2 figures 5 and 6 while its mixture with its metabolites and tps is already worrying for the aquatic environment because of their persistence and their high levels however this remark is not fully generalized since cbz alone and its mixture with metabolites and tps show the same level of risk this finding suggests that it would be necessary to only identify compounds for which it is relevant 4 conclusion unsurprisingly pharmaceutical metabolites and tps have been found in waters sediments biofilms and clams of the studied rivers obviously in varying concentrations but in all samples this widespread distribution and occurrence presumably requires special attention at least as much as the presence of pesticide metabolites indeed the use of qsar models made it possible to address the lack of experimental ecotoxicological data and to highlight that some of cbz or dcf metabolites and tps could be more toxic than their parent compounds for aquatic species thus oh dcf benz and dibenz could represent a risk for aquatic wildlife because of their relatively high hazard quotients and their relatively slow biodegradation the large number of possible metabolites and tps and the possibility of individual toxicity also raises questions about a cocktail effect indeed compounds may have unpredictable biochemical interactions when considered in a mixture resulting in different cumulative or not effects than individual molecules as shown by qsar predictions of mixtures it appears that the risk for the aquatic environment is higher when one considers dcf along with its metabolites and tps nevertheless our results also show that this is not generalizable for all parent compounds e g cbz consequently it is urgent to identify the most relevant metabolites and tps as is done for pesticides to better prioritize risk assessment for future works it is important to complete the collected data by conducting sampling campaigns at different times of the year and not only in summer this would help better understand the impact of seasonal variations on pharmaceutical molecules degradation pathways and the presence and distribution of their metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment furthermore it is important to acknowledge that qsar modelling constitutes a first estimation of pharmaceutical metabolites and tps ecotoxicities as well as mixture effects experimental data still need to be generated to confirm these calculations our findings constitute a starting point for further research aimed to determine the risks coming from the presence of pharmaceutical compounds along with their metabolites and tps in the aquatic environment with the purpose of potentially including them in water management policies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17088,dissolved black carbon dbc widely found in soil and water environments is likely to affect the transport of nanoplastics in aquatic environments the aggregation and deposition behaviors of fresh and aged polystyrene nanoplastics pss with and without dbc in nacl solution were investigated by time resolved dynamic light scattering dls and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring equipment qcm d techniques the results suggest that dbc can screen the surface charges of pss by interacting with pss through hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions although they were negatively charged dbc promoted the aggregation of pss under relatively low ionic strengths and it minimally affected the stability of pss under high ionic strength deposition experiments showed that both dbc in salt solution and dbc adsorption on silica surface facilitated the deposition of fresh pss while ha inhibited both deposition processes after aging pss were more stable and the effects of dbc and ha were weakened this study investigated the influence mechanism of dbc on the aggregation and deposition behaviors which provides new insights into the stability and transport of

2017 large suspended sediment with sizes of 100 500 mm significantly increased the aggregation and settling of pss with an average diameter of 100 nm while the presence of humic acid ha decreased the heteroaggregation between suspended sediment and pss because of steric repulsion liu hu et al 2019 although previous studies have provided some insights into the heteroaggregation behaviors of nps the mechanisms of heteroaggregation between nps and natural colloids as well as nanoparticles require further investigation black carbon bc an important carbon component of soil and sediment systems has attracted widespread attention in agricultural and environmental fields because of its roles in many related biogeological processes including the transport of contaminants carbon cycling and soil conditioners ouyang zhao et al 2016 qu fu et al 2016 with the rainfall and irrigation bc can release a water soluble fraction called dissolved bc dbc into aquatic environments xu wei et al 2017 which accounts for approximately 10 of dissolved organic carbon in rivers and 2 in oceans globally hopkinson and vallino 2005 dittmar and paeng 2009 dittmar de rezende et al 2012 rudolf jaffé yan ding et al 2013 in addition particulate or nanoparticulate bc might form because of the physical disintegration of bc after aging and weathering in the environment qian zhang et al 2016 in china particulate bc accounted for 13 0 9 and 22 11 of the particulate organic carbon pools in the changjiang and huanghe rivers respectively xu xue et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that dbc exhibits high stability under environmental conditions xu wei et al 2017 xu et al found that dbc is hard to aggregate even at 800 mm na or mg2 solutions because of the strong hydration force xu wei et al 2017 the ccc values of dbc produced at 400 c and 700 c were 700 and 140 mm for na lian yu et al 2019 in addition as dbc has abundant aromatic domains and oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh groups it might exhibit strong affinity to environmental pollutants and soil matrices harvey herbert et al 2011 yao gao et al 2014 lian and xing 2017 alam gorman lewis et al 2018 luo chen et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 considering its high mobility and reactivity dbc is expected to have an impact on the transport and fate of associated contaminants such as nps owing to their high surface to volume ratio and high surface hydrophobicity nps exhibit strong affinities toward a range of hydrophobic organic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and perfluorinated surfactants chua shimeta et al 2014 velzeboer kwadijk et al 2014 huffer and hofmann 2016 liu fokkink et al 2016 liu ma et al 2018 pss have higher adsorption ability to pcbs than polyethylene mps because of the higher aromaticity and surface volume ratio of pss velzeboer kwadijk et al 2014 the π π interactions between pahs and the aromatic polymer ps contributed to the high and nonlinear adsorption liu fokkink et al 2016 with adequate aromatic components dbc might strongly adsorb to the surface of nps via hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions thereby impacting the transport of nps however limited research has investigated the impact of dbc on the transport of pss in aquatic environments in this study to investigate the effect of dbc on the stability and transport of pss the aggregation and deposition behaviors of primary and aged pss with and without dbc or ha were studied first the dls method was applied to study the aggregation behavior of the aggregation kinetics of pss with and without dbc from various sources moreover the qcm d technique was utilized to examine the deposition of individual pss on the sio2 surface the co deposition behavior of dbc and pss on sio2 surface and the deposition of pss on the dbc modified sio2 surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a ps stock solution aqueous suspension with a diameter of 0 05 0 1 µm was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the stock solution had a particle concentration of 2 5 w v i e 25 g l of pss without surface modification prior to the experiments the ps suspension was prepared by diluting the stock solution with ultrapure water to obtain 40 mg l ps a final ps concentration of 10 mg l was used in all experiments which was selected as a representative nanoplastic concentration commonly applied in previous studies liu hu et al 2019 yu shen et al 2019 liu huang et al 2020 wang zhao et al 2021 the ps aging experiments were conducted in an aging chamber equipped with a uv lamp uvc 254 nm 15w a 250 ml suspension of 40 mg l ps was added to a quartz vial and a uv lamp was inserted into the reactor the sample was exposed to uv light for either 12 h or 24 h and stirred constantly to ensure uniform exposure the unaged samples and pss aged for 12 h and 24h named ps0 ps12 and ps24 respectively were stored at 4 8 c before use dbc originating from biochar was prepared by an ultrasonic method luo xu et al 2015 xu wei et al 2017 the detailed procedure is presented in text s1 of the supplementary material different types of dbc were prepared using maize straw biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c and 300 c wood and rice straw biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c as raw materials termed ms5 ms3 wo rs respectively ha was purchased from sigma aldrich cas1415 93 6 and used as a representative aquatic humic substance the total organic carbon toc content of dbc and ha solutions was measured to determine their concentrations the ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha stock solution with a concentration of 10 mg c l were stored at 4 8 c prior to the experiments according to published values of dissolved organic carbon doc and dbc 0 001 3 7 mg c l in aquatic environments ding cawley et al 2014 wagner jaffé et al 2018 the experimental concentrations of dbc and ha were selected as 2 mg l 2 2 characterization of pss and dbc the structural properties and functional groups of unaged and aged pss dbc and ha samples were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir analysis was performed using the kbr tablet method with wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to characterize the surface chemical compositions of these samples qu fu et al 2016 the xps measurements were performed with a phi 5000 versaprobe system ulvac phi japan using monochromatized al kα radiation h ν 1486 6 ev all samples were freeze dried before ftir and xps characterization the hydrodynamic sizes and zeta potentials of pss were measured at 25 c via dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk operated with a hene laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a scattering angle of 90 to determine effect of dbc and ha on the surface charge of pss the zeta potentials of pss with or without dbc and ha were measured over a range of nacl concentrations at ph 7 adjusted by using 0 1 m nacl and hcl each sample was measured in triplicate with 10 runs per measurement 2 3 aggregation kinetics measurements the aggregation kinetics of pss under various solution were determined by time resolved dls measurements using a malvern zetasizer instrument nano zs malvern uk with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a fixed scattering angle of 90 xu ou et al 2020 prior to each measurement the ps samples were sonicated in a water bath for 15 min during the aggregation measurements 1 5 ml of the ps suspension was added to the dls polystyrene cuvette followed by the addition of 1 5 ml of the prepared nacl solution for the aggregation processes in the presence of dbc and ha the pss dbc ha and nacl solutions were mixed in a certain proportion the final concentrations of pss and dbc were 10 mg l and 2 mg toc l respectively the time resolved dls measurements continuously monitored the average hydrodynamic diameter of pss every 30 s for 30 min with no delay between measurements all measurements were conducted in triplicate to increase statistical power for data analysis the aggregation kinetics of pss in the initial stage were evaluated by measuring the initial rate of change in hydrodynamic size dh over time t the initial aggregation rate constant k was proportional to the initial rate of increase in dh and inversely proportional to the initial ps concentration of pss in the suspension m0 equation 1 jiang raliya et al 2016 1 k d d h t d t t 0 m 0 the initial rate of the linear increase of dh for pss with time ddh t dt was determined from t 0 to the time when dh reached 1 5dh0 the value of ddh t dt was calculated using a linear least squares regression analysis the attachment efficiency α applied to characterize the stability of pss was calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions to kf under fast aggregation conditions liu legros et al 2013 2 α k k f d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d

surface purchased from q sense ab was a representative environmental surface qcm d experiments were conducted to monitor changes in the frequency δf of a 5 mhz at cut quartz sensor crystal the qcm sensors were cleaned according to the standard cleaning protocols recommended by the q sense text s2 prior to each deposition experiment the flow rate of the solution was controlled at 0 15 ml min and the experiment was performed at 25 c to investigate the effect of dbc on the deposition behavior of pss on silica surfaces the deposition of individual pss on the sio2 surface the co deposition behavior of dbc and pss on the sio2 surface and the deposition of pss on the dbc modified sio2 surface were examined in each deposition experiment the qcm d system was first pre equilibrated with the desired salt solution to obtain a stable baseline at 0 15 ml min for the first case the prepared ps suspension 10 mg l in desired salt solution was then injected into the crystal chamber to obtain the frequency shift curve for the co deposition process ps suspension 10 mg l with 2 mg c l dbc or ha in the desired salt solution was injected to obtain the frequency shift curve for the last case dbc or ha samples 2 mg c l were first injected to obtain a stable baseline then the desired salt solution was injected to remove the unabsorbed dbc or ha finally the pss in the desired salt solution were injected the continuous increase in the mass of the deposited pss or dbc δm can lead to a shift in the resonance and overtone frequencies δf described by the sauerbrey relationship 3 δ m c δ f n n where n is the overtone number n 3 in this study and c is the crystal constant 17 7 ng hz cm2 when f 5 mhz the initial deposition rate r d quantified by the initial shift of the normalized frequency at a given period was obtained to determine the deposition kinetics chen and elimelech 2006 4 r d d δ f 3 d t 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of pss and dbc the particle size morphology and hydrodynamic size of primary pss and dbc were determined by sem and dls measurements the sem images showed that the average diameter of the pss was 50 nm exhibiting a regular spherical morphology fig s1 dls measurement showed the average hydrodynamic size of pss was 117 8 5 7 nm dls was further used to determine the zeta potential of the pss fig s2 the fresh pss had strong negative surface charge with a ζ potential of 44 4 1 3 mv as measured at 10 mm nacl and ph 7 fig s2 which indicated that the fresh pss were very stable liu hu et al 2019 liu huang et al 2020 after uv radiation the ζ potential of pss barely changed 41 4 3 5 mv for ps12 and 43 3 1 8 mv for ps24 at 10 mm nacl and ph 7 fig s2 which was similar to the results of previous studies liu hu et al 2019 the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss decreased to 98 1 4 1 and 70 9 4 4 nm at 12 and 24 hours after uv irradiation respectively fig s3 ftir and xps were further used to characterize the functional groups and surface elemental composition of fresh and aged pss fig 1 s4 and table s1 for fresh pss typical adsorption peaks were identified at 1500 and 1649 cm 1 that corresponded to c c stretch of aromatic ring and alkene respectively liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 aromatic c h bending contributed to the adsorption peaks at 698 and 831 cm 1 luo chen et al 2019 for ps12 and ps24 the broad adsorption peaks of c o stretching 1600 1755 cm 1 implied the formation of hydrophilic groups after ageing moreover the polarity indexes o n c of ps0 ps12 and ps24 were 0 07 0 11 and 0 18 respectively table s1 suggesting aged ps contained more polar functional groups lian yu et al 2019 liu hu et al 2019 the sem images showed that the morphology of dbc was irregular and the particle size was not uniform or definite fig s1 all dbcs were negatively charged and the ζ potential of dbc generally followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s5 ftir was used to analyze the surface functional groups of the dbc fig 1 the strong absorbance at 3361 1622 1400 1251 and 1120 cm 1 of ms5 suggest that it contained o containing functional groups such as c o c oh and c o groups lian yu et al 2019 additionally the unsaturated aromatic c c stretching at 1560 cm 1 and aromatic c h bending 625 900 cm 1 indicated the abundance of aromatics luo chen et al 2019 similarly ftir also indicated that the presence of o containing functional groups and aromatic components in ms3 wo rs and ha fig 1 the polarity indexes of ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 0 45 0 50 0 37 0 42 0 45 respectively and almost followed wo rs ms5 ha ms3 table s1 additionally the ζ potential of pss in the presence of ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha in a range of nacl concentrations were measured fig s2 interestingly the addition of a certain amount of dbc reduced the ζ potential of pss both the dbc and ps were negatively charged fig s5 but a decrease in the negative charge on the pss was observed in this study owing to the abundance of o containing groups and aromatic constituents of dbc other interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and π π interactions may overcome electrostatic repulsion resulting in the adsorption of dbc onto the ps surface thus the partial charge of pss was shielded by bc molecule distributed unevenly on the ps surface the ζ potential increased more when the concentration of added dbc ms5 was higher which indicated the spatial shielding of the surface charge was enhanced in addition the ζ potential of pss in the presence 2 mg c l ms5 ms3 wo rs almost followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s2 however the ζ potential of pss remained almost constant in the presence of ha fig s2 previous study also reported that ha had little or no effect on the surface charge of pss liu huang et al 2020 3 2 aggregation behaviors of pss 3 2 1 dbc enhanced aggregation of fresh pss dbc had a different refractive index and the dls signal was mainly derived from pss as the solution contained more small pss to identify the effect mechanism of dbc on the aggregation kinetics of fresh pss 1 2 and 5 mg c l ms5 2 mg c l ms3 wo and rs were selected to conduct the aggregation experiments fig 2 shows the change of hydrodynamic size of fresh ps0 with time after the addition of dbc at different concentrations at several selected nacl concentrations as observed all dbc appeared to increase the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss to a certain extent under 200 mm nacl solution taking ms5 as an example with the increase in dbc concentration the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss increased more obviously particularly after adding 5 mg c l dbc the particle size increased significantly to 600 nm within 30 min while individual ps0 maintained high stability in 200 mm nacl solution the sem images reveal that ps0 were partially connected implying that aggregation was not obvious in this case fig s6a however parts of the ps0 attached to the dbc surface and clustered together fig s6b in the presence of dbc therefore dbc was conducive to the aggregation of ps0 to some extent according to the change in the ζ potential of the pss in fig s2 the reduced electrostatic repulsion was responsible for the increased aggregation of pss however when the ionic strength exceeded 400 mm the positive effect of dbc on pss aggregation weakened and even disappeared the sem images also indicated that pss significantly aggregated in 500 mm nacl solution compared to low ionic strength fig s6c although dbc can form heretoaggregates with some pss only a minimal effect on the average aggregate size was observed fig s7d thus the presence of dbc is not significantly influential on the hydrodynamic size of pss under high salt concentrations which is attributed to the low stability of individual pss and the limited impact of dbc the aggregation efficiency of pss with or without ms5 under various salt concentrations was used to further quantify the aggregation kinetics of pss fig 3 a the initial stage when the aggregation efficiency of pss increased with an increase in ionic strength was called the reaction limited stage which basically conformed to the dlvo theory huangfu ma et al 2019 huangfu xu et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 under high ionic strength the adsorption efficiency was close to 1 and remained almost constant indicating that the energy barrier was completely shielded and the aggregation rate reached its maximum this process is known as the diffusion limited stage liu hu et al 2019 shams alam et al 2020 the ionic strength corresponding to the transition from the reaction limited stage to the diffusion limited stage is called the ccc which is usually used to evaluate the particle stability under different environmental conditions liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 the ccc value of pss measured in this study was approximately 585 mm nacl which was close to the ccc values reported in other papers cai hu et al 2018 liu hu et al 2019 wu jiang et al 2019 yu shen et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 the ccc values of pss in the presence of 1 2 and 5 mg l ms5 were 560 mm 520 mm and 485 mm respectively which were lower than those of individual pss fig 3a this suggests that dbc can destabilize pss to some extent and this destabilization ability is positively correlated with the dbc concentration generally the increase in dbc concentration screened the surface charges of pss because of the hydrophobic interaction and π π interaction between them as a result dbc may act as a bridge between pss and promote the aggregation of pss some scholars also reported that the addition of a certain concentration of dbc could neutralize the surface charge and thus promote the aggregation of iron oxide colloidal particles because of the opposite charge between dbc and iron oxide colloidal particles lian yu et al 2019 however in this study we found that there was a similar bridging effect although both dbc and pss were negatively charged 3 2 2 comparison of ha and different dbc dbc is an important carbon component of doc in aquatic environments armanious aeppli et al 2014 wagner jaffé et al 2018 lian yu et al 2019 to distinguish the role of dbc and natural organic matter in the aggregation of nanoplastics the aggregation kinetics of fresh pss with 2 mg c l ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were investigated fig 3b shows the hydrodynamic size shift curves of pss with 2 mg l dbc or ha under a range of nacl concentrations for examples fig 2 individual ps0 and ps0 with 2 mg c l ha remained stable while 2 mg c l dbc significantly increase the hydrodynamic size of pss in 200 mm nacl solution this means that there was an obvious difference between dbc and ha in controlling the aggregation of ps0 in nacl solutions fig 3b shows the aggregation efficiency of ps0 with or without 2 mg l dbc and ha at various nacl concentrations the ccc values of pss in the presence of 2 mg l ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 520 mm 550 mm 515 mm 500 mm and 1200 mm respectively notably the presence of dbc promoted the aggregation of pss whereas ha strongly stabilized ps0 additionally the four dbc samples exhibited different extents of aggregation effects on the ps0 in nacl solutions the physicochemical properties of dbc from different sources may play an important role in dominating the processes for example the promotion effect of ms3 produced by low temperature pyrolysis of maize straw was the weakest which was likely related to its higher hydrophilicity and more negative zeta potential compared with other dbc produced at high temperatures table s1 and fig s5 thus the presence of ms3 insignificantly affected the stability of ps0 generally the positive effect of dbc on ps0 aggregation likely resulted from the electrical double layer compression mechanism as discussed above fig s2 the presence of dbc screened the negative charges of ps0 due to the binding of dbc because of the different physicochemical characteristics of different the zeta potential of ps0 in the presence of dbc followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s2 which is consistent with the change rule of ccc values in contrast to dbc the adsorption of ha on the ps0 surface slightly changed the surface charges of ps0 fig s2 which reflects the findings of previous studies liu huang et al 2020 most studies implied that the ha molecules absorbed on the ps0 surface can produce steric repulsion and therefore strongly enhance the stability of ps0 liu huang et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 3 2 3 effect on the aggregation of aged pss as previously mentioned hydrophobic pss can absorb dbc and ha to varying degrees either by promoting or inhibiting their aggregation environmental pss are likely to undergo the aging process dbc and ha may have distinct effects on the aggregation of aged pss fig s7 and s8 show the hydrodynamic size shift curves of ps12 and ps24 in the presence of 2 mg l dbc and ha under a range of nacl concentrations after uv radiation ps12 and ps24 contained more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups that could form hydrogen bonds with water resulting in higher stability than ps0 table s1 cai hu et al 2018 liu hu et al 2019 notably the hydrodynamic size of ps24 with and without dbc and ha barely changed even in 1000 mm nacl solution fig s8 fig 3c describes the aggregation efficiency of ps12 with or without 2 mg l dbc and ha at various nacl concentrations the ccc value of ps12 was 700 mm nacl which was similar to the ccc values reported in previous studies liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 studies also suggested that enhanced electrostatic repulsion due to deprotonation of o containing functional groups as well as steric hindrance between formed molecules on aged ps surfaces were responsible for the stability of aged pss liu hu et al 2019 in this study there was no significant difference in zeta potential between aged pss and fresh pss fig s2 thus the enhanced stability of aged pss may be attributed to the enhanced hydration repulsion xu wei et al 2017 liu hu et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 in addition the effects of dbc and ha on the aggregation of aged pss were different from those of the fresh pss notably the ccc value of ps12 in the presence of ha was 1100 mm which was slightly lower than that of ps0 in the presence of ha fig 3b and 3c hence the inhibitory effect of ha on the aggregation of aged pss was not as strong as ps0 is more hydrophobic it can absorb ha more easily than hydrophilic ps12 the steric repulsion derived from the adsorbed ha layer was the primary mechanism of enhanced ps0 stability liu huang et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 therefore the weak interaction between ha and aged pss was likely responsible for the reduced inhibitory effect of ha similarly while dbc promoted the aggregation of ps12 to some extent the effect was not significant fig s7 and 3c 3 3 deposition behaviors of pss 3 3 1 influence of dbc and ha to explore the influence of dbc or ha on the deposition behavior of fresh pss on environmental surface we studied the co deposition behavior of dbc or ha and ps0 on a representative sio2 surface as well as the deposition behavior of ps0 on the surface of sio2 coated with dbc fig 4 fig 4a and s9 show the representative frequency shift curve of individual ps0 deposited on the silica surface 50 mm the deposition process of ps0 can lead to an obvious frequency shift the initial deposition rate was 3 52 0 31 hz min indicating that the deposition behavior can occur under low ionic strengths fig 4b and s9 represents the representative frequency shift curves of ps0 deposited on the sio2 surface in the presence of 2 mg c l dbc and ha after adding 2 mg l of dbc the frequency shift was more obvious than that of individual ps0 while the addition of ha inhibited this process the initial deposition rates when adding ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 5 84 0 25 4 05 0 14 7 23 0 42 5 45 0 11 and 2 60 0 10 hz min fig 5 a similar to the aggregation experiments the adsorption of dbc on ps0 surface reduced the surface charge of ps0 fig s2 resulting in a decrease the electrostatic repulsion between ps0 and the silica surface the promotion effect of different dbc generally followed wo rs ms5 ms3 which is in agreement with the zeta potential of pss in the presence of dbc fig s2 in contrast the presence of ha prevented the deposition of ps0 due to the additional steric repulsion other publications have also reported that ha can limit the deposition of several engineered nanoparticles such as mno2 fullerene quantum dots and silver nanoparticles qu alvarez et al 2012 furman usenko et al 2013 quevedo olsson et al 2013 huangfu ma et al 2019 the deposition process of ps0 on the dbc or ha coated silica surface fig 4c and s9 was further studied to investigate the impact of dbc or ha adsorbed on the environmental surface after pre depositing 2 mg c l dbc on silica surface there was a significant frequency shift when ps0 was added fig s9 the deposition experiment can provide information about the affinity of ps0 to the surface and such a large deposition rate suggested there was a strong interaction between ps0 and dbc although both were negatively charged which may be attributed to the strong hydrophobic and π π interactions between ps0 and the aromatic component of dbc in this case dbc deposited on surface was likely to act as a bridge mediating the deposition of ps0 on the silica surface this bridging effect of dbc was similar to the dbc mediated contact between ps0 in the aggregation experiment fig 2 several studies have reported increased nanoparticle deposition by surface immobilized macromolecules including c60 deposition on alginate and eps coated silica surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 tong ding et al 2010 and nmno2 on a protein bovine serum albumin coated silica surface in monovalent electrolyte solutions huangfu ma et al 2019 which was likely attributed to the hydrophobic effect of these macromolecules in this study the adsorption of dbc on the surface of the silica surface may provide more hydrophobic binding sites for pss in contrast the coating of ha impeded ps0 deposition due to additional steric repulsion qu alvarez et al 2012 furman usenko et al 2013 with the increase in nacl concentration e g 100 and 200 mm the deposition rate of ps0 with or without dbc and ha increased due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion fig 5a and 5b quevedo olsson et al 2013 xu ou et al 2020 however the cases differed with further increases in salt concentration at high ionic strength e g 500 mm the deposition rates of both individual ps0 and ps0 with dbc dramatically decreased this was attributed to the reduced mass transfer rate due to the aggregation the particles and many publications have reported on this diffusion limited transport mechanism qu alvarez et al 2012 huangfu ma et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 in the diffusion limited stage neither dbc in solution nor dbc adsorbed on the silica surface had any effect on the deposition of ps0 however at high nacl concentrations the initial deposition rate of ps0 co deposited with ha was much higher than that of individual ps0 resulting from enhanced mass transfer rate of ps0 in the presence of ha because of the smaller particle size qu alvarez et al 2012 owing to the domination of diffusion limited transport the absorbed ha on the silica surface had a minimal effect on the deposition of ps0 3 3 2 deposition of aged pss the aging of pss significantly affected their deposition for examples with the increase of aging time the deposition rate of pss in 50 mm nacl solution dramatically reduced from 3 52 0 31 hz min for ps0 to 2 10 0 11 hz min for ps12 and 0 98 0 14 hz min for ps24 fig 5c 5e s10 and s11 this was similar to the aggregation phenomenon that the increased hydrophilicity of ps12 and ps24 inhibited both the aggregation and deposition processes and similar results were reported for the deposition of uva irradiated nc60 qu alvarez et al 2012 with the increase in nacl concentration the initial deposition rate of ps12 first increased and then decreased this was attributed to the enhanced hydrodynamic size of ps12 implying that the diffusion limited transport was also present in the deposition of ps12 at high salt concentration however the initial deposition rate of ps24 constantly increased from 0 98 0 14 hz min to 3 20 0 11 hz min as the nacl concentration increased from 50 to 800 mm fig 5e as discussed above ps24 hardly aggregated even at 1000 mm nacl solution and thus the electrostatic interaction rather than mass transfer rate controlled the deposition of ps24 fig s8 the initial deposition rates of ps12 and ps24 in the presence of dbc were higher than that of individual ps12 and ps24 which was similar with the effect of dbc on the deposition of ps0 notably the effect of dbc on the deposition of aged pss was not as strong as that on fresh pss due to the weak interaction between dbc and aged pss owing to their high hydrophilicity in particular the deposition rates of ps12 and ps24 on the dbc modified silica surface were insignificantly different from those on the silica surface which indicated the limited role in controlling the deposition of aged pss fig 5d and 5f the presence of ha in either salt solution or silica surface was not conducive to the deposition of aged pss because of the additional steric repulsion fig 5c 5f 4 conclusions and environmental implications the aggregation and deposition of nanoplastics are important for evaluating their fate in aquatic environments current studies have focused on the aggregation behavior of pss under different conditions such as the effects of salt concentration and valence cai hu et al 2018 mao li et al 2020 ph shams alam et al 2020 aging liu hu et

al 2020 these studies provide insights into the transport of nanoplastics in complex aquatic environments dbc is an important component of doc accounting for approximately 10 of the doc in rivers and 2 in oceans hopkinson and vallino 2005 dittmar and paeng 2009 dittmar de rezende et al 2012 rudolf jaffé yan ding et al 2013 elucidating the effect of dbc on the aggregation and deposition of nanoplastics is important for understanding the transport of nanoplastics in natural environments our study found that dbc from the four sources can promote the aggregation of pss to some extent the deposition experiments also showed that the coexistence of dbc promoted the deposition of pss on the silica surface similarly the dbc modified silica surface was also conducive to ps attachment our findings provide new insights into the effect of dbc on the fate of environmental contaminants and enrich the research on the transport of nanoplastics in complex aquatic systems the work on the influence of dbc and ha on the deposition process of nanoplastics on environmental surfaces is also meaningful for understanding the accumulation of fine plastic particles in river lake sediment as well as the potential effects of dissolved bc and natural organic matter this study had several limitations for example similar to other articles the selected commercial pss are unlikely to represent nanoplastics in actual aquatic environments and the amount and distribution characteristics of nanoplastics in aquatic systems remain unknown additionally as reported in previous studies and this study commercial pss with the critical coagulation concentration of 500 600 mm nacl under neutral conditions are very stable thus these works are profound only in the range of high ionic strengths and short time horizons studies on the fate of pss can help predict their possible environmental behavior and potential ecological risks future studies should focus on the quantification and identification of nanoplastics in actual environments and the long term vertical or horizontal migration of nanoplastics commonly detected in the real environment requires further research declaration

17088,dissolved black carbon dbc widely found in soil and water environments is likely to affect the transport of nanoplastics in aquatic environments the aggregation and deposition behaviors of fresh and aged polystyrene nanoplastics pss with and without dbc in nacl solution were investigated by time resolved dynamic light scattering dls and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring equipment qcm d techniques the results suggest that dbc can screen the surface charges of pss by interacting with pss through hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions although they were negatively charged dbc promoted the aggregation of pss under relatively low ionic strengths and it minimally affected the stability of pss under high ionic strength deposition experiments showed that both dbc in salt solution and dbc adsorption on silica surface facilitated the deposition of fresh pss while ha inhibited both deposition processes after aging pss were more stable and the effects of dbc and ha were weakened this study investigated the influence mechanism of dbc on the aggregation and deposition behaviors which provides new insights into the stability and transport of

alam et al 2020 in addition to the homoaggregation behavior of nps in synthetic and natural waters heteroaggregation with natural colloids and nanoparticles also plays an important role in their transport and bioavailability in aquatic systems long paul pont et al 2017 cai hu et al 2018 oriekhova and stoll 2018 liu hu et al 2019 a certain concentration of negatively charged alginate and fe2o3 can destabilize pss with amino functional groups due to charge neutralization while further increasing the alginate and fe2o3 concentrations could induce charge inversion thereby reducing the aggregate sizes oriekhova and stoll 2018 extracellular polysaccharides promote the interactions of ps mps and marine phytoplankton resulting in species specific heteroaggregation long paul pont et al 2017 large suspended sediment with sizes of 100 500 mm significantly increased the aggregation and settling of pss with an average diameter of 100 nm while the presence of humic acid ha decreased the heteroaggregation between suspended sediment and pss because of steric repulsion liu hu et al 2019 although previous studies have provided some insights into the heteroaggregation behaviors of nps the mechanisms of heteroaggregation between nps and natural colloids as well as nanoparticles require further investigation black carbon bc an important carbon component of soil and sediment systems has attracted widespread attention in agricultural and environmental fields because of its roles in many related biogeological processes including the transport of contaminants carbon cycling and soil conditioners ouyang zhao et al 2016 qu fu et al 2016 with the rainfall and irrigation bc can release a water soluble fraction called dissolved bc dbc into aquatic environments xu wei et al 2017 which accounts for approximately 10 of dissolved organic carbon in rivers and 2 in oceans globally hopkinson and vallino 2005 dittmar and paeng 2009 dittmar de rezende et al 2012 rudolf jaffé yan ding et al 2013 in addition particulate or nanoparticulate bc might form because of the physical disintegration of bc after aging and weathering in the environment qian zhang et al 2016 in china particulate bc accounted for 13 0 9 and 22 11 of the particulate organic carbon pools in the changjiang and huanghe rivers respectively xu xue et al 2016 previous studies have suggested that dbc exhibits high stability under environmental conditions xu wei et al 2017 xu et al found that dbc is hard to aggregate even at 800 mm na or mg2 solutions because of the strong hydration force xu wei et al 2017 the ccc values of dbc produced at 400 c and 700 c were 700 and 140 mm for na lian yu et al 2019 in addition as dbc has abundant aromatic domains and oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh groups it might exhibit strong affinity to environmental pollutants and soil matrices harvey herbert et al 2011 yao gao et al 2014 lian and xing 2017 alam gorman lewis et al 2018 luo chen et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 considering its high mobility and reactivity dbc is expected to have an impact on the transport and fate of associated contaminants such as nps owing to their high surface to volume ratio and high surface hydrophobicity nps exhibit strong affinities toward a range of hydrophobic organic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and perfluorinated surfactants chua shimeta et al 2014 velzeboer kwadijk et al 2014 huffer and hofmann 2016 liu fokkink et al 2016 liu ma et al 2018 pss have higher adsorption ability to pcbs than polyethylene mps because of the higher aromaticity and surface volume ratio of pss velzeboer kwadijk et al 2014 the π π interactions between pahs and the aromatic polymer ps contributed to the high and nonlinear adsorption liu fokkink et al 2016 with adequate aromatic components dbc might strongly adsorb to the surface of nps via hydrophobic interactions and π π interactions thereby impacting the transport of nps however limited research has investigated the impact of dbc on the transport of pss in aquatic environments in this study to investigate the effect of dbc on the stability and transport of pss the aggregation and deposition behaviors of primary and aged pss with and without dbc or ha were studied first the dls method was applied to study the aggregation behavior of the aggregation kinetics of pss with and without dbc from various sources moreover the qcm d technique was utilized to examine the deposition of individual pss on the sio2 surface the co deposition behavior of dbc and pss on sio2 surface and the deposition of pss on the dbc modified sio2 surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a ps stock solution aqueous suspension with a diameter of 0 05 0 1 µm was purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china the stock solution had a particle concentration of 2 5 w v i e 25 g l of pss without surface modification prior to the experiments the ps suspension was prepared by diluting the stock solution with ultrapure water to obtain 40 mg l ps a final ps concentration of 10 mg l was used in all experiments which was selected as a representative nanoplastic concentration commonly applied in previous studies liu hu et al 2019 yu shen et al 2019 liu huang et al 2020 wang zhao et al 2021 the ps aging experiments were conducted in an aging chamber equipped with a uv lamp uvc 254 nm 15w a 250 ml suspension of 40 mg l ps was added to a quartz vial and a uv lamp was inserted into the reactor the sample was exposed to uv light for either 12 h or 24 h and stirred constantly to ensure uniform exposure the unaged samples and pss aged for 12 h and 24h named ps0 ps12 and ps24 respectively were stored at 4 8 c before use dbc originating from biochar was prepared by an ultrasonic method luo xu et al 2015 xu wei et al 2017 the detailed procedure is presented in text s1 of the supplementary material different types of dbc were prepared using maize straw biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c and 300 c wood and rice straw biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c as raw materials termed ms5 ms3 wo rs respectively ha was purchased from sigma aldrich cas1415 93 6 and used as a representative aquatic humic substance the total organic carbon toc content of dbc and ha solutions was measured to determine their concentrations the ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha stock solution with a concentration of 10 mg c l were stored at 4 8 c prior to the experiments according to published values of dissolved organic carbon doc and dbc 0 001 3 7 mg c l in aquatic environments ding cawley et al 2014 wagner jaffé et al 2018 the experimental concentrations of dbc and ha were selected as 2 mg l 2 2 characterization of pss and dbc the structural properties and functional groups of unaged and aged pss dbc and ha samples were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir analysis was performed using the kbr tablet method with wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to characterize the surface chemical compositions of these samples qu fu et al 2016 the xps measurements were performed with a phi 5000 versaprobe system ulvac phi japan using monochromatized al kα radiation h ν 1486 6 ev all samples were freeze dried before ftir and xps characterization the hydrodynamic sizes and zeta potentials of pss were measured at 25 c via dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk operated with a hene laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a scattering angle of 90 to determine effect of dbc and ha on the surface charge of pss the zeta potentials of pss with or without dbc and ha were measured over a range of nacl concentrations at ph 7 adjusted by using 0 1 m nacl and hcl each sample was measured in triplicate with 10 runs per measurement 2 3 aggregation kinetics measurements the aggregation kinetics of pss under various solution were determined by time resolved dls measurements using a malvern zetasizer instrument nano zs malvern uk with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and a fixed scattering angle of 90 xu ou et al 2020 prior to each measurement the ps samples were sonicated in a water bath for 15 min during the aggregation measurements 1 5 ml of the ps suspension was added to the dls polystyrene cuvette followed by the addition of 1 5 ml of the prepared nacl solution for the aggregation processes in the presence of dbc and ha the pss dbc ha and nacl solutions were mixed in a certain proportion the final concentrations of pss and dbc were 10 mg l and 2 mg toc l respectively the time resolved dls measurements continuously monitored the average hydrodynamic diameter of pss every 30 s for 30 min with no delay between measurements all measurements were conducted in triplicate to increase statistical power for data analysis the aggregation kinetics of pss in the initial stage were evaluated by measuring the initial rate of change in hydrodynamic size dh over time t the initial aggregation rate constant k was proportional to the initial rate of increase in dh and inversely proportional to the initial ps concentration of pss in the suspension m0 equation 1 jiang raliya et al 2016 1 k d d h t d t t 0 m 0 the initial rate of the linear increase of dh for pss with time ddh t dt was determined from t 0 to the time when dh reached 1 5dh0 the value of ddh t dt was calculated using a linear least squares regression analysis the attachment efficiency α applied to characterize the stability of pss was calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions to kf under fast aggregation conditions liu legros et al 2013 2 α k k f d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d

surface purchased from q sense ab was a representative environmental surface qcm d experiments were conducted to monitor changes in the frequency δf of a 5 mhz at cut quartz sensor crystal the qcm sensors were cleaned according to the standard cleaning protocols recommended by the q sense text s2 prior to each deposition experiment the flow rate of the solution was controlled at 0 15 ml min and the experiment was performed at 25 c to investigate the effect of dbc on the deposition behavior of pss on silica surfaces the deposition of individual pss on the sio2 surface the co deposition behavior of dbc and pss on the sio2 surface and the deposition of pss on the dbc modified sio2 surface were examined in each deposition experiment the qcm d system was first pre equilibrated with the desired salt solution to obtain a stable baseline at 0 15 ml min for the first case the prepared ps suspension 10 mg l in desired salt solution was then injected into the crystal chamber to obtain the frequency shift curve for the co deposition process ps suspension 10 mg l with 2 mg c l dbc or ha in the desired salt solution was injected to obtain the frequency shift curve for the last case dbc or ha samples 2 mg c l were first injected to obtain a stable baseline then the desired salt solution was injected to remove the unabsorbed dbc or ha finally the pss in the desired salt solution were injected the continuous increase in the mass of the deposited pss or dbc δm can lead to a shift in the resonance and overtone frequencies δf described by the sauerbrey relationship 3 δ m c δ f n n where n is the overtone number n 3 in this study and c is the crystal constant 17 7 ng hz cm2 when f 5 mhz the initial deposition rate r d quantified by the initial shift of the normalized frequency at a given period was obtained to determine the deposition kinetics chen and elimelech 2006 4 r d d δ f 3 d t 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of pss and dbc the particle size morphology and hydrodynamic size of primary pss and dbc were determined by sem and dls measurements the sem images showed that the average diameter of the pss was 50 nm exhibiting a regular spherical morphology fig s1 dls measurement showed the average hydrodynamic size of pss was 117 8 5 7 nm dls was further used to determine the zeta potential of the pss fig s2 the fresh pss had strong negative surface charge with a ζ potential of 44 4 1 3 mv as measured at 10 mm nacl and ph 7 fig s2 which indicated that the fresh pss were very stable liu hu et al 2019 liu huang et al 2020 after uv radiation the ζ potential of pss barely changed 41 4 3 5 mv for ps12 and 43 3 1 8 mv for ps24 at 10 mm nacl and ph 7 fig s2 which was similar to the results of previous studies liu hu et al 2019 the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss decreased to 98 1 4 1 and 70 9 4 4 nm at 12 and 24 hours after uv irradiation respectively fig s3 ftir and xps were further used to characterize the functional groups and surface elemental composition of fresh and aged pss fig 1 s4 and table s1 for fresh pss typical adsorption peaks were identified at 1500 and 1649 cm 1 that corresponded to c c stretch of aromatic ring and alkene respectively liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 aromatic c h bending contributed to the adsorption peaks at 698 and 831 cm 1 luo chen et al 2019 for ps12 and ps24 the broad adsorption peaks of c o stretching 1600 1755 cm 1 implied the formation of hydrophilic groups after ageing moreover the polarity indexes o n c of ps0 ps12 and ps24 were 0 07 0 11 and 0 18 respectively table s1 suggesting aged ps contained more polar functional groups lian yu et al 2019 liu hu et al 2019 the sem images showed that the morphology of dbc was irregular and the particle size was not uniform or definite fig s1 all dbcs were negatively charged and the ζ potential of dbc generally followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s5 ftir was used to analyze the surface functional groups of the dbc fig 1 the strong absorbance at 3361 1622 1400 1251 and 1120 cm 1 of ms5 suggest that it contained o containing functional groups such as c o c oh and c o groups lian yu et al 2019 additionally the unsaturated aromatic c c stretching at 1560 cm 1 and aromatic c h bending 625 900 cm 1 indicated the abundance of aromatics luo chen et al 2019 similarly ftir also indicated that the presence of o containing functional groups and aromatic components in ms3 wo rs and ha fig 1 the polarity indexes of ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 0 45 0 50 0 37 0 42 0 45 respectively and almost followed wo rs ms5 ha ms3 table s1 additionally the ζ potential of pss in the presence of ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha in a range of nacl concentrations were measured fig s2 interestingly the addition of a certain amount of dbc reduced the ζ potential of pss both the dbc and ps were negatively charged fig s5 but a decrease in the negative charge on the pss was observed in this study owing to the abundance of o containing groups and aromatic constituents of dbc other interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic and π π interactions may overcome electrostatic repulsion resulting in the adsorption of dbc onto the ps surface thus the partial charge of pss was shielded by bc molecule distributed unevenly on the ps surface the ζ potential increased more when the concentration of added dbc ms5 was higher which indicated the spatial shielding of the surface charge was enhanced in addition the ζ potential of pss in the presence 2 mg c l ms5 ms3 wo rs almost followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s2 however the ζ potential of pss remained almost constant in the presence of ha fig s2 previous study also reported that ha had little or no effect on the surface charge of pss liu huang et al 2020 3 2 aggregation behaviors of pss 3 2 1 dbc enhanced aggregation of fresh pss dbc had a different refractive index and the dls signal was mainly derived from pss as the solution contained more small pss to identify the effect mechanism of dbc on the aggregation kinetics of fresh pss 1 2 and 5 mg c l ms5 2 mg c l ms3 wo and rs were selected to conduct the aggregation experiments fig 2 shows the change of hydrodynamic size of fresh ps0 with time after the addition of dbc at different concentrations at several selected nacl concentrations as observed all dbc appeared to increase the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss to a certain extent under 200 mm nacl solution taking ms5 as an example with the increase in dbc concentration the hydrodynamic size of fresh pss increased more obviously particularly after adding 5 mg c l dbc the particle size increased significantly to 600 nm within 30 min while individual ps0 maintained high stability in 200 mm nacl solution the sem images reveal that ps0 were partially connected implying that aggregation was not obvious in this case fig s6a however parts of the ps0 attached to the dbc surface and clustered together fig s6b in the presence of dbc therefore dbc was conducive to the aggregation of ps0 to some extent according to the change in the ζ potential of the pss in fig s2 the reduced electrostatic repulsion was responsible for the increased aggregation of pss however when the ionic strength exceeded 400 mm the positive effect of dbc on pss aggregation weakened and even disappeared the sem images also indicated that pss significantly aggregated in 500 mm nacl solution compared to low ionic strength fig s6c although dbc can form heretoaggregates with some pss only a minimal effect on the average aggregate size was observed fig s7d thus the presence of dbc is not significantly influential on the hydrodynamic size of pss under high salt concentrations which is attributed to the low stability of individual pss and the limited impact of dbc the aggregation efficiency of pss with or without ms5 under various salt concentrations was used to further quantify the aggregation kinetics of pss fig 3 a the initial stage when the aggregation efficiency of pss increased with an increase in ionic strength was called the reaction limited stage which basically conformed to the dlvo theory huangfu ma et al 2019 huangfu xu et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 under high ionic strength the adsorption efficiency was close to 1 and remained almost constant indicating that the energy barrier was completely shielded and the aggregation rate reached its maximum this process is known as the diffusion limited stage liu hu et al 2019 shams alam et al 2020 the ionic strength corresponding to the transition from the reaction limited stage to the diffusion limited stage is called the ccc which is usually used to evaluate the particle stability under different environmental conditions liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 the ccc value of pss measured in this study was approximately 585 mm nacl which was close to the ccc values reported in other papers cai hu et al 2018 liu hu et al 2019 wu jiang et al 2019 yu shen et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 the ccc values of pss in the presence of 1 2 and 5 mg l ms5 were 560 mm 520 mm and 485 mm respectively which were lower than those of individual pss fig 3a this suggests that dbc can destabilize pss to some extent and this destabilization ability is positively correlated with the dbc concentration generally the increase in dbc concentration screened the surface charges of pss because of the hydrophobic interaction and π π interaction between them as a result dbc may act as a bridge between pss and promote the aggregation of pss some scholars also reported that the addition of a certain concentration of dbc could neutralize the surface charge and thus promote the aggregation of iron oxide colloidal particles because of the opposite charge between dbc and iron oxide colloidal particles lian yu et al 2019 however in this study we found that there was a similar bridging effect although both dbc and pss were negatively charged 3 2 2 comparison of ha and different dbc dbc is an important carbon component of doc in aquatic environments armanious aeppli et al 2014 wagner jaffé et al 2018 lian yu et al 2019 to distinguish the role of dbc and natural organic matter in the aggregation of nanoplastics the aggregation kinetics of fresh pss with 2 mg c l ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were investigated fig 3b shows the hydrodynamic size shift curves of pss with 2 mg l dbc or ha under a range of nacl concentrations for examples fig 2 individual ps0 and ps0 with 2 mg c l ha remained stable while 2 mg c l dbc significantly increase the hydrodynamic size of pss in 200 mm nacl solution this means that there was an obvious difference between dbc and ha in controlling the aggregation of ps0 in nacl solutions fig 3b shows the aggregation efficiency of ps0 with or without 2 mg l dbc and ha at various nacl concentrations the ccc values of pss in the presence of 2 mg l ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 520 mm 550 mm 515 mm 500 mm and 1200 mm respectively notably the presence of dbc promoted the aggregation of pss whereas ha strongly stabilized ps0 additionally the four dbc samples exhibited different extents of aggregation effects on the ps0 in nacl solutions the physicochemical properties of dbc from different sources may play an important role in dominating the processes for example the promotion effect of ms3 produced by low temperature pyrolysis of maize straw was the weakest which was likely related to its higher hydrophilicity and more negative zeta potential compared with other dbc produced at high temperatures table s1 and fig s5 thus the presence of ms3 insignificantly affected the stability of ps0 generally the positive effect of dbc on ps0 aggregation likely resulted from the electrical double layer compression mechanism as discussed above fig s2 the presence of dbc screened the negative charges of ps0 due to the binding of dbc because of the different physicochemical characteristics of different the zeta potential of ps0 in the presence of dbc followed wo rs ms5 ms3 fig s2 which is consistent with the change rule of ccc values in contrast to dbc the adsorption of ha on the ps0 surface slightly changed the surface charges of ps0 fig s2 which reflects the findings of previous studies liu huang et al 2020 most studies implied that the ha molecules absorbed on the ps0 surface can produce steric repulsion and therefore strongly enhance the stability of ps0 liu huang et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 3 2 3 effect on the aggregation of aged pss as previously mentioned hydrophobic pss can absorb dbc and ha to varying degrees either by promoting or inhibiting their aggregation environmental pss are likely to undergo the aging process dbc and ha may have distinct effects on the aggregation of aged pss fig s7 and s8 show the hydrodynamic size shift curves of ps12 and ps24 in the presence of 2 mg l dbc and ha under a range of nacl concentrations after uv radiation ps12 and ps24 contained more hydrophilic oxygen containing groups that could form hydrogen bonds with water resulting in higher stability than ps0 table s1 cai hu et al 2018 liu hu et al 2019 notably the hydrodynamic size of ps24 with and without dbc and ha barely changed even in 1000 mm nacl solution fig s8 fig 3c describes the aggregation efficiency of ps12 with or without 2 mg l dbc and ha at various nacl concentrations the ccc value of ps12 was 700 mm nacl which was similar to the ccc values reported in previous studies liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 studies also suggested that enhanced electrostatic repulsion due to deprotonation of o containing functional groups as well as steric hindrance between formed molecules on aged ps surfaces were responsible for the stability of aged pss liu hu et al 2019 in this study there was no significant difference in zeta potential between aged pss and fresh pss fig s2 thus the enhanced stability of aged pss may be attributed to the enhanced hydration repulsion xu wei et al 2017 liu hu et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 in addition the effects of dbc and ha on the aggregation of aged pss were different from those of the fresh pss notably the ccc value of ps12 in the presence of ha was 1100 mm which was slightly lower than that of ps0 in the presence of ha fig 3b and 3c hence the inhibitory effect of ha on the aggregation of aged pss was not as strong as ps0 is more hydrophobic it can absorb ha more easily than hydrophilic ps12 the steric repulsion derived from the adsorbed ha layer was the primary mechanism of enhanced ps0 stability liu huang et al 2020 shams alam et al 2020 therefore the weak interaction between ha and aged pss was likely responsible for the reduced inhibitory effect of ha similarly while dbc promoted the aggregation of ps12 to some extent the effect was not significant fig s7 and 3c 3 3 deposition behaviors of pss 3 3 1 influence of dbc and ha to explore the influence of dbc or ha on the deposition behavior of fresh pss on environmental surface we studied the co deposition behavior of dbc or ha and ps0 on a representative sio2 surface as well as the deposition behavior of ps0 on the surface of sio2 coated with dbc fig 4 fig 4a and s9 show the representative frequency shift curve of individual ps0 deposited on the silica surface 50 mm the deposition process of ps0 can lead to an obvious frequency shift the initial deposition rate was 3 52 0 31 hz min indicating that the deposition behavior can occur under low ionic strengths fig 4b and s9 represents the representative frequency shift curves of ps0 deposited on the sio2 surface in the presence of 2 mg c l dbc and ha after adding 2 mg l of dbc the frequency shift was more obvious than that of individual ps0 while the addition of ha inhibited this process the initial deposition rates when adding ms5 ms3 wo rs and ha were 5 84 0 25 4 05 0 14 7 23 0 42 5 45 0 11 and 2 60 0 10 hz min fig 5 a similar to the aggregation experiments the adsorption of dbc on ps0 surface reduced the surface charge of ps0 fig s2 resulting in a decrease the electrostatic repulsion between ps0 and the silica surface the promotion effect of different dbc generally followed wo rs ms5 ms3 which is in agreement with the zeta potential of pss in the presence of dbc fig s2 in contrast the presence of ha prevented the deposition of ps0 due to the additional steric repulsion other publications have also reported that ha can limit the deposition of several engineered nanoparticles such as mno2 fullerene quantum dots and silver nanoparticles qu alvarez et al 2012 furman usenko et al 2013 quevedo olsson et al 2013 huangfu ma et al 2019 the deposition process of ps0 on the dbc or ha coated silica surface fig 4c and s9 was further studied to investigate the impact of dbc or ha adsorbed on the environmental surface after pre depositing 2 mg c l dbc on silica surface there was a significant frequency shift when ps0 was added fig s9 the deposition experiment can provide information about the affinity of ps0 to the surface and such a large deposition rate suggested there was a strong interaction between ps0 and dbc although both were negatively charged which may be attributed to the strong hydrophobic and π π interactions between ps0 and the aromatic component of dbc in this case dbc deposited on surface was likely to act as a bridge mediating the deposition of ps0 on the silica surface this bridging effect of dbc was similar to the dbc mediated contact between ps0 in the aggregation experiment fig 2 several studies have reported increased nanoparticle deposition by surface immobilized macromolecules including c60 deposition on alginate and eps coated silica surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 tong ding et al 2010 and nmno2 on a protein bovine serum albumin coated silica surface in monovalent electrolyte solutions huangfu ma et al 2019 which was likely attributed to the hydrophobic effect of these macromolecules in this study the adsorption of dbc on the surface of the silica surface may provide more hydrophobic binding sites for pss in contrast the coating of ha impeded ps0 deposition due to additional steric repulsion qu alvarez et al 2012 furman usenko et al 2013 with the increase in nacl concentration e g 100 and 200 mm the deposition rate of ps0 with or without dbc and ha increased due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion fig 5a and 5b quevedo olsson et al 2013 xu ou et al 2020 however the cases differed with further increases in salt concentration at high ionic strength e g 500 mm the deposition rates of both individual ps0 and ps0 with dbc dramatically decreased this was attributed to the reduced mass transfer rate due to the aggregation the particles and many publications have reported on this diffusion limited transport mechanism qu alvarez et al 2012 huangfu ma et al 2019 xu ou et al 2020 in the diffusion limited stage neither dbc in solution nor dbc adsorbed on the silica surface had any effect on the deposition of ps0 however at high nacl concentrations the initial deposition rate of ps0 co deposited with ha was much higher than that of individual ps0 resulting from enhanced mass transfer rate of ps0 in the presence of ha because of the smaller particle size qu alvarez et al 2012 owing to the domination of diffusion limited transport the absorbed ha on the silica surface had a minimal effect on the deposition of ps0 3 3 2 deposition of aged pss the aging of pss significantly affected their deposition for examples with the increase of aging time the deposition rate of pss in 50 mm nacl solution dramatically reduced from 3 52 0 31 hz min for ps0 to 2 10 0 11 hz min for ps12 and 0 98 0 14 hz min for ps24 fig 5c 5e s10 and s11 this was similar to the aggregation phenomenon that the increased hydrophilicity of ps12 and ps24 inhibited both the aggregation and deposition processes and similar results were reported for the deposition of uva irradiated nc60 qu alvarez et al 2012 with the increase in nacl concentration the initial deposition rate of ps12 first increased and then decreased this was attributed to the enhanced hydrodynamic size of ps12 implying that the diffusion limited transport was also present in the deposition of ps12 at high salt concentration however the initial deposition rate of ps24 constantly increased from 0 98 0 14 hz min to 3 20 0 11 hz min as the nacl concentration increased from 50 to 800 mm fig 5e as discussed above ps24 hardly aggregated even at 1000 mm nacl solution and thus the electrostatic interaction rather than mass transfer rate controlled the deposition of ps24 fig s8 the initial deposition rates of ps12 and ps24 in the presence of dbc were higher than that of individual ps12 and ps24 which was similar with the effect of dbc on the deposition of ps0 notably the effect of dbc on the deposition of aged pss was not as strong as that on fresh pss due to the weak interaction between dbc and aged pss owing to their high hydrophilicity in particular the deposition rates of ps12 and ps24 on the dbc modified silica surface were insignificantly different from those on the silica surface which indicated the limited role in controlling the deposition of aged pss fig 5d and 5f the presence of ha in either salt solution or silica surface was not conducive to the deposition of aged pss because of the additional steric repulsion fig 5c 5f 4 conclusions and environmental implications the aggregation and deposition of nanoplastics are important for evaluating their fate in aquatic environments current studies have focused on the aggregation behavior of pss under different conditions such as the effects of salt concentration and valence cai hu et al 2018 mao li et al 2020 ph shams alam et al 2020 aging liu hu et al 2019 mao li et al 2020 natural organic matter and biological macromolecules dong hou et al 2020 leiser wu et al 2020 liu huang et al 2020 temperature alimi farner et al 2021 as well as their heteroaggregation behaviors with marine phytoplankton long paul pont et al 2017 suspended sediment or natural colloids oriekhova and stoll 2018 li wang et al 2019 and engineered nanoparticles li he et al 2020 these studies provide insights into the transport of nanoplastics in complex aquatic environments dbc is an important component of doc accounting for approximately 10 of the doc in rivers and 2 in oceans hopkinson and vallino 2005 dittmar and paeng 2009 dittmar de rezende et al 2012 rudolf jaffé yan ding et al 2013 elucidating the effect of dbc on the aggregation and deposition of nanoplastics is important for understanding the transport of nanoplastics in natural environments our study found that dbc from the four sources can promote the aggregation of pss to some extent the deposition experiments also showed that the coexistence of dbc promoted the deposition of pss on the silica surface similarly the dbc modified silica surface was also conducive to ps attachment our findings provide new insights into the effect of dbc on the fate of environmental contaminants and enrich the research on the transport of nanoplastics in complex aquatic systems the work on the influence of dbc and ha on the deposition process of nanoplastics on environmental surfaces is also meaningful for understanding the accumulation of fine plastic particles in river lake sediment as well as the potential effects of dissolved bc and natural organic matter this study had several limitations for example similar to other articles the selected commercial pss are unlikely to represent nanoplastics in actual aquatic environments and the amount and distribution characteristics of nanoplastics in aquatic systems remain unknown additionally as reported in previous studies and this study commercial pss with the critical coagulation concentration of 500 600 mm nacl under neutral conditions are very stable thus these works are profound only in the range of high ionic strengths and short time horizons studies on the fate of pss can help predict their possible environmental behavior and potential ecological risks future studies should focus on the quantification and identification of nanoplastics in actual environments and the long term vertical or horizontal migration of nanoplastics commonly detected in the real environment requires further research declaration

17089,the impact of cultural eutrophication on carbon cycling in subtropical reservoirs was assessed using high resolution measurements of dissolved gas concentration atmospheric exchange and uptake production rates of methane carbon dioxide and oxygen seasonal measurements were performed in two reservoirs that pertain to the same hydrological basin but are drastically different in terms of allochthonous carbon input these results were used to feed a mass balance model from which a large number of overall parameters were determined to explicitly describe the dynamics and spatial attributes of the carbon cycle in the reservoirs a single graphical representation of each reservoir was created to facilitate an overall appraisal of the carbon cycle the impact of cultural eutrophication was profound and resulted in a complete redistribution of how the various bioprocesses participated in the methane carbon dioxide and oxygen cycles among several identified impacts of eutrophication it was observed that while eutrophication triggered increased methane production this effect was followed by a similar increase in methane emissions and methanotrophic rates while gross primary production was depleted graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction despite their relatively small contribution to the global landscape freshwater ecosystems have been identified as an important natural source of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 which act as greenhouse gasses when released into the atmosphere tranvik et al 2009 many processes are involved in the carbon cycle and they directly impact the greenhouse gas emissions from lakes and reservoirs among these ch4 production methanogenesis and ch4 oxidation methanotrophy are the dominant bioprocesses involved in ch4 emissions while mineral dissolution primary production and heterotrophic respiration are those most closely related to co2 emissions bridgham et al 2013 cole and caraco 2001 morales williams et al 2020 these processes interact and create a complex metabolic network that is regulated to a great extent by the availability of oxygen o2 ch4 and co2 together with nutrient and organic carbon concentrations as well as physicochemical conditions in addition to these processes naturally occurring in aquatic ecosystems the input of sewage fertilizers and other nutrient sources have a significant impact on the carbon cycle such as causing eutrophication which has become a growing global problem on a large scale istvánovics 2009 wen et al 2017 the impact of eutrophication on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions has been thoroughly described beaulieu et al 2019 delsontro et al 2018 overall nutrient inputs trigger algal growth which results in increased dissolved and particulate organic matter part of which settles to the sediment layer where most of the methanogenesis takes place duc et al 2010 concomitantly the higher dissolved and particulate organic matter also promotes heterotrophic respiration within the water column thus depleting dissolved oxygen due to bacterial respiration resulting in less appropriate conditions for aerobic methanotrophy hernandez et al 2015 thus it has been well established that eutrophication induces higher methane emissions beaulieu et al 2019 gonzalez valencia et al 2014b in terms of carbon dioxide eutrophication promotes primary production and therefore co2 capture grasset et al 2020 pacheco et al 2014 however contrasting results have been reported some showing higher co2 emission in eutrophicated ecosystems huttunen et al 2003 kortelainen et al 2006 zhou et al 2020 the main reason for these contrasting observations is probably caused by chemical dependency of the inorganic carbon equilibrium and by the nature of the pollutants causing eutrophication indeed if pollutants are limited to nutrients morales williams et al 2017 they act mostly on primary production whereas if they are accompanied by organic carbon tranvik et al 2009 they also promote aerobic respiration in addition to primary production given the large number of processes and parameters involved the carbon cycle and more specifically the greenhouse gas emissions are highly variable not only among water bodies or seasons but also within a given ecosystem due to this complexity and spatiotemporal variability the overall description and comparison of aquatic ecosystems in broad terms is a difficult task two approaches can be used to describe the overall carbon cycle mass balances and or overall parameters that numerically describe a given feature of the studied ecosystem the mass balance approach consists of describing the overall carbon cycle in an ecosystem by a gray model fed with a limited number of interconnected processes by closing the mass balance some individual processes which could otherwise not be determined experimentally can be derived this approach has been used for in depth analysis of either a single component or a reduced number of the carbon cycle components li et al 2020 santoso et al 2020 in the same context overall parameters usually link several components of the studied cycles that are relevant to a given feature among these some examples are i the net ecosystem productivity nep which indicates whether the ecosystem is predominantly autotrophic or heterotrophic lovett et al 2006 ii the proportion of gross primary production gpp or nep that is lost as greenhouse gas whiting and chanton 1993 iii the mean oxidation reduction potential which defines whether oxidative or reductive processes predominate in the ecosystem mcmahon and chapelle 2008 iv the sestonic c n p ratio that provides insights into the biological processes v the homogeneity and anisotropic factors that describe the spatiotemporal distribution of a given parameter gonzalez valencia et al 2019 and vi the trophic state index which establishes the level of eutrophication in numeric terms merging mass balance and overall parameters would be a beneficial approach for a simplified yet meaningful description of the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems in this context the first objective of the present work was to combine mass balances as many overall parameters as possible and several spatiotemporal attributes into a single graphical representation thus facilitating the overall appraisal of the carbon cycle in lakes and reservoirs at a glance the second objective was to test this approach in subtropical reservoirs over three characteristic seasons based on high resolution measurements of ch4 co2 and o2 related processes the third objective was to use this approach to establish the impact of cultural eutrophication on the carbon cycle in subtropical reservoirs our study was therefore conducted in two reservoirs that pertain to the same hydrological basin but are drastically different in terms of allochthonous carbon input one reservoir is located in a natural protected area while the other is surrounded by an urban area and receives a high input of sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling campaigns two subtropical reservoirs that belong to the same hydrological basin located close to mexico city were selected lago de guadalupe lg 19 6333 99 2602 and lago el llano ll 19 6582 99 5071 the former is a dendritic reservoir with an area of 450 ha and is located 2300 m above sea level lg receives an estimated flow of 0 5 m3 s 1 of untreated wastewater from the surrounding densely populated urban areas sepulveda jauregui et al 2013 contrastingly ll is a u shaped 6 ha reservoir situated 2840 m above sea level in a protected area that receives water from springs and a pristine tributary river both reservoirs have a subtropical climate of warm summers and mild winters with an average annual air temperature of 17 c and 15 c for lg and ll respectively six monitoring and sampling stations mss were established in lg and five were set up in ll fig 1 since lg is characterized by a clear longitudinal zonation the mss locations were selected to cover the fluvial and lacustrine zones i e southwest to northeast in ll the mss were distributed to cover both arms of the u shape it is worth noting that the selection of the number of mss in lg was established after an earlier campaign in which ch4 flux dissolved gasses concentration and ph were measured gonzález valencia et al 2019 several semivariograms were determined from these data and those that minimized the error were selected willmott and matsuura 2006 to establish the range in ll four mss were selected along the main axis of the lake to allow for interpolation and mapping see section 2 8 and an additional mss was selected in the lateral arm of the reservoir both reservoirs were monitored in august 2018 january 2019 and may 2019 which correspond to the three annual seasons of the area i e mild and rainy wet cold and dry dry cold and warm and dry dry hot respectively 2 2 limnological characteristics temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured at each mss with a multi parametric probe hi 9828 hanna instruments mexico from the surface to the sediments at depth intervals of 0 25 m surface water samples were taken from each mss additional water samples were taken at 1 m depth intervals from the surface to the bottom at lg 6 fig 1a and ll 4 fig 1b the water samples were collected with a horizontal 2 2 l van dorn bottle wildco mexico and handled according to standard methods apha et al 2012 they were used to determine the total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and orthophosphate po4 3 concentrations toc and tn were determined using a shimadzu toc analyzer equipped with a total nitrogen module model toc vcn tnm whereas po4 3 concentrations were determined with a colorimetric standard method apha et al 2012 the secchi depth was determined with a 0 2 m secchi disk at each mss these measurements were used to establish the trophic state of each lake according to wetzel 2001 and carlson 1977 the thermocline depth and the schmidt stability which indicates the resistance to mechanical mixing due to stratification were obtained from temperature profiles using the rlakeanalyzer package winslow et al 2019 of r software version 3 6 2 r core team 2020 2 3 fluxes of greenhouse gasses and oxygen we used the floating static chamber method to measure ch4 and co2 fluxes the floating static chamber was connected to an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga los gatos research usa in a closed circuit a continuous five minute measurement was used to determine diffusive fluxes from ch4 and co2 concentrations the first 30 s after positioning the floating static chamber on the water surface were discarded each flux determination was done in triplicate with a measurement data logging frequency of 1 hz in some cases ebullitive events occurred while measuring fluxes in order to filter these a threshold was set to differentiate diffusive and ebullitive emissions i e an abrupt increase of concentration at least five times higher than the linear slope observed during diffusive fluxes and for five seconds or more the total flux was defined as the mean concentration slope of the entire measurement whereas the ebullitive flux was defined as the difference between the total flux and the diffusive flux the o2 flux was determined theoretically by using an approach similar to jähne et al 1987 and wanninkhof 2014 here measured co2 fluxes f c o 2 were used to determine the o2 mass transfer coefficient of the boundary layer in this approach co2 fluxes were preferred over ch4 given that co2 was emitted only via diffusion briefly o2 fluxes f o 2 were calculated as follows 1 f o 2 k o 2 h o 2 p o 2 w p o 2 a i r where ko2 is the o2 mass transfer coefficient m h 1 see below ho2 is the henry constant for o2 mole m 3 atm sander 2017 and po2 w and po2 air are the oxygen partial pressure measured in the surface water and in the atmosphere atm respectively these partial pressures were determined according to eq 2 as follows 2 p o 2 w c d o h o 2 p o 2 a i r 0 21 p a t m where cdo is the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water and patm is the absolute atmospheric pressure atm to determine k o2 the f c o 2 was first used to determine the co2 mass transfer coefficient kco2 as per eq 3 which is equivalent to eq 1 3 k c o 2 f c o 2 h c o 2 p c o 2 w p c o 2 a i r once k co2 was determined k o2 was obtained as follows 4 k o 2 k c o 2 0 851 0 5 1 084 k c o 2 where 0 851 is the ratio between the schmidt numbers of o2 and co2 as recommended by wanninkhof 2014 and 0 5 is an adjustment parameter recommended by cole et al 2010 for low wind conditions 2 4 dissolved gas concentration the dissolved ch4 cch4 and co2 cco2 concentrations in the water column were determined on site with a previously reported m icos method gonzalez valencia et al 2014a briefly this method consists of a gas liquid exchange module pdmsxa 1000 medarray inc usa through which water extracted from the reservoir flows constantly on the shell side of the gas exchange module while a ch4 and co2 free nitrogen counterflows inside the silicone fibers i e exchange area of 1000 cm2 diffusive forces from the concentration gradient promote transfer of the dissolved ch4 and co2 contained in the water to the gas phase where they are quantified by the ugga in the present study the water was continuously extracted at the desired depth with a peristaltic pump 12 v solinst mexico at a flow rate of 1 2 l min 1 while the ch4 and co2 free nitrogen was flowing at a constant flow rate of 0 75 l min 1 controlled by a mass flow controller gfc 17 aalborg mexico the setup was calibrated as specified in the method at the beginning and at the end of each measurement day with a standard headspace equilibration technique gonzalez valencia et al 2014a the cch4 and cco2 profiles were obtained by placing the extraction probe just below the water surface for about 60 s afterwards the probe was allowed to descend steadily at a rate of approximately 1 m min 1 until it reached the bottom where it was kept for an additional 30 s additionally a flow through oxygen optode ftc pst3 presens germany was included in the water extraction line allowing the simultaneous determination of dissolved oxygen concentration cdo using this procedure about 60 data points of dissolved gasses were acquired for each meter of water column depth the lower detection limit of the m icos method coupled with the do sensor under the present configuration was 0 005 mmol m 3 for cch4 4 mmol m 3 for cco2 and 0 625 mmol m 3 for cdo 2 5 methane carbon dioxide and oxygen production and uptake rates water samples were taken with a van dorn bottle usually guided by cch4 and cdo profiles to measure the ch4 production and oxidation rates at several characteristic water depths the samples were immediately and carefully transferred to 50 ml glass syringes that included an optical oxygen sensor spot pst 3 or pst 6 presens germany previously fixed to the inside wall close to the syringe output the difference between pst 3 or pst 6 sensors is their lower detection limits and ranges expressed in air saturation percentage of 0 03 100 and 0 002 5 respectively thus pst 6 sensors were preferred for low do and anaerobic samples once the samples had been collected the syringes were taken to the laboratory for incubation under dark conditions at a constant temperature similar to that of the reservoirs then at pre established time intervals cdo was determined and 2 ml sub samples were transferred into 5 ml plastic syringes to which 3 ml of ch4 and co2 free nitrogen were added the sub sample syringes were vigorously shaken for 30 s to allow for equilibration the liquid volume was evacuated and the 3 ml gas content of the syringe was injected through a septum into a continuous flow of nitrogen passing through an open circuit into the ugga the presence of ch4 and co2 in the sample was detected as a peak response that was integrated after proper calibration lastly cch4 and cco2 in the liquid sub samples were derived from henry s solubility constant sander 2017 these incubations were sustained for five to seven days during that time a total of five to six triplicate measurements of cch4 cco2 and cdo were done to ascertain the ch4 co2 and do production uptake rates it is worth noting that this protocol allowed for the determination of the production uptake rates without headspace addition thus the laboratory conditions matched those prevalent in the reservoirs as we will show in the next section these incubations were used to quantify methanotrophy methanogenesis and respiration in terms of ch4 co2 and do production or uptake rates we acknowledge that incubations under dark conditions may have had some impact on the processes occurring in samples collected from the photic zone of the reservoirs indeed the absence of light prevented potential organic matter mineralization via photochemical transformation bertilsson and tranvik 2000 tranvik et al 2009 and light inhibition of aerobic methanotrophy dumestre et al 1999 morana et al 2020 murase and sugimoto 2005 despite these limitations using incubations in dark conditions allowed to close the mass balance 2 6 mass balance the full mass balance calculations and assumptions are described in detail in the supplementary material section s1 1 in this section the experimentally determined parameters are notated with an asterisk briefly assuming steady state the ch4 balance over the entire water column and sediments was considered as a three compartment system i methanogenesis mg described by the methanogenic rate r c h 4 m g ii methanotrophy mt described by the methanotrophic rate r c h 4 m t and iii emissions to from the atmosphere f c h 4 of these two were measured r c h 4 m t and f c h 4 which then allowed r c h 4 m g to be calculated the do balance consisted of three compartments i respiration r described by the respiratory rate r o 2 r ii oxygen production described by the gross primary production gpp r o 2 g p p and iii atmospheric exchange f o 2 the rate r o 2 r was measured f o 2 was estimated from the dissolved oxygen gradient which in turn allowed r o 2 g p p to be determined the co2 balance was considered as a four compartment model i mg which is described by r c o 2 m g and can result in co2 production acetoclastic pathway or uptake hydrogenotrophic pathway ii r in the water column described by r c o 2 r iii the gpp in the photic zone of the water column described by r c o 2 g p p and iv emission to from the atmosphere f c o 2 in this case only two of these four compartments were measured r c o 2 r and f c o 2 thus r c o 2 g p p was determined from r o 2 g p p assuming a constant r c o 2 g p p to r o 2 g p p ratio of 1 2 wetzel et al 2000 once r c o 2 g p p was determined r c o 2 m g was estimated by closing the mass balance in these mass balance equations negative rate values indicate uptake or efflux of a given molecule while positive values indicate production or influx the steady state assumption used in this mass balance model will be discussed in the results and discussion section in addition to process rates for each compound x ch4 o2 and co2 the total mass of x in the water column was determined according to 5 m x i 1 n c x δ i where δi is the depth section of the water column corresponding to each concentration measurement c x finally the turnover time θ x which is the mean time that m x remains within the water column was defined to that end a total rate was defined for each compound r x t o t which is the sum of all positive rates involved in the compound mass balance 6 θ x m x r x t o t 2 7 numerical homogeneity model the numerical homogeneity model nhm gonzalez valencia et al 2019 was implemented to explore the spatial distribution of the dissolved gas concentrations and to assign a numerical value to the distribution briefly this model includes a homogeneity index hp which represents the homogeneity of the parameter p along two dimensions x y in our case longitudinal distance along the reservoir transect and depth the significance of this quantity is that for a nonhomogeneous distribution 0 hp 100 while for a homogeneous distribution hp 100 furthermore to establish in which dimension heterogeneities are dominant the nhm also defines an anisotropic factor ωp that indicates the angle of the heterogeneities in the two dimensional space this value ranges from 45 when heterogeneities are observed only in the x dimension length to 45 for heterogeneities observed only in the y dimension depth 2 8 data treatment and statistics the dplyr package was used in r software to determine the mean and standard deviation of the physicochemical parameters wickham et al 2020 data collected during the campaigns were smoothed by weighted linear least squares and a savitzky golay filter using matlab version 2015a mathworks usa the smoothed data were then used to generate contour maps of dissolved gas concentration the contour maps were generated by interpolation of the high resolution data using surfer 11 0 software golden software usa the surfer software provides 10 interpolation methods from which the best was chosen according to willmott and matsuura 2006 using the mean absolute error mae and the mean bias error mbe as selection criteria we log transformed our data in order to compare means between reservoirs given that aquatic ecosystems usually show log normal distribution st pierre et al 2018 welch s t test was used in matlab to compare the annual means from the log transformed data of the reservoirs 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization clear differences were observed in the water physicochemical parameters measured in both reservoirs as expected based on the urban vs natural ecosystems surrounding lg and ll respectively the wastewater discharged into lg resulted in mean seasonal toc ranging from 0 82 to 2 55 mmol l 1 meanwhile the values observed in ll ranged from 0 23 to 0 56 mmol l 1 in lg the seasonal mean tn ranged from 0 95 to 1 28 mmol l 1 whereas in ll it ranged from 0 011 to 0 015 mmol l 1 the mean seasonal po4 3 concentration ranged from 17 to 22 µmol l 1 in lg while in ll the concentration was between 0 7 and 2 µmol l 1 differences in terms of element balance were also observed between the reservoirs as reflected by the stoichiometric c n p molar ratio which was on average 171 53 1 in lg and 582 10 1 in ll these ratios revealed no nutrient limitation in lg whereas a moderate to severe n and p limitation was observed in ll wetzel 2001 a significant difference in terms of water transparency was also observed with a mean secchi disk depth in lg of 0 75 0 42 m while in ll the mean secchi disk depth was 2 71 0 93 m p 0 01 reductive processes predominated in lg as shown by a mean orp of 124 36 488 mv while in ll oxidation prevailed with mean orp of 94 32 97 07 mv mcmahon and chapelle 2008 according to wetzel 2001 the physicochemical parameters of lg were in line with those commonly found in eutrophic hypereutrophic ecosystems while ll corresponded to a mesotrophic site although orthophosphate concentration was slightly above the level associated to that trophic state 3 2 dissolved gasses and gas emission the cch4 was subject to a large spatial variability as shown in the contour maps fig 2 a the cch4 concentration in ll was on average 50 times lower than that of lg in all cases these concentrations corresponded to an oversaturation relative to the atmospheric ch4 by four to five orders of magnitude in lg and three orders of magnitude in ll which indicates that both reservoirs are sources of atmospheric ch4 surface cch4 observed in ll and lg was generally higher than in other subtropical reservoirs table s2 and world lakes of the same class size holgerson and raymond 2016 contrastingly bottom cch4 was in the lower range of reported values for tropical and subtropical ecosystems table s2 in ll and within the range in lg together higher surface cch4 and similar or lower bottom cch4 suggest a lower ch4 oxidation and or a better ch4 transfer from the bottom to the surface water than is usually seen in other lakes the latter is further supported by relatively low schmidt numbers ranging from 13 8 55 1 j m 2 in lg and 38 9 96 6 j m 2 in ll which reflects a relatively weak thermal stratification for both reservoirs considering that schmidt numbers as high as 1 104 j m 2 have been reported wetzel 2001 as expected from the large variability of cch4 ch4 fluxes were also highly variable figs 3 a and 3b it is worth remembering that according to the model explained in section 2 6 negative values indicate emission to the atmosphere efflux whereas positive values indicate capture from the atmosphere influx mean ch4 total fluxes were 128 5 222 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and 62 0 155 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in lg and ll respectively ebullition was a major emission mode in lg and was observed consistently in all readings with the exception of those from three mss during the wet season this resulted in ebullition accounting for 72 27 of the total flux in ll ebullition was more sporadic and was detected on only four occasions during our study in the shallow zone of the lake ll 1 and or ll 2 given the relatively low diffusive flux despite being sporadic ebullition in ll was responsible for the highest rates of emission measured fig 3b however the sporadic nature of ebullition implies that the few bubbles observed in ll cannot be considered to accurately establish the percentage of ebullitive flux ch4 emissions in lg and ll were higher than expected based on their respective trophic states as detailed by deemer et al 2016 moreover emissions observed in lg are within the higher range of fluxes from brazilian reservoirs 83 5 to 0 62 mmol m 2 d 1 de mello et al 2018 dos santos et al 2006 and are even comparable to those reported for dairy and swine farm wastewater lagoons 3125 to 6 25 mmol m 2 d 1 grant and boehm 2015 leytem et al 2017 sharpe and harper 1999 notably cco2 was subject to a narrower range than cch4 fig 2b from 84 2 to 593 5 mmol m 3 in lg and from 5 9 to 197 5 mmol m 3 in ll in lg the mean cco2 over the entire column was about 25 times higher than the atmospheric equilibrium concentration while in ll the mean cco2 was 4 times above equilibrium in terms of emissions the mean total co2 flux was 107 70 78 60 mmol m 2 d 1 in lg which is within the higher range previously reported from other subtropical reservoirs table s2 and eutrophic aquatic ecosystems i e 76 27 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 in ll despite observing an overall supersaturation of co2 in the water column the surface waters were often undersaturated resulting in predominantly positive co2 fluxes at 9 5 13 6 mmol m 2 d 1 the latter is also in accordance with emissions previously reported from oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs i e 15 10 to 6 99 mmol m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 thus ll can be considered as a co2 sink and a dominantly autotrophic ecosystem whereas lg is a source of co2 and a dominantly heterotrophic ecosystem fig 3d overall freshwater ecosystems are generally considered sources of co2 duarte and prairie 2005 morales williams et al 2020 while eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs often results in a transition to co2 sink as primary productivity elicited by nutrients exceeds heterotrophic respiration grasset et al 2020 pacheco et al 2014 in the present study we observed the opposite tendency which could be explained by the large input of sewage in lg resulting in a relatively high input of allochthonous carbon thus promoting heterotrophic respiration caraco and cole 2004 an alternative explanation is the possible partial inhibition of primary production which will be discussed in section 3 4 in lg the eutrophic hypereutrophic conditions promoted aerobic heterotrophic respiratory processes and do depletion as shown in the cdo contour maps fig 2c throughout the three campaigns most of the lg water column was characterized by cdo values that were below the detection limit of the method while mean seasonal cdo were within the dysoxic range tyson and pearson 1991 i e from 10 68 25 36 to 26 45 65 8 mmol m 3 which corresponds to 5 59 13 85 saturation these low cdo are below survival levels for regular macrobiota u s epa 2000 and are an additional indicator of the polluted state of lg notably cdo close to saturation mss 5 or even above saturation mss 6 were observed in surface water during the wet season caused by local algal bloom aside from this local anomaly seasonality was low and the total mass of do was characterized by a seasonal cv of 28 all year round a fully oxygenated water column was observed in ll with mean seasonal cdo levels ranging from 198 53 to 272 24 mmol m 3 which corresponds to 93 127 saturation and the total mass of do over the entire water column was characterized by a seasonal cv of 8 the oversaturation commonly observed in ll confirms the dominant autotrophic nature of the reservoir in lg the observed do undersaturation was partly compensated for by influxes from the atmosphere with seasonal means ranging from 23 65 to 137 93 mmol m 2 d 1 in contrast ll was a source of o2 to the atmosphere with mean seasonal fluxes ranging from 23 92 to 4 94 mmol m 2 d 1 although diffusive o2 fluxes are not extensively reported in the literature our measurements fig 3c are within the range previously reported by gelda and effler 2002 60 to 300 mmol m 2 d 1 in a hypereutrophic lake and close to an overall estimation for lakes published by koschorreck et al 2017 90 to 90 mmol m 2 d 1 3 3 bioprocesses rates microbial activity profiles were determined for each season at lg 6 and ll 4 which had mean depths of 10 7 4 2 and 16 5 0 5 m respectively regarding ch4 as standardly observed in most lakes and reservoirs a clear methanotrophic activity was observed in both lakes however irregular trends were observed in lg while a relatively smooth and constant pattern was observed in ll figure s2 since the standard deviations of the triplicate measurements were smaller than the observed variations experimental noise was discarded as a possible explanation of that observed behavior irregular patterns of methanotrophic activity with drastic variations within short depth intervals have been previously observed thalasso et al 2020 and hypothesized to be the result of complex transitions between aerobic and anaerobic ch4 production oxidation along the water column it is noteworthy that during the dry cold season a positive production rate of 13 55 mmol ch4 m 3 d 1 was found at the bottom of the water column in lg which is a clear indication of methanogenesis equally noticeable is the maximum methanotrophic rate of 30 08 mmol ch4 m 3 d 1 found during the wet season 8 m below the oxic superficial layer and 8 m below the photic depth which was estimated to be at 4 m from the secchi disk depth and according to the french et al 1982 methodology since incubations were done under dark and anaerobic conditions no o2 added do concentration undetectable the methanotrophic rates observed below 5 m strongly suggest anaerobic oxidation of methane aom the latter has been previously reported to naturally occur in lakes martinez cruz et al 2018 in terms of co2 the production rates found in lg were higher than those observed in ll but were limited to the oxic epilimnion notably a negative co2 production rate was observed at the depth where aom was found which suggests the presence of autotrophic assimilation of co2 coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation kellermann et al 2012 or other autotrophic processes such as homoacetogenesis or iron oxidation bryce et al 2018 lay et al 1998 conversely a significant co2 production rate was found in the water column where methanogenesis was observed which could indicate dominant acetoclastic methanogenesis however no conclusion can be reached as other anaerobic processes producing co2 could have taken place requiring a more detailed study to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in ll co2 production was found at almost all depths of the water column over the three seasons but was highly variable it is worth reiterating that these tests were performed under dark conditions and reflect respiration i e they do not account for primary production in terms of do a respiration rate was observed only at the oxic epilimnion of lg as expected from the do profiles in ll respiration was found along the entire water column with a distinctive local minimum at 10 m over the three seasons 3 4 spatiotemporal variations and overall metabolism a global mass balance was established from measurements at lg 6 and ll 4 which considered a limited number of dominant processes expressed per unit of lake area i e methanotrophy methanogenesis respiration primary production and emissions from to the atmosphere the magnitude of each process is listed in table 1 along with the parameters of spatiotemporal distribution of cch4 cco2 and cdo the total mass of each dissolved gas present in the water column m x and their corresponding turnover time θ x it should be noted that the steady state condition assumed during the model development was confirmed by experimental data i e the variation of m x between seasons represented on average 1 69 1 13 of r x t o t all of the determined parameters listed in table 1 were also included in a graphical representation fig 4 facilitating the overall appraisal of the carbon cycle at a glance this figure shows drastic differences between the two reservoirs thus illustrating the impact of eutrophication on the carbon cycle i the magnitude of the ch4 cycle in lg was significantly higher than that of ll p 0 01 ii despite differences in magnitude the distribution of the processes linked to the ch4 cycle were similar in both reservoirs iii the magnitude of the do cycle was lower in lg than in ll p 0 02 iv the flux components were more important in lg than in ll v r c o 2 m g was negative in lg and positive in ll vi gpp was a relatively minor component of the carbon cycle in lg and a dominant component in ll and vii the co2 and o2 cycles were more balanced in ll than in lg as evidenced by similitude in size and processes share the same exercise was done regarding seasonality illustrated in fig s3 which indicates that the variation among seasons was moderate meanwhile large variations were observed between the two ecosystems not only in terms of magnitude but also in the contribution of each bioprocess this observation suggests that the impact of the trophic state on the carbon cycle is greater than that of seasonality regarding parameter seasonality as shown on fig 2 a relatively moderate seasonal variation of dissolved gas concentration was observed indeed the coefficient of variation cv i e standard deviation divided by the mean of the mass of dissolved gas contained in the entire water column m x table 1 was 28 4 1 37 in lg and 28 5 16 2 in ll when considering together ch4 co2 and o2 similarly the cv related to the homogeneity factors hp of the three gasses was varying by 14 0 7 6 in lg and 8 8 6 0 in ll thus the total content of ch4 co2 and o2 contained in the reservoirs as well as their spatial distributions were varying moderately probably due to the moderate seasonal variations of temperature and water column stability table 1 and supplementary data at aguirrezabala cámpano and thalasso 2021 thus lg and ll were both characterized by a moderate monomictic regime which is a characteristic of subtropical ecosystems wetzel 2001 parameters listed in table 1 and illustrated in fig 4 show that lg contained on average and over the three seasons 76 times more ch4 in the water column than ll this storage would suggest a disbalance between the main ch4 production pathway methanogenesis and the main ch4 output of our model atmospheric emissions and methanotrophy however a closer analysis shows that it was not the case as r c h 4 m g was about 15 times higher in lg than in ll while f c h 4 and r c h 4 m t were respectively 17 and 14 times higher in lg than in ll thus undoubtedly eutrophication in lg induced higher methanogenesis but also higher methanotrophy and emissions to the atmosphere with the same magnitude compared to ll the higher ch4 storage was reflected by a higher turnover time in lg than in ll with θ c h 4 being 9 3 3 7 d in lg and 1 9 1 2 d in ll the opposite trend to ch4 was observed regarding do with m o 2 10 times higher in ll than lg as a result of the relatively high photosynthetic do production observed in ll above the relatively low respiration as a result of the latter the do cycle was more dynamic in lg than in ll with a θ o 2 of 4 4 0 6 and 12 5 3 8 d respectively in terms of co2 an important contrast between lg and ll was also observed indeed m c o 2 was three times higher in lg than in ll in ll a deficit of co2 production compared to co2 uptake by primary production was compensated for by a co2 input from the atmosphere while in lg a large co2 production and relatively low primary production resulted in important emissions despite these drastic disparities a relatively small difference in terms of θ co2 was observed at 19 2 8 9 and 10 1 3 6 d for lg and ll respectively notably fig 4 and table 1 also indicate a depleted gpp in lg despite it having a higher concentration of nutrients and trophic level than ll photosynthesis is known to be inhibited by compounds that could potentially be present in the wastewater discharged into lg such as nh3 herbicides sulfide and humic substances chen et al 2020 choi et al 2012 godos et al 2010 leusch et al 2014 misaki et al 2019 chlorophyll a concentrations confirmed the hypothesis of depleted gpp in lg as it ranged from 0 59 to 52 64 µg m 3 conagua 2019 which is in the lower range of hypereutrophic ecosystems i e 9 5 275 µg m 3 wetzel 2001 the combination of depleted gpp and high respiration in lg suggests that allochthonous carbon was the main substrate for respiration in lg cole et al 2000 meanwhile autochthonous carbon input from gpp always exceeded r in ll the dominance of autotrophic over heterotrophic activity is further evidenced by the mean gpp r ratio which was 3 17 1 31 in ll and 0 34 0 40 in lg in addition to these observations fig 4 also indicates a negative r c o 2 m g in lg which is in direct contrast to that observed in ll although there are several fermentative processes that consume and produce co2 the observed contrast between lg and ll could suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis prevailed in ll while the hydrogenotrophic pathway was dominant in lg this is surprising since methanogenesis in the water column of lg was observed along with a net co2 production which is usually indicative of acetoclastic methanogenesis this would suggest a shift of the dominant pathway between the sediments and the water column although it bears repeating that a more detailed analysis would be required to elucidate the methanogenic pathway additionally r c o 2 m g was considered as a buffer compartment in our model therefore r c o 2 m g consists primarily of the ch4 produced in the sediments and transferred to the water column but also any other unidentified biological or abiotic process including potentially autotrophic processes aside from the main bioprocesses rates the spatiotemporal distribution of cch4 cco2 and cdo offers an additional scope on the carbon cycle for instance cdo was the parameter most heterogeneously distributed in lg homogeneity index of 25 while in the same reservoir cco2 was the most homogeneously distributed parameter homogeneity index of 83 as suggested by gonzalez valencia et al 2019 the comparison of the homogeneity index values of several compounds is an indicator of which compounds are in excess and or deficit an overabundant compound is more likely to be evenly distributed which seems to be confirmed here indeed the low homogeneity index observed for cdo in lg appears to be caused by the dominant anoxic conditions reflecting a do limitation while the homogeneous distribution of cco2 suggests that respiration surpassed primary production causing an abundant cco2 based on that premise the order of the dissolved gasses from excess to deficit was co2 ch4 o2 in lg and o2 co2 ch4 in ll which is in line with the dominant heterotrophic and autotrophic overall metabolism in lg and ll respectively together with the homogeneity index the nhm also provides the anisotropic dominant direction in this case it was mostly depthward positive anisotropic factor figs 4 and s3 which is in accordance with the concept of water column stratification notably in lg the anisotropic factors of ch4 co2 and do were linearly correlated to the schmidt stability with a r2 0 998 p 0 01 n 4 unlike ll where no clear correlation was observed thus stratification is not the dominant factor that influences the anisotropy of dissolved gas distribution in ll in general the predominant direction of anisotropy in ll was slighter and more stable across seasons than that of lg to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the impact of anthropogenic pollution is reported through a mass balance combined with gas emissions and the major bioprocesses rates for ch4 co2 and o2 most of the parameters as well as the graphical representation indicated the strong impact of anthropogenic pollution on the carbon cycle in lg there the emission of ch4 as well as the rates of methanogenesis and methanotrophy were significantly higher than those of ll as standardly observed in eutrophicated waters huttunen et al 2003 zhou et al 2020 similarly the pollution had a clear effect on dissolved oxygen turning the water column dominantly anoxic which was partially compensated for by oxygen transfer from the atmosphere despite these observations several results are apparently contradictory to what is standardly expected in eutrophicated waters among these we observed a relatively depleted primary production an increase in co2 emissions and a low do production table 1 however it is worth noting that the mass balances and the resulting graphical representation were established over the entire water column while the photic depth in lg was limited to 4 m and do was detected only in the first 2 4 m of the water column thus the mass balance approach used in the present work gives an overview of the complete ecosystem status and not only of the photic zone where eutrophication is standardly more apparent this explains for instance why despite the anthropogenic pollution in lg processes like photosynthesis and aerobic respiration were lower than in ll thus the mass balance approach presented here is applicable only to the entire water column and a future development to allow for the characterization of a specific section of the water column would be beneficial in that case however the mass balance equation should be modified to consider vertical transport along the water column which is challenging especially when water column stability is weak as observed in lg and ll 4 conclusion as shown in the present work a large number of overall parameters were determined from a relatively reduced number of field measurements including flux dissolved concentration and several bioprocess rates of ch4 co2 and o2 which were integrated in a mass balance model an arbitrary selection of parameters was done to exhaustively describe the carbon cycling in two reservoirs over three seasons all of these parameters were included in a single graphical representation which allows for an overall appraisal of the carbon cycle at a glance this approach revealed the share of each major process in the ch4 co2 and o2 cycles as well as several spatiotemporal attributes of their distribution and turnover the combination of a comprehensive study and an integrative graphical representation facilitates seasonal comparisons between the ecosystems in the present study this approach vividly showed how allochthonous pollution deeply modifies the global functioning of

17089,the impact of cultural eutrophication on carbon cycling in subtropical reservoirs was assessed using high resolution measurements of dissolved gas concentration atmospheric exchange and uptake production rates of methane carbon dioxide and oxygen seasonal measurements were performed in two reservoirs that pertain to the same hydrological basin but are drastically different in terms of allochthonous carbon input these results were used to feed a mass balance model from which a large number of overall parameters were determined to explicitly describe the dynamics and spatial attributes of the carbon cycle in the reservoirs a single graphical representation of each reservoir was created to facilitate an overall appraisal of the carbon cycle the impact of cultural eutrophication was profound and resulted in a complete redistribution of how the various bioprocesses participated in the methane carbon dioxide and oxygen cycles among several identified impacts of eutrophication it was observed that while eutrophication triggered increased methane production this effect was followed by a similar increase in methane emissions and methanotrophic rates while gross primary production was depleted graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction despite their relatively small contribution to the global landscape freshwater ecosystems have been identified as an important natural source of methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 which act as greenhouse gasses when released into the atmosphere tranvik et al 2009 many processes are involved in the carbon cycle and they directly impact the greenhouse gas emissions from lakes and reservoirs among these ch4 production methanogenesis and ch4 oxidation methanotrophy are the dominant bioprocesses involved in ch4 emissions while mineral dissolution primary production and heterotrophic respiration are those most closely related to co2 emissions bridgham et al 2013 cole and caraco 2001 morales williams et al 2020 these processes interact and create a complex metabolic network that is regulated to a great extent by the availability of oxygen o2 ch4 and co2 together with nutrient and organic carbon concentrations as well as physicochemical conditions in addition to these processes naturally occurring in aquatic ecosystems the input of sewage fertilizers and other nutrient sources have a significant impact on the carbon cycle such as causing eutrophication which has become a growing global problem on a large scale istvánovics 2009 wen et al 2017 the impact of eutrophication on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions has been thoroughly described beaulieu et al 2019 delsontro et al 2018 overall nutrient inputs trigger algal growth which results in increased dissolved and particulate organic matter part of which settles to the sediment layer where most of the methanogenesis takes place duc et al 2010 concomitantly the higher dissolved and particulate organic matter also promotes heterotrophic respiration within the water column thus depleting dissolved oxygen due to bacterial respiration resulting in less appropriate conditions for aerobic methanotrophy hernandez et al 2015 thus it has been well established that eutrophication induces higher methane emissions beaulieu et al 2019 gonzalez valencia et al 2014b in terms of carbon dioxide eutrophication promotes primary production and therefore co2 capture grasset et al 2020 pacheco et al 2014 however contrasting results have been reported some showing higher co2 emission in eutrophicated ecosystems huttunen et al 2003 kortelainen et al 2006 zhou et al 2020 the main reason for these contrasting observations is probably caused by chemical dependency of the inorganic carbon equilibrium and by the nature of the pollutants causing eutrophication indeed if pollutants are limited to nutrients morales williams et al 2017 they act mostly on primary production whereas if they are accompanied by organic carbon tranvik et al 2009 they also promote aerobic respiration in addition to primary production given the large number of processes and parameters involved the carbon cycle and more specifically the greenhouse gas emissions are highly variable not only among water bodies or seasons but also within a given ecosystem due to this complexity and spatiotemporal variability the overall description and comparison of aquatic ecosystems in broad terms is a difficult task two approaches can be used to describe the overall carbon cycle mass balances and or overall parameters that numerically describe a given feature of the studied ecosystem the mass balance approach consists of describing the overall carbon cycle in an ecosystem by a gray model fed with a limited number of interconnected processes by closing the mass balance some individual processes which could otherwise not be determined experimentally can be derived this approach has been used for in depth analysis of either a single component or a reduced number of the carbon cycle components li et al 2020 santoso et al 2020 in the same context overall parameters usually link several components of the studied cycles that are relevant to a given feature among these some examples are i the net ecosystem productivity nep which indicates whether the ecosystem is predominantly autotrophic or heterotrophic lovett et al 2006 ii the proportion of gross primary production gpp or nep that is lost as greenhouse gas whiting and chanton 1993 iii the mean oxidation reduction potential which defines whether oxidative or reductive processes predominate in the ecosystem mcmahon and chapelle 2008 iv the sestonic c n p ratio that provides insights into the biological processes v the homogeneity and anisotropic factors that describe the spatiotemporal distribution of a given parameter gonzalez valencia et al 2019 and vi the trophic state index which establishes the level of eutrophication in numeric terms merging mass balance and overall parameters would be a beneficial approach for a simplified yet meaningful description of the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems in this context the first objective of the present work was to combine mass balances as many overall parameters as possible and several spatiotemporal attributes into a single graphical representation thus facilitating the overall appraisal of the carbon cycle in lakes and reservoirs at a glance the second objective was to test this approach in subtropical reservoirs over three characteristic seasons based on high resolution measurements of ch4 co2 and o2 related processes the third objective was to use this approach to establish the impact of cultural eutrophication on the carbon cycle in subtropical reservoirs our study was therefore conducted in two reservoirs that pertain to the same hydrological basin but are drastically different in terms of allochthonous carbon input one reservoir is located in a natural protected area while the other is surrounded by an urban area and receives a high input of sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling campaigns two subtropical reservoirs that belong to the same hydrological basin located close to mexico city were selected lago de guadalupe lg 19 6333 99 2602 and lago el llano ll 19 6582 99 5071 the former is a dendritic reservoir with an area of 450 ha and is located 2300 m above sea level lg receives an estimated flow of 0 5 m3 s 1 of untreated wastewater from the surrounding densely populated urban areas sepulveda jauregui et al 2013 contrastingly ll is a u shaped 6 ha reservoir situated 2840 m above sea level in a protected area that receives water from springs and a pristine tributary river both reservoirs have a subtropical climate of warm summers and mild winters with an average annual air temperature of 17 c and 15 c for lg and ll respectively six monitoring and sampling stations mss were established in lg and five were set up in ll fig 1 since lg is characterized by a clear longitudinal zonation the mss locations were selected to cover the fluvial and lacustrine zones i e southwest to northeast in ll the mss were distributed to cover both arms of the u shape it is worth noting that the selection of the number of mss in lg was established after an earlier campaign in which ch4 flux dissolved gasses concentration and ph were measured gonzález valencia et al 2019 several semivariograms were determined from these data and those that minimized the error were selected willmott and matsuura 2006 to establish the range in ll four mss were selected along the main axis of the lake to allow for interpolation and mapping see section 2 8 and an additional mss was selected in the lateral arm of the reservoir both reservoirs were monitored in august 2018 january 2019 and may 2019 which correspond to the three annual seasons of the area i e mild and rainy wet cold and dry dry cold and warm and dry dry hot respectively 2 2 limnological characteristics temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured at each mss with a multi parametric probe hi 9828 hanna instruments mexico from the surface to the sediments at depth intervals of 0 25 m surface water samples were taken from each mss additional water samples were taken at 1 m depth intervals from the surface to the bottom at lg 6 fig 1a and ll 4 fig 1b the water samples were collected with a horizontal 2 2 l van dorn bottle wildco mexico and handled according to standard methods apha et al 2012 they were used to determine the total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and orthophosphate po4 3 concentrations toc and tn were determined using a shimadzu toc analyzer equipped with a total nitrogen module model toc vcn tnm whereas po4 3 concentrations were determined with a colorimetric standard method apha et al 2012 the secchi depth was determined with a 0 2 m secchi disk at each mss these measurements were used to establish the trophic state of each lake according to wetzel 2001 and carlson 1977 the thermocline depth and the schmidt stability which indicates the resistance to mechanical mixing due to stratification were obtained from temperature profiles using the rlakeanalyzer package winslow et al 2019 of r software version 3 6 2 r core team 2020 2 3 fluxes of greenhouse gasses and oxygen we used the floating static chamber method to measure ch4 and co2 fluxes the floating static chamber was connected to an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga los gatos research usa in a closed circuit a continuous five minute measurement was used to determine diffusive fluxes from ch4 and co2 concentrations the first 30 s after positioning the floating static chamber on the water surface were discarded each flux determination was done in triplicate with a measurement data logging frequency of 1 hz in some cases ebullitive events occurred while measuring fluxes in order to filter these a threshold was set to differentiate diffusive and ebullitive emissions i e an abrupt increase of concentration at least five times higher than the linear slope observed during diffusive fluxes and for five seconds or more the total flux was defined as the mean concentration slope of the entire measurement whereas the ebullitive flux was defined as the difference between the total flux and the diffusive flux the o2 flux was determined theoretically by using an approach similar to jähne et al 1987 and wanninkhof 2014 here measured co2 fluxes f c o 2 were used to determine the o2 mass transfer coefficient of the boundary layer in this approach co2 fluxes were preferred over ch4 given that co2 was emitted only via diffusion briefly o2 fluxes f o 2 were calculated as follows 1 f o 2 k o 2 h o 2 p o 2 w p o 2 a i r where ko2 is the o2 mass transfer coefficient m h 1 see below ho2 is the henry constant for o2 mole m 3 atm sander 2017 and po2 w and po2 air are the oxygen partial pressure measured in the surface water and in the atmosphere atm respectively these partial pressures were determined according to eq 2 as follows 2 p o 2 w c d o h o 2 p o 2 a i r 0 21 p a t m where cdo is the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water and patm is the absolute atmospheric pressure atm to determine k o2 the f c o 2 was first used to determine the co2 mass transfer coefficient kco2 as per eq 3 which is equivalent to eq 1 3 k c o 2 f c o 2 h c o 2 p c o 2 w p c o 2 a i r once k co2 was determined k o2 was obtained as follows 4 k o 2 k c o 2 0 851 0 5 1 084 k c o 2 where 0 851 is the ratio between the schmidt numbers of o2 and co2 as recommended by wanninkhof 2014 and 0 5 is an adjustment parameter recommended by cole et al 2010 for low wind conditions 2 4 dissolved gas concentration the dissolved ch4 cch4 and co2 cco2 concentrations in the water column were determined on site with a previously reported m icos method gonzalez valencia et al 2014a briefly this method consists of a gas liquid exchange module pdmsxa 1000 medarray inc usa through which water extracted from the reservoir flows constantly on the shell side of the gas exchange module while a ch4 and co2 free nitrogen counterflows inside the silicone fibers i e exchange area of 1000 cm2 diffusive forces from the concentration gradient promote transfer of the dissolved ch4 and co2 contained in the water to the gas phase where they are quantified by the ugga in the present study the water was continuously extracted at the desired depth with a peristaltic pump 12 v solinst mexico at a flow rate of 1 2 l min 1 while the ch4 and co2 free nitrogen was flowing at a constant flow rate of 0 75 l min 1 controlled by a mass flow controller gfc 17 aalborg mexico the setup was calibrated as specified in the method at the beginning and at the end of each measurement day with a standard headspace equilibration technique gonzalez valencia et al 2014a the cch4 and cco2 profiles were obtained by placing the extraction probe just below the water surface for about 60 s afterwards the probe was allowed to descend steadily at a rate of approximately 1 m min 1 until it reached the bottom where it was kept for an additional 30 s additionally a flow through oxygen optode ftc pst3 presens germany was included in the water extraction line allowing the simultaneous determination of dissolved oxygen concentration cdo using this procedure about 60 data points of dissolved gasses were acquired for each meter of water column depth the lower detection limit of the m icos method coupled with the do sensor under the present configuration was 0 005 mmol m 3 for cch4 4 mmol m 3 for cco2 and 0 625 mmol m 3 for cdo 2 5 methane carbon dioxide and oxygen production and uptake rates water samples were taken with a van dorn bottle usually guided by cch4 and cdo profiles to measure the ch4 production and oxidation rates at several characteristic water depths the samples were immediately and carefully transferred to 50 ml glass syringes that included an optical oxygen sensor spot pst 3 or pst 6 presens germany previously fixed to the inside wall close to the syringe output the difference between pst 3 or pst 6 sensors is their lower detection limits and ranges expressed in air saturation percentage of 0 03 100 and 0 002 5 respectively thus pst 6 sensors were preferred for low do and anaerobic samples once the samples had been collected the syringes were taken to the laboratory for incubation under dark conditions at a constant temperature similar to that of the reservoirs then at pre established time intervals cdo was determined and 2 ml sub samples were transferred into 5 ml plastic syringes to which 3 ml of ch4 and co2 free nitrogen were added the sub sample syringes were vigorously shaken for 30 s to allow for equilibration the liquid volume was evacuated and the 3 ml gas content of the syringe was injected through a septum into a continuous flow of nitrogen passing through an open circuit into the ugga the presence of ch4 and co2 in the sample was detected as a peak response that was integrated after proper calibration lastly cch4 and cco2 in the liquid sub samples were derived from henry s solubility constant sander 2017 these incubations were sustained for five to seven days during that time a total of five to six triplicate measurements of cch4 cco2 and cdo were done to ascertain the ch4 co2 and do production uptake rates it is worth noting that this protocol allowed for the determination of the production uptake rates without headspace addition thus the laboratory conditions matched those prevalent in the reservoirs as we will show in the next section these incubations were used to quantify methanotrophy methanogenesis and respiration in terms of ch4 co2 and do production or uptake rates we acknowledge that incubations under dark conditions may have had some impact on the processes occurring in samples collected from the photic zone of the reservoirs indeed the absence of light prevented potential organic matter mineralization via photochemical transformation bertilsson and tranvik 2000 tranvik et al 2009 and light inhibition of aerobic methanotrophy dumestre et al 1999 morana et al 2020 murase and sugimoto 2005 despite these limitations using incubations in dark conditions allowed to close the mass balance 2 6 mass balance the full mass balance calculations and assumptions are described in detail in the supplementary material section s1 1 in this section the experimentally determined parameters are notated with an asterisk briefly assuming steady state the ch4 balance over the entire water column and sediments was considered as a three compartment system i methanogenesis mg described by the methanogenic rate r c h 4 m g ii methanotrophy mt described by the methanotrophic rate r c h 4 m t and iii emissions to from the atmosphere f c h 4 of these two were measured r c h 4 m t and f c h 4 which then allowed r c h 4 m g to be calculated the do balance consisted of three compartments i respiration r described by the respiratory rate r o 2 r ii oxygen production described by the gross primary production gpp r o 2 g p p and iii atmospheric exchange f o 2 the rate r o 2 r was measured f o 2 was estimated from the dissolved oxygen gradient which in turn allowed r o 2 g p p to be determined the co2 balance was considered as a four compartment model i mg which is described by r c o 2 m g and can result in co2 production acetoclastic pathway or uptake hydrogenotrophic pathway ii r in the water column described by r c o 2 r iii the gpp in the photic zone of the water column described by r c o 2 g p p and iv emission to from the atmosphere f c o 2 in this case only two of these four compartments were measured r c o 2 r and f c o 2 thus r c o 2 g p p was determined from r o 2 g p p assuming a constant r c o 2 g p p to r o 2 g p p ratio of 1 2 wetzel et al 2000 once r c o 2 g p p was determined r c o 2 m g was estimated by closing the mass balance in these mass balance equations negative rate values indicate uptake or efflux of a given molecule while positive values indicate production or influx the steady state assumption used in this mass balance model will be discussed in the results and discussion section in addition to process rates for each compound x ch4 o2 and co2 the total mass of x in the water column was determined according to 5 m x i 1 n c x δ i where δi is the depth section of the water column corresponding to each concentration measurement c x finally the turnover time θ x which is the mean time that m x remains within the water column was defined to that end a total rate was defined for each compound r x t o t which is the sum of all positive rates involved in the compound mass balance 6 θ x m x r x t o t 2 7 numerical homogeneity model the numerical homogeneity model nhm gonzalez valencia et al 2019 was implemented to explore the spatial distribution of the dissolved gas concentrations and to assign a numerical value to the distribution briefly this model includes a homogeneity index hp which represents the homogeneity of the parameter p along two dimensions x y in our case longitudinal distance along the reservoir transect and depth the significance of this quantity is that for a nonhomogeneous distribution 0 hp 100 while for a homogeneous distribution hp 100 furthermore to establish in which dimension heterogeneities are dominant the nhm also defines an anisotropic factor ωp that indicates the angle of the heterogeneities in the two dimensional space this value ranges from 45 when heterogeneities are observed only in the x dimension length to 45 for heterogeneities observed only in the y dimension depth 2 8 data treatment and statistics the dplyr package was used in r software to determine the mean and standard deviation of the physicochemical parameters wickham et al 2020 data collected during the campaigns were smoothed by weighted linear least squares and a savitzky golay filter using matlab version 2015a mathworks usa the smoothed data were then used to generate contour maps of dissolved gas concentration the contour maps were generated by interpolation of the high resolution data using surfer 11 0 software golden software usa the surfer software provides 10 interpolation methods from which the best was chosen according to willmott and matsuura 2006 using the mean absolute error mae and the mean bias error mbe as selection criteria we log transformed our data in order to compare means between reservoirs given that aquatic ecosystems usually show log normal distribution st pierre et al 2018 welch s t test was used in matlab to compare the annual means from the log transformed data of the reservoirs 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization clear differences were observed in the water physicochemical parameters measured in both reservoirs as expected based on the urban vs natural ecosystems surrounding lg and ll respectively the wastewater discharged into lg resulted in mean seasonal toc ranging from 0 82 to 2 55 mmol l 1 meanwhile the values observed in ll ranged from 0 23 to 0 56 mmol l 1 in lg the seasonal mean tn ranged from 0 95 to 1 28 mmol l 1 whereas in ll it ranged from 0 011 to 0 015 mmol l 1 the mean seasonal po4 3 concentration ranged from 17 to 22 µmol l 1 in lg while in ll the concentration was between 0 7 and 2 µmol l 1 differences in terms of element balance were also observed between the reservoirs as reflected by the stoichiometric c n p molar ratio which was on average 171 53 1 in lg and 582 10 1 in ll these ratios revealed no nutrient limitation in lg whereas a moderate to severe n and p limitation was observed in ll wetzel 2001 a significant difference in terms of water transparency was also observed with a mean secchi disk depth in lg of 0 75 0 42 m while in ll the mean secchi disk depth was 2 71 0 93 m p 0 01 reductive processes predominated in lg as shown by a mean orp of 124 36 488 mv while in ll oxidation prevailed with mean orp of 94 32 97 07 mv mcmahon and chapelle 2008 according to wetzel 2001 the physicochemical parameters of lg were in line with those commonly found in eutrophic hypereutrophic ecosystems while ll corresponded to a mesotrophic site although orthophosphate concentration was slightly above the level associated to that trophic state 3 2 dissolved gasses and gas emission the cch4 was subject to a large spatial variability as shown in the contour maps fig 2 a the cch4 concentration in ll was on average 50 times lower than that of lg in all cases these concentrations corresponded to an oversaturation relative to the atmospheric ch4 by four to five orders of magnitude in lg and three orders of magnitude in ll which indicates that both reservoirs are sources of atmospheric ch4 surface cch4 observed in ll and lg was generally higher than in other subtropical reservoirs table s2 and world lakes of the same class size holgerson and raymond 2016 contrastingly bottom cch4 was in the lower range of reported values for tropical and subtropical ecosystems table s2 in ll and within the range in lg together higher surface cch4 and similar or lower bottom cch4 suggest a lower ch4 oxidation and or a better ch4 transfer from the bottom to the surface water than is usually seen in other lakes the latter is further supported by relatively low schmidt numbers ranging from 13 8 55 1 j m 2 in lg and 38 9 96 6 j m 2 in ll which reflects a relatively weak thermal stratification for both reservoirs considering that schmidt numbers as high as 1 104 j m 2 have been reported wetzel 2001 as expected from the large variability of cch4 ch4 fluxes were also highly variable figs 3 a and 3b it is worth remembering that according to the model explained in section 2 6 negative values indicate emission to the atmosphere efflux whereas positive values indicate capture from the atmosphere influx mean ch4 total fluxes were 128 5 222 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and 62 0 155 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in lg and ll respectively ebullition was a major emission mode in lg and was observed consistently in all readings with the exception of those from three mss during the wet season this resulted in ebullition accounting for 72 27 of the total flux in ll ebullition was more sporadic and was detected on only four occasions during our study in the shallow zone of the lake ll 1 and or ll 2 given the relatively low diffusive flux despite being sporadic ebullition in ll was responsible for the highest rates of emission measured fig 3b however the sporadic nature of ebullition implies that the few bubbles observed in ll cannot be considered to accurately establish the percentage of ebullitive flux ch4 emissions in lg and ll were higher than expected based on their respective trophic states as detailed by deemer et al 2016 moreover emissions observed in lg are within the higher range of fluxes from brazilian reservoirs 83 5 to 0 62 mmol m 2 d 1 de mello et al 2018 dos santos et al 2006 and are even comparable to those reported for dairy and swine farm wastewater lagoons 3125 to 6 25 mmol m 2 d 1 grant and boehm 2015 leytem et al 2017 sharpe and harper 1999 notably cco2 was subject to a narrower range than cch4 fig 2b from 84 2 to 593 5 mmol m 3 in lg and from 5 9 to 197 5 mmol m 3 in ll in lg the mean cco2 over the entire column was about 25 times higher than the atmospheric equilibrium concentration while in ll the mean cco2 was 4 times above equilibrium in terms of emissions the mean total co2 flux was 107 70 78 60 mmol m 2 d 1 in lg which is within the higher range previously reported from other subtropical reservoirs table s2 and eutrophic aquatic ecosystems i e 76 27 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 in ll despite observing an overall supersaturation of co2 in the water column the surface waters were often undersaturated resulting in predominantly positive co2 fluxes at 9 5 13 6 mmol m 2 d 1 the latter is also in accordance with emissions previously reported from oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs i e 15 10 to 6 99 mmol m 2 d 1 deemer et al 2016 thus ll can be considered as a co2 sink and a dominantly autotrophic ecosystem whereas lg is a source of co2 and a dominantly heterotrophic ecosystem fig 3d overall freshwater ecosystems are generally considered sources of co2 duarte and prairie 2005 morales williams et al 2020 while eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs often results in a transition to co2 sink as primary productivity elicited by nutrients exceeds heterotrophic respiration grasset et al 2020 pacheco et al 2014 in the present study we observed the opposite tendency which could be explained by the large input of sewage in lg resulting in a relatively high input of allochthonous carbon thus promoting heterotrophic respiration caraco and cole 2004 an alternative explanation is the possible partial inhibition of primary production which will be discussed in section 3 4 in lg the eutrophic hypereutrophic conditions promoted aerobic heterotrophic respiratory processes and do depletion as shown in the cdo contour maps fig 2c throughout the three campaigns most of the lg water column was characterized by cdo values that were below the detection limit of the method while mean seasonal cdo were within the dysoxic range tyson and pearson 1991 i e from 10 68 25 36 to 26 45 65 8 mmol m 3 which corresponds to 5 59 13 85 saturation these low cdo are below survival levels for regular macrobiota u s epa 2000 and are an additional indicator of the polluted state of lg notably cdo close to saturation mss 5 or even above saturation mss 6 were observed in surface water during the wet season caused by local algal bloom aside from this local anomaly seasonality was low and the total mass of do was characterized by a seasonal cv of 28 all year round a fully oxygenated water column was observed in ll with mean seasonal cdo levels ranging from 198 53 to 272 24 mmol m 3 which corresponds to 93 127 saturation and the total mass of do over the entire water column was characterized by a seasonal cv of 8 the oversaturation commonly observed in ll confirms the dominant autotrophic nature of the reservoir in lg the observed do undersaturation was partly compensated for by influxes from the atmosphere with seasonal means ranging from 23 65 to 137 93 mmol m 2 d 1 in contrast ll was a source of o2 to the atmosphere with mean seasonal fluxes ranging from 23 92 to 4 94 mmol m 2 d 1 although diffusive o2 fluxes are not extensively reported in the literature our measurements fig 3c are within the range previously reported by gelda and effler 2002 60 to 300 mmol m 2 d 1 in a hypereutrophic lake and close to an overall estimation for lakes published by koschorreck et al 2017 90 to 90 mmol m 2 d 1 3 3 bioprocesses rates microbial activity profiles were determined for each season at lg 6 and ll 4 which had mean depths of 10 7 4 2 and 16 5 0 5 m respectively regarding ch4 as standardly observed in most lakes and reservoirs a clear methanotrophic activity was observed in both lakes however irregular trends were observed in lg while a relatively smooth and constant pattern was observed in ll figure s2 since the standard deviations of the triplicate measurements were smaller than the observed variations experimental noise was discarded as a possible explanation of that observed behavior irregular patterns of methanotrophic activity with drastic variations within short depth intervals have been previously observed thalasso et al 2020 and hypothesized to be the result of complex transitions between aerobic and anaerobic ch4 production oxidation along the water column it is noteworthy that during the dry cold season a positive production rate of 13 55 mmol ch4 m 3 d 1 was found at the bottom of the water column in lg which is a clear indication of methanogenesis equally noticeable is the maximum methanotrophic rate of 30 08 mmol ch4 m 3 d 1 found during the wet season 8 m below the oxic superficial layer and 8 m below the photic depth which was estimated to be at 4 m from the secchi disk depth and according to the french et al 1982 methodology since incubations were done under dark and anaerobic conditions no o2 added do concentration undetectable the methanotrophic rates observed below 5 m strongly suggest anaerobic oxidation of methane aom the latter has been previously reported to naturally occur in lakes martinez cruz et al 2018 in terms of co2 the production rates found in lg were higher than those observed in ll but were limited to the oxic epilimnion notably a negative co2 production rate was observed at the depth where aom was found which suggests the presence of autotrophic assimilation of co2 coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation kellermann et al 2012 or other autotrophic processes such as homoacetogenesis or iron oxidation bryce et al 2018 lay et al 1998 conversely a significant co2 production rate was found in the water column where methanogenesis was observed which could indicate dominant acetoclastic methanogenesis however no conclusion can be reached as other anaerobic processes producing co2 could have taken place requiring a more detailed study to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in ll co2 production was found at almost all depths of the water column over the three seasons but was highly variable it is worth reiterating that these tests were performed under dark conditions and reflect respiration i e they do not account for primary production in terms of do a respiration rate was observed only at the oxic epilimnion of lg as expected from the do profiles in ll respiration was found along the entire water column with a distinctive local minimum at 10 m over the three seasons 3 4 spatiotemporal variations and overall metabolism a global mass balance was established from measurements at lg 6 and ll 4 which considered a limited number of dominant processes expressed per unit of lake area i e methanotrophy methanogenesis respiration primary production and emissions from to the atmosphere the magnitude of each process is listed in table 1 along with the parameters of spatiotemporal distribution of cch4 cco2 and cdo the total mass of each dissolved gas present in the water column m x and their corresponding turnover time θ x it should be noted that the steady state condition assumed during the model development was confirmed by experimental data i e the variation of m x between seasons represented on average 1 69 1 13 of r x t o t all of the determined parameters listed in table 1 were also included in a graphical representation fig 4 facilitating the overall appraisal of the carbon cycle at a glance this figure shows drastic differences between the two reservoirs thus illustrating the impact of eutrophication on the carbon cycle i the magnitude of the ch4 cycle in lg was significantly higher than that of ll p 0 01 ii despite differences in magnitude the distribution of the processes linked to the ch4 cycle were similar in both reservoirs iii the magnitude of the do cycle was lower in lg than in ll p 0 02 iv the flux components were more important in lg than in ll v r c o 2 m g was negative in lg and positive in ll vi gpp was a relatively minor component of the carbon cycle in lg and a dominant component in ll and vii the co2 and o2 cycles were more balanced in ll than in lg as evidenced by similitude in size and processes share the same exercise was done regarding seasonality illustrated in fig s3 which indicates that the variation among seasons was moderate meanwhile large variations were observed between the two ecosystems not only in terms of magnitude but also in the contribution of each bioprocess this observation suggests that the impact of the trophic state on the carbon cycle is greater than that of seasonality regarding parameter seasonality as shown on fig 2 a relatively moderate seasonal variation of dissolved gas concentration was observed indeed the coefficient of variation cv i e standard deviation divided by the mean of the mass of dissolved gas contained in the entire water column m x table 1 was 28 4 1 37 in lg and 28 5 16 2 in ll when considering together ch4 co2 and o2 similarly the cv related to the homogeneity factors hp of the three gasses was varying by 14 0 7 6 in lg and 8 8 6 0 in ll thus the total content of ch4 co2 and o2 contained in the reservoirs as well as their spatial distributions were varying moderately probably due to the moderate seasonal variations of temperature and water column stability table 1 and supplementary data at aguirrezabala cámpano and thalasso 2021 thus lg and ll were both characterized by a moderate monomictic regime which is a characteristic of subtropical ecosystems wetzel 2001 parameters listed in table 1 and illustrated in fig 4 show that lg contained on average and over the three seasons 76 times more ch4 in the water column than ll this storage would suggest a disbalance between the main ch4 production pathway methanogenesis and the main ch4 output of our model atmospheric emissions and methanotrophy however a closer analysis shows that it was not the case as r c h 4 m g was about 15 times higher in lg than in ll while f c h 4 and r c h 4 m t were respectively 17 and 14 times higher in lg than in ll thus undoubtedly eutrophication in lg induced higher methanogenesis but also higher methanotrophy and emissions to the atmosphere with the same magnitude compared to ll the higher ch4 storage was reflected by a higher turnover time in lg than in ll with θ c h 4 being 9 3 3 7 d in lg and 1 9 1 2 d in ll the opposite trend to ch4 was observed regarding do with m o 2 10 times higher in ll than lg as a result of the relatively high photosynthetic do production observed in ll above the relatively low respiration as a result of the latter the do cycle was more dynamic in lg than in ll with a θ o 2 of 4 4 0 6 and 12 5 3 8 d respectively in terms of co2 an important contrast between lg and ll was also observed indeed m c o 2 was three times higher in lg than in ll in ll a deficit of co2 production compared to co2 uptake by primary production was compensated for by a co2 input from the atmosphere while in lg a large co2 production and relatively low primary production resulted in important emissions despite these drastic disparities a relatively small difference in terms of θ co2 was observed at 19 2 8 9 and 10 1 3 6 d for lg and ll respectively notably fig 4 and table 1 also indicate a depleted gpp in lg despite it having a higher concentration of nutrients and trophic level than ll photosynthesis is known to be inhibited by compounds that could potentially be present in the wastewater discharged into lg such as nh3 herbicides sulfide and humic substances chen et al 2020 choi et al 2012 godos et al 2010 leusch et al 2014 misaki et al 2019 chlorophyll a concentrations confirmed the hypothesis of depleted gpp in lg as it ranged from 0 59 to 52 64 µg m 3 conagua 2019 which is in the lower range of hypereutrophic ecosystems i e 9 5 275 µg m 3 wetzel 2001 the combination of depleted gpp and high respiration in lg suggests that allochthonous carbon was the main substrate for respiration in lg cole et al 2000 meanwhile autochthonous carbon input from gpp always exceeded r in ll the dominance of autotrophic over heterotrophic activity is further evidenced by the mean gpp r ratio which was 3 17 1 31 in ll and 0 34 0 40 in lg in addition to these observations fig 4 also indicates a negative r c o 2 m g in lg which is in direct contrast to that observed in ll although there are several fermentative processes that consume and produce co2 the observed contrast between lg and ll could suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis prevailed in ll while the hydrogenotrophic pathway was dominant in lg this is surprising since methanogenesis in the water column of lg was observed along with a net co2 production which is usually indicative of acetoclastic methanogenesis this would suggest a shift of the dominant pathway between the sediments and the water column although it bears repeating that a more detailed analysis would be required to elucidate the methanogenic pathway additionally r c o 2 m g was considered as a buffer compartment in our model therefore r c o 2 m g consists primarily of the ch4 produced in the sediments and transferred to the water column but also any other unidentified biological or abiotic process including potentially autotrophic processes aside from the main bioprocesses rates the spatiotemporal distribution of cch4 cco2 and cdo offers an additional scope on the carbon cycle for instance cdo was the parameter most heterogeneously distributed in lg homogeneity index of 25 while in the same reservoir cco2 was the most homogeneously distributed parameter homogeneity index of 83 as suggested by gonzalez valencia et al 2019 the comparison of the homogeneity index values of several compounds is an indicator of which compounds are in excess and or deficit an overabundant compound is more likely to be evenly distributed which seems to be confirmed here indeed the low homogeneity index observed for cdo in lg appears to be caused by the dominant anoxic conditions reflecting a do limitation while the homogeneous distribution of cco2 suggests that respiration surpassed primary production causing an abundant cco2 based on that premise the order of the dissolved gasses from excess to deficit was co2 ch4 o2 in lg and o2 co2 ch4 in ll which is in line with the dominant heterotrophic and autotrophic overall metabolism in lg and ll respectively together with the homogeneity index the nhm also provides the anisotropic dominant direction in this case it was mostly depthward positive anisotropic factor figs 4 and s3 which is in accordance with the concept of water column stratification notably in lg the anisotropic factors of ch4 co2 and do were linearly correlated to the schmidt stability with a r2 0 998 p 0 01 n 4 unlike ll where no clear correlation was observed thus stratification is not the dominant factor that influences the anisotropy of dissolved gas distribution in ll in general the predominant direction of anisotropy in ll was slighter and more stable across seasons than that of lg to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the impact of anthropogenic pollution is reported through a mass balance combined with gas emissions and the major bioprocesses rates for ch4 co2 and o2 most of the parameters as well as the graphical representation indicated the strong impact of anthropogenic pollution on the carbon cycle in lg there the emission of ch4 as well as the rates of methanogenesis and methanotrophy were significantly higher than those of ll as standardly observed in eutrophicated waters huttunen et al 2003 zhou et al 2020 similarly the pollution had a clear effect on dissolved oxygen turning the water column dominantly anoxic which was partially compensated for by oxygen transfer from the atmosphere despite these observations several results are apparently contradictory to what is standardly expected in eutrophicated waters among these we observed a relatively depleted primary production an increase in co2 emissions and a low do production table 1 however it is worth noting that the mass balances and the resulting graphical representation were established over the entire water column while the photic depth in lg was limited to 4 m and do was detected only in the first 2 4 m of the water column thus the mass balance approach used in the present work gives an overview of the complete ecosystem status and not only of the photic zone where eutrophication is standardly more apparent this explains for instance why despite the anthropogenic pollution in lg processes like photosynthesis and aerobic respiration were lower than in ll thus the mass balance approach presented here is applicable only to the entire water column and a future development to allow for the characterization of a specific section of the water column would be beneficial in that case however the mass balance equation should be modified to consider vertical transport along the water column which is challenging especially when water column stability is weak as observed in lg and ll 4 conclusion as shown in the present work a large number of overall parameters were determined from a relatively reduced number of field measurements including flux dissolved concentration and several bioprocess rates of ch4 co2 and o2 which were integrated in a mass balance model an arbitrary selection of parameters was done to exhaustively describe the carbon cycling in two reservoirs over three seasons all of these parameters were included in a single graphical representation which allows for an overall appraisal of the carbon cycle at a glance this approach revealed the share of each major process in the ch4 co2 and o2 cycles as well as several spatiotemporal attributes of their distribution and turnover the combination of a comprehensive study and an integrative graphical representation facilitates seasonal comparisons between the ecosystems in the present study this approach vividly showed how allochthonous pollution deeply modifies the global functioning of subtropical reservoirs the same approach could be applied to draw comparisons among other aquatic ecosystems and their respective characteristics locations and or seasons author contribution t a c and
