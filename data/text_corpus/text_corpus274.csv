1370,agriculture sourced non point groundwater contamination e g nitrate is a serious concern from the drinking water crisis aspect across the agrarian world india is one of the largest consumers of nitrogen fertilizers in south asia as well as in the world but groundwater nitrate lacks critical attention as a wide scale drinking water pollutant in the country our study provides the first documentation of the distribution of groundwater nitrate and the extent of elevated nitrate contamination across india along with the delineation of the temporal trends and the natural and anthropogenic factors that influence such occurrence of groundwater nitrate high resolution annual scale spatio temporal variability of groundwater nitrate concentration and consequent contamination was delineated using groundwater nitrate measurements from 3 million drinking water wells spread across 7038 administrative blocks between 2010 and 2017 in india an average 8 of the studied blocks were found affected by elevated groundwater nitrate 45 mg l depth dependent trend demonstrated that nitrate concentrations were about 14 higher in shallow water wells 35 m than deep wells 35 m the overall temporal trend of groundwater nitrate concentration was decreasing slightly nationwide in the study period the correlation tests and causality test results indicated that the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate was significantly associated with agricultural n fertilizer usage whereas the decreasing temporal trend corresponded with the overall reduced n fertilizer usage during the study period spatial autocorrelation analysis identified the clustering of high nitrate areas in central north and southern india specifically in areas with higher fertilizer usage we estimate about 71 million indians possibly exposed to elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations and the majority of them reside in rural areas thus this study provides the previously unrecognized wide scale anthropogenic diffused groundwater nitrate contamination across india graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater nitrate fertilizer non point source vulnerability 1 introduction in recent decades access to safe water to society is challenging due to emerging water quality related issues due to growing shortages and apprehension of microbiological contaminants in surface water sources groundwater faces increasing stress to cope with agricultural industrial and drinking water requirements worldwide at least half of the global population uses groundwater for drinking world water assessment programme wwap 2012 india relies on groundwater to meet 85 of its rural population drinking water demand and 60 agricultural water requirements bank 2010 nevertheless anthropogenic activities like overexploitation daskalaki and voudouris 2008 khezzani and bouchemal 2018 application of fertilizers for greater crop yields jiang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 improper sanitation and sewage treatment systems industrial development mcdonough et al 2020 and population growth sridharan and nathan 2017 have caused deterioration of groundwater resources in both quantity and quality nitrate is considered as the most pervasive chemical contaminant found in groundwater pastén zapata et al 2014 spalding and exner 1993 and encounters of elevated groundwater nitrate are evident around the globe various anthropogenic and natural processes can introduce nitrate in groundwater like the application of nitrogen n fertilizers kim et al 2015 re et al 2017 shalev et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 and animal manure torres martínez et al 2020 widory et al 2005 usage of sewage effluent in irrigation buvaneshwari et al 2017 liu et al 2006 leaky urban sewage systems karunanidhi et al 2020 lapworth et al 2017 and microbial nitrification process bhanja et al 2019b elevated nitrate concentration in groundwater is a major environmental concern around the world particularly for shallow aquifers underneath agricultural areas with excessive application of n fertilizers nolan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 large areal extents dominated by agricultural activities in the north and northwest parts of china chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017 gu et al 2013 qian et al 2020 and the central valley plains central california pennsylvania piedmont and eastern coastal plains in the united states chaudhuri and ale 2014 pennino et al 2020 face elevated groundwater nitrate problems groundwater nitrate contamination is also observed in the united kingdom macdonald et al 2018 germany steege et al 2001 denmark hansen et al 2019 the mekong delta of vietnam tran et al 2020 and in parts of africa lapworth et al 2017 ouedraogo et al 2019 in india the economy is mostly dominated by agriculture and after the green revolution in 1960 agriculture turned into an industrial system duttagupta et al 2018 during this period application of modern technologies like the intensive usage of cheaper synthetic fertilizers had increased many folds to escalate the crop yield kumar et al 2017 murgai et al 2001 but the resultant high nitrate levels degrade groundwater quality and ingestion of such contaminated groundwater poses fatal human health risks ahada and suthar 2018 brender et al 2013 fan et al 1987 van maanen et al 1994 weyer et al 2001 therefore it is vital to understand the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater in india several previous studies have reported excess levels of nitrate in groundwater and its governing factors from the indian states of andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 gujarat shirke et al 2020 karnataka vinod et al 2015 madhya pradesh malik and shukla 2019 quamar et al 2020 maharshtra gupta et al 2011 marghade et al 2020 haryana wats et al 2019 punjab sharma et al 2016 singh et al 2015 rajasthan coyte et al 2019 tamil nadu karunanidhi et al 2021 telangana adimalla and li 2019 adimalla and qian 2019 and uttar pradesh agarwal et al 2019 these previous studies were so far limited to only regional local short term seasonal investigations and have only indicated local anthropogenic activities especially n fertilizer use as the primary source although excess n fertilizer application is primarily linked with elevated groundwater nitrate burow et al 2010 various intrinsic factors like geology hydrogeology hydrogeochemistry biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic exogenous factor like land use bhanja et al 2019b dutta et al 2018 menció et al 2016 that also impact the nitrate leaching and distribution in groundwater in india substantial heterogeneity exist in terms of the agricultural activities landuse geology hydrogeology and hydrochemistry and as groundwater dependency in india is growing continuously management of nitrate contamination in groundwater has become a major concern for the sustainable usage of groundwater resources and the lack of a nationwide assessment of groundwater nitrate threatens the safety of the millions of population that thrives on groundwater in india this present study attempts to develop the first comprehensive delineation of groundwater nitrate distribution and occurrence of high groundwater nitrate as a function of the spatial variability of intrinsic and exogenous parameters over the large spatial extent of india using groundwater nitrate measurements from nearly 3 million drinking water wells spread across the country further we tried to demonstrate the temporal changes in groundwater nitrate concentrations in the study area and estimated the population vulnerable to groundwater nitrate contamination the specific objectives of the study are to evaluate 1 the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate in the study area fig 1 2 temporal changes in nitrate concentration in the 2010 2017 8 years period 3 clustering of elevated nitrate areas and 4 population exposed to elevated concentrations of groundwater nitrate the present study is significant as the identified distribution of nitrate contamination in groundwater and the factors affecting such distribution across the large extent of india can be used to undertake intense groundwater quality investigations in known contaminated areas or yet unknown areas moreover the estimated population at risk and the delineated temporal trends by this study can aid in formulating better management policies for groundwater resources and public health safety 2 study area the distribution of groundwater resources varies significantly among the different geologic geomorphic and hydroclimatic regions in india groundwater in india is mostly extracted using motor operated tubewells and hand pumps to meet the agricultural requirements and supply the large population dependent on it the porous alluvial aquifers of the indus ganges and brahmaputra river basins are the largest in the country fig 2a together the indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin aquifer is one of the largest aquifers of the world mukherjee et al 2015 the igb is also one of the most critically stressed aquifers due to intense groundwater abstractions mukherjee et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2015 meeting the agricultural requirements industrial and drinking water of nearly 400 million people residing in the 700 000 km2 area encompassed by the basin factbook 2010 additional high yielding alluvial aquifers are located along the eastern coast most of the peninsular and cratonic parts are hard rock aquifers with limited storage in the few meters thick upper soil and sub soil zone lying above the un weathered bedrock aquifers bhanja et al 2016 fig 2a the bedrock aquifers are less porous lack primary porosity and groundwater flow follow preferential pathways saha and ray 2019 rainfall is considered as the primary source of groundwater recharge in india bhanja et al 2019a bhanja and mukherjee 2019 india has a sub tropical climate and can be divided into five hydroclimatic regions bhanja et al 2017 and receive average annual rainfall in the range of 750 and 1500 mm the heterogeneous distribution and recharge of groundwater resources accompanied by the huge demand resulted in increasing stress on the groundwater resources and eventually affecting public health and socio economy severely in recent times in the country mukherjee et al 2015 in case of landuse types more than half of india s land is utilized as croplands fao 2019 and the rest are deciduous forests mixed leaf forests urban areas shrubs grasslands sparse vegetation wetlands mangroves bare areas water bodies and snow covered areas the dominant landuse types in india are represented in fig 2b 3 materials and methods 3 1 discretizing five zones based on n fertilizer consumptions n fertilizer consumption thousand tonnes and application kg ha data for each state were compiled for 2010 to 2017 exclusively from the department of fertilizers government of india fertilizers scenario 2018 to study the variability of nitrate concentration across india we selected five zones based on the consumption of nitrate fertilizers fig 1c the zones are namely zone a comprises of 0 100 thousand tonnes of nitrate fertilizer consumption per year and with 300 blocks followed by zone b 100 500 thousand tonnes with 950 blocks and zone c 500 1000 thousand tonnes with 2100 blocks zone d and zone e comprise a significantly higher annual consumption of 1000 1400 thousand tonnes and 1400 3050 thousand tonnes respectively table s1 the number of blocks falling in zone d was 1200 and for zone e it was 2400 blocks zone a comprises most areas from north east india coastal and hilly regions where agricultural practices are low compared to other zones and forest coverage is more in zone b mining activities are predominant than agriculture and the remaining three zones have vast land proportions used as cropland with high agricultural productivity areas within zone d and e are some of the india s largest food grain producers primarily facilitated with groundwater irrigation and have a very high consumption of n fertilizers the main crops grown in these areas are rice wheat cotton sugar cane pulses millet maize and barley 3 2 data acquisition and management the spatial distribution and temporal trends of groundwater nitrate concentrations above the permissible value of 45 mg l world water assessment programme wwap 2009 bureau of indian standards 2016 us epa 2015 were evaluated for major parts of india fig 1 using annual groundwater nitrate measurements as total nitrate from n 2 929 917 drinking water wells across the 7038 administrative blocks or its equivalent in the study domain between 2010 and 2017 we retrieved the data from the database of national rural drinking water programme nrdwp imis reports 2018 a district sub division defined for government land regulatory purposes is known as a block it is considered the smallest unit of the indian administration division mukherjee et al 2019 we have excluded the himalayan terrains of jammu kashmir and ladakh due to lack of data the data was downloaded and processed as described below for further statistical analysis beginning in 2009 nrdwp aimed to supply potable drinking water to the population and also to monitor groundwater quality using the network of wells distributed around the country hutchings et al 2017 jangle et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2019 wescoat jr et al 2019 groundwater samples were collected from tubewells 89 and dug wells 11 used primarily for drinking water purposes and analyzed for nitrate following the nrdwp protocols ddws 2018 modws 2013 samples were collected in 2 l polyethylene containers after sufficient purging of the wells for atleast 10 min and analyzed using either field test kits or ion selective electrodes the samples were generally kept at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h nrdwp conducts sample collection and analysis once to three times a year march april july august and december january the annual groundwater nitrate measurement data from n 2 929 917 drinking water wells was screened for temporal continuity over the study period 2010 2017 and selected only those that were continuous over the period tukey s fence approach was also used to make the data statistically robust by removing the outliers mukherjee et al 2019 tukey 1977 finally nitrate measurements from 686 956 wells that satisfy temporal continuity for the 8 year period from 2010 to 2017 and the outlier condition were selected fig s1 each administrative block contained groundwater nitrate measurements from an average of 64 wells min 4 max 244 for each year and this data has been up scaled to block level using the mean values from each block the processed data were used to delineate various metrics e g distribution of nitrate in groundwater blocks in violation repeated violators and temporal trends we further screened the data by the depth of the wells sampled and divided them into two types shallow 35 m and deep wells 35 m depending upon the predominant subsurface depth of the wells considered in the study dowr 2017 malakar et al 2021 the dataset consists of 25 shallow and 75 deep wells alongside groundwater data we have acquired block population data from census 2011 ministry of home affairs govt of india census of india 2011 and used it to represent the population possibly affected by drinking groundwater with nitrate concentration above the permissible limit 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 temporal trend analysis the temporal trend of average nitrate concentration was done using the hodrick and prescott hp filter the hp filter is a non parametric trend estimator the following equation separates the trends and cycles 1 min t t 1 t y t t t 2 λ t t 1 t t t t t t 1 2 where tt 1 and tt 1 are the trend component at the time steps t 1 and t 1 respectively the cyclical components can be computed by removing the trends from their real values reduction in the variability of cyclic components is achieved by selecting a suitable value of smoothing parameter λ and we have chosen λ 100 for yearly data in our study hodrick and prescott 1997 the hp filter was applied to the nitrate concentration values as well as the fertilizer data the hp filter has been applied previously in hydrogeology to determine temporal trends of various parameters bhanja et al 2017 duttagupta et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2019 3 3 2 granger causality test we have used the granger causality test between fertilizer consumption and nitrate concentration as granger causality allows determining the causal linkage between two variables zhang et al 2017 the primary purpose of the granger causality test is to identify whether variable x is causally linked to variable y and gives better understating than simple correlations granger 1969 a bi variate model e g eqs 2 and 3 is implemented between two stationary time series variables x and y 2 y n j 1 m a j y t j j 1 m b j x t j μ t 3 x n j 1 m c j x t j j 1 m d j y t j μ t where x and yt are the two stationary time series variables a b c d are the coefficients and μt the white noise sequence for y to be granger caused by x bj 0 in eq 1 and dj 0 in eq 2 for feedback between the two 3 3 3 spatial autocorrelation to identify the clusters of high and low nitrate concentration we performed spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation identifies the similarities among the neighbors and measures the likeness s extent as the function of spatial distance chaudhuri and ale 2014 griffith 1987 quino lima et al 2020 the most commonly used coefficient in univariate autocorrelation is the moran s i coefficient moran 1950 moran s i vary in the range of 1 and 1 for perfectly positive and entirely negative autocorrelation respectively zero denotes no correlation between adjacent neighbors a non zero value of moran s i denote that the nitrate concentration values in the contiguous blocks are more similar or less similar expected than randomly associated blocks eq 4 is used for calculating the moran s i 4 i n s i j w ij y i y y j y i y i y 2 where n is the number of samples or blocks y i and y j are the nitrate concentration values in i and j blocks y is the average of y and w ij is an element of matrix w s is the number of entries in the matrix w diniz filho et al 2003 after obtaining the univariate moran s i values spatial autocorrelation was represented as the lisa local indicators of spatial association significance maps lisa maps classify the location clusters based on the type of associations anselin et al 2006 spatial autocorrelation analysis was carried out using arcgis 10 2 software 3 3 4 assessment of natural and anthropogenic variables for association with groundwater nitrate we applied spearman s rank correlation and univariate logistic regression tests to assess how well groundwater nitrate concentrations were associated with various natural and anthropogenic variables for this purpose we selected a total of 21 variables from climate hydrogeologic hydrogeochemical and anthropogenic such as n fertilizer use and landuse categories based on published literature leading to the understanding that each of these variables has a direct or indirect influence on the distribution of nitrate in groundwater table s2 these selection criteria statistical results and the descriptive statistics of the variables are described in the supplementary information the correlations were tested at 95 confidence interval and the variables found significant in both the tests were only considered to have a possible association with groundwater nitrate all the variables except the n fertilizer consumption that was available only at the state level were summarized to the block level the blocks were binary coded i e 0 for no violation nitrate concentration 45 mg l and 1 for violation nitrate concentration 45 mg l during the study period for the univariate logistic regression test the spearman s ranked correlation test and logistic regressions were performed in r programming language v 3 6 1 3 4 uncertainty and assumptions only continuous datasets have been considered for the study during the entire study period this process utilized the maximum available temporal datasets from the respective data sources for temporal trend analysis over the mutually convenient time interval furthermore the validation of the data used here is solely dependent on the acquired datasets from government sources the data have been up scaled from individual wells to block level using the mean values from each block and using this block level data further analyses have been carried out the outcomes of spatial autocorrelation analysis using the moran s i may get influenced by the selection function for the weight function and presence of extreme values and this study considers these factors to get much reliable outcomes 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate the compiled dataset of groundwater nitrate across india suggests that an average 8 of the total blocks exceeded the permissible value of 45 mg l with 9 land area

groundwater nitrate concentration across india around 3 million measurements of groundwater nitrate across the country are compiled for this study the spatial distribution of nitrate in groundwater is shown in fig 1 as well as in fig s2 the distribution indicates that the number of blocks with elevated nitrate concentration is maximum for zone e which consumes maximum fertilizer among the zones groundwater nitrate concentrations above the permissible limit of 45 mg l are observed at varying magnitudes in number of blocks and area in the 21 states out of 36 states of india the geological distribution pattern of groundwater nitrate shows that maximum of the affected areas lies in the indian cratonic aquifer region and indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin fig 2a our findings corroborate with previous studies that have reported high groundwater nitrate in alluvial basins khan et al 2019 lapworth et al 2017 lockhart et al 2013 and crystalline aquifers buvaneshwari et al 2017 mueller et al 1995 more specifically in the indian cratonic aquifer regions we observed that the states primarily affected from elevated groundwater nitrate are andhra pradesh and maharashtra from zone e madhya pradesh from zone d karnataka tamil nadu and telangana from zone c and kerala and orissa from zone b fig 2a and fig 3a while in the igb basin region the states affected most are punjab and uttar pradesh from zone e haryana and rajasthan from zone c and assam from zone b fig 2a and fig 3a these states comprise the majority of the elevated nitrate areas in the country the observed occurrences of high groundwater nitrate from our study match well with the previous reportings of elevated nitrate from andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 maharashtra gupta et al 2011 pandith et al 2017 madhya

et al 2018 and orissa sahoo and khaoash 2020 other areas with prevalent existence of elevated groundwater nitrate are observed in the semi consolidated aquifer areas of the state gujarat from zone d figs 1b and 2a and in smaller proportions of the states arunachal pradesh manipur meghalaya mizoram nagaland and tripura from zone a in the north east part of india fig 1b and fig 3a previous studies have also reported high groundwater nitrate from these areas kumar et al 2019 shirke et al 2020 singh et al 2008 in india 70 of the land area is used as croplands followed by 14 as deciduous forests 4 mixed leaf forests 4 of urban areas 3 shrubs 2 grasslands and 2 water bodies other landuse types such as sparse vegetation bare areas wetlands mangroves and snow covered areas constitute minimal landuse the majority 82 of the blocks with elevated groundwater nitrate are observed in the croplands fig 2b in zone e 25 of the cropped areas have high groundwater nitrate maximum among the five zones fig 2b zone e has some of india s highest agriculturally productive states e g andhra pradesh maharashtra punjab and uttar pradesh agri stats 2018 fig 1b previous studies have also found high groundwater nitrate in the highly cultivated parts of andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 maharashtra marghade et al 2020 punjab ahada and suthar 2018 and uttar pradesh agarwal et al 2019 and reported excessive use of fertilizers as the primary cause of elevated nitrate for the other zones the percent of cropland affected with high groundwater nitrate ranges between 17 and 4 and zone a being the lowest and studies have also reported high nitrate in parts of these zones with agricultural activities kaur et al 2020 raja and neelakantan 2021 shirke et al 2020 thapa et al 2019 about 7 and 3 of the violating blocks are observed in the deciduous and mixed leaf forests respectively and zone a has the maximum percent of forest cover affected by elevated groundwater nitrate 11 with deciduous and 9 with mixed leaf forest areas fig 2b majority of states with elevated groundwater nitrate from zone a i e arunachal pradesh himachal pradesh manipur meghalaya mizoram nagaland sikkim and tripura has forest cover as the dominant landuse type fig 1b and 2b deciduous forests are well known to leach nitrates to the soil consequently leaching to the groundwater and nutrient content of deciduous forests are also higher honoki et al 2001 the bacteria present in the root nodules of deciduous trees can fix nitrogen rupert 2008 resulting in elevated nitrate concentrations in these areas around 4 of the blocks with elevated nitrate are observed in the urban areas encompassing 14 of india s total urban area zones e and d have the maximum percentages of their urban areas affected from high groundwater nitrate 22 and 21 respectively while zone a has the minimum 1 among the zones vishakhapatnam district of andhra pradesh ernakulum and kannur districts of kerala ludhiana district of punjab and hyderabad district of telangana state have shown pervasive high nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 1c elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the urban areas have become perpetual concern around the globe marghade 2020 in urban areas the primary sources of elevated nitrate are domestic wastes animal waste disposals leaching from landfills industrial and wastewater treatment effluents gao et al 2020 wakida and lerner 2005 a study by duan and kaushal 2015 soil nitrogen mobilization by ion exchange process can be promoted by the anthropogenic inputs in urban areas and thus can result in higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater previous studies from india and other parts of the world have reported higher occurrence of nitrate concentration in groundwater in urban setups resulting from unmanaged sanitation systems domestic sewage and wastewaters blarasin et al 2020 gao et al 2020 karunanidhi et al 2020 zendehbad et al 2019 in the case of other dominant landuse types shrubs and grasslands contained about 3 and 1 respectively of the violating blocks zone c showed the maximum percent of shrub area and zone e showed maximum percent of grasslands affected with elevated nitrate fig 1b and 2b the major contributing sources of groundwater nitrate in shrubs and grassland areas are known to be the dumping of manure fertilizers native soil organic matter and wet depositions almasri 2007 pastén zapata et al 2014 western parts of the state rajasthan and parts of andhra pradesh have shown shrub and grassland areas with groundwater nitrate concentrations above 45 mg l figs 1b and 2b 5 2 temporal patterns of groundwater nitrate concentration our study is the first to show that the average nitrate concentration in groundwater has a reducing trend in india though less in magnitude fig 4a and reducing trends are observed in both shallow fig s6 and deep wells fig s7 concentrations in the blocks violating the permissible limit of nitrate were also decreasing fig 4b in general agricultural activities such as use of synthetic fertilizers are widely regarded as the major source of nitrate contamination in groundwater savci 2012 we found that the fertilizer application trends were also decreasing in india during the study period fig s8 the n fertilizer application initially increased by 3 between 2010 70 8 kg ha and 2011 72 8 kg ha in india but after 2011 the usage rates decreased significantly kumar et al 2017 fig s8 previous studies have also reported that a decline in fertilizer usage resulted in the lowering of groundwater nitrate in countries like denmark hansen and djurhuus 1996 south korea lee et al 2017 and the united states pennino et al 2017 the cumulative decrease in fertilizer application was 13 from 2011 72 8 kg ha to 2017 63 5 kg ha this fact is supported by the granger causality analysis which showed significant causal relations between the fertilizer inputs and nitrate concentrations the zones e and a represented decreasing trend in fertilizer application which is reflected in the declination of groundwater nitrate concentrations in all blocks of these zones however the fertilizer application increased for zones c and d while remained constant for zone b the primary contributor for nitrate violations from zone d is the gujarat state fig 3a and although the overall fertilizer application for zone d showed increasing trend we found that fertilizer application decreased for gujarat zone c showed increasing trend in groundwater nitrate that corresponds with the increased fertilizer application of this zone previous studies have reported implication of restrictions on fertilizer inputs have resulted decrease in nitrate concentrations puckett et al 2011 rupert 2008 other than decreased fertilizer applications the other factor contributing to such declining trends in groundwater nitrate is the improvement of sanitary conditions fouché et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2019 reported that the status of sanitation infrastructure in india have improved significantly with the onset of clean india mission in 2014 we have also observed that nitrate concentrations declined about 15 decline in 2014 2017 however we emphasize that confirmations of the influence of improved sanitation on declining groundwater nitrate warrants further isotopic or tracer investigations in the study area 5 3 depth dependent variability of groundwater nitrate we observed that nitrate concentrations are higher in shallow wells than deep wells fig s5 an average of 10 of the shallow wells showed concentrations above the permissible limit whereas 6 of the deep wells had high nitrate concentrations the shallow aquifers are more vulnerable to contamination due to enhanced chances of contaminant leaching from the surface and eventually reaching the shallow aquifers pastén zapata et al 2014 qian et al 2020 higher concentrations in shallow wells are influenced by higher loading of nutrients to shallow groundwater tables while in greater depths low nitrate concentrations can be attributed to the redox conditions which induces the denitrification process and inhibits nitrate movement mueller et al 1995 spalding and exner 1993 deeper groundwater can be more anoxic than shallow groundwater and due to the prevalence of such oxygen limiting and lower redox potential conditions the microbial denitrification process is favoured in deep groundwater which leads to the release of n2o and n2 from denitrification of nitrate bhanja et al 2019b dutta et al 2018 the correlation values of shallow and deep groundwater nitrate concentrations with fertilizer consumption are highly significant and higher for shallow groundwater supporting that nutrient loading could result in higher nitrate concentration in shallow depths gu et al 2013 and li et al 2018 have reported elevated nitrate in shallow aquifers beneath wide spread agricultural areas of north and north western china other studies have also demonstrated similar higher nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater due to surplus fertilizer application and lower concentrations in deep groundwater due to the longer travel time and denitrification in the coastal plain of arborea italy biddau et al 2019 and in the indus river flood plain in pakistan khan et al 2019 we have found that average nitrate concentrations in the shallow wells are higher than deep wells for the zone c d and e these zones receive more n inputs in the form of fertilizers resulting in higher nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater previous studies confirm our observations of higher nitrate concentration in shallow depths in these zones adimalla et al 2018 lapworth et al 2017 the groundwater recharge distribution shown in fig s9 indicates that the recharge rates are very high in the east west and northern parts of the country these areas receive higher precipitation than other parts of the country fig s9 and are located in the porous igb basin aquifer regions fig 2a the groundwater table depths were primarily shallow except the arid and semi arid western parts fig s10 therefore with the higher groundwater recharge and connectivity nitrate from the surface can reach the groundwater below and easily contaminate the shallow groundwater in these regions but with increased depth the denitrifying conditions prevail that inhibit nitrate movement and result in lower nitrate concentrations in deep groundwater than shallow groundwater in punjab and uttar pradesh of zone e haryana and rajasthan of zone c the groundwater recharge rates are low in the central and southern parts of the country fig s9 and these areas are located in the cratonic crystalline aquifer region fig 2a these aquifers are less conductive and the recharge water from the surface cannot reach the deeper depths and is restricted only to the shallow depths bhanja et al 2019a mukherjee et al 2015 thus explaining the higher nitrate concentrations in the shallow depths in the central and southern parts such as andhra pradesh and maharashtra of zone e madhya pradesh of zone d and karnataka tamil nadu and telangana of zone c further details on groundwater recharge in the study area can be found in bhanja et al 2019a for zones a and b the n inputs from fertilizers are significantly less and thus the nitrate concentrations in the shallow snd deep wells were nearly similar and very low compared to other zones figs s6 and s7 5 4 clusters of high and low groundwater nitrate strong spatial autocorrelation can be seen among the administrative blocks for groundwater nitrate concentration based on the positive moran s i values during the study period fig 5 furthermore the moran s i values are higher in the early years of the study period and comparatively low in the later years indicating a reduction in clustering phenomenon which is similar to our temporal trend observations of nitrate table s6 values of neighboring blocks were used to build a spatial matrix of contiguity and moran s i was calculated using that matrix maximum moran s i value in 2012 due to the high average nitrate concentration in the blocks and minimum moran s i in 2014 due to the low clustering though the number of blocks in violation was maximum moran s i have been used in numerous studies for evaluating trends in water usage quantity and quality chaudhuri et al 2012 franczyk and chang 2009 machiwal et al 2012 lisa maps allow visualizing the association between similar and dissimilar values by considering the data clusters and outliers for the northeastern region we have observed high value clustering in 2010 and 2011 only in the other years this region has not shown any significant clustering which indicates the dissolution of clusters in the northeast resulting from the decrease in n fertilizer use fig 5c h these areas mostly come under zone a with very low consumption of fertilizers most of the eastern areas have low value clustering except high high value association in orissa resembling our observations of low nitrate concentration in this region fig 5a h the low low clustering in the eastern zone was consistent for the study period while it is inconsistent for high value clustering majority of the areas from zone b and c have reflected low low or insignificant clustering during the study period most of the high value clusters with highly significant spatial autocorrelation are observed in central west and some states in north india mainly practicing agricultural activity and consuming higher n fertilizer consumption mostly from zone e and d fig 5a h the states of punjab and uttar pradesh in the northern and gujarat and maharashtra in western and madhya pradesh in central india have clusters of high high spatial autocorrelation fig 5a h in the southern region most areas have shown high value clustering fig 5a h the percent area under high value clustering was more 20 in the early study period and decreased later while the low value clusters showed the opposite trend these results indicate temporal decrease in clustering of high nitrate concentration in the blocks lisa maps indicated that areas with high fertilizer consumption and croplands are the hotspots of high nitrate concentration in groundwater while areas with less fertilizer consumption and greater forest coverage have comparatively low concentration 5 5 relationship of groundwater nitrate with natural and anthropogenic parameters variables found significant in spearman s correlation test and logistic regression in our study agree with previous studies that found the association of high groundwater nitrate concentration with fertilizer use adimalla 2020 khan et al 2019 rupert 2008 sharma et al 2016 landuse busico et al 2017 epelde et al 2016

properties in combination with conditions that inhibits denitrification process e g limited carbon supply and oxygenated in subsurface bhanja et al 2019b spalding and exner 1993 the correlations indicate that the distribution of groundwater nitrate is more associated with the fertilizer inputs hydrogeology water table depth slope soil permeability and hydrogeochemistry groundwater chloride sulfate ph hardness and alkalinity further discussions on the correlations are provided in the supplementary information text s2 5 6 vulnerability of population based on the 2011 census population data we estimated that the population vulnerable to high groundwater nitrate exposure is 71 million 71 187 156 table s7 fig 6 of these 71 million people 64 million is the rural population table s8 and the rest 7 million are urban table s9 i e 90 is rural and 10 is urban these statistics indicate that the rural population is much more vulnerable to groundwater nitrate pollution for the five zones the maximum vulnerable population are from zone e 35 million and followed by zone d 14 million zone c 13 million zone b 8 million and zone a 0 50 million the estimations also indicated that the maximum rural population exposed to elevated groundwater are from zone e 31 million followed by zone d 13 million zone c 12 million zone b 7 million and zone a 0 46 million in case of the urban population maximum population vulnerable are from zone e 4 million followed by zone c 1 million zone b 0 90 million zone d 0 65 million and zone a 0 04 million some of the states with most affected people are 17 4 million uttar pradesh 11 1 million andhra pradesh 6 5 million and punjab 1 6 million of zone e gujarat 7 4 million and madhya pradesh 6 8 million of zone d rajasthan 5 5 million tamil nadu 4 3 million karnataka 3 6 million and telangana 1 8 million of zone c and assam 2 9 million orissa 2 9 million and kerala 2 8 million of zone b fig 6 these estimations indicate that a large population of india especially the rural population is exposed to high groundwater nitrate concentrations and warrants significant attention towards the mitigation of the groundwater elevated nitrate problem 6 conclusion the occurrence of elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations in the highly agrarian areas of south asia is a matter of serious concern to the large groundwater dependent population of this region in this study we attempted to delineate the first nationwide distribution and 8 year temporal trends in groundwater nitrate and identified the occurrence and clustering of nitrate concentrations above the permissible limit of 45 mg l using a large dataset and contemporary statistical methods in india the distribution of groundwater nitrate indicated that out of the 36 states of india 21 have concerns of elevated groundwater nitrate and majority of these states are from zones with high fertilizer applications the states of andhra pradesh maharashtra punjab uttar pradesh gujarat madhya pradesh karnataka tamil nadu and telangana are the most affected and consisted majority of the violating blocks of groundwater nitrate we observed that majority of the blocks with elevated nitrate emerged in the alluvial igb basin aquifers and crystalline aquifers of the indian cratonic region nitrate concentration was significantly higher in shallow wells than deep wells we have also found that the highest percent of the violating blocks were located in the croplands followed by deciduous forests urban areas mixed leaf forests shrubs and grasslands the 8 year temporal trend from 2010 and 2017 showed that the overall nitrate concentration in india is slightly decreasing similar decrease in nitrate concentration was also observed for the shallow and deep wells the statistical tests demonstrated that the decreasing trend in groundwater nitrate corresponds to the declining fertilizer application during the study period clustering blocks with high groundwater nitrate in central west and north india coincided with extensive fertilizer usage in these areas lastly we estimate that about 71 million people is at risk of exposure to elevated groundwater nitrate and of these 71 million 90 is rural and 10 is urban we conclude that higher nitrate concentration is a wide spread concern in india and needs significant attention the decrease in nitrate concentration with decreased fertilizer usage indicates that if use of n fertilizers is restricted nitrate may reduce below the permissible limits in groundwater by natural reduction processes such as denitrification but it may take several years investigations on plant available nitrogen during each cropping period and for different soils and use of native crop species may reduce fertilizer use and eventually nitrate concentrations we stress further investigations on zone site specific crop fertilizer requirements and denitrification capabilities of soils based on our study results moreover we are also emphasizing the requirement of long term monitoring studies including applying stable isotopes and modeling approaches to help develop more detailed quantification of groundwater nitrate

1370,agriculture sourced non point groundwater contamination e g nitrate is a serious concern from the drinking water crisis aspect across the agrarian world india is one of the largest consumers of nitrogen fertilizers in south asia as well as in the world but groundwater nitrate lacks critical attention as a wide scale drinking water pollutant in the country our study provides the first documentation of the distribution of groundwater nitrate and the extent of elevated nitrate contamination across india along with the delineation of the temporal trends and the natural and anthropogenic factors that influence such occurrence of groundwater nitrate high resolution annual scale spatio temporal variability of groundwater nitrate concentration and consequent contamination was delineated using groundwater nitrate measurements from 3 million drinking water wells spread across 7038 administrative blocks between 2010 and 2017 in india an average 8 of the studied blocks were found affected by elevated groundwater nitrate 45 mg l depth dependent trend demonstrated that nitrate concentrations were about 14 higher in shallow water wells 35 m than deep wells 35 m the overall temporal trend of groundwater nitrate concentration was decreasing slightly nationwide in the study period the correlation tests and causality test results indicated that the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate was significantly associated with agricultural n fertilizer usage whereas the decreasing temporal trend corresponded with the overall reduced n fertilizer usage during the study period spatial autocorrelation analysis identified the clustering of high nitrate areas in central north and southern india specifically in areas with higher fertilizer usage we estimate about 71 million indians possibly exposed to elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations and the majority of them reside in rural areas thus this study provides the previously unrecognized wide scale anthropogenic diffused groundwater nitrate contamination across india graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater nitrate fertilizer non point source vulnerability 1 introduction in recent decades access to safe water to society is challenging due to emerging water quality related issues due to growing shortages and apprehension of microbiological contaminants in surface water sources groundwater faces increasing stress to cope with agricultural industrial and drinking water requirements worldwide at least half of the global population uses groundwater for drinking world water assessment programme wwap 2012 india relies on groundwater to meet 85 of its rural population drinking water demand and 60 agricultural water requirements bank 2010 nevertheless anthropogenic activities like overexploitation daskalaki and voudouris 2008 khezzani and bouchemal 2018 application of fertilizers for greater crop yields jiang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 improper sanitation and sewage treatment systems industrial development mcdonough et al 2020 and population growth sridharan and nathan 2017 have caused deterioration of groundwater resources in both quantity and quality nitrate is considered as the most pervasive chemical contaminant found in groundwater pastén zapata et al 2014 spalding and exner 1993 and encounters of elevated groundwater nitrate are evident around the globe various anthropogenic and natural processes can introduce nitrate in groundwater like the application of nitrogen n fertilizers kim et al 2015 re et al 2017 shalev et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 and animal manure torres martínez et al 2020 widory et al 2005 usage of sewage effluent in irrigation buvaneshwari et al 2017 liu et al 2006 leaky urban sewage systems karunanidhi et al 2020 lapworth et al 2017 and microbial nitrification process bhanja et al 2019b elevated nitrate concentration in groundwater is a major environmental concern around the world particularly for shallow aquifers underneath agricultural areas with excessive application of n fertilizers nolan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 large areal extents dominated by agricultural activities in the north and northwest parts of china chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017 gu et al 2013 qian et al 2020 and the central valley plains central california pennsylvania piedmont and eastern coastal plains in the united states chaudhuri and ale 2014 pennino et al 2020 face elevated groundwater nitrate problems groundwater nitrate contamination is also observed in the united kingdom macdonald et al 2018 germany steege et al 2001 denmark hansen et al 2019 the mekong delta of vietnam tran et al 2020 and in parts of africa lapworth et al 2017 ouedraogo et al 2019 in india the economy is mostly dominated by agriculture and after the green revolution in 1960 agriculture turned into an industrial system duttagupta et al 2018 during this period application of modern technologies like the intensive usage of cheaper synthetic fertilizers had increased many folds to escalate the crop yield kumar et al 2017 murgai et al 2001 but the resultant high nitrate levels degrade groundwater quality and ingestion of such contaminated groundwater poses fatal human health risks ahada and suthar 2018 brender et al 2013 fan et al 1987 van maanen et al 1994 weyer et al 2001 therefore it is vital to understand the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater in india several previous studies have reported excess levels of nitrate in groundwater and its governing factors from the indian states of andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 gujarat shirke et al 2020 karnataka vinod et al 2015 madhya pradesh malik and shukla 2019 quamar et al 2020 maharshtra gupta et al 2011 marghade et al 2020 haryana wats et al 2019 punjab sharma et al 2016 singh et al 2015 rajasthan coyte et al 2019 tamil nadu karunanidhi et al 2021 telangana adimalla and li 2019 adimalla and qian 2019 and uttar pradesh agarwal et al 2019 these previous studies were so far limited to only regional local short term seasonal investigations and have only indicated local anthropogenic activities especially n fertilizer use as the primary source although excess n fertilizer application is primarily linked with elevated groundwater nitrate burow et al 2010 various intrinsic factors like geology hydrogeology hydrogeochemistry biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic exogenous factor like land use bhanja et al 2019b dutta et al 2018 menció et al 2016 that also impact the nitrate leaching and distribution in groundwater in india substantial heterogeneity exist in terms of the agricultural activities landuse geology hydrogeology and hydrochemistry and as groundwater dependency in india is growing continuously management of nitrate contamination in groundwater has become a major concern for the sustainable usage of groundwater resources and the lack of a nationwide assessment of groundwater nitrate threatens the safety of the millions of population that thrives on groundwater in india this present study attempts to develop the first comprehensive delineation of groundwater nitrate distribution and occurrence of high groundwater nitrate as a function of the spatial variability of intrinsic and exogenous parameters over the large spatial extent of india using groundwater nitrate measurements from nearly 3 million drinking water wells spread across the country further we tried to demonstrate the temporal changes in groundwater nitrate concentrations in the study area and estimated the population vulnerable to groundwater nitrate contamination the specific objectives of the study are to evaluate 1 the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate in the study area fig 1 2 temporal changes in nitrate concentration in the 2010 2017 8 years period 3 clustering of elevated nitrate areas and 4 population exposed to elevated concentrations of groundwater nitrate the present study is significant as the identified distribution of nitrate contamination in groundwater and the factors affecting such distribution across the large extent of india can be used to undertake intense groundwater quality investigations in known contaminated areas or yet unknown areas moreover the estimated population at risk and the delineated temporal trends by this study can aid in formulating better management policies for groundwater resources and public health safety 2 study area the distribution of groundwater resources varies significantly among the different geologic geomorphic and hydroclimatic regions in india groundwater in india is mostly extracted using motor operated tubewells and hand pumps to meet the agricultural requirements and supply the large population dependent on it the porous alluvial aquifers of the indus ganges and brahmaputra river basins are the largest in the country fig 2a together the indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin aquifer is one of the largest aquifers of the world mukherjee et al 2015 the igb is also one of the most critically stressed aquifers due to intense groundwater abstractions mukherjee et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2015 meeting the agricultural requirements industrial and drinking water of nearly 400 million people residing in the 700 000 km2 area encompassed by the basin factbook 2010 additional high yielding alluvial aquifers are located along the eastern coast most of the peninsular and cratonic parts are hard rock aquifers with limited storage in the few meters thick upper soil and sub soil zone lying above the un weathered bedrock aquifers bhanja et al 2016 fig 2a the bedrock aquifers are less porous lack primary porosity and groundwater flow follow preferential pathways saha and ray 2019 rainfall is considered as the primary source of groundwater recharge in india bhanja et al 2019a bhanja and mukherjee 2019 india has a sub tropical climate and can be divided into five hydroclimatic regions bhanja et al 2017 and receive average annual rainfall in the range of 750 and 1500 mm the heterogeneous distribution and recharge of groundwater resources accompanied by the huge demand resulted in increasing stress on the groundwater resources and eventually affecting public health and socio economy severely in recent times in the country mukherjee et al 2015 in case of landuse types more than half of india s land is utilized as croplands fao 2019 and the rest are deciduous forests mixed leaf forests urban areas shrubs grasslands sparse vegetation wetlands mangroves bare areas water bodies and snow covered areas the dominant landuse types in india are represented in fig 2b 3 materials and methods 3 1 discretizing five zones based on n fertilizer consumptions n fertilizer consumption thousand tonnes and application kg ha data for each state were compiled for 2010 to 2017 exclusively from the department of fertilizers government of india fertilizers scenario 2018 to study the variability of nitrate concentration across india we selected five zones based on the consumption of nitrate fertilizers fig 1c the zones are namely zone a comprises of 0 100 thousand tonnes of nitrate fertilizer consumption per year and with 300 blocks followed by zone b 100 500 thousand tonnes with 950 blocks and zone c 500 1000 thousand tonnes with 2100 blocks zone d and zone e comprise a significantly higher annual consumption of 1000 1400 thousand tonnes and 1400 3050 thousand tonnes respectively table s1 the number of blocks falling in zone d was 1200 and for zone e it was 2400 blocks zone a comprises most areas from north east india coastal and hilly regions where agricultural practices are low compared to other zones and forest coverage is more in zone b mining activities are predominant than agriculture and the remaining three zones have vast land proportions used as cropland with high agricultural productivity areas within zone d and e are some of the india s largest food grain producers primarily facilitated with groundwater irrigation and have a very high consumption of n fertilizers the main crops grown in these areas are rice wheat cotton sugar cane pulses millet maize and barley 3 2 data acquisition and management the spatial distribution and temporal trends of groundwater nitrate concentrations above the permissible value of 45 mg l world water assessment programme wwap 2009 bureau of indian standards 2016 us epa 2015 were evaluated for major parts of india fig 1 using annual groundwater nitrate measurements as total nitrate from n 2 929 917 drinking water wells across the 7038 administrative blocks or its equivalent in the study domain between 2010 and 2017 we retrieved the data from the database of national rural drinking water programme nrdwp imis reports 2018 a district sub division defined for government land regulatory purposes is known as a block it is considered the smallest unit of the indian administration division mukherjee et al 2019 we have excluded the himalayan terrains of jammu kashmir and ladakh due to lack of data the data was downloaded and processed as described below for further statistical analysis beginning in 2009 nrdwp aimed to supply potable drinking water to the population and also to monitor groundwater quality using the network of wells distributed around the country hutchings et al 2017 jangle et al 2016 mukherjee et al 2019 wescoat jr et al 2019 groundwater samples were collected from tubewells 89 and dug wells 11 used primarily for drinking water purposes and analyzed for nitrate following the nrdwp protocols ddws 2018 modws 2013 samples were collected in 2 l polyethylene containers after sufficient purging of the wells for atleast 10 min and analyzed using either field test kits or ion selective electrodes the samples were generally kept at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h nrdwp conducts sample collection and analysis once to three times a year march april july august and december january the annual groundwater nitrate measurement data from n 2 929 917 drinking water wells was screened for temporal continuity over the study period 2010 2017 and selected only those that were continuous over the period tukey s fence approach was also used to make the data statistically robust by removing the outliers mukherjee et al 2019 tukey 1977 finally nitrate measurements from 686 956 wells that satisfy temporal continuity for the 8 year period from 2010 to 2017 and the outlier condition were selected fig s1 each administrative block contained groundwater nitrate measurements from an average of 64 wells min 4 max 244 for each year and this data has been up scaled to block level using the mean values from each block the processed data were used to delineate various metrics e g distribution of nitrate in groundwater blocks in violation repeated violators and temporal trends we further screened the data by the depth of the wells sampled and divided them into two types shallow 35 m and deep wells 35 m depending upon the predominant subsurface depth of the wells considered in the study dowr 2017 malakar et al 2021 the dataset consists of 25 shallow and 75 deep wells alongside groundwater data we have acquired block population data from census 2011 ministry of home affairs govt of india census of india 2011 and used it to represent the population possibly affected by drinking groundwater with nitrate concentration above the permissible limit 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 temporal trend analysis the temporal trend of average nitrate concentration was done using the hodrick and prescott hp filter the hp filter is a non parametric trend estimator the following equation separates the trends and cycles 1 min t t 1 t y t t t 2 λ t t 1 t t t t t t 1 2 where tt 1 and tt 1 are the trend component at the time steps t 1 and t 1 respectively the cyclical components can be computed by removing the trends from their real values reduction in the variability of cyclic components is achieved by selecting a suitable value of smoothing parameter λ and we have chosen λ 100 for yearly data in our study hodrick and prescott 1997 the hp filter was applied to the nitrate concentration values as well as the fertilizer data the hp filter has been applied previously in hydrogeology to determine temporal trends of various parameters bhanja et al 2017 duttagupta et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2019 3 3 2 granger causality test we have used the granger causality test between fertilizer consumption and nitrate concentration as granger causality allows determining the causal linkage between two variables zhang et al 2017 the primary purpose of the granger causality test is to identify whether variable x is causally linked to variable y and gives better understating than simple correlations granger 1969 a bi variate model e g eqs 2 and 3 is implemented between two stationary time series variables x and y 2 y n j 1 m a j y t j j 1 m b j x

x bj 0 in eq 1 and dj 0 in eq 2 for feedback between the two 3 3 3 spatial autocorrelation to identify the clusters of high and low nitrate concentration we performed spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation identifies the similarities among the neighbors and measures the likeness s extent as the function of spatial distance chaudhuri and ale 2014 griffith 1987 quino lima et al 2020 the most commonly used coefficient in univariate autocorrelation is the moran s i coefficient moran 1950 moran s i vary in the range of 1 and 1 for perfectly positive and entirely negative autocorrelation respectively zero denotes no correlation between adjacent neighbors a non zero value of moran s i denote that the nitrate concentration values in the contiguous blocks are more similar or less similar expected than randomly associated blocks eq 4 is used for calculating the moran s i 4 i n s i j w ij y i y y j y i y i y 2 where n is the number of samples or blocks y i and y j are the nitrate concentration values in i and j blocks y is the average of y and w ij is an element of matrix w s is the number of entries in the matrix w diniz filho et al 2003 after obtaining the univariate moran s i values spatial autocorrelation was represented as the lisa local indicators of spatial association significance maps lisa maps classify the location clusters based on the type of associations anselin et al 2006 spatial autocorrelation analysis was carried out using arcgis 10 2 software 3 3 4 assessment of natural and anthropogenic variables for association with groundwater nitrate we applied spearman s rank correlation and univariate logistic regression tests to assess how well groundwater nitrate concentrations were associated with various natural and anthropogenic variables for this purpose we selected a total of 21 variables from climate hydrogeologic hydrogeochemical and anthropogenic such as n fertilizer use and landuse categories based on published literature leading to the understanding that each of these variables has a direct or indirect influence on the distribution of nitrate in groundwater table s2 these selection criteria statistical results and the descriptive statistics of the variables are described in the supplementary information the correlations were tested at 95 confidence interval and the variables found significant in both the tests were only considered to have a possible association with groundwater nitrate all the variables except the n fertilizer consumption that was available only at the state level were summarized to the block level the blocks were binary coded i e 0 for no violation nitrate concentration 45 mg l and 1 for violation nitrate concentration 45 mg l during the study period for the univariate logistic regression test the spearman s ranked correlation test and logistic regressions were performed in r programming language v 3 6 1 3 4 uncertainty and assumptions only continuous datasets have been considered for the study during the entire study period this process utilized the maximum available temporal datasets from the respective data sources for temporal trend analysis over the mutually convenient time interval furthermore the validation of the data used here is solely dependent on the acquired datasets from government sources the data have been up scaled from individual wells to block level using the mean values from each block and using this block level data further analyses have been carried out the outcomes of spatial autocorrelation analysis using the moran s i may get influenced by the selection function for the weight function and presence of extreme values and this study considers these factors to get much reliable outcomes 4 results 4 1 spatial

statistic 228 01 p 0 04 for application for zone a only fertilizer application was observed to granger cause nitrate concentration in deep wells f statistic 714 25 p 0 02 fertilizer consumption and application did not show significant granger causality on nitrate concentration in other zones and while computing the entire india data 4 6 spatial autocorrelation and clustering of groundwater nitrate concentration to test whether the adjacent blocks were spatially auto correlated we used the moran s i and lisa maps based on their nitrate concentration moran s i values were positive and ranged from 0 40 to 0 50 for all the years table s6 the lowest value of spatial association was in 2014 0 42 fig 5e and highest was in 2016 0 50 fig 5g lisa maps showed persistent clustering of high value blocks in the west and central india region from 2010 to 2014 fig 5a e and it started reducing after 2014 fig 5f h india s north and southern areas had mostly high value clusters while the eastern and northeastern areas had low value clusters the high value clustering was more in the early years of the study period and tended to dissolve towards the end although the low value clustering was relatively constant 4 7 variables associated with groundwater nitrate spearman s ranked correlation results and univariate logistic regression tests indicated that out of the 21 variables selected 17 variables had a statistically significant association with groundwater nitrate concentration table s2 the significant variables were percent cropland percent deciduous forest percent urban area water table depth slope precipitation organic carbon content in topsoil clay content in topsoil sand content in topsoil soil permeability fertilizer consumption and groundwater chemical parameters ph total dissolved solids tds hardness alkalinity chloride and sulfate 5 discussion 5 1 occurrence of nitrate in groundwater this study is the first to delineate the occurrence and temporal trends in groundwater nitrate concentration across india around 3 million measurements of groundwater nitrate across the country are compiled for this study the spatial distribution of nitrate in groundwater is shown in fig 1 as well as in fig s2 the distribution indicates that the number of blocks with elevated nitrate concentration is maximum for zone e which consumes maximum fertilizer among the zones groundwater nitrate concentrations above the permissible limit of 45 mg l are observed at varying magnitudes in number of blocks and area in the 21 states out of 36 states of india the geological distribution pattern of groundwater nitrate shows that maximum of the affected areas lies in the indian cratonic aquifer region and indus ganges brahmaputra igb basin fig 2a our findings corroborate with previous studies that have reported high groundwater nitrate in alluvial basins khan et al 2019 lapworth et al 2017 lockhart et al 2013 and crystalline aquifers buvaneshwari et al 2017 mueller et al 1995 more specifically in the indian cratonic aquifer regions we observed that the states primarily affected from elevated groundwater nitrate are andhra pradesh and maharashtra from zone e madhya pradesh from zone d karnataka tamil nadu and telangana from zone c and kerala and orissa from zone b fig 2a and fig 3a while in the igb basin region the states affected most are punjab and uttar pradesh from zone e haryana and rajasthan from zone c and assam from zone b fig 2a and fig 3a these states comprise the majority of the elevated nitrate areas in the country the observed occurrences of high groundwater nitrate from our study match well with the previous reportings of elevated nitrate from andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 maharashtra gupta et al 2011 pandith et al 2017 madhya pradesh malik and shukla 2019 quamar et al 2020 karnataka mohammed aslam and rizvi 2020 tamil nadu karunanidhi et al 2021 telangana adimalla and li 2019 kerala nandakumaran and balakrishnan 2020 shaji et al 2018 and orissa sahoo and khaoash 2020 other areas with prevalent existence of elevated groundwater nitrate are observed in the semi consolidated aquifer areas of the state gujarat from zone d figs 1b and 2a and in smaller proportions of the states arunachal pradesh manipur meghalaya mizoram nagaland and tripura from zone a in the north east part of india fig 1b and fig 3a previous studies have also reported high groundwater nitrate from these areas kumar et al 2019 shirke et al 2020 singh et al 2008 in india 70 of the land area is used as croplands followed by 14 as deciduous forests 4 mixed leaf forests 4 of urban areas 3 shrubs 2 grasslands and 2 water bodies other landuse types such as sparse vegetation bare areas wetlands mangroves and snow covered areas constitute minimal landuse the majority 82 of the blocks with elevated groundwater nitrate are observed in the croplands fig 2b in zone e 25 of the cropped areas have high groundwater nitrate maximum among the five zones fig 2b zone e has some of india s highest agriculturally productive states e g andhra pradesh maharashtra punjab and uttar pradesh agri stats 2018 fig 1b previous studies have also found high groundwater nitrate in the highly cultivated parts of andhra pradesh reddy et al 2019 maharashtra marghade et al 2020 punjab ahada and suthar 2018 and uttar pradesh agarwal et al 2019 and reported excessive use of fertilizers as the primary cause of elevated nitrate for the other zones the percent of cropland affected with high groundwater nitrate ranges between 17 and 4 and zone a being the lowest and studies have also reported high nitrate in parts of these zones with agricultural activities kaur et al 2020 raja and neelakantan 2021 shirke et al 2020 thapa et al 2019 about 7 and 3 of the violating blocks are observed in the deciduous and mixed leaf forests respectively and zone a has the maximum percent of forest cover affected by elevated groundwater nitrate 11 with deciduous and 9 with mixed leaf forest areas fig 2b majority of states with elevated groundwater nitrate from zone a i e arunachal pradesh himachal pradesh manipur meghalaya mizoram nagaland sikkim and tripura has forest cover as the dominant landuse type fig 1b and 2b deciduous forests are well known to leach nitrates to the soil consequently leaching to the groundwater and nutrient content of deciduous forests are also higher honoki et al 2001 the bacteria present in the root nodules of deciduous trees can fix nitrogen rupert 2008 resulting in elevated nitrate concentrations in these areas around 4 of the blocks with elevated nitrate are observed in the urban areas encompassing 14 of india s total urban area zones e and d have the maximum percentages of their urban areas affected from high groundwater nitrate 22 and 21 respectively while zone a has the minimum 1 among the zones vishakhapatnam district of andhra pradesh ernakulum and kannur districts of kerala ludhiana district of punjab and hyderabad district of telangana state have shown pervasive high nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 1c elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the urban areas have become perpetual concern around the globe marghade 2020 in urban areas the primary sources of elevated nitrate are domestic wastes animal waste disposals leaching from landfills industrial and wastewater treatment effluents gao et al 2020 wakida and lerner 2005 a study by duan and kaushal 2015 soil nitrogen mobilization by ion exchange process can be promoted by the anthropogenic inputs in urban areas and thus can result in higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater previous studies from india and other parts of the world have reported higher occurrence of nitrate concentration in groundwater in urban setups resulting from unmanaged sanitation systems domestic sewage and wastewaters blarasin et al 2020 gao et al 2020 karunanidhi et al 2020 zendehbad et al 2019 in the case of other dominant landuse types shrubs and grasslands contained about 3 and 1 respectively of the violating blocks zone c showed the maximum percent of shrub area and zone e showed maximum percent of grasslands affected with elevated nitrate fig 1b and 2b the major contributing sources of groundwater nitrate in shrubs and grassland areas are known to be the dumping of manure fertilizers native soil organic matter and wet depositions almasri 2007 pastén zapata et al 2014 western parts of the state rajasthan and parts of andhra pradesh have shown shrub and grassland areas with groundwater nitrate concentrations above 45 mg l figs 1b and 2b 5 2 temporal patterns of groundwater nitrate concentration our study is the first to show that the average nitrate concentration in groundwater has a reducing trend in india though less in magnitude fig 4a and reducing trends are observed in both shallow fig s6 and deep wells fig s7 concentrations in the blocks violating the permissible limit of nitrate were also decreasing fig 4b in general agricultural activities such as use of synthetic fertilizers are widely regarded as the major source of nitrate contamination in groundwater savci 2012 we found that the fertilizer application trends were also decreasing in india during the study period fig s8 the n fertilizer application initially increased by 3 between 2010 70 8 kg ha and 2011 72 8 kg ha in india but after 2011 the usage rates decreased significantly kumar et al 2017 fig s8 previous studies have also reported that a decline in fertilizer usage resulted in the lowering of groundwater nitrate in countries like denmark hansen and djurhuus 1996 south korea lee et al 2017 and the united states pennino et al 2017 the cumulative decrease in fertilizer application was 13 from 2011 72 8 kg ha to 2017 63 5 kg ha this fact is supported by the granger causality analysis which showed significant causal relations between the fertilizer inputs and nitrate concentrations the zones e and a represented decreasing trend in fertilizer application which is reflected in the declination of groundwater nitrate concentrations in all blocks of these zones however the fertilizer application increased for zones c and d while remained constant for zone b the primary contributor for nitrate violations from zone d is the gujarat state fig 3a and although the overall fertilizer application for zone d showed increasing trend we found that fertilizer application decreased for gujarat zone c showed increasing trend in groundwater nitrate that corresponds with the increased fertilizer application of this zone previous studies have reported implication of restrictions on fertilizer inputs have resulted decrease in nitrate concentrations puckett et al 2011 rupert 2008 other than decreased fertilizer applications the other factor contributing to such declining trends in groundwater nitrate is the improvement of sanitary conditions fouché et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2019 reported that the status of sanitation infrastructure in india have improved significantly with the onset of clean india mission in 2014 we have also observed that nitrate concentrations declined about 15 decline in 2014 2017 however we emphasize that confirmations of the influence of improved sanitation on declining groundwater nitrate warrants further isotopic or tracer investigations in the study area 5 3 depth dependent variability of groundwater nitrate we observed that nitrate concentrations are higher in shallow wells than deep wells fig s5 an average of 10 of the shallow wells showed concentrations above the permissible limit whereas 6 of the deep wells had high nitrate concentrations the shallow aquifers are more vulnerable to contamination due to enhanced chances of contaminant leaching from the surface and eventually reaching the shallow aquifers pastén zapata et al 2014 qian et al 2020 higher concentrations in shallow wells are influenced by higher loading of nutrients to shallow groundwater tables while in greater depths low nitrate concentrations can be attributed to the redox conditions which induces the denitrification process and inhibits nitrate movement mueller et al 1995 spalding and exner 1993 deeper groundwater can be more anoxic than shallow groundwater and due to the prevalence of such oxygen limiting and lower redox potential conditions the microbial denitrification process is favoured in deep groundwater which leads to the release of n2o and n2 from denitrification of nitrate bhanja et al 2019b dutta et al 2018 the correlation values of shallow and deep groundwater nitrate concentrations with fertilizer consumption are highly significant and higher for shallow groundwater supporting that nutrient loading could result in higher nitrate concentration in shallow depths gu et al 2013 and li et al 2018 have reported elevated nitrate in shallow aquifers beneath wide spread agricultural areas of north and north western china other studies have also demonstrated similar higher nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater due to surplus fertilizer application and lower concentrations in deep groundwater due to the longer travel time and denitrification in the coastal plain of arborea italy biddau et al 2019 and in the indus river flood plain in pakistan khan et al 2019 we have found that average nitrate concentrations in the shallow wells are higher than deep wells for the zone c d and e these zones receive more n inputs in the form of fertilizers resulting in higher nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater previous studies confirm our observations of higher nitrate concentration in shallow depths in these zones adimalla et al 2018 lapworth et al 2017 the groundwater recharge distribution shown in fig s9 indicates that the recharge rates are very high in the east west and northern parts of the country these areas receive higher precipitation than other parts of the country fig s9 and are located in the porous igb basin aquifer regions fig 2a the groundwater table depths were primarily shallow except the arid and semi arid western parts fig s10 therefore with the higher groundwater recharge and connectivity nitrate from the surface can reach the groundwater below and easily contaminate the shallow groundwater in these regions but with increased depth the denitrifying conditions prevail that inhibit nitrate movement and result in lower nitrate concentrations in deep groundwater than shallow groundwater in punjab and uttar pradesh of zone e haryana and rajasthan of zone c the groundwater recharge rates are low in the central and southern parts of the country fig s9 and these areas are located in the cratonic crystalline aquifer region fig 2a these aquifers are less conductive and the recharge water from the surface cannot reach the deeper depths and is restricted only to the shallow depths bhanja et al 2019a mukherjee et al 2015 thus explaining the higher nitrate concentrations in the shallow depths in the central and southern parts such as andhra pradesh and maharashtra of zone e madhya pradesh of zone d and karnataka tamil nadu and telangana of zone c further details on groundwater recharge in the study area can be found in bhanja et al 2019a for zones a and b the n inputs from fertilizers are significantly less and thus the nitrate concentrations in the shallow snd deep wells were nearly similar and very low compared to other zones figs s6 and s7 5 4 clusters of high and low groundwater nitrate strong spatial autocorrelation can be seen among the administrative blocks for groundwater nitrate concentration based on the positive moran s i values during the study period fig 5 furthermore the moran s i values are higher in the early years of the study period and comparatively low in the later years indicating a reduction in clustering phenomenon which is similar to our temporal trend observations of nitrate table s6 values of neighboring blocks were used to build a spatial matrix of contiguity and moran s i was calculated using that matrix maximum moran s i value in 2012 due to the high average nitrate concentration in the blocks and minimum moran s i in 2014 due to the low clustering though the number of blocks in violation was maximum moran s i have been used in numerous studies for evaluating trends in water usage quantity and quality chaudhuri et al 2012 franczyk and chang 2009 machiwal et al 2012 lisa maps allow visualizing the association between similar and dissimilar values by considering the data clusters and outliers for the northeastern region we have observed high value clustering in 2010 and 2011 only in the other years this region has not shown any significant clustering which indicates the dissolution of clusters in the northeast resulting from the decrease in n fertilizer use fig 5c h these areas mostly come under zone a with very low consumption of fertilizers most of the eastern areas have low value clustering except high high value association in orissa resembling our observations of low nitrate concentration in this region fig 5a h the low low clustering in the eastern zone was consistent for the study period while it is inconsistent for high value clustering majority of the areas from zone b and c have reflected low low or insignificant clustering during the study period most of the high value clusters with highly significant spatial autocorrelation are observed in central west and some states in north india mainly practicing agricultural activity and consuming higher n fertilizer consumption mostly from zone e and d fig 5a h the states of punjab and uttar pradesh in the northern and gujarat and maharashtra in western and madhya pradesh in central india have clusters of high high spatial autocorrelation fig 5a h in the southern region most areas have shown high value clustering fig 5a h the percent area under high value clustering was more 20 in the early study period and decreased later while the low value clusters showed the opposite trend these results indicate temporal decrease in clustering of high nitrate concentration in the blocks lisa maps indicated that areas with high fertilizer consumption and croplands are the hotspots of high nitrate concentration in groundwater while areas with less fertilizer consumption and greater forest coverage have comparatively low concentration 5 5 relationship of groundwater nitrate with natural and anthropogenic parameters variables found significant in spearman s correlation test and logistic regression in our study agree with previous studies that found the association of high groundwater nitrate concentration with fertilizer use adimalla 2020 khan et al 2019 rupert 2008 sharma et al 2016 landuse busico et al 2017 epelde et al 2016

properties in combination with conditions that inhibits denitrification process e g limited carbon supply and oxygenated in subsurface bhanja et al 2019b spalding and exner 1993 the correlations

sulfate ph hardness and alkalinity further discussions on the correlations are provided in the supplementary information text s2 5 6 vulnerability of population based on the 2011 census population data we estimated that the population vulnerable to high groundwater nitrate exposure is 71 million 71 187 156 table s7 fig 6 of these 71 million people 64 million is the rural population table s8 and the rest 7 million are urban table s9 i e 90 is rural and 10 is urban these statistics indicate that the rural population is much more vulnerable to groundwater nitrate pollution for the five zones the maximum vulnerable population are from zone e 35 million and followed by zone d 14 million zone c 13 million zone b 8 million and zone a 0 50 million the estimations also indicated that the maximum rural population exposed to elevated groundwater are from zone e 31 million followed by zone d 13 million zone c 12 million zone b 7 million and zone a 0 46 million in case of the urban population maximum population vulnerable are from zone e 4 million followed by zone c 1 million zone b 0 90 million zone d 0 65 million and zone a 0 04 million some of the states with most affected people are 17 4 million uttar pradesh 11 1 million andhra pradesh 6 5 million and punjab 1 6 million of zone e gujarat 7 4 million and madhya pradesh 6 8 million of zone d rajasthan 5 5 million tamil nadu 4 3 million karnataka 3 6 million and telangana 1 8 million of zone c and assam 2 9 million orissa 2 9 million and kerala 2 8 million of zone b fig 6 these estimations indicate that a large population of india especially the rural population is exposed to high groundwater nitrate concentrations and warrants significant attention towards the mitigation of the groundwater elevated nitrate problem 6 conclusion the occurrence of elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations in the highly agrarian areas of south asia is a matter of serious concern to the large groundwater dependent population of this region in this study we attempted to delineate the first nationwide distribution and 8 year temporal trends in groundwater nitrate and identified the occurrence and clustering of nitrate concentrations above the permissible limit of 45 mg l using a large dataset and contemporary statistical methods in india the distribution of groundwater nitrate indicated that out of the 36 states of india 21 have concerns of elevated groundwater nitrate and majority of these states are from zones with high fertilizer applications the states of andhra pradesh maharashtra punjab uttar pradesh gujarat madhya pradesh karnataka tamil nadu and telangana are the most affected and consisted majority of the violating blocks of groundwater nitrate we observed that majority of the blocks with elevated nitrate emerged in the alluvial igb basin aquifers and crystalline aquifers of the indian cratonic region nitrate concentration was significantly higher in shallow wells than deep wells we have also found that the highest percent of the violating blocks were located in the croplands followed by deciduous forests urban areas mixed leaf forests shrubs and grasslands the 8 year temporal trend from 2010 and 2017 showed that the overall nitrate concentration in india is slightly decreasing similar decrease in nitrate concentration was also observed for the shallow and deep wells the statistical tests demonstrated that the decreasing trend in groundwater nitrate corresponds to the declining fertilizer application during the study period clustering blocks with high groundwater nitrate in central west and north india coincided with extensive fertilizer usage in these areas lastly we estimate that about 71 million people is at risk of exposure to elevated groundwater nitrate and of these 71 million 90 is rural and 10 is urban we conclude that higher nitrate concentration is a wide spread concern in india and needs significant attention the decrease in nitrate concentration with decreased fertilizer usage indicates that if use of n fertilizers is restricted nitrate may reduce below the permissible limits in groundwater by natural reduction processes such as denitrification but it may take several years investigations on plant available nitrogen during each cropping period and for different soils and use of native crop species may reduce fertilizer use and eventually nitrate concentrations we stress further investigations on zone site specific crop fertilizer requirements and denitrification capabilities of soils based on our study results moreover we are also emphasizing the requirement of long term monitoring studies including applying stable isotopes and modeling approaches to help develop more detailed quantification of groundwater nitrate

herein c0 mg l and ce mg l represent the initial and the final concentration of bpa respectively ariaeenejad et al 2021 ku sahoo et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 sem analysis the sem image of go is exhibited in fig 1 a which demonstrated the flake structure of go fig 1b shows that the spherical nzvi is dispersed on graphene oxide sheets it can be observed that the nzvi particles are decorated with go saleh and gupta 2012 saleh 2015b also dispersion of copper grains between go sheets is clear in the sem image of nzvi go cu fig 1c which reveals a proper combination between go sheet and cu moreover the particle size distribution related to the synthesized go nzvi cu is illustrated in fig 2 that the average size of nanocomposite was achieved 20 89 nm with standard deviation sd of 8 502 3 1 2 eds analysis the presence of high amount of c 77 5 and o 22 5 in the eds spectrum fig 3a proves the go structure eds analysis related to the nzvi go fig 3b confirms the presence of fe 45 3 c 28 6 and o 26 1 in addition fig 3c demonstrates the presence of c 50 5 fe 29 1 o 16 7 and cu 3 7 in the nzvi go cu composite for analyzing the sample it should be an electrical conductor so the sample surface is coated before testing this coating is usually made of gold au and the presence of au in these spectra is due to this coverage 3 1 3 ftir analysis ftir spectrum of go is displayed in fig 4a the observed peak at 3427 cm 1 is corresponding to the oh group stretching vibrations two absorption peaks at 1728 and 1627 cm 1 are related to the co stretching of rcooh carboxylic characteristic peak and sp2 bonded carbon c c respectively the band at 1396 and 1061 cm 1 are due to co stretching vibrations saleh 2011 rattana et al 2012 papiya et al 2019 fig 4 b is related to the nzvi go spectra which has a slight peak at 494 cm 1 assigned to the feo group also the vibration at 795 cm 1 is belonged to the feooh the stretching vibration of oh and is observed at 3420 and 3216 cm 1 the peak at 1047 cm 1 is corresponding to the hydrogen bonded oh xing et al 2020 hemmat et al 2021 in fig 4c peak in the range of 400 to 700 cm 1 can be attributed to the metal oxide stretching vibration saleh 2018 the absorption peak around 584 cm 1 is related to the cuo stretching vibration the peak intensity of nzvi go cu diminished compared with nzvi go at 584 cm 1 which confirms that cu stabilized on nzvi go ganesan et al 2020 the absorption peak at 2919 cm 1 is due to ch stretching vibration the peak around 1630 cm 1 can be attributed to the cc bond hamdy et al 2018 3 1 4 xrd analysis xrd pattern of go is shown in fig 5a an increase in the interplanar distance between the nanoplatelets occurred after the placement of oxygenated groups therefore the peak at 2θ 9

17 5 25 2 36 1 and 57 0 it can be said that it is compatible with the standards jcpds 19 0629 farooq et al 2017 in nzvi go cu fig 5c the specific peaks are demonstrated at 2θ values of 12 74 25 35 and 56 0 3 1 5 vsm analysis the magnetic features of go go nzvi and go nzvi cu were investigated by vsm fig 6 the saturation magnetization σs of go go nzvi and go nzvi cu was found 0 0518 1 2426 and 1 0585 emu g 1 the magnetic property of go nzvi cu is lower than go nzvi which is due to adding cu to go nzvi 3 2 effect of experimental parameters in this section the effects of ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial bpa concentration and temperature with three repetitions n 3 were examined 3 2 1 effect of ph ph of the solution affects the electrostatic interaction between bpa and the surface of the adsorbent this factor was assessed in the range of 3 to 10 the removal percentage was a maximum when the ph was equal to 7 then the removal value diminished with increasing ph this decreasing may be owing to the deprotonation of the hydroxy of phenol at ph higher than 7 hydrogen bonding may have occurred between bpa and adsorbent hence ph 7 with the removal percentage of 97 was considered as optimum ph fig 7a tang et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of contact time a plot of the removal percentage of bpa against different contact times 2 12 min is illustrated in fig 7b as shown in this fig the removal of bpa increased during the 5 min then at the equilibrium point 10 min the removal rate was 97 and no more removal percentage was observed after 10 min therefore 10 min was chosen for the subsequent experiments as the equilibrium time at the time of 2 to 10 min the rate of bpa removal was higher owing to the accessibility of more than the required number of active sites on the adsorbent surface and becomes slower after a contact time of 10 min due to the reduced number of active sites by increasing time until 10 min the accessible sites related to the adsorbent were increased and after 10 min the adsorbent was saturated ahmadi et al 2017 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dosage was evaluated from 0 05 to 0 2 g the results indicated that the removal percentage is dependent on the amount of nzvi go cu added increasing the adsorbent led to enhance the percentage removal of bpa which can be owing to the increase in the number of active sites of nzvi go cu that the penetration of pollutant into active sites is facilitated the maximum removal of bpa was 97 with an adsorbent dose of 0 2 g fig 7c however at higher values of adsorbent dosage the removal percentage may be reduced due to the agglomeration of adsorbent particles reddy koduru et al 2016 3 2 4 effect of pollutant concentration changes in the initial concentration of the bpa were studied from 10 to 30 mg l as shown in fig 7d the bpa removal reduced from 97 to 85 as the initial concentration of bpa increased this is probably attributed to the limited number of active sites on the surface of nzvi go cu versus the higher concentration of bpa which prevent the bpa from binding completely to the adsorbent surface pal et al 2013 3 2 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the removal of bpa was considered at 15 c 25 c and 35 c with different concentration of bpa 10 30 mg l fig 7e it can be concluded that the removal of bpa was diminished from 98 5 to 79 5 by decreasing the temperature from 35 to 15 c it can be suggested that the reaction was endothermic hamdy et al 2018 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent as well as investigation of the adsorption process at homogeneous or heterogeneous surface have been explained using adsorption isotherm models the experimentally achieved data were applied for langmuir and freundlich isotherm models in order to find the best model the maximum capacity removal of the nzvi go cu corresponding to the monolayer surface of this adsorbent can be determined by langmuir isotherm eq 2 is denoted the linear equation of langmuir 2 c e q e 1 q m k l 1 q m c e energy of adsorption is shown by langmuir constant kl l mg the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g 1 and maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 are demonstrated by qe and qm respectively ce reveals the concentration of pollutant at the equilibrium state mg l eslek koyuncu and okur 2021 gholamiyan et al 2020 by plotting ce qe versus ce the values of qm and kl were found via slope and intercept fig 8a in other words for the langmuir isotherm model the ce qe was plotted to ce then the slope will be equal to 1 qm and intercept will be equal to 1 klqm in the langmuir isotherm adsorption occurs only at a limited number of specific and identical sites therefore this isotherm is based on homogeneous or uniform adsorption in which the adsorbent molecules have a constant enthalpy and activation energy in this model adsorption is assumed to be a monolayer the mechanism of multi molecular layer adsorption is described by freundlich isotherm its practical equation states the adsorption on a heterogeneous surface eq 3 represented the freundlich linearized form 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where n specifies the freundlich constant which expresses the heterogeneity of the surface according to the assumptions of freundlich when n 1 n 1 and n 1 the adsorption is chemical physical and linear respectively eslek koyuncu and okur 2021 log qe against log ce was plotted and 1 n and kf were obtained through the slope 1 n and intercept log kf respectively fig 8b the calculated isotherm parameters related to the cited are given in table 1 according to the results that the data fitted well within the langmuir isotherm the higher value of the coefficient of determination r2 was considered for this reason r2 1 thus the monolayer adsorption process is proven given the r2 of both isotherms it can be assumed that part of the adsorption is in the form of a molecular monolayer on the adsorbent surface langmuir model the other part is not limited to the formation of one adsorption layer and can be used for the multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface freundlich model 3 4 adsorption kinetics various kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were suggested to study the mechanisms of adsorption eqs 4 and 5 based on the lagrange equation express pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic respectively 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e herein the values of the amount adsorbed per unit mass at equilibrium and at any time t are demonstrated by qe and qt k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the rate coefficients related to the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order respectively al khateeb et al 2014 ln qe qt versus t was plotted that the values of k1 and qe cal were acquired through the slope and intercept respectively fig 9a the slope and intercept assigned to the t qt against t plot were studied to estimate the k2 and qe cal fig 9b it is clear that the r2 values of pseudo second order related to the bpa was obtained 0 995 which was higher than the pseudo first order 0 8863 this states that the controlling of adsorption was performed by a chemical process the calculated adsorption capacity by the pseudo second order model was 16 10 mg g 1 table 2 which was almost close to the experimental value 21 59 mg g 1 it can be assumed that due to the presence of nzvi the reaction is radical and the value of the r2 confirms this reaction also in the transition state when the bonds are changed the chemical structure changes which is confirmed by the value of r2 3 5 thermodynamic study different temperature values 288 298 and 308 k were considered to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters including changes in the free energy δg0 enthalpy energy change δh0 and entropy energy change δs0 these parameters were calculated by following equations 6 g 0 rtln k d 7 k d q e c e where r and t are the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and the temperature k respectively kd l mg denotes the distribution constant kakavandi et al 2014 laabd et al 2016 by plotting lnkc versus 1 t van t hoff plot fig 10 δh0 and δs0 parameters can be calculated using slope and intercept respectively the nature of the adsorption process is spontaneous due to the negative values of δg0 table 3 moreover the δg values become greater by decreasing the temperature from 308 to 288 k which implies that the adsorption process is suitable at higher temperatures also the δh0 and δs0 values for bpa adsorption on go nzvi cu were 17 459 4 j mol and 61 23 j mol k which demonstrate that the adsorption procedure was endothermic in nature 3 6 comparison of various adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity removal efficiency and contact time related to the different adsorbents were investigated to remove bpa from aqueous solutions table 4 it is clear that go nzvi cu possesses a high potential for the removal of bpa with minimum time 10 min compared to the other ones as shown qmax and the removal percentage relative to minimum contact time is acceptable for go nzvi cu in the other adsorbents more time was spent to achieve qmax and maximum removal 4 conclusion in this study the bpa removal performance onto nzvi go cu was experimented the formation of go nzvi go and nzvi go cu was proved by fesem eds ftir xrd vsm at a ph 7 the removal percentage was enhanced up to 97 by an increase in adsorbent dosage 0 2 g the contact time 10 min and temperature as well as a decrease in the initial concentration of bpa 10 mg l the equilibrium adsorption data were obtained to fit best using a langmuir isotherm r2 1 in comparison with the freundlich model the adsorption parameter of bpa by nzvi go cu obeyed by the pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 0 995 which revealed that the adsorption process was controlled by the chemical reaction the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the nature of adsorption behavior was endothermic with δh 17 459 4 j mol and δs 61 23 j mol k as well as spontaneous with negative δg0 results represented that nzvi go cu has a high adsorption capacity 21 59 mg g 1 cost effective and rapid for bpa removal from aqueous media at minimum time 10 min credit authorship contribution statement shokoufeh yousefinia investigation data

herein c0 mg l and ce mg l represent the initial and the final concentration of bpa respectively ariaeenejad et al 2021 ku sahoo et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 sem analysis the sem image of go is exhibited in fig 1 a which demonstrated the flake structure of go fig 1b shows that the spherical nzvi is dispersed on graphene oxide sheets it can be observed that the nzvi particles are decorated with go saleh and gupta 2012 saleh 2015b also dispersion of copper grains between go sheets is clear in the sem image of nzvi go cu fig 1c which reveals a proper combination between go sheet and cu moreover the particle size distribution related to the synthesized go nzvi cu is illustrated in fig 2 that the average size of nanocomposite was achieved 20 89 nm with standard deviation sd of 8 502 3 1 2 eds analysis the presence of high amount of c 77 5 and o 22 5 in the eds spectrum fig 3a proves the go structure eds analysis related to the nzvi go fig 3b confirms the presence of fe 45 3 c 28 6 and o 26 1 in addition fig 3c demonstrates the presence of c 50 5 fe 29 1 o 16 7 and cu 3 7 in the nzvi go cu composite for analyzing the sample it should be an electrical conductor so the sample surface is coated before testing this coating is usually made of gold au and the presence of au in these spectra is due to this coverage 3 1 3 ftir analysis ftir spectrum of go is displayed in fig 4a the observed peak at 3427 cm 1 is corresponding to the oh group stretching vibrations two absorption peaks at 1728 and 1627 cm 1 are related to the co stretching of rcooh carboxylic characteristic peak and sp2 bonded carbon c c respectively the band at 1396 and 1061 cm 1 are due to co stretching vibrations saleh 2011 rattana et al 2012 papiya et al 2019 fig 4 b is related to the nzvi go spectra which has a slight peak at 494 cm 1 assigned to the feo group also the vibration at 795 cm 1 is belonged to the feooh the stretching vibration of oh and is observed at 3420 and 3216 cm 1 the peak at 1047 cm 1 is corresponding to the hydrogen bonded oh xing et al 2020 hemmat et al 2021 in fig 4c peak in the range of 400 to 700 cm 1 can be attributed to the metal oxide stretching vibration saleh 2018 the absorption peak around 584 cm 1 is related to the cuo stretching vibration the peak intensity of nzvi go cu diminished compared with nzvi go at 584 cm 1 which confirms that cu stabilized on nzvi go ganesan et al 2020 the absorption peak at 2919 cm 1 is due to ch stretching vibration the peak around 1630 cm 1 can be attributed to the cc bond hamdy et al 2018 3 1 4 xrd analysis xrd pattern of go is shown in fig 5a an increase in the interplanar distance between the nanoplatelets occurred after the placement of oxygenated groups therefore the peak at 2θ 9 23 was appeared in the go which is in agreement with standard data for go jcpds card no 75 2078 hemmat et al 2021 gascho et al 2019 the peaks of the nzvi go fig 5b observed at 2θ values equal to 12 11 17 5 25 2 36 1 and 57 0 it can be said that it is compatible with the standards jcpds 19 0629 farooq et al 2017 in nzvi go cu fig 5c the specific peaks are demonstrated at 2θ values of 12 74 25 35 and 56 0 3 1 5 vsm analysis the magnetic features of go go nzvi and go nzvi cu were investigated by vsm fig 6 the saturation magnetization σs of go go nzvi and go nzvi cu was found 0 0518 1 2426 and 1 0585 emu g 1 the magnetic property of go nzvi cu is lower than go nzvi which is due to adding cu to go nzvi 3 2 effect of experimental parameters in this section the effects of ph contact time adsorbent dosage initial bpa concentration and temperature with three repetitions n 3 were examined 3 2 1 effect of ph ph of the solution affects the electrostatic interaction between bpa and the surface of the adsorbent this factor was assessed in the range of 3 to 10 the removal percentage was a maximum when the ph was equal to 7 then the removal value diminished with increasing ph this decreasing may be owing to the deprotonation of the hydroxy of phenol at ph higher than 7 hydrogen bonding may have occurred between bpa and adsorbent hence ph 7 with the removal percentage of 97 was considered as optimum ph fig 7a tang et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of contact time a plot of the removal percentage of bpa against different contact times 2 12 min is illustrated in fig 7b as shown in this fig the removal of bpa increased during the 5 min then at the equilibrium point 10 min the removal rate was 97 and no more removal percentage was observed after 10 min therefore 10 min was chosen for the subsequent experiments as the equilibrium time at the time of 2 to 10 min the rate of bpa removal was higher owing to the accessibility of more than the required number of active sites on the adsorbent surface and becomes slower after a contact time of 10 min due to the reduced number of active sites by increasing time until 10 min the accessible sites related to the adsorbent were increased and after 10 min the adsorbent was saturated ahmadi et al 2017 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dosage was evaluated from 0 05 to 0 2 g the results indicated that the removal percentage is dependent on the amount of nzvi go cu added increasing the adsorbent led to enhance the percentage removal of bpa which can be owing to the increase in the number of active sites of nzvi go cu that the penetration of pollutant into active sites is facilitated the maximum removal of bpa was 97 with an adsorbent dose of 0 2 g fig 7c however at higher values of adsorbent dosage the removal percentage may be reduced due to the agglomeration of adsorbent particles reddy koduru et al 2016 3 2 4 effect of pollutant concentration changes in the initial concentration of the bpa were studied from 10 to 30 mg l as shown in fig 7d the bpa removal reduced from 97 to 85 as the initial concentration of bpa increased this is probably attributed to the limited number of active sites on the surface of nzvi go cu versus the higher concentration of bpa which prevent the bpa from binding completely to the adsorbent surface pal et al 2013 3 2 5 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on the removal of bpa was considered at 15 c 25 c and 35 c with different concentration of bpa 10 30 mg l fig 7e it can be concluded that the removal of bpa was diminished from 98 5 to 79 5 by decreasing the temperature from 35 to 15 c it can be suggested that the reaction was endothermic hamdy et al 2018 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent as well as investigation of the adsorption process at homogeneous or heterogeneous surface have been explained using adsorption isotherm models the experimentally achieved data were applied for langmuir and freundlich isotherm models in order to find the best model the maximum capacity removal of the nzvi go cu corresponding to the monolayer surface of this adsorbent can be determined by langmuir isotherm eq 2 is denoted the linear equation of langmuir 2 c e q e 1 q m k l 1 q m c e energy of adsorption is shown by langmuir constant kl l mg the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g 1 and maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 are demonstrated by qe and qm respectively ce reveals the concentration of pollutant at the equilibrium state mg l eslek koyuncu and okur 2021 gholamiyan et al 2020 by plotting ce qe versus ce the values of qm and kl were found via slope and intercept fig 8a in other words for the langmuir isotherm model the ce qe was plotted to ce then the slope will be equal to 1 qm and intercept will be equal to 1 klqm in the langmuir isotherm adsorption occurs only at a limited number of specific and identical sites therefore this isotherm is based on homogeneous or uniform adsorption in which the adsorbent molecules have a constant enthalpy and activation energy in this model adsorption is assumed to be a monolayer the mechanism of multi molecular layer adsorption is described by freundlich isotherm its practical equation states the adsorption on a heterogeneous surface eq 3 represented the freundlich linearized form 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where n specifies the freundlich constant which expresses the heterogeneity of the surface according to the assumptions of freundlich when n 1 n 1 and n 1 the adsorption is chemical physical and linear respectively eslek koyuncu and okur 2021 log qe against log ce was plotted and 1 n and kf were obtained through the slope 1 n and intercept log kf respectively fig 8b the calculated isotherm parameters related to the cited are given in table 1 according to the results that the data fitted well within the langmuir isotherm the higher value of the coefficient of determination r2 was considered for this reason r2 1 thus the monolayer adsorption process is proven given the r2 of both isotherms it can be assumed that part of the adsorption is in the form of a molecular monolayer on the adsorbent surface langmuir model the other part is not limited to the formation of one adsorption layer and can be used for the multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface freundlich model 3 4 adsorption kinetics various kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were suggested to study the mechanisms of adsorption eqs 4 and 5 based on the lagrange equation express pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic respectively 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e herein the values of the amount adsorbed per unit mass at equilibrium and at any time t are demonstrated by qe and qt k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are the rate coefficients related to the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order respectively al khateeb et al 2014 ln qe qt versus t was plotted that the values of k1 and qe cal were acquired through the slope and intercept respectively fig 9a the slope and intercept assigned to the t qt against t plot were studied to estimate the k2 and qe cal fig 9b it is clear that the r2 values of pseudo second order related to the bpa was obtained 0 995 which was higher than the pseudo first order 0 8863 this states that the controlling of adsorption was performed by a chemical process the calculated adsorption capacity by the pseudo second order model was 16 10 mg g 1 table 2 which was almost close to the experimental value 21 59 mg g 1 it can be assumed that due to the presence of nzvi the reaction is radical and the value of the r2 confirms this reaction also in the transition state when the bonds are changed the chemical structure changes which is confirmed by the value of r2 3 5 thermodynamic study different temperature values 288 298 and 308 k were considered to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters including changes in the free energy δg0 enthalpy energy change δh0 and entropy energy change δs0 these parameters were calculated by following equations 6 g 0 rtln k d 7 k d q e c e where r and t are the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and the temperature k respectively kd l mg denotes the distribution constant kakavandi et al 2014 laabd et al 2016 by plotting lnkc versus 1 t van t hoff plot fig 10 δh0 and δs0 parameters can be calculated using slope and intercept respectively the nature of the adsorption process is spontaneous due to the negative values of δg0 table 3 moreover the δg values become greater by decreasing the temperature from 308 to 288 k which implies that the adsorption process is suitable at higher temperatures also the δh0 and δs0 values for bpa adsorption on go nzvi cu were 17 459 4 j mol and 61 23 j mol k which demonstrate that the adsorption procedure was endothermic in nature 3 6 comparison of various adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity removal efficiency and contact time related to the different adsorbents were investigated to remove bpa from aqueous solutions table 4 it is clear that go nzvi cu possesses a high potential for the removal of bpa with minimum time 10 min compared to the other ones as shown qmax and the removal percentage relative to minimum contact time is acceptable for go nzvi cu in the other adsorbents more time was spent to achieve qmax and maximum removal 4 conclusion in this study the bpa removal performance onto nzvi go cu was experimented the formation of go nzvi go and nzvi go cu was proved by fesem eds ftir xrd vsm at a ph 7 the removal percentage was enhanced up to 97 by an increase in adsorbent dosage 0 2 g the contact time 10 min and temperature as well as a decrease in the initial concentration of bpa 10 mg l the equilibrium adsorption data were obtained to fit best using a langmuir isotherm r2 1 in comparison with the freundlich model the adsorption parameter of bpa by nzvi go cu obeyed by the pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 0 995 which revealed that the adsorption process was controlled by the chemical reaction the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the nature of adsorption behavior was endothermic with δh 17 459 4 j mol and δs 61 23 j mol k as well as spontaneous with negative δg0 results represented that nzvi go cu has a high adsorption capacity 21 59 mg g 1 cost effective and rapid for bpa removal from aqueous media at minimum time 10 min credit authorship contribution statement shokoufeh yousefinia investigation data

1372,the domenico solution is a widely used analytical solution in screening tools such as bioscreen fate5 biochlor art3d arcnlet quick domenico etc to simulate the three dimensional transport of reactive contaminants in groundwater while being approximate this solution presents a convenient closed form expression for computing plume contaminant concentrations without the need for numerical integration previous studies have mathematically shown that the domenico solution provides correct estimates of contaminant plume concentrations when the value of longitudinal dispersivity is zero however under non zero longitudinal dispersivity values the errors in the domenico solution increase especially at plume locations beyond the advective front the nature of these errors places severe limitations on the applicability of the domenico solution in simulating realistic contaminant transport problems here we present a new closed form solution for three dimensional 3d reactive contaminant transport that overcomes this limitation we introduce the concept of characteristic residence time which represents the average time taken by a contaminant particle to reach a given x y z location we show that along the plume centerline the characteristic residence time exhibits three features i initial linear response with a slope equal to the inverse of advection velocity ii final saturation response with a maximum value of simulation time iii transition between the initial and final responses at the region surrounding the advective front with sharper transitions at lower longitudinal dispersivities and smoother transitions at higher longitudinal dispersivities we calibrate the ramberg osgood function to fit the behavior of the characteristic residence time along the plume centerline and use this to develop a new and improved closed form approximation for the domenico solution without any additional computational effort our new and improved solution better approximates the solute concentrations of a three dimensional contaminant plume under realistic values of longitudinal dispersivity our improved solution closely matches the exact analytical solution especially at plume locations beyond the advective front where the domenico solution performs poorly existing screening tools can be readily be retrofitted with the new and improved solution to provide more accurate estimates for plume concentrations keywords domenico solution groundwater contaminant transport analytical solution screening tool characteristic residence time 1 introduction a frequently encountered problem in groundwater contamination is predicting the fate and transport of 3d contaminant plumes emanating from a constant rectangular patch source in a semi infinite domain undergoing 1d advection 3d dispersion linear equilibrium sorption and first order decay domenico 1987 the exact semi analytical solution to this equation for a conservative contaminant was provided by sagar 1982 later wexler 1992 presented a semi analytical solution wexler solution for a non conservative source undergoing first order decay wexler 1992 also presented solutions for reactive transport of point and line sources in semi infinite and finite domains the solutions derived by sagar 1982 and wexler 1992 are semi analytical semi analytical solutions require numerical integration to compute the final plume concentrations making these solutions computationally demanding and prone to numerical errors several authors have discussed the challenges of using semi analytical models wang et al 2011 burnell et al 2011 2012 a simple trapezoidal integration approach is insufficient to get accurate estimates of plume concentrations depending on the choice of parameters and the simulation location sophisticated adaptive mesh methods or higher order methods gauss quadrature are required to compute plume concentrations wang et al 2011 while higher level programming languages have readily available tools for adaptive integration most groundwater contaminant transport screening level models are embedded in a microsoft excel based gui platform newell et al 1996 aziz et al 2002 promma 2010 brown 2014 where advanced integration techniques are not readily available closed form solutions overcome this difficulty by eliminating the need for such a numerical integration step domenico 1987 presented an approximate closed form analytical solution domenico solution to the area patch source 3d reactive contaminant transport problem solved by wexler 1992 this solution was derived using the method described in domenico and robbins 1985 for a conservative source being a closed form solution the domenico solution is computationally advantageous compared to the semi analytical wexler solution since the computational demand of semi analytical solutions increases with larger simulation times and close to steady state conditions burnell et al 2011 the domenico solution offers an attractive alternative especially for long term monitoring and natural attenuation studies our analysis indicates that the domenico solution is 50 times more computationally efficient than the semi analytical wexler solution when solving 3d contaminant transport problems typically encountered in groundwater another key advantage of the closed form domenico solution is that it decouples the longitudinal advective dispersive transport from the transverse purely dispersive transport srinivasan et al 2007 west et al 2007 this decoupling enables the conversion of 1d multi species solutions into 3d solutions simply by multiplying 1d solutions with transverse dispersion terms aziz et al 2000 a feature that is attractive for use in coupled multi species transport problems due to its simplicity the domenico solution has been widely popular in screening models newell et al 1996 aziz et al 2000 jones et al 2006 promma 2010 brown 2014 funk et al 2017 and educational tools devlin et

solution for a prism shaped conservative contaminant source and implemented the new solution in a microsoft excel based user interface the transformation technique by domenico and schwartz 1998 was applied to first approximate a 3d source to a 2d planar source the modified 2d planar source concentrations were then calculated using a geometric transformation approach involving source angles which

tool at123d implemented a set of semi analytical solutions to predict the fate and transport of reactive groundwater contaminants subject to various initial and boundary conditions using the green s function approach yeh 1981 yeh 1981 derived expressions for contamination from a point line area and volume sources for dirichlet neumann and cauchy boundary conditions however at123d is a fortran based tool that does not include any user interface for plume visualization park and zhan 2001 applied the approach of yeh 1981 to obtain semi analytical solutions for an aquifer of finite thickness and implemented his solution algorithm in matlab while the green s function solution is versatile the complex nature of the solution and its associated multiple integrals causes convergence problems during numerical integration especially under large simulation times burnell et al 2011 while some numerical improvements were made to the original at123d model at123d at by burnell et al 2012 the green s function approach involves multiple nested numerical integrations which can be challenging to evaluate 1 2 review of errors in the domenico solution due to its approximate nature the domenico solution has received considerable investigations on the nature of its error guyonnet and neville 2004 west and kueper 2004 srinivasan et al 2007 west et al 2007 aziz et al 2009 guyonnet and neville 2004 compared the domenico solution with the sagar solution for a conservative contaminant they concluded that for transport dominated by advection and mechanical dispersion the errors in the domenico solution are minor along the plume centerline however for transport dominated by molecular diffusion and first order decay reaction the domenico solution introduces significant errors especially for plume locations away from the centreline west and kueper 2004 compared the domenico solution with an exact analytical solution and concluded that the domenico solution introduces significant errors at large values of longitudinal dispersivity west et al 2007 showed that the errors in the domenico solution could vary between 2 to 80 depending on the parameter values srinivasan et al 2007 employed a rigorous mathematical analysis to characterize the nature of the error in the domenico approximation and compared the domenico solution with the wexler solution based on their mathematical derivations and model intercomparison simulations they concluded that i the domenico solution is an exact solution when longitudinal dispersivity is 0 ii for non zero longitudinal dispersivity the domenico solution introduces errors that increase with increasing longitudinal dispersivity and iii the errors in the domenico solution are larger beyond the advective front and smaller within the advective front aziz et al 2009 concluded that the domenico solution might be more appropriate for solving transport problems where plume concentrations are predicted at regions close to the source and at large simulation times these regions experience close to steady state conditions however aziz et al 2009 cautioned against the use of domenico solution for predicting plume concentrations in transient problems especially at regions far away from the source these observations of aziz et al 2009 are consistent with the findings of srinivasan et al 2007 since transient problems can have significant portions of the plume beyond the advective front where the domenico solution introduces significant errors based on these studies it can be concluded that the domenico solution provides reasonable results within the advective front and in advection dominated transport however for contaminant transport problems dominated by longitudinal dispersion and beyond the advective front the validity of the domenico solution is under question despite its errors and limitations the domenico solution remains popular among screening level models for groundwater contaminant transport due to its simplicity and a lack of a better closed form alternative solution the objective of this paper is to derive a new and improved closed form approximation to the 3d contaminant transport problem 2 governing equations and exact semi analytical solution the governing equation for the transport of a contaminant undergoing 1d advection 3d dispersion and first order decay is given as wexler 1992 1 c t v x c x v x α x 2 c x 2 v x α y 2 c y 2 v x α z 2 c z 2 kc where c is the solute concentration mgl 1 v x is the advection velocity in the x direction mday 1 α x is the longitudinal dispersivity in the x direction m and α y and α z are the transverse dispersivities in the y and z directions respectively m and k is the first order decay coefficient day 1 eq 1 is solved for a transport problem in a semi infinite domain subject to a rectangular patch source the initial and boundary conditions are given as wexler 1992 2 c x y z 0 0 0 x y z c 0 y z t c 0 t 0 x x 1 y 1 y y 2 z 1 z z 2 lim x c x y z t x 0 t 0 y z lim y c x y z t y 0 t 0 0 x z lim z c x y z t z 0 t 0 0 x y where c 0 is the concentration of the patch source mgl 1 and x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 and z 2 are the coordinates of source location in the x y and z directions respectively the exact analytical solution wexler solution for eq 1 subject to the initial and boundary conditions given by eq 2 is given as wexler 1992 3 c wex x y z t c 0 8 0 t f x x τ f y y τ f z z τ d τ where the f x f y and f z terms are given as in eq 4 4 f x x τ x x 1 π α x v x exp x x 1 2 α x exp v x τ 4 α x x x 1 2 4 α x v x τ k τ τ 3 2 f y y τ erf y y 1 2 α y v

plume concentrations making the wexler solution a non closed form semi analytical solution 3 characteristic residence time t the integral in eq 3 with only the f x term can be evaluated analytically as eq 5 5 0 t f x x τ d τ φ x x t where φ x x t is given as martin hayden and robbins 1997 6 φ x x t exp x x 1 2 α x 1 1 4 k α x v x erfc x x 1 v x t 1 4 k α x v x 2 α x v x t exp x x 1 2 α x 1 1 4 k α x v x erfc x x 1 v x t 1 4 k α x v x 2 α x v x t invoking an approximation that would make f y and f z terms in eq 3 independent of the variable of integration τ a closed form solution to the 3d reactive transport problem can be obtained this is accomplished by making the following substitution for τ in the f y and f z terms in eq 3 7 τ t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 the validity of this approximation depends on the choice of the t function t has the unit of time and represents the average or characteristic residence time of a contaminant particle at a given location x y z applying eqs 7 and 6 in eq 3 we get a closed form approximation to the wexler solution as 8 c app x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t f z z t where c app mgl 1 is the concentration from the t approximation when α x 0 the longitudinal transport of the contaminant is purely governed by advection while transverse dispersion transports the contaminants in directions orthogonal to the longitude they do not affect the characteristic residence time hence in the absence of longitudinal dispersion all particles at a given x location will have the same characteristic residence time t x x 1 v x irrespective of their y and z locations srinivasan et al 2007 in this case the maximum value of t will be t hence when α x 0 c app c wex if 9 t min x x 1 v x t when α x 0 the presence of longitudinal dispersion will cause a portion of the contaminant particles to be transported farther than the advective front dispersion increases the rate of longitudinal transport causing a reduction in the characteristic residence time at a given location hence when α x 0 t will be less than x x 1 v x along the plume centerline 3 1 domenico characteristic residence time approximation tdom domenico 1987 presented an approximation for t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 as 10 t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 t dom x x 1 v x applying eq 10 in eq 8 we get the approximate domenico solution as domenico 1987 11 c dom x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t dom f z z t dom where c dom is the concentration from the domenico approximation mgl 1 from eq 10 it is evident that the characteristic residence time approximation of the domenico solution eq 11 only considers the effect of transport due to advection and ignores longitudinal dispersive transport this is why the domenico solution is reasonable only under small α x values srinivasan et al 2007 furthermore beyond the advective front the domenico characteristic residence time approximation is incorrectly greater than the simulation time t this causes the errors in the domenico solution to be higher at regions beyond the advective front srinivasan et al 2007 a simple first order improvement to the domenico solution that would fix the second aspect would be to use eq 9 instead of eq 10 for the characteristic residence time 3 2 true characteristic time twex there exists a twex such that substituting t twex in eq 8 will make c app c wex using inverse numerical methods fminbnd matlab the math works inc 2021a the true t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 t wex that minimizes the error between c wex and c app was calculated this is expressed as 12 t wex minimize c wex c app t 2 substituting eq 12 in eq 8 we get as 13 13 c x y z t c wex x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t wex f z z t wex twex represents the actual characteristic average residence time of the contaminant at a given location computing twex from eq 12 and comparing it with tdom x v x reveals the origin of the errors in the domenico approximation for the example problem presented in domenico and robbins 1985 table 1 along the centerline the errors in the domenico approximation of tdom become unreasonable beyond the advective front where tdom is greater than the simulation time t fig 1 additionally with increasing α x values the errors in the tdom approximation increase note that tdom is independent of α x srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the domenico approximation results in significant errors when v x and t are small under both conditions a larger portion of the plume will be beyond the advective front resulting in higher errors comparison of twex with tdom along the centerline shows that beyond the advective front the domenico approximation performs poorly under small v x and small t fig 2 sensitivity simulations of tdom in other model parameters α y α z y 2 y 1 and z 2 z 1 show that the errors in the domenico approximation are relatively insensitive to these parameters fig s1 the sensitivity simulations performed so far show that along the plume centerline twex is sensitive only to α x v x x and t other model parameters α y α z y 2 y 1 and z 2 z 1 do not play a major role in determining twex the variation of twex with respect to x has three features figs 1 and 2 i initial linearly varying response with a slope equal to the inverse of velocity v x 1 ii final constant saturation response with a maximum y axis value of t iii transition between the initial and final responses at the region surrounding the advective front with sharper rapid transitions at lower α x values and smoother gradual transitions at higher α x 3 3 new and improved characteristic residence time timp while the simple correction to the domenico solution given by eq 9 addresses features i and ii it fails in feature iii because it can only model a sharp transition zone making it unsuitable for use under high α x values hence an empirical function that connects features i and ii with varying degrees of smoothness depending on the magnitude of the α x is required to model the behavior of twex several functions such as the logistic function monod kinetics function power law function polynomial function etc were employed to fit the behavior of twex while these functions were able to capture some features of i ii and iii they could not independently vary the three distinct features as their restrictive functional form commingled different features limiting their applicability table 2 however the ramberg osgood function presented an attractive alternative that addresses all three features with independent parameter control ramberg and osgood 1943 ramberg osgood function describes the non linear stress strain relationship of materials within and beyond their yield points and models the smooth transitions between the initial elastic linearly varying response and final plastic constant saturation response behavior using this the new and improved characteristic average residence time approximation is expressed as 14 t x t α x v x t imp x x 1 v x 1 x x 1 v x t n 1 n where the shape or curvature parameter n is given as 15 n v x t α x β where β is the exponent parameter and is empirically computed through model calibration exercise see section 5 2 calibration of empirical exponent parameter β β 0 25 gives the best fit characteristic residence times over the range of parameters and simulation domain values typically involved in groundwater transport scenarios see section 4 3 range of parameter and domain conditions the first term v x 1 in eq 14 represents the initial linear response feature i and the t term in the denominator within the square bracket is the constant saturation value of the asymptote feature ii the curvature parameter n represents feature iii and controls the transition between i and ii higher n results in sharper transitions and vice versa the specific formulation of n given by eq 15 captures the transport behavior of feature iii well since under advection dominated transport high v x low α x the transition between features i and ii will be sharp higher n while under dispersion dominated transport low v x high α x the transition will be smooth lower n applying eq 14 in eq 8 we get the new and improved approximate solution as eq 16 16 c imp x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t imp f z z t imp comparison of the estimates of twex with timp along the centerline for varying α x values shows that near the source timp starts with the initial slope v x 1 and then gradually transitions to a constant value equal to the simulation time t beyond the advective front fig 3 a the transitions are smoother under higher α x and sharper under lower α x demonstrating that the proposed improved solution for timp matches the wexler solution for varying longitudinal dispersivity values model sensitivity simulations to variation in advection velocity show that along the centerline the proposed improved solution timp captures the trends in the exact analytical solution twex well fig 3b as the velocity changes the initial slope of timp also changes with twex and this behavior is similar to tdom fig 2a however this region is within the advective front beyond the advective front timp asymptotically reaches the travel time t similar to twex with increasing v x the transitions between the initial linear response and final constant response become more gradual for timp this behavior closely matches with twex fig 3b timp also shows a similar variation with simulation time t mimicking the behavior of twex fig 3c these simulations show that along the plume centerline the improved solution accurately predicts the initial slope final constant saturation value of t and precisely identifies the location of the transition zone at the advective front additionally the smoothness of the transitions gradual to sharp is also effectively modeled by the improved solution timp based on the model parameters α x v x and simulation time t 4 model inter comparison the performance of the improved solution is tested by comparing the plume concentrations predicted by the improved approximation c imp with the exact wexler solution c wex for a variety of problems commonly encountered in groundwater contaminant transport scenarios 4 1 domenico example problem and sensitivity for the original domenico example problem domenico and robbins 1985 the performance of improved approximation with respect to concentration profiles shows that for a range of α x values the improved approximation c imp outperforms c dom and matches well with the wexler solution c wex fig 4 under advection dominated conditions i e low α x fig 4a the domenico approximation is reasonable and so is the improved approximation under the presence of longitudinal dispersion base case α x the domenico approximation introduces some errors whereas the improved solution performs very well fig 4b however under dispersion dominated conditions high α x the domenico approximation introduces significant errors and is unreasonable especially at regions beyond the advective front fig 4c here the improved approximation performs very well and closely matches the exact wexler solution at regions close to the source and away from the centerline the improved solution shows some errors however it performs similar to or better than the domenico solution in these regions the domenico solution marginally outperforms the new solution in a narrow region just behind the advective front and away from the centerline however the improved solution is better than the domenico approximation across a range of longitudinal dispersivity values and over the entire physical domain fig 4 model simulations performed for sensitivity in advection velocity parameter v x show that the improved solution outperforms the domenico solution across a range of advection velocities fig s2 the region where the domenico solution performs poorly is under dispersion dominated scenarios with low v x values especially beyond the advective front fig s2a in these regions the improved solution performs very well and closely matches the domenico solution similar behavior is observed when simulation time t is varied to further test the performance of the improved solution under sensitivity to other parameter conditions simulations were performed by varying source width y 2 y 1 and transverse dispersivity α y the results of these sensitivity analyses show that the improved solution performs well and closely matches the exact wexler solution over a range of critical parameter conditions where the domenico solution performs poorly fig 5 the simulations performed so far do not include the effect of contaminant decay frequently groundwater transport problems involve non conservative reactive contaminants that undergo first order decay eq 1 such as nitrification nuclear degradation chlorinated hydrocarbon attenuation etc sensitivity simulations that include the effect of decay rate k show that the improved solution performs better than the domenico solution under a range of k values over the entire domain fig s3 overall in the presence of contaminant decay there is only a marginal improvement in the performance of the improved solution this is because contaminant decay results in a larger portion of the plume behind the advective front where the original domenico solution produces reasonable results 4 2 other example problems the model inter comparison simulations performed so far only show sensitivity around a particular example problem table 1 to further test the performance of the improved solution model inter comparison studies are performed on four field scale example problems table 3 from literature martin hayden and robbins 1997 wexler 1992 karanovic et al 2007 west et al 2007 these simulation results show that the improved solution outperforms the domenico solution and closely matches the exact wexler solution fig 6 as expected the improved solution performs well pronounced beyond the advective front where the domenico solution introduces significant errors 4 3 range of parameter values and domain conditions to further test the performance of the improved solution over a range of parameter values encountered in groundwater modeling gelhar et al 1993 sensitivity simulations were performed over the entire range of parameter combinations table 4 and domain values 0 t 10 000 days 0 x x 1 10 000 m 0 y y 2 y 1 2 5000 m 0 z z 2 z 1 2 500 m a random sample uniform distribution of 16 000 unique parameter and domain simulations were selected for this simulation one to one comparison of the results of these 16 000 randomized simulations with the wexler solution shows that beyond the advective front the improved solution performs better than the domenico solution both in terms of residence times t fig 7 a and b and concentrations c fig 7c and d in regions beyond the advective front the improved solution is closer to the one to one line than the domenico solution fig 7c and d since beyond the advective front the domenico approximation is unreasonable tdom t the domenico solution overestimates the residence times fig 7a this causes a significant overestimation in the concentration values away from the plume centerline resulting in a compensatory underestimation near the centerline fig 7c in contrast both the domenico and improved solutions exhibit similar behavior for regions within the advective front fig 7a and b with respect to the concentration plots c imp outperforms c dom in a large portion of the domain however as mentioned before a small region exists behind the advective front and away from the plume centerline that the domenico solution performs marginally better than the improved solution overall for a range of parameter conditions and the entire simulation domain the improved solution significantly outperforms the domenico solution fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 validity of timp when α x 0 srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the domenico characteristic residence time results in an exact solution when α x 0 within the advective front through limiting analysis sec s1 we show that timp also reproduces the exact solution when α x 0 this is given as 17 lim α x 0 t imp x x 1 v x when x x 1 v x t t when x x 1 v x t under this limiting condition only features i and iii are active while feature ii is absent due to the abrupt transition it must be noted that eq 17 is identical to the first order simple correction given by eq 9 5 2 calibration of empirical exponent parameter β the shape parameter n in the expression for timp eq 14 determines the curvature of the transition between the initial linear slope v x 1 feature i and the final constant saturation value t feature iii n given by eq 15 involves an empirical exponent coefficient β 0 25 that is fitted through model calibration this coefficient is the only calibrated coefficient used in our improved solution sensitivity simulations that test the robustness of the improved solution regarding the choice of β show that the improved solution performs well over a range 0 2 0 3 of β values beyond the advective front figs s4 and s5 around a value of 0 25 there is a reasonable compensation between accurately predicting both high and low concentrations at lower β values the accuracy of lower concentrations is preferentially weighted and vice versa however any differences in the model performance are relatively minor in the range of parameter and domain combinations indicating the robustness of the proposed solution in capturing the trends in the characteristic average residence time t 5 3 limitations and future directions apart from being valid only within the range of parameter conditions and simulation domains see table 4 our proposed solution has some additional limitations while timp performs better than tdom in mimicking the behavior of twex fig 3 there are some differences between c imp and c wex especially at regions close to the source boundary and away from the centerline figs 4 and 5 this is because the timp formulation presented in this work only approximates the behavior of twex along the plume centerline fig 3 and accounts for variations only along the longitudinal x direction however twex also varies along the transverse y and z directions an aspect currently not accounted for in this study since the variation of twex is much less along the transverse directions than the longitudinal direction over large sections of the plume our timp formulation performs well in most plume locations however at regions close to the source and away from the centerline the transverse variation of twex is significant and the centerline based fit for timp is unable to capture these effects fig s6 hence we see a discrepancy between c imp and c wex at these locations figs 4 and 5 theoretically it is possible to improve the solution performance of c imp by including an additional transverse variation term in the timp formulation the challenge in adding a transverse correction for tin is to develop an empirical relationship that does not place additional restrictions on the validity of this solution regarding the operating range of parameters and simulation domains however even without accounting for the transverse dispersion effects our proposed improved solution strikes a good balance between solution accuracy over large sections of the plume and a wide operating range of parameters 6 conclusions this paper presents an improved empirical approximation to the domenico solution residence times timp is presented that is consistent with the physics of contaminant transport and is dimensionally correct eqs 14 and 15 our proposed improved solution is valid over a range of parameter conditions and simulation domain values typically encountered in groundwater transport scenarios table 4 the model inter comparison results presented in this paper how that the new and improved solution developed in this paper better approximates the contaminant characteristic average residence times timp than the domenico solution the improved characteristic average residence time approximation enables the improved solution to better match the exact analytical wexler solution particularly in regions beyond the advective front the improved solution accurately describes the behavior of twex in contrast the domenico solution incorrectly approximates t as being more than the simulation time t the proposed new and improved solution is computationally less demanding than the exact wexler semi analytical solution which requires numerical integration to compute final plume concentrations the improved solution only requires one fiftieth of the computing time to generate plume concentrations single core processor matlab the math works inc 2021a by simply modifying the approximation of tdom with timp in existing screening models such as bioscreen fate5

1372,the domenico solution is a widely used analytical solution in screening tools such as bioscreen fate5 biochlor art3d arcnlet quick domenico etc to simulate the three dimensional transport of reactive contaminants in groundwater while being approximate this solution presents a convenient closed form expression for computing plume contaminant concentrations without the need for numerical integration previous studies have mathematically shown that the domenico solution provides correct estimates of contaminant plume concentrations when the value of longitudinal dispersivity is zero however under non zero longitudinal dispersivity values the errors in the domenico solution increase especially at plume locations beyond the advective front the nature of these errors places severe limitations on the applicability of the domenico solution in simulating realistic contaminant transport problems here we present a new closed form solution for three dimensional 3d reactive contaminant transport that overcomes this limitation we introduce the concept of characteristic residence time which represents the average time taken by a contaminant particle to reach a given x y z location we show that along the plume centerline the characteristic residence time exhibits three features i initial linear response with a slope equal to the inverse of advection velocity ii final saturation response with a maximum value of simulation time iii transition between the initial and final responses at the region surrounding the advective front with sharper transitions at lower longitudinal dispersivities and smoother transitions at higher longitudinal dispersivities we calibrate the ramberg osgood function to fit the behavior of the characteristic residence time along the plume centerline and use this to develop a new and improved closed form approximation for the domenico solution without any additional computational effort our new and improved solution better approximates the solute concentrations of a three dimensional contaminant plume under realistic values of longitudinal dispersivity our improved solution closely matches the exact analytical solution especially at plume locations beyond the advective front where the domenico solution performs poorly existing screening tools can be readily be retrofitted with the new and improved solution to provide more accurate estimates for plume concentrations keywords domenico solution groundwater contaminant transport analytical solution screening tool characteristic residence time 1 introduction a frequently encountered problem in groundwater contamination is predicting the fate and transport of 3d contaminant plumes emanating from a constant rectangular patch source in a semi infinite domain undergoing 1d advection 3d dispersion linear equilibrium sorption and first order decay domenico 1987 the exact semi analytical solution to this equation for a conservative contaminant was provided by sagar 1982 later wexler 1992 presented a semi analytical solution wexler solution for a non conservative source undergoing first order decay wexler 1992 also presented solutions for reactive transport of point and line sources in semi infinite and finite domains the solutions derived by sagar 1982 and wexler 1992 are semi analytical semi analytical solutions require numerical integration to compute the final plume concentrations making these solutions computationally demanding and prone to numerical errors several authors have discussed the challenges of using semi analytical models wang et al 2011 burnell et al 2011 2012 a simple trapezoidal integration approach is insufficient to get accurate estimates of plume concentrations depending on the choice of parameters and the simulation location sophisticated adaptive mesh methods or higher order methods gauss quadrature are required to compute plume concentrations wang et al 2011 while higher level programming languages have readily available tools for adaptive integration most groundwater contaminant transport screening level models are embedded in a microsoft excel based gui platform newell et al 1996 aziz et al 2002 promma 2010 brown 2014 where advanced integration techniques are not readily available closed form solutions overcome this difficulty by eliminating the need for such a numerical integration step domenico 1987 presented an approximate closed form analytical solution domenico solution to the area patch source 3d reactive contaminant transport problem solved by wexler 1992 this solution was derived using the method described in domenico and robbins 1985 for a conservative source being a closed form solution the domenico solution is computationally advantageous compared to the semi analytical wexler solution since the computational demand of semi analytical solutions increases with larger simulation times and close to steady state conditions burnell et al 2011 the domenico solution offers an attractive alternative especially for long term monitoring and natural attenuation studies our analysis indicates that the domenico solution is 50 times more computationally efficient than the semi analytical wexler solution when solving 3d contaminant transport problems typically encountered in groundwater another key advantage of the closed form domenico solution is that it decouples the longitudinal advective dispersive transport from the transverse purely dispersive transport srinivasan et al 2007 west et al 2007 this decoupling enables the conversion of 1d multi species solutions into 3d solutions simply by multiplying 1d solutions with transverse dispersion terms aziz et al 2000 a feature that is attractive for use in coupled multi species transport problems due to its

solution has received considerable investigations on the nature of its error guyonnet and neville 2004 west and kueper 2004 srinivasan et al 2007 west et al 2007 aziz et al 2009 guyonnet and neville 2004 compared the domenico solution with the sagar solution for a conservative contaminant they concluded that for transport dominated by advection and mechanical dispersion the errors in the domenico solution are minor along the plume centerline however for transport dominated by molecular diffusion and first order decay reaction the domenico solution introduces significant errors especially for plume locations away from the centreline west and kueper 2004 compared the domenico solution with an exact analytical solution and concluded that the domenico solution introduces significant errors at large values of longitudinal dispersivity west et al 2007 showed that the errors in the domenico solution could vary between 2 to 80 depending on the parameter values srinivasan et al 2007 employed a rigorous mathematical analysis to characterize the nature of the error in the domenico approximation and compared the domenico solution with the wexler solution based on their mathematical derivations and model intercomparison simulations they concluded that i the domenico solution is an exact solution when longitudinal dispersivity is 0 ii for non zero longitudinal dispersivity the domenico solution introduces errors that increase with increasing longitudinal dispersivity and iii the errors in the domenico solution are larger beyond the advective front and smaller within the advective front aziz et al 2009 concluded that the domenico solution might be more appropriate for solving transport problems where plume concentrations are predicted at regions close to the source and at large simulation times these regions experience close to steady state conditions however aziz et al 2009 cautioned against the use of domenico solution for predicting plume concentrations in transient problems especially at regions far away from the source these observations of aziz et al 2009 are consistent with the findings of srinivasan et al 2007 since transient problems can have significant portions of the plume beyond the advective front where the domenico solution introduces significant errors based on these studies it can be concluded that the domenico solution provides reasonable results within the advective front and in advection dominated transport however for contaminant transport problems dominated by longitudinal dispersion and beyond the advective front the validity of the domenico solution is under question despite its errors and limitations the domenico solution remains popular among screening level models for groundwater contaminant transport due to its simplicity and a lack of a better closed form alternative solution the objective of this paper is to derive a new and improved closed form approximation to the 3d contaminant transport problem 2 governing equations and exact semi analytical solution the governing equation for the transport of a contaminant undergoing 1d advection 3d dispersion and first order decay is given as wexler 1992 1 c

as eq 5 5 0 t f x x τ d τ φ x x t where φ x x t is given as martin hayden and robbins 1997 6 φ x x t exp x x 1 2 α x 1 1 4 k α x v x erfc x x 1 v x t 1 4 k α x v x 2 α x v x t exp x x 1 2 α x 1 1 4 k α x v x erfc x x 1 v x t 1 4 k α x v x 2 α x v x t invoking an approximation that would make f y and f z terms in eq 3 independent of the variable of integration τ a closed form solution to the 3d reactive transport problem can be obtained this is accomplished by making the following substitution for τ in the f y and f z terms in eq 3 7 τ t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 the validity of this approximation depends on the choice of the t function t has the unit of time and represents the average or characteristic residence time of a contaminant particle at a given location

approximation when α x 0 the longitudinal transport of the contaminant is purely governed by advection while transverse dispersion transports the contaminants in directions orthogonal to the longitude they do not affect the characteristic residence time hence in the absence of longitudinal dispersion all particles at a given x location will have the same characteristic residence time t x x 1 v x irrespective of their y and z locations srinivasan et al 2007 in this case the maximum value of t will be t hence when α x 0 c app c wex if 9 t min x x 1 v x t when α x 0 the presence of longitudinal dispersion will cause a portion of the contaminant particles to be transported farther than the advective front dispersion increases the rate of longitudinal transport causing a reduction in the characteristic residence time at a given location hence when α x 0 t will be less than x x 1 v x along the plume centerline 3 1 domenico characteristic residence time approximation tdom domenico 1987 presented an approximation for t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 as 10 t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 t dom x x 1 v x applying eq 10 in eq 8 we get the approximate domenico solution as domenico 1987 11 c dom x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t dom f z z t dom where c dom is the concentration from the domenico approximation mgl 1 from eq 10 it is evident that the characteristic residence time approximation of the domenico solution eq 11 only considers the effect of transport due to advection and ignores longitudinal dispersive transport this is why the domenico solution is reasonable only under small α x values srinivasan et al 2007 furthermore beyond the advective front the domenico characteristic residence time approximation is incorrectly greater than the simulation time t this causes the errors in the domenico solution to be higher at regions beyond the advective front srinivasan et al 2007 a simple first order improvement to the domenico solution that would fix the second aspect would be to use eq 9 instead of eq 10 for the characteristic residence time 3 2 true characteristic time twex there exists a twex such that substituting t twex in eq 8 will make c app c wex using inverse numerical methods fminbnd matlab the math works inc 2021a the true t x y z t α x α y α z v x x 1 y 1 y 2 z 1 z 2 t wex that minimizes the error between c wex and c app was calculated this is expressed as 12 t wex minimize c wex c app t 2 substituting eq 12 in eq 8 we get as 13 13 c x y z t c wex x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t wex f z z t wex twex represents the actual characteristic average residence time of the contaminant at a given location computing twex from eq 12 and comparing it with tdom x v x reveals the origin of the errors in the domenico approximation for the example problem presented in domenico and robbins 1985 table 1 along the centerline the errors in the domenico approximation of tdom become unreasonable beyond the advective front where tdom is greater than the simulation time t fig 1 additionally with increasing α x values the errors in the tdom approximation increase note that tdom is independent of α x srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the domenico approximation results in significant errors when v x and t are small under both conditions a larger portion of the plume will be beyond the advective front resulting in higher errors comparison of twex with tdom along the centerline shows that beyond the advective front the domenico approximation performs poorly under small v x and small t fig 2 sensitivity simulations of tdom in other model parameters α y α z y 2 y 1 and z 2 z 1 show that the errors in the domenico approximation are relatively insensitive to these parameters fig s1 the sensitivity simulations performed so far show that along the plume centerline twex is sensitive only to α x v x x and t other model parameters α y α z y 2 y 1 and z 2 z 1 do not play a major role in determining twex the variation of twex with respect to x has three features figs 1 and 2 i initial linearly varying response with a slope equal to the inverse of velocity v x 1 ii final constant saturation response with a maximum y axis value of t iii transition between the initial and final responses at the region surrounding the advective front with sharper rapid transitions at lower α x values and smoother gradual transitions at higher α x 3 3 new and improved characteristic residence time timp while the simple correction to the domenico solution given by eq 9 addresses features i and ii it fails in feature iii because it can only model a sharp transition zone making it unsuitable for use under high α x values hence an empirical function that connects features i and ii with varying degrees of smoothness depending on the magnitude of the α x is required to model the behavior of twex several functions such as the logistic function monod kinetics function power law function polynomial function etc were employed to fit the behavior of twex while these functions were able to capture some features of i ii and iii they could not independently vary the three distinct features as their restrictive functional form commingled different features limiting their applicability table 2 however the ramberg osgood function presented an attractive alternative that addresses all three features with independent parameter control ramberg and osgood 1943 ramberg osgood function describes the non linear stress strain relationship of materials within and beyond their yield points and models the smooth transitions between the initial elastic linearly varying response and final plastic constant saturation response behavior using this the new and improved characteristic average residence time approximation is expressed as 14 t x t α x v x t imp x x 1 v x 1 x x 1 v x t n 1 n where the shape or curvature parameter n is given as 15 n v x t α x β where β is the exponent parameter and is empirically computed through model calibration exercise see section 5 2 calibration of empirical exponent parameter β β 0 25 gives the best fit characteristic residence times over the range of parameters and simulation domain values typically involved in groundwater transport scenarios see section 4 3 range of parameter and domain conditions the first term v x 1 in eq 14 represents the initial linear response feature i and the t term in the denominator within the square bracket is the constant saturation value of the asymptote feature ii the curvature parameter n represents feature iii and controls the transition between i and ii higher n results in sharper transitions and vice versa the specific formulation of n given by eq 15 captures the transport behavior of feature iii well since under advection dominated transport high v x low α x the transition between features i and ii will be sharp higher n while under dispersion dominated transport low v x high α x the transition will be smooth lower n applying eq 14 in eq 8 we get the new and improved approximate solution as eq 16 16 c imp x y z t c 0 8 φ x x t f y y t imp f z z t imp comparison of the estimates of twex with timp along the centerline for varying α x values shows that near the source timp starts with the initial slope v x 1 and then gradually transitions to a constant value equal to the simulation time t beyond the advective front fig 3 a the transitions are smoother under higher α x and sharper under lower α x demonstrating that the proposed improved solution for timp matches the wexler solution for varying longitudinal dispersivity values model sensitivity simulations to variation in advection velocity show that along the centerline the proposed improved solution timp captures the trends in the exact analytical solution twex well fig 3b as the velocity changes the initial slope of timp also changes with twex and this behavior is similar to tdom fig 2a however this region is within the advective front beyond the advective front timp asymptotically reaches the travel time t similar to twex with increasing v x the transitions between the initial linear response and final constant response become more gradual for timp this behavior closely matches with twex fig 3b timp also shows a similar variation with simulation time t mimicking the behavior of twex fig 3c these simulations show that along the plume centerline the improved solution accurately predicts the initial slope final constant saturation value of t and precisely identifies the location of the transition zone at the advective front additionally the smoothness of the transitions gradual to sharp is also effectively modeled by the improved solution timp based on the model parameters α x v x and simulation time t 4 model inter comparison the performance of the improved solution is tested by comparing the plume concentrations predicted by the improved approximation c imp with the exact wexler solution c wex for a variety of problems commonly encountered in groundwater contaminant transport scenarios 4 1 domenico example problem and sensitivity for the original domenico example problem domenico and robbins 1985 the performance of improved approximation with respect to concentration profiles shows that for a range of α x values the improved approximation c imp outperforms c dom and matches well with the wexler solution c wex fig 4 under advection dominated conditions i e low α x fig 4a the domenico approximation is reasonable and so is the improved approximation under the presence of longitudinal dispersion base case α x the domenico approximation introduces some errors whereas the improved solution performs very well fig 4b however under dispersion dominated conditions high α x the domenico approximation introduces significant errors and is unreasonable especially at regions beyond the advective front fig 4c here the improved approximation performs very well and closely matches the exact wexler solution at regions close to the source and away from the centerline the improved solution shows some errors however it performs similar to or better than the domenico solution in these regions the domenico solution marginally outperforms the new solution in a narrow region just behind the advective front and away from the centerline however the improved solution is better than the domenico approximation across a range of longitudinal dispersivity values and over the entire physical domain fig 4 model simulations performed for sensitivity in advection velocity parameter v x show that the improved solution outperforms the domenico solution across a range of advection velocities fig s2 the region where the domenico solution performs poorly is under dispersion dominated scenarios with low v x values especially beyond the advective front fig s2a in these regions the improved solution performs very well and closely matches the domenico solution similar behavior is observed when simulation time t is varied to further test the performance of the improved solution under sensitivity to other parameter conditions simulations were performed by varying source width y 2 y 1 and transverse dispersivity α y the results of these sensitivity analyses show that the improved solution performs well and closely matches the exact wexler solution over a range of critical parameter conditions where the domenico solution performs poorly fig 5 the simulations performed so far do not include the effect of contaminant decay frequently groundwater transport problems involve non conservative reactive contaminants that undergo first order decay eq 1 such as nitrification nuclear degradation chlorinated hydrocarbon attenuation etc sensitivity simulations that include the effect of decay rate k show that the improved solution performs better than the domenico solution under a range of k values over the entire domain fig s3 overall in the presence of contaminant decay there is only a marginal improvement in the performance of the improved solution this is because contaminant decay results in a larger portion of the plume behind the advective front where the original domenico solution produces reasonable results 4 2 other example problems the model inter comparison simulations performed so far only show sensitivity around a particular example problem table 1 to further test the performance of the improved solution model inter comparison studies are performed on four field scale example problems table 3 from literature martin hayden and robbins 1997 wexler 1992 karanovic et al 2007 west et al 2007 these simulation results show that the improved solution outperforms the domenico solution and closely matches the exact wexler solution fig 6 as expected the improved solution performs well pronounced beyond the advective front where the domenico solution introduces significant errors 4 3 range of parameter values and domain conditions to further test the performance of the improved solution over a range of parameter values encountered in groundwater modeling gelhar et al 1993 sensitivity simulations were performed over the entire range of parameter combinations table 4 and domain values 0 t 10 000 days 0 x x 1 10 000 m 0 y y 2 y 1 2 5000 m 0 z z 2 z 1 2 500 m a random sample uniform distribution of 16 000 unique parameter and domain simulations were selected for this simulation one to one comparison of the results of these 16 000 randomized simulations with the wexler solution shows that beyond the advective front the improved solution performs better than the domenico solution both in terms of residence times t fig 7 a and b and concentrations c fig 7c and d in regions beyond the advective front the improved solution is closer to the one to one line than the domenico solution fig 7c and d since beyond the advective front the domenico approximation is unreasonable tdom t the domenico solution overestimates the residence times fig 7a this causes a significant overestimation in the concentration values away from the plume centerline resulting in a compensatory underestimation near the centerline fig 7c in contrast both the domenico and improved solutions exhibit similar behavior for regions within the advective front fig 7a and b with respect to the concentration plots c imp outperforms c dom in a large portion of the domain however as mentioned before a small region exists behind the advective front and away from the plume centerline that the domenico solution performs marginally better than the improved solution overall for a range of parameter conditions and the entire simulation domain the improved solution significantly outperforms the domenico solution fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 validity of timp when α x 0 srinivasan et al 2007 showed that the domenico characteristic residence time results in an exact solution when α x 0 within the advective front through limiting analysis sec s1 we show that timp also reproduces the exact solution when α x 0 this is given as 17 lim α x 0 t imp x x 1 v x when x x 1 v x t t when x x 1 v x t under this limiting condition only features i and iii are active while feature ii is absent due to the abrupt transition it must be noted that eq 17 is identical to the first order simple correction given by eq 9 5 2 calibration of empirical exponent parameter β the shape parameter n in the expression for timp eq 14 determines the curvature of the transition between the initial linear slope v x 1 feature i and the final constant saturation value t feature iii n given by eq 15 involves an empirical exponent coefficient β 0 25 that is fitted through model calibration this coefficient is the only calibrated coefficient used in our improved solution sensitivity simulations that test the robustness of the improved solution regarding the choice of β show that the improved solution performs well over a range 0 2 0 3 of β values beyond the advective front figs s4 and s5 around a value of 0 25 there is a reasonable compensation between accurately predicting both high and low concentrations at lower β values the accuracy of lower concentrations is preferentially weighted and vice versa however any differences in the model performance are relatively minor in the range of parameter and domain combinations indicating the robustness of the proposed solution in capturing the trends in the characteristic average residence time t 5 3 limitations and future directions apart from being valid only within the range of parameter conditions and simulation domains see table 4 our proposed solution has some additional limitations while timp performs better than tdom in mimicking the behavior of twex fig 3 there are some differences between c imp and c wex especially at regions close to the source boundary and away from the centerline figs 4 and 5 this is because the timp formulation presented in this work only approximates the behavior of twex along the plume centerline fig 3 and accounts for variations only along the longitudinal x direction however twex also varies along the transverse y and z directions an aspect currently not accounted for in this study since the variation of twex is much less along the transverse directions than the longitudinal direction over large sections of the plume our timp formulation performs well in most plume locations however at regions close to the source and away from the centerline the transverse variation of twex is significant and the centerline based fit for timp is unable to capture these effects fig s6 hence we see a discrepancy between c imp and c wex at these locations figs 4 and 5 theoretically it is possible to improve the solution performance of c imp by including an additional transverse variation term in the timp formulation the challenge in adding a transverse correction for tin is to develop an empirical relationship that does not place additional restrictions on the validity of this solution regarding the operating range of parameters and simulation domains however even without accounting for the transverse dispersion effects our proposed improved solution strikes a good balance between solution accuracy over large sections of the plume and a wide operating range of parameters 6 conclusions this paper presents an improved empirical approximation to the domenico solution residence times timp is presented that is consistent with the physics of contaminant transport and is dimensionally correct eqs 14 and 15 our proposed improved solution is valid over a range of parameter conditions and simulation domain values typically encountered in groundwater transport scenarios table 4 the model inter comparison results presented in this paper how that the new and improved solution developed in this paper better approximates the contaminant characteristic average residence times timp than the domenico solution the improved characteristic average residence time approximation enables the improved solution to better match the exact analytical wexler solution particularly in regions beyond the advective front the improved solution accurately describes the behavior of twex in contrast the domenico solution incorrectly approximates t as being more than the simulation time t the proposed new and improved solution is computationally less demanding than the exact wexler semi analytical solution which requires numerical integration to compute final plume concentrations the improved solution only requires one fiftieth of the computing time to generate plume concentrations single core processor matlab the math works inc 2021a by simply modifying the approximation of tdom with timp in existing screening models such as bioscreen fate5

1373,the presence of fractures in bedrock allows for rapid aqueous contaminant transport through complex pathways and for diffusion of solutes between the fractures and the matrix to better understand transport in these settings tracer experiments are a commonly used tool the need for expensive multi level wells to obtain depth specific concentrations however significantly limits the cost efficiency the primary objective of this study is to develop a method whereby a discrete fracture network approach can be used to simulate the results of a divergent tracer experiment conducted using open observation boreholes in a well characterized dolostone over distances of 55 m to 242 m the experiment was conducted using a fluorescent tracer which allowed for continuous concentration measurement with depth in each open observation well two numerical models were employed in the interpretation of the experiment the first was a 1 d finite difference model focused on flow and transport in the observation wells and the second was a 3 d control volume finite element model capable of simulating the entire fracture network through fitting the experimental data to simulations the most important fractures for transport in the system were identified the number of fractures that participated in transport was few relative to the number of fractures observed in core and in constant head test results heterogeneous distribution of the fracture apertures was determined to be the likely cause of the highly tortuous transport observed at the site this study demonstrates that tracer experiments conducted using open observation boreholes and a downhole fluorometer can improve our understanding of large scale transport in fractured rock especially when analysed with multiple models and compared to other measured properties such as matrix porosity hydraulic aperture and fracture orientation keywords discrete fracture networks tracer experiment aqueous solute transport numerical modelling open wells 1 introduction fractures in bedrock create preferential pathways for groundwater flow and allow for the rapid movement of groundwater and aqueous contaminants over large distances these pathways can be exceptionally tortuous and heterogeneous due to morphology arising from mode of formation and geological history bear et al 1993 neuman 2005 tsang and neretnieks 1998 as an example novakowski and lapcevic 1994 found that the hydraulic aperture of a single horizontal fracture feature varied significantly 200 μm over distances of less than 5 m in an ordovician shale in carbonate rock other authors have found ranges in fracture aperture from lower hydraulic testing limits which are 30 40 μm to dissolution features which may exceed one m medici et al 2019 medici et al 2021 quinn et al 2011a quinn et al 2011b ren et al 2018 during transport diffusion of aqueous contaminants from fractures into the rock matrix further adds to the complexity by establishing a long term low concentration source in the matrix that is difficult to remove carrera et al 1998 feenstra et al 1984 jardine et al 1999 mutch et al 1993 west and kueper 2010 the result of these issues provides difficulty in the prediction of solute transport in fracture networks that can present a significant problem for the protection of drinking water tracer experiments can be powerful tools for interpreting and understanding flow and transport in many groundwater settings berkowitz 2002 national research council 1996 nasem 2015 numerous tracer experiments have been conducted in fractured rock using a variety of configurations which have greatly advanced our understanding of the governing transport processes e g abelin et al 1991 cvetkovic et al 2010 d alessandro et al 1997 maloszewski et al 1999 mckay et al 1993 novakowski et al 2004 paillet et al 2012 reimus et al 2003 webster et al 1970 many of these studies have been conducted at transport distances of less than 50 m which is far less than what is typically relevant at a contaminated site experiments in larger networks are needed to better understand the importance of fracture interconnections despite this far fewer tracer experiments have been conducted at larger distances primarily due to the cost and complexity of undertaking these investigations for example in a review by zhou et al 2007 just six of the approximately 40 experiments examined involved transport scales at or above 50 m one of the difficulties that remains with understanding large scale transport through fractured rock is the potential for non uniqueness in the interpretation of experiments conceptual model non uniqueness has been well recognized at all scales becker and shapiro 2003 berkowitz et al 2006 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 johnston et al 2009 sánchez vila and carrera 2004 several studies in which non uniqueness has been encountered have suggested scaling of parameters such as aperture or matrix porosity with distance to fit the data guihéneuf et al 2017 lapcevic et al 1999 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 however the use of scaling parameters does not provide substantial information regarding the nature of the heterogeneity at a site and can be difficult from which to make predictions to accurately predict transport in fractured rock at a site with non uniqueness issues multiple transport experiments are often needed and even then success in determining a unique conceptual model is not common because of the cost and difficulty associated with most tracer experiments national research council 1996 nasem 2015 numerous tests are simply not possible at many sites thus limiting the information available for accurate conceptual model development in addition to the need for multiple experiments large scale transport studies typically use multi level wells with numerous measurement zones in favour of the much more common open well which further adds to the expense and difficulty lasagna and de luca 2016 lerner and teutsch 1995 poulsen et al 2019 open boreholes cannot be used to collect samples from individual fracture features and typically provide only averaged samples for all fractures intersecting the borehole forcing the use of an equivalent porous media epm approach blessent et al 2013 harte 2013 medici et al 2019 medici et al 2021 molson et al 2012 national research council 1996 pankow et al 1985 conversely multi level wells can provide depth discrete concentrations although these too are subject to concentration averaging where fracture spacing is small shapiro 2001 note that due to both the highly heterogeneous natures of concentration profiles in fractured rock and the evidence that only a small proportion of observed fractures may control solute transport at many sites chilès and de marsily 1993 hitchmough et al 2007 quinn et al 2011a zanini et al 2000 the complexity of transport pathways is not easily captured with either open wells or multi level piezometers thus it would be advantageous if a tracer experiment could be conducted using open boreholes as this is the least expensive option in such a way as to obtain discrete fracture properties and information regarding in fracture concentrations which in turn would enable analysis of large scale transport based on a discrete fracture network dfn approach to modelling blessent et al 2011 chapman et al 2013 hyman et al 2015 molson et al 2012 pierce et al 2018 downhole fluorometers have been shown to provide depth discrete concentrations in tracer experiments flynn et al 2004 levison and novakowski 2012 petrella et al 2008 however very few studies have been conducted using this method at transport distances exceeding 20 m further experiments involving downhole fluorometers have been mostly limited to hydrogeological settings in unconsolidated media although very local scale 10 m transport studies have been conducted in epikarst petrella et al 2008 and crystalline rock levison and novakowski 2012 this method has had no known use in fractured rock at larger scales a notable drawback occurs because of mixing processes in the open well which can dilute concentrations and may obscure the individual fractures through which most of the solute is transported thus further investigation to determine the usefulness of this method for accurately estimating transport in fractured bedrock at the network scale is required the primary objectives of this study are to develop a methodology to successfully simulate experiments conducted in sparse fracture networks using open boreholes and downhole tracer concentration measurement and to explore the processes of solute transport in a fracture network in particular this study will focus on i the development of a conceptual model for a dfn that can reproduce the measured concentrations and ii on determining the important tracer carrying fractures over a transport distance of approximately 250 m an additional objective is to identify issues of non uniqueness that can arise in interpreting tracer experiments conducted in this fashion these objectives will be resolved through the application of the method using an experiment conducted in a divergent flow system in a silurian dolostone located in southern ontario this site has been the focus of extensive investigations over several decades although transport at the site is not yet fully understood e g gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 golder associates limited 1995 mclaren et al 2012 novakowski et al 1999 the tracer experiment was conducted in a previous study moore 2008 and the focus of this paper will be to apply a discrete fracture based numerical model to interpret the results within the context of the objectives described above 2 methodology 2 1 modelling approach the focus of this paper is the analysis of a tracer experiment that was conducted by injecting a fluorescent dye tracer into an open 10 4 m section of borehole 72 in fig 1 and then observing breakthrough in six down gradient wells 56 58 59 70 71 and 73 located at distances between 55 m and 242 m from the injection point to simulate the results of the tracer experiment two distinct numerical models were used the first of these is a finite difference model for flow and transport through a 1 d feature representing the open wells with terms to provide net fluxes through the well the governing equations and solution method are described in section 2 4 below the flux terms represent inflow or outflow from fractures in this model no consideration of the governing processes outside the observation well was taken as the focus was solely on the analyses of the net fluxes required to achieve a fit to observed concentrations a second model was therefore needed with an expanded domain to include the fracture network and surrounding porous medium for this a control volume finite element cvfe model therrien and sudicky 1996 was employed using physical properties e g matrix porosity fracture aperture based on those measured in the field a detailed description of the tracer experiment and the application of both models is described in the following 2 2 study site characterization this study was conducted at a site to north of the town of smithville ontario canada fig 1 in the early 1980s pcb waste from nearby municipalities was stored at the site golder associates limited 1995 after the detection of tce and pcbs in the subsurface significant efforts to characterize the hydrogeology of the site have been undertaken including the completion of more than 1400 constant head tests numerous pumping and pulse interference tests several local scale tracer experiments 50 m transport distance and multiple large scale tracer experiments 50 m transport distance such as the one of interest to this research the constant head tests pumping tests and pulse interference tests are described in novakowski et al 1999 the local scale tracer experiments are described in novakowski et al 2004 the near surface geology at the smithville site is composed of approximately 10 m of overburden till underlain by the lockport dolostone this is a silurian aged dolostone which can be further subdivided into four units including the gasport goat island vinemount and eramosa the uppermost of these is the eramosa which is the focus of this study and is approximately 15 m in thickness the unit dips slightly to the south east and is characterized by vuggy features laminations and a dark grey colour golder associates limited 1995 novakowski and lapcevic 1988 both horizontal bedding plane fractures and vertical fractures with five sets of orientations have been identified in the eramosa novakowski et al 1999 the bedding plane fractures follow the dip and can be traced using marker beds over lateral distances greater than 250 m the mean spacing for these fractures is 0 38 m the vertical fractures group in orientation at 0 65 and 105 for the three most dominant sets and at 42 and 147 for two minor sets the mean spacing for the vertical fractures is 0 77 m although additional discussion of this is provided below the study area has also been identified to lie in a region that has experienced karstification particularly in the eramosa unit brunton and dodge 2008 gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 although there is some evidence of karst features where the till thickness diminishes to less than one m to the north of the site and in 20 mile creek to the south the is little to no evidence of dissolution features in the drilling results or rock core previous numerical simulations of the study site mclaren et al 2012 have been conducted assuming no influence of karstification constant head tests zeigler 1976 conducted in eight wells fig 1 in the vicinity of the tracer experiment using 0 1 m and 0 5 m packer spacings were interpreted to determine the distribution of hydraulic conductivity and the location of permeable fractures in the eramosa boreholes 70 73 were drilled vertically and the remaining boreholes were inclined with plunges of 55 degrees the drilling was conducted using triple tube diamond coring methods the diameter of all the wells was 96 mm h sized the wells all fully penetrated the eramosa and ranged in length from approximately 23 m to 59 m the 51 tests conducted at 0 1 m packer spacing in borehole 64 indicate that the background unfractured hydraulic conductivity of the eramosa ranges from approximately 10 9 to 10 6 m s the tests conducted at 0 5 m lengths which were completed in each well across the entire span of the eramosa provided evidence that groundwater flow is dominated by a small number of highly conductive bedding plane fractures zanini et al 2000 in particular five primary horizontal fractures were identified in many of the wells with significantly higher hydraulic conductivities 500 μm hydraulic aperture than the background hydraulic apertures were determined using the measured transmissivity obtained from constant head tests with the cubic law snow 1965 using the assumption that a single fracture dominated each test section core logs were used to corroborate the positions of the fractures identified by constant head tests and to assist in distinguishing horizontal and vertical fractures note that numerous other horizontal fractures 15 in each well were observed in the core log for the eramosa but showed no evidence of conducting significantly more flow than the matrix the identified horizontal fractures are believed to be correlated horizontally across hundreds of meters at the site novakowski et al 1999 zanini et al 2000 as illustrated in fig 2 this is both because of the observation of high transmissivity horizontal features affiliated with marker beds at approximately the same heights across each well and due to the low regional gradient measured of 0 0001 to the south east novakowski et al 2006 the appearance of the tracer at distances of over 100 m in both this experiment and other experiments at the site also support this hypothesis moore 2008 an additional conceptual model in cross section adapted from moore 2008 is included in the supplementary data table 1 provides the relevant statistics for the fractures identified in fig 2 the mean geometric value was not considered particularly meaningful here due to the small number of measurements for each fracture and the high variability in the values observed combined with statistics from other boreholes nearby novakowski et al 1999 however it was useful as a guide for approximate apertures used in the tracer experiment models the lowest of these horizontal features was located at approximately 173 masl and this fracture was observed in each well fig 2 table 1 the geometric mean of the measured hydraulic apertures between all of the boreholes for this feature is 1261 μm fig 2 a feature between 175 and 178 masl geometric mean aperture 464 μm and one at the top of the eramosa unit were also identified in each well the top of the eramosa unit was located at 182 184 masl with an elevation of 184 m in the closer wells 55 59 and 182 m at distant observation points 64 37c the geometric mean hydraulic aperture of the uppermost fracture was 903 μm two other high transmissivity features were observed in most of the observation wells but notably there was no corresponding high transmissivity zone in the injection well fig 2 a feature was identified in all but the injection well consistently at an elevation of approximately 179 180 masl with a geometric mean hydraulic aperture of 792 μm the other was located between this fracture and that at the top of the eramosa 182 masl but was only observed in the 55 59 cluster of wells possibly due to an intersection with the top of the unit in more distant wells finally while not listed in the table note that another smaller feature was observed at the bottom of four of the observation wells 37c 55 57 and 58 the geometric mean of the apertures was 320 μm with a range of 223 to 409 μm the identified vertical fractures had an average spacing determined from the core to be 0 77 m novakowski et al 1999 borehole inclination was considered when calculating spacings constant head tests at 0 5 m spacing indicated that many of the vertical fractures have transmissivities in the range of 10 9 10 6 m2 s which corresponds to apertures of approximately 12 120 μm however there were several larger features corresponding to hydraulic apertures between 250 and 690 μm while vertical fracture lengths heights could not be measured via boreholes at the smithville site they were taken at a nearby quarry gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 most fractures were less than one m in length but fractures with a greater length were observed at spacing ranging from less than 1 0 m to 20 m the fractures range in height from approximately 1 0 m to 7 0 m the ability of these fractures to provide vertical connections between horizontal fractures at the site is not fully understood based on the characterization conducted by novakowski et al 1999 from hydraulic head measurements in four multi level piezometers at the test site there is little indication of vertical flow or recharge in the eramosa unit this can be observed in the hydraulic head measured in multi levels 11 12 21 and 53 with plots and a location map obtained from novakowski et al 1999 and shown in supplementary data as diffusion between the matrix and fractures is potentially significant in a carbonate rock measurements of matrix porosity were conducted gravimetric methods were used to measure the porosity novakowski et al 1999 this involved comparing the weights of wet samples and then oven dried samples of 5 20 mm discs collected from core the range of the 342 measurements was 1 to 20 porosity the interquartile range however was 5 to 7 5 providing a practical range on the porosity that was used for the modelling 2 3 tracer experiment the tracer experiment was conducted by first isolating the eramosa in the injection well bh72 using a packer at the top of the unit fig 2 moore 2008 the bottom of the well did not cross the lower boundary of the eramosa the resulting isolated section was approximately 10 4 m in length in the six observation wells used in the experiment fig 1 packers were placed at the bottom of the unit the top was left open resulting in an observation region 14 15 m in length uniform injection of the tracer over the length of the open section was achieved using a perforated standpipe with preferentially larger openings closer to the bottom steady flow conditions were first established with a flow rate of 92 2 l min once this was achieved lissamine ff dye tracer was injected at a concentration of 150 mg l for 19 min after which the source was switched back to fresh water at the same flow rate for the remaining duration of the experiment the lissamine dye was chosen because of its resistance to retardation novakowski et al 2004 smart and laidlaw 1977 in most rock with exceptions for where organic matter is ubiquitous such as peat lissamine ff has losses of less than 10 due to retardation smart and laidlaw 1977 concentration profiles were measured in the observation wells using downhole fluorometers a submersible fluorometer turner designs cyclops 7 with a detection limit of 0 001 mg l coupled with a pressure transducer was used before tracer arrival background fluorescence was measured and was found to be 0 015 mg l or less at each measurement event the fluorometer was lowered down the borehole at a rate of 2 3 m min and then brought back up at a similar rate continuous measurements were taken during this time with readings every second recorded with a campbell scientific cr10 x data logger the concentration measurements were linked to water depth using a continuously recording pressure transducer attached to the fluorometer due to the length of the experiment relative to the duration of the measurement of each profile it was considered unlikely that the concentrations changed significantly in the time it took to lower and raise the fluorometer measurements were initially obtained at half hour intervals which later became less frequent as the experiment neared conclusion the total duration of the experiment was 72 h with two additional measurements taken several days later for more detail regarding the tracer experiment the reader is directed to moore 2008 2 4 finite difference well model development as the observation wells were open hydraulic communication between fractures intersecting the wells at different depths was possible thus to analyze the tracer experiment a 1 d implicit finite difference model for flow and transport in an observation well was developed to accommodate this process in the model flow is treated as uniformly steady whereas transport is transient in the experiment steady flow conditions were reached before injection of the dye tracer so this assumption was deemed reasonable the governing equations used are given in 1 and 2 where 1 represents the equation for flow in an open well and 2 represents solute transport in the well adapted from lacombe et al 1995 1 π r s 2 k w 2 h l 2 q n 0 2 π r s 2 c w t d w 2 c w l 2 q w c w l γ n 0 3 k w r s 2 ρg 8 μ 4 d w d 0 r s 2 q w 2 48 d 0 these equations are similar to that for flow and transport in a porous media with an additional term representing flux perpendicular to the well at each node this term allows for the representation of fractures intersecting the well as flux values where in 1 r s represents the well radius q n is the nodal darcy flux normal to the well l is the position along the well h is the hydraulic head and k w is the hydraulic conductivity of the well which is defined in 3 fluid density the gravitational acceleration constant and fluid viscosity are represented by ρ g and μ respectively in 2 q w represents the water velocity along the well q w k w h l c w is the concentration in the well and γ n is the nodal solute flux normal to the well integrated over the circumference at elevation l the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d w is defined in 4 where d 0 is the free water diffusion coefficient a central difference approach was used for the spatial terms whereas a forward difference approach was used for time the model domain was 15 m long as illustrated in fig 3 with the base at 170 masl in the context of the field setting a single node at 173 5 masl was selected as a constant head and concentration boundary this node was chosen at the height of the highest hydraulic aperture fracture which could be correlated between the injection and observation wells elements of 0 1 m length were used with time steps of 20 s to test the suitability of the discretization an analytical solution ogata and banks 1961 to eq 2 was compared to the finite difference solution with the flux terms in 2 set to zero using a q w varied between 10 5 and 10 3 m s no difference between the numerical model and the analytical solution was observed visually indicating that the discretization was acceptable fining of the discretization beyond these values made no discernible difference to the solution a well radius of 0 05 m consistent with the field value was used a value of 5 6 10 10 m2 s was used for the free water diffusion coefficient and a value of 0 1 used for matrix tortuosity this is consistent with novakowski et al 2004 for the same tracer used in the present field study finally the fluid density gravitational acceleration constant and dynamic fluid viscosity were set as 1000 kg m3 9 81 m2 s and 1 124 10 3 kg m s respectively the top and bottom boundaries of the model were set as no flow for fluid migration and no flux for solute transport the choice of the position of the constant head boundary was varied by choosing other points as dirichlet boundary conditions to determine if this influenced the conclusions drawn from this analysis this will be further discussed in the results section once the model development was complete flow and transport were simulated in each well separately with different values of nodal flux terms to achieve fits to the shape of the concentration profile through observing which nodes required external fluxes to fit the model to the experimental profile the purpose was to identify solute carrying fractures intersecting the borehole and develop one or more depictions of flow and transport in the observation well 2 5 expanded domain with control volume finite element model to support the conclusions of the finite difference model and to simulate the entire experimental domain a 3 d control volume finite element model was used therrien and sudicky 1996 this model is capable of simulating groundwater flow and solute transport through discrete fractures coupled to a porous matrix brunner and simmons 2012 a 700 700 17 m domain was first generated the lateral domain size was selected by increasing the limits in x and y until the transport solution at specific snapshots in time no longer varied significantly 5 change in concentrations between domain sizes at the observation wells the injection well bh72 was placed at the center of the domain and the observation wells at appropriate positions relative to this the observation wells were fully penetrating whereas the injection well was an isolated 10 4 m section 172 183 m height in the model with impermeable material above and below the injection well was assigned a constant pumping rate of 92 l min observation wells are represented as 1 d line features in the domain as described in lacombe et al 1995 which allowed for mixing in the wells due to computational restraints these were placed vertically rather than at an incline initially four fully continuous fractures between the injection and observation wells were placed at elevations of 173 177 5 179 5 and 182 masl which was supported by the constant head test results the fracture elevations and the horizontal extents were later varied to explore fits to the measured data the discretization of the domain was centered on the fractures with elements of 1 mm vertical height and 10 mm horizontal length in the immediate vicinity this then coarsened outwards to 1 1 0 5 m blocks outside of the region with observation wells this was further coarsened to 100 100 0 5 m elements fig 4 shows an illustration of the model grid in the plane of the fracture the element sizes were chosen by shrinking the elements until the transport solution no longer varied with changes to the discretization the discretization was corroborated through comparison of the numerical model to an analytical solution developed by chen 1985 as the analytical solution is for just one fracture does not account for a regional gradient and uses a constant concentration source the numerical model was adapted for this but retained the grid structure and discretization the comparison showed no visibly discernable difference in breakthrough curves between the final numerical discretization and the analytical model at several locations in the domain appendix a two of the horizontal boundaries of the domain were assigned a constant head providing a regional gradient of 0 0001 across the domain for the duration of the simulation this is consistent with what was measured at the site zanini et al 2000 the other four boundaries were assigned as no flow other relevant properties to the simulation such as matrix porosity and matrix hydraulic conductivity were assigned values based on measurements described in section 2 2 the longitudinal dispersivity was initially set as 5 m which is consistent with gelhar et al 1992 this was then varied as necessary during the simulations to provide a better fit to the measured data the horizontal transverse dispersivity was set at 1 10th the longitudinal dispersivity and the vertical transverse dispersvity was 1 10th the horizontal transverse dispersivity marsily 1986 the reasonable possibility of non reversible adsorption or loss of solute from the domain was examined using a first order decay parameter while a first order decay parameter may not be completely accurate in representing these processes it will show the effects of solute loss it was quickly determined that decay was not important in achieving a fit because the duration of the experiment was short 72 h and because the tail of the breakthrough was impossible to fit no matter what conditions were used see section 3 3 at the beginning of the simulation a tracer with the properties of a fluorescent dye was placed into the isolated 10 4 m section of the injection well at a concentration of 150 mg l for 19 min it was assumed that the tracer was fully mixed in the open section of the injection well after this the tracer source was turned off and tracer breakthrough was observed at the observation wells the simulated profiles were then compared to the measured profiles and the results of the finite difference modelling an analytical solution that accounts for mixing in the well such as that described by novakowski 1992 was not implemented in this study as such solutions cannot account for multiple contributions from complex fracture distributions or a variable concentration profile to achieve a fit to the measured data and to determine which properties had the most effect on the solution a wide array of parameters was varied deterministically for the fractures aperture heterogeneity was examined by systematically changing the apertures of rectangular regions in each fracture the sizes and apertures of the regions were adjusted as necessary to approach a fit this allowed for an exploration of the effects of regions of closure or of possible channelization the horizontal extents of fractures were also varied to allow connection to specific wells but not others additional horizontal fractures were added to the model with some unconnected to any of the wells in particular the addition of a fracture at bottom of the domain was a focus for this due to the evidence from the constant head tests vertical fractures with apertures up to 1 mm were added to connect the different horizontal fractures note that for each of the properties listed above the effects were examined both individually and combined with changes to other properties resulting in complex fracture networks as matrix diffusion was a potentially key process at this site the matrix porosity was varied between 1 and 15 to observe its effects on the transport solution zones of increased matrix diffusion 40 porosity with a length of up to 4 m were also added to represent heterogeneity in the matrix porosity or the possible presence of enhanced porosity due to zones of densely spaced low aperture fractures these were added because the core from multiple boreholes contained zones with broken core and numerous fractures within a 50 cm length while the length and quantity of these regions was not well known it was possible that they influenced transport the regional horizontal gradient was too small to have an impact on the simulations however vertical gradients ranging from 0 01 to 0 67 were implemented in the numerical model there was little indication of a vertical gradient at the site from hydraulic head measurements but there was enough error in the measured values that a gradient within the range listed above was possible 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial cvfe model analysis of tracer experiment the analysis presented herein is primarily focused on one observation well 56 located 55 m downstream from the injection well the breakthrough observed at most other wells were much weaker with the fluorescence in wells 59 70 71 and 73 only increasing from the 0 015 mg l background to less than 0 03 mg l with a significant amount of background fluctuation also appearing appendix b in contrast the breakthrough at borehole 56 rose to over 1 mg l breakthrough was observed at 58 but with much lower peak concentrations that were 10 smaller than at 56 the weaker breakthrough at other wells in this experiment makes it difficult to determine the effectiveness of this method at distances of over 100 m however this does provide evidence for the presence of significant fracture heterogeneity between the injection and observation wells the heterogeneity could include poor fracture connections mean aperture differences between fractures and divergence of pathways both in the horizontal plane and up or down vertical fractures concentration profiles in borehole 56 are presented in fig 5 to interpret this experiment in a way that provides useful information regarding the hydrogeology of the fracture network it is not only necessary to determine the tracer concentrations entering the well from the formation but also to recreate the transport and dilution that was occurring via the different fractures intersecting the borehole wall in particular note the divide in concentrations at 180 masl which coincides with one of the observed fractures initial attempts at modelling this system with the 3 d cvfe model using the four continuous fracture representation described in the methods section were completely unable to replicate this as there was little to no mixing in the well in the model these produced a concentric plume as would be expected from a divergent setup this result is not shown here as it provides little additional information the decreases in concentration at the bottom of the domain relative to rest of the profile at early times and increases at late time were another particularly challenging part of the profile to explain with the initial models due to the similarity between the measurements in both the ascending and descending profiles fig 5 it is evident that the process of lowering and raising the fluorometer did not influence the measured profile recall that the fluorometer was lowered down the borehole descending profile at a rate of 2 3 m min and then brought back up ascending profile at a similar rate collecting concentration data every second furthermore a profile similar to this was observed in borehole 58 particularly the break in concentrations at approximately 180 masl diffusion through the well was also unable to explain the profile as the diffusion coefficient 5 56 10 10 m2 s was simply too small to create significant diffusion over multiple metres in a timespan of just a few days therefore the most likely explanation was advection dominated flux between fracture features i e as shown in fig 2 using the well as a conduit the wide variation in concentrations in the measured profile combined with the lack of breakthrough at several of the observation wells indicates strong tortuosity in the plane of individual horizontal fractures and or in vertical connection between fractures the next steps were to investigate this hypothesis and to determine the feasibility of constraining the position and magnitude of the most important fluxes to and within the well using numerical models 3 2 results of well model simulations through variation of nodal flux terms for both flow and transport a fit was achieved in bh56 to the measured concentration profiles using the finite difference model for the well fig 6 each fit to a line in the 3 diagrams shown was achieved using the same model configuration the best fit was determined visually non uniqueness was observed in the number of fractures and the magnitude and direction of water velocity through the well that could result in a fit each of the fits however shared a number of similar characteristics note that all the values for fluxes in this section correspond to net fluxes into or out of the well the flux terms in eqs 1 and 2 do not account for the absolute amount of mass entering the well only the mass left in the well to determine if the net water fluxes used in this study were considered reasonable estimates of total flux into the well were then compared to the net fluxes in the well model the total flux was calculated using the cubic law with a range of values from 0 0001 to 0 001 for the hydraulic gradient near borehole 56 during the experiment and the apertures as derived from the hydraulic testing results shown in fig 2 for any parameter combination within the measured values the water flux obtained from the well model fit was consistently lower than that estimated from the cubic law which would be expected as water would be also leaving the borehole at the same time to fit the measured concentrations the model required 5 6 connecting fractures in addition to the 173 5 masl fracture acting as a constant source fractures were added at elevations of approximately 170 m 171 5 m 179 5 m 182 m and 184 m in the domain for water fluxes while the direction of the resulting velocity in the borehole was not unique the magnitude needed to be on the order of 10 3 m s through the middle of the domain 173 5 179 5 masl to achieve a fit at the edges this was reduced to 10 4 m s these velocities correspond to net darcy fluxes between 5 10 5 m s for the larger fractures and 10 100 smaller for the smaller fractures the possibility of an external vertical gradient influencing the velocity over the entire domain was considered however such a gradient could not be responsible for a velocity larger than those at the domain boundaries 10 4 m s indicating that the effect of any vertical gradient would have to be small and could not be responsible for a significant component of the 10 3 m s velocity observed through the centre of the domain another feature common to multiple fits was that the fractures at 179 5 masl and 184 masl had net positive flow and solute fluxes with the majority being added from the 179 5 masl fracture fluxes 10 larger than any other fracture conversely the fractures at 170 m and 171 5 masl had net negative fluxes for both flow and solute in all fits to the measured data the net fluxes for the solute corresponded to concentrations that were significantly less 10 than the injection concentration an example of the conceptual model for transport in borehole 56 as described above is shown in fig 7 in this diagram the fracture at 173 5 masl is constant two fractures are providing a net positive influx into the well elevations of 179 5 masl and 184 masl and the others are removing solute 182 masl and 171 5 masl the fracture at 182 masl also had net negative flow and solute flux but the values were much smaller 10 100 x than in other fractures thus this fracture was not considered to be as important as the others to explaining transport into the well this model for borehole 56 was used to achieve fits in the other observation wells using the same number of fractures elevations and directions of net flux with some exceptions the positions of these fractures correspond to high transmissivity zones observed in the constant head tests for example both the 179 5 masl and 184 masl fractures were observed in almost all observation wells e g fig 2 providing additional support for their significance to flow and transport in this system notably despite the importance of the 179 5 masl fracture to solute transport in the model it was not observed in the injection well via the constant head tests also note that no fracture is needed at 187 masl in the well model indicating that the fracture observed at that elevation may not be important for solute transport in the tracer experiment the total number of horizontal fractures participating in transport based on this analysis 5 6 and using the mean spacing from the core logs indicates that only 13 16 of the identified fractures contribute transport through the network at these locations finally while it was unclear whether a fracture was present at the base of the unit from the transmissivity logs it was not possible to achieve a fit to the tracer experiment without such a feature the location of the constant concentration node 173 5 masl was varied to determine if that would influence the conclusions from the simulations by moving the constant source to both 179 5 masl and 184 masl it was observed that the 173 5 and 179 5 masl fractures were the most significant in terms of solute flux entering the well distinguishing which of the two fractures was more important with a unique solution was not possible while solute fluxes did change when moving the constant source node the magnitude of the velocities through the well as well as the number approximate positions and relative importance of the five important fracture features for transport did not the importance of the 179 5 masl fracture to fitting the measured data despite not being observed in injection well constant head tests indicates that there is at least some vertical connection at the site this is possibly only true near the injection well as the differences in the solute fluxes from fractures of similar hydraulic aperture indicate that there is not a strong vertical connection in the domain near the observation well it is not possible to make further interpretations based on the well model alone while the open borehole tracer experiment combined with a simple finite difference model for flow and transport in the borehole can provide us mostly qualitative information regarding the transport properties of the upper eramosa it does not supply any detail on absolute concentrations in the formation or provide specifics on the transport parameters of individual fractures thus the next step was to look at results of a model of the larger network system 3 3 three dimensional modelling results fig 8 shows the results of the closest fit that was achieved visually using the 3 d cvfe model this was accomplished using six fractures at approximately the same elevations as used with the well model 170 5 171 5 173 5 179 5 182 and 184 masl note that because the injection well was isolated between 172 and 183 masl three of the fractures in the borehole 56 were not connected to the source except for the 14 m fracture the apertures of each fracture were constant throughout the domain a small amount of heterogeneity was needed in the 184 masl fracture where an aperture of 700 μm between the injection and observation well was then increased to 900 μm past borehole 56 the other parameters are listed in table 2 note that while the center of the profile 173 180 masl and the decline in concentrations at 180 masl were comparable to the measured values this model remained unable to fully explain the data comparison to the best fit obtained using the well model illustrates the importance of the fracture at 173 5 masl and this suggests that the 3 d cvfe model does not capture the source of driving hydraulic head and concentration generated by this feature see further discussion below due to the sensitivity of the profile to small changes in the fracture network and the countless possible fracture geometries the primary goal was to match the overall shape of the profile at the greatest number of times simultaneously and not to achieve a perfect fit at every point most of the discrepancies observed were thus not considered important to the overall fit e g the differences between measured at simulated curves at 2 4 h the late time concentration peaks at 184 masl and at the base of the eramosa were particularly anomalous however these were caused by solute entering the well through the fractures at 173 5 179 5 and 182 masl and being pushed outwards to the edges of the well allowed by the small but present hydraulic conductivity of the matrix in these regions once there the mass was unable to leave the well because the regional gradient responsible for flow and transport near the well boundaries was simply too low the reason for this issue arising in the model but not in the measured data suggests that the hydraulic conductivity in the matrix was lower in these locations than used in the model variation of the vertical fracture properties vertical gradients and matrix properties discussed in the methods section 2 5 were unable to achieve a comparable fit to the data and were mostly unable to achieve a significant amount of vertical spreading in the well also note that no matter the combination of parameters the peaks observed fig 8 were also present in these models this highlights the need to use the well model to sort out the fluxes and assist in the interpretation of the 3 d cvfe model calculation of reynolds numbers and inertial effects using the velocities estimated in the horizontal fractures and the methods provided in quinn et al 2011b suggested that turbulence played little role if any in conclusion the addition of fractures at locations indicated by the well model combined with aperture heterogeneity different values of mean aperture was best able to explain the measured concentrations overall the conceptual model produced from this was of a series of six poorly connected horizontal fractures with varying amounts of aperture heterogeneity through the variation of parameters discussed in the methods the properties of the rock matrix while potentially more important in experiments with longer timespans or under natural gradient were not found to be particularly influential on the results of this experiment a further experiment where advection is less dominant i e natural conditions would be required to better understand the importance of the matrix there are still issues of non uniqueness with the exact parameter values used in particular for the fracture apertures numerous fits could be achieved through different combinations however like with the well model the overall conceptual model did not change significantly with these arrangements the model which achieved the closest fit at borehole 56 was also used to simulate breakthrough at other wells used in the experiment simulated concentrations similar to measured concentrations were observed at borehole 73 which was at 116 m distance from the injection well fig 9 the addition of a first order decay parameter to simulate a small amount 2 10 6 s 1 of dye loss possibly caused by vertical spreading of the tracer along the fracture network to regions outside the measurement domain was also helpful in simulating the experiment at later times for this larger distance at borehole 71 there was no simulated breakthrough which corroborates the lack of breakthrough observed in the well after correcting for background fluorescence the resulting conceptual model derived from the simulations is considered consistent with the well model in both 5 6 fractures are needed to explain the results of the tracer experiment furthermore the positions of these fractures are essentially identical while the apertures of the 173 5 m and 179 5 masl fractures in the cvfe model might be smaller than that of the others they remain the most important fractures for solute transport due to their apparent connection to the injection well in both models the fracture at 175 178 masl observed in constant head tests was not necessary to explain measured concentrations the most significant difference between this model and the well model was that the fracture at 184 masl had a net positive flux in the well model but not in the cvfe model in both models however the flux was small relative to that of other fractures so the influence was likely negligible the differences between the model and the measured constant head test data are more significant while the apertures of the fractures are reasonable based on the ranges provided in table 1 and the positions of most fractures are similar the constant head tests indicated that the fractures at 9 5 masl and 12 masl may not be connected to the injection well unless through unknown vertically connected pathways it was not possible however to recreate the measured profile without these connections further the two fractures added at the bottom of the model needed to be significantly larger than what was observed in the observation wells where they were present it is possible that the one fracture measured at 171 174 masl was actually two fractures in wells where it was observed there were multiple adjacent test intervals with similar transmissivities e g boreholes 58 and 59 in fig 2 the explanation for this was initially thought to be inadvertent overlap in the tests but it is also possible that more than one conductive fracture was present however the maximum aperture for the measured feature was approximately 400 μm which is less than half the aperture used in the model differences between apertures determined from tracer experiments and those from hydraulic tests have been observed and discussed extensively in the literature before cady et al 1993 hjerne et al 2010 silliman 1989 tsang 1992 zheng et al 2008 therefore discrepancies between the aperture determined from this analysis and that measured in constant head tests could be expected overall from the cvfe model of the tracer experiment it was possible to corroborate which fractures were important to solute transport their positions and relative importance furthermore while it was not possible to completely explain the experiment with a numerical model due to the difficulty of fitting a complex concentration profile at numerous times with a single model a better understanding of transport processes at this site was obtained from this analysis differing values of aperture between primary horizontal fractures rather than vertical connections between the horizontal fractures was indicated to be an essential factor to explaining the tortuous transport patterns that have been observed at this site thus it can be concluded that experiments conducted in open boreholes using downhole fluorometers can inform conceptual models of transport processes in sparsely fractured rock 4 conclusions in this study we used two numerical models to analyze the results of a unique network scale tracer experiment conducted in a silurian dolostone near smithville ontario the purpose was to obtain discrete fracture properties from the experiment which was conducted using open boreholes with concentrations obtained using a downhole fluorometer the first simulations were conducted using a finite difference model of one observation well which represented flow and transport through the well and nodal net fluxes accounting for solute additions to or subtractions from the well the second set of simulations was conducted using a control volume finite element model which simulated transport between the injection and observation wells through a series of discretely formulated fractures coupled with a porous matrix in a three dimensional domain from the results of this modelling the following conclusions were drawn a fit to the experimental data could be achieved using the well model having 5 6 fractures intersecting the borehole wall a 3 d control volume finite element model which was consistent with the configuration of the well model could also fit much of the measured profile through the analyses presented in this paper we were able to identify the most important horizontal fractures for transporting aqueous contaminants to the observation wells the use of both models together with the one data set helped constrain the conceptual model for transport in the fracture network based on the models presented in this paper it appears much more likely that heterogeneity in fracture aperture within and between primary horizontal fractures as opposed to vertical fracture connections between horizontal fractures is the most important factor in explaining observed tortuosity non uniqueness in model fits made it extremely difficult to constrain exact parameter values such as the fracture aperture for the different fractures consistent with previous studies only limited agreement between the transport carrying fractures as determined from the present analysis and those that would be predicted from the results of constant head tests are observed overall this study indicates that tracer experiments conducted in open boreholes with the use of a downhole fluorometer can provide useful information for large scale transport because of the difficulty in interpreting breakthroughs at distances of over 100 m and because it was not possible to fit the entire profile using the control volume finite element model this experimental setup may be best used in conjunction with other investigation techniques in this study the loss of solute with distance effectively limited the distances that could be studied to little more than 50 m larger scale experiments remain necessary to better understand transport at scales relevant to the field note that the source tracer concentration was limited to 150 mg l increasing this value by an order of magnitude would be possible without introducing significant density effects and would significantly increase the potentially observable transport distance furthermore as this study involved a forced gradient tracer experiment there are issues surrounding how representative the results are of the natural environment for example the importance of matrix diffusion was difficult to determine due to the high flow rate and short timeframe of the experiment a natural gradient experiment would be required to make further conclusions on this subject declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

1373,the presence of fractures in bedrock allows for rapid aqueous contaminant transport through complex pathways and for diffusion of solutes between the fractures and the matrix to better understand transport in these settings tracer experiments are a commonly used tool the need for expensive multi level wells to obtain depth specific concentrations however significantly limits the cost efficiency the primary objective of this study is to develop a method whereby a discrete fracture network approach can be used to simulate the results of a divergent tracer experiment conducted using open observation boreholes in a well characterized dolostone over distances of 55 m to 242 m the experiment was conducted using a fluorescent tracer which allowed for continuous concentration measurement with depth in each open observation well two numerical models were employed in the interpretation of the experiment the first was a 1 d finite difference model focused on flow and transport in the observation wells and the second was a 3 d control volume finite element model capable of simulating the entire fracture network through fitting the experimental data to simulations the most important fractures for transport in the system were identified the number of fractures that participated in transport was few relative to the number of fractures observed in core and in constant head test results heterogeneous distribution of the fracture apertures was determined to be the likely cause of the highly tortuous transport observed at the site this study demonstrates that tracer experiments conducted using open observation boreholes and a downhole fluorometer can improve our understanding of large scale transport in fractured rock especially when analysed with multiple models and compared to other measured properties such as matrix porosity hydraulic aperture and fracture orientation keywords discrete fracture networks tracer experiment aqueous solute transport numerical modelling open wells 1 introduction fractures in bedrock create preferential pathways for groundwater flow and allow for the rapid movement of groundwater and aqueous contaminants over large distances these pathways can be exceptionally tortuous and heterogeneous due to morphology arising from mode of formation and geological history bear et al 1993 neuman 2005 tsang and neretnieks 1998 as an example novakowski and lapcevic 1994 found that the hydraulic aperture of a single horizontal fracture feature varied significantly 200 μm over distances of less than 5 m in an ordovician shale in carbonate rock other authors have found ranges in fracture aperture from lower hydraulic testing limits which are 30 40 μm to dissolution features which may exceed one m medici et al 2019 medici et al 2021 quinn et al 2011a quinn et al 2011b ren et al 2018 during transport diffusion of aqueous contaminants from fractures into the rock matrix further adds to the complexity by establishing a long term low concentration source in the matrix that is difficult to remove carrera et al 1998 feenstra et al 1984 jardine et al 1999 mutch et al 1993 west and kueper 2010 the result of these issues provides difficulty in the prediction of solute transport in fracture networks that can present a significant problem for the protection of drinking water tracer experiments can be powerful tools for interpreting and understanding flow and transport in many groundwater settings berkowitz 2002 national research council 1996 nasem 2015 numerous tracer experiments have been conducted in fractured rock using a variety of configurations which have greatly advanced our understanding of the governing transport processes e g abelin et al 1991 cvetkovic et al 2010 d alessandro et al 1997 maloszewski et al 1999 mckay et al 1993 novakowski et al 2004 paillet et al 2012 reimus et al 2003 webster et al 1970 many of these studies have been conducted at transport distances of less than 50 m which is far less than what is typically relevant at a contaminated site experiments in larger networks are needed to better understand the importance of fracture interconnections despite this far fewer tracer experiments have been conducted at larger distances primarily due to the cost and complexity of undertaking these investigations for example in a review by zhou et al 2007 just six of the approximately 40 experiments examined involved transport scales at or above 50 m one of the difficulties that remains with understanding large scale transport through fractured rock is the potential for non uniqueness in the interpretation of experiments conceptual model non uniqueness has been well recognized at all scales becker and shapiro 2003 berkowitz et al 2006 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 johnston et al 2009 sánchez vila and carrera 2004 several studies in which non uniqueness has been encountered have suggested scaling of parameters such as aperture or matrix porosity with distance to fit the data guihéneuf et al 2017 lapcevic et al 1999 shapiro 2001 zhou et al 2007 however the use of scaling parameters does not provide substantial information regarding the nature of the heterogeneity at a site and can be difficult from which to make predictions to accurately predict transport in fractured rock at a site with non uniqueness issues multiple transport experiments are often needed and even then success in determining a unique conceptual model is not common because of the cost and difficulty associated with most tracer experiments national research council 1996 nasem 2015 numerous tests are simply not possible at many sites thus limiting the information available for accurate conceptual model development in addition to the need for multiple experiments large scale transport studies typically use multi level wells with numerous measurement zones in favour of the much more common open well which further adds to the expense and difficulty lasagna and de luca 2016 lerner and teutsch 1995 poulsen et al 2019 open boreholes cannot be used to collect samples from individual fracture features and typically provide only averaged samples for all fractures intersecting the borehole forcing the use of an equivalent porous media epm approach blessent et al 2013 harte 2013 medici et al 2019 medici et al 2021 molson et al 2012 national research council 1996 pankow et al 1985 conversely multi level wells can provide depth discrete concentrations although these too are subject to concentration averaging where fracture spacing is small shapiro 2001 note that due to both the highly heterogeneous natures of concentration profiles in fractured rock and the evidence that only a small proportion of observed fractures may control solute transport at many sites chilès and de marsily 1993 hitchmough et al 2007 quinn et al 2011a zanini et al 2000 the complexity of transport pathways is not easily captured with either open wells or multi level piezometers thus it would be advantageous if a tracer experiment could be conducted using open boreholes as this is the least expensive option in such a way as to obtain discrete fracture properties and information regarding in fracture concentrations which in turn would enable analysis of large scale transport based on a discrete fracture network dfn approach to modelling blessent et al 2011 chapman et al 2013 hyman et al 2015 molson et al 2012 pierce et al 2018 downhole fluorometers have been shown to provide depth discrete concentrations in tracer experiments flynn et al 2004 levison and novakowski 2012 petrella et al 2008 however very few studies have been conducted using this method at transport distances exceeding 20 m further experiments involving downhole fluorometers have been mostly limited to hydrogeological settings in unconsolidated media although very local scale 10 m transport studies have been conducted in epikarst petrella et al 2008 and crystalline rock levison and novakowski 2012 this method has had no known use in fractured rock at larger scales a notable drawback occurs because of mixing processes in the open well which can dilute concentrations and may obscure the individual fractures through which most of the solute is transported thus further investigation to determine the usefulness of this method for accurately estimating transport in fractured bedrock at the network scale is required the primary objectives of this study are to develop a methodology to successfully simulate experiments conducted in sparse fracture networks using open boreholes and downhole tracer concentration measurement and to explore the processes of solute transport in a fracture network in particular this study will focus on i the development of a conceptual model for a dfn that can reproduce the measured concentrations and ii on determining the important tracer carrying fractures over a transport distance of approximately 250 m an additional objective is to identify issues of non uniqueness that can arise in interpreting tracer experiments conducted in this fashion these objectives will be resolved through the application of the method using an experiment conducted in a divergent flow system in a silurian dolostone located in southern ontario this site has been the focus of extensive investigations over several decades although transport at the site is not yet fully understood e g gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 golder associates limited 1995 mclaren et al 2012 novakowski et al 1999 the tracer experiment was conducted in a previous study moore 2008 and the focus of this paper will be to apply a discrete fracture based numerical model to interpret the results within the context of the objectives described above 2 methodology 2 1 modelling approach the focus of this paper is the analysis of a tracer experiment that was conducted by injecting a fluorescent dye tracer into an open 10 4 m section of borehole 72 in fig 1 and then observing breakthrough in six down gradient wells 56 58 59 70 71 and 73 located at distances between 55 m and 242 m from the injection point to simulate the results of the tracer experiment two distinct numerical models were used the first of these is a finite difference model for flow and transport through a 1 d feature representing the open wells with terms to provide net fluxes through the well the governing equations and solution method are described in section 2 4 below the flux terms represent inflow or outflow from fractures in this model no consideration of the governing processes outside the observation well was taken as the focus was solely on the analyses of the net fluxes required to achieve a fit to observed concentrations a second model was therefore needed with an expanded domain to include the fracture network and surrounding porous medium for this a control volume finite element cvfe model therrien and sudicky 1996 was employed using physical properties e g matrix porosity fracture aperture based on those measured in the field a detailed description of the tracer experiment and the application of both models is described in the following 2 2 study site characterization this study was conducted at a site to north of the town of smithville ontario canada fig 1 in the early 1980s pcb waste from nearby municipalities was stored at the site golder associates limited 1995 after the detection of tce and pcbs in the subsurface significant efforts to characterize the hydrogeology of the site have been undertaken including the completion of more than 1400 constant head tests numerous pumping and pulse interference tests several local scale tracer experiments 50 m transport distance and multiple large scale tracer experiments 50 m transport distance such as the one of interest to this research the constant head tests pumping tests and pulse interference tests are described in novakowski et al 1999 the local scale tracer experiments are described in novakowski et al 2004 the near surface geology at the smithville site is composed of approximately 10 m of overburden till underlain by the lockport dolostone this is a silurian aged dolostone which can be further subdivided into four units including the gasport goat island vinemount and eramosa the uppermost of these is the eramosa which is the focus of this study and is approximately 15 m in thickness the unit dips slightly to the south east and is characterized by vuggy features laminations and a dark grey colour golder associates limited 1995 novakowski and lapcevic 1988 both horizontal bedding plane fractures and vertical fractures with five sets of orientations have been identified in the eramosa novakowski et al 1999 the bedding plane fractures follow the dip and can be traced using marker beds over lateral distances greater than 250 m the mean spacing for these fractures is 0 38 m the vertical fractures group in orientation at 0 65 and 105 for the three most dominant sets and at 42 and 147 for two minor sets the mean spacing for the vertical fractures is 0 77 m although additional discussion of this is provided below the study area has also been identified to lie in a region that has experienced karstification particularly in the eramosa unit brunton and dodge 2008 gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 although there is some evidence of karst features where the till thickness diminishes to less than one m to the north of the site and in 20 mile creek to the south the is little to no evidence of dissolution features in the drilling results or rock core previous numerical simulations of the study site mclaren et al 2012 have been conducted assuming no influence of karstification constant head tests zeigler 1976 conducted in eight wells fig 1 in the vicinity of the tracer experiment using 0 1 m and 0 5 m packer spacings were interpreted to determine the distribution of hydraulic conductivity and the location of permeable fractures in the eramosa boreholes 70 73 were drilled vertically and the remaining boreholes were inclined with plunges of 55 degrees the drilling was conducted using triple tube diamond coring methods the diameter of all the wells was 96 mm h sized the wells all fully penetrated the eramosa and ranged in length from approximately 23 m to 59 m the 51 tests conducted at 0 1 m packer spacing in borehole 64 indicate that the background unfractured hydraulic conductivity of the eramosa ranges from approximately 10 9 to 10 6 m s the tests conducted at 0 5 m lengths which were completed in each well across the entire span of the eramosa provided evidence that groundwater flow is dominated by a small number of highly conductive bedding plane fractures zanini et al 2000 in particular five primary horizontal fractures were identified in many of the wells with significantly higher hydraulic conductivities 500 μm hydraulic aperture than the background hydraulic apertures were determined using the measured transmissivity obtained from constant head tests with the cubic law snow 1965 using the assumption that a single fracture dominated each test section core logs were used to corroborate the positions of the fractures identified by constant head tests and to assist in distinguishing horizontal and vertical fractures note that numerous other horizontal fractures 15 in each well were observed in the core log for the eramosa but showed no evidence of conducting significantly more flow than the matrix the identified horizontal fractures are believed to be correlated horizontally across hundreds of meters at the site novakowski et al 1999 zanini et al 2000 as illustrated in fig 2 this is both because of the observation of high transmissivity horizontal features affiliated with marker beds at approximately the same heights across each well and due to the low regional gradient measured of 0 0001 to the south east novakowski et al 2006 the appearance of the tracer at distances of over 100 m in both this experiment and other experiments at the site also support this hypothesis moore 2008 an additional conceptual model in cross section adapted from moore 2008 is included in the supplementary data table 1 provides the relevant statistics for the fractures identified in fig 2 the mean geometric value was not considered particularly meaningful here due to the small number of measurements for each fracture and the high variability in the values observed combined with statistics from other boreholes nearby novakowski et al 1999 however it was useful as a guide for approximate apertures used in the tracer experiment models the lowest of these horizontal features was located at approximately 173 masl and this fracture was observed in each well fig 2 table 1 the geometric mean of the measured hydraulic apertures between all of the boreholes for this feature is 1261 μm fig 2 a feature between 175 and 178 masl geometric mean aperture 464 μm and one at the top of the eramosa unit were also identified in each well the top of the eramosa unit was located at 182 184 masl with an elevation of 184 m in the closer wells 55 59 and 182 m at distant observation points 64 37c the geometric mean hydraulic aperture of the uppermost fracture was 903 μm two other high transmissivity features were observed in most of the observation wells but notably there was no corresponding high transmissivity zone in the injection well fig 2 a feature was identified in all but the injection well consistently at an elevation of approximately 179 180 masl with a geometric mean hydraulic aperture of 792 μm the other was located between this fracture and that at the top of the eramosa 182 masl but was only observed in the 55 59 cluster of wells possibly due to an intersection with the top of the unit in more distant wells finally while not listed in the table note that another smaller feature was observed at the bottom of four of the observation wells 37c 55 57 and 58 the geometric mean of the apertures was 320 μm with a range of 223 to 409 μm the identified vertical fractures had an average spacing determined from the core to be 0 77 m novakowski et al 1999 borehole inclination was considered when calculating spacings constant head tests at 0 5 m spacing indicated that many of the vertical fractures have transmissivities in the range of 10 9 10 6 m2 s which corresponds to apertures of approximately 12 120 μm however there were several larger features corresponding to hydraulic apertures between 250 and 690 μm while vertical fracture lengths heights could not be measured via boreholes at the smithville site they were taken at a nearby quarry gartner lee limited and acres international ltd 1996 most fractures were less than one m in length but fractures with a greater length were observed at spacing ranging from less than 1 0 m to 20 m the fractures range in height from approximately 1 0 m to 7 0 m the ability of these fractures to provide vertical connections between horizontal fractures at the site is not fully understood based on the characterization conducted by novakowski et al 1999 from hydraulic head measurements in four multi level piezometers at the test site there is little indication of vertical flow or recharge in the eramosa unit this can be observed in the hydraulic head measured in multi levels 11 12 21 and 53 with plots and a location map obtained from novakowski et al 1999 and shown in supplementary data as diffusion between the matrix and fractures is potentially significant in a carbonate rock measurements of matrix porosity were conducted gravimetric methods were used to measure the porosity novakowski et al 1999 this involved comparing the weights of wet samples and then oven dried samples of 5 20 mm discs collected from core the range of the 342 measurements was 1 to 20 porosity the interquartile range however was 5 to 7 5 providing a practical range on the porosity that was used for the modelling 2 3 tracer experiment the tracer experiment was conducted by first isolating the eramosa in the injection well bh72 using a packer at the top of the unit fig 2 moore 2008 the bottom of the well did not cross the lower boundary of the eramosa the resulting isolated section was approximately 10 4 m in length in the six observation wells used in the experiment fig 1 packers were placed at the bottom of the unit the top was left open resulting in an observation region 14 15 m in length uniform injection of the tracer over the length of the open section was achieved using a perforated standpipe with preferentially larger openings closer to the bottom steady flow conditions were first established with a flow rate of 92 2 l min once this was achieved lissamine ff dye tracer was injected at a concentration of 150 mg l for 19 min after which the source was switched back to fresh water at the same flow rate for the remaining duration of the experiment the lissamine dye was chosen because of its resistance to retardation novakowski et al 2004 smart and laidlaw 1977 in most rock with exceptions for where organic matter is ubiquitous such as peat lissamine ff has losses of less than 10 due to retardation smart and laidlaw 1977 concentration profiles were measured in the observation wells using downhole fluorometers a submersible fluorometer turner designs cyclops 7 with a detection limit of 0 001 mg l coupled with a pressure transducer was used before tracer arrival background fluorescence was measured and was found to be 0 015 mg l or less at each measurement event the fluorometer was lowered down the borehole at a rate of 2 3 m min and then brought back up at a similar rate continuous measurements were taken during this time with readings every second recorded with a campbell scientific cr10 x data logger the concentration measurements were linked to water depth using a continuously recording pressure transducer attached to the fluorometer due to the length of the experiment relative to the duration of the measurement of each profile it was considered unlikely that the concentrations changed significantly in the time it took to lower and raise the fluorometer measurements were initially obtained at half hour intervals which later became less frequent as the experiment neared conclusion the total duration of the experiment was 72 h with two additional measurements taken several days later for more detail regarding the tracer experiment the reader is directed to moore 2008 2 4 finite difference well model development as the observation wells were open hydraulic communication between fractures intersecting the wells at different depths was possible thus to analyze the tracer experiment a 1 d implicit finite difference model for flow and transport in an observation well was developed to accommodate this process in the model flow is treated as uniformly steady whereas transport is transient in the experiment steady flow conditions were reached before injection of the dye tracer so this assumption was deemed reasonable the governing equations used are given in 1 and 2 where 1 represents the equation for flow in an open well and 2 represents solute transport in the well adapted from lacombe et al 1995 1 π r s 2 k w 2 h l 2 q n 0 2 π r s 2 c w t d w 2 c w l 2 q w c w l γ n 0 3 k w r s 2 ρg 8 μ 4 d w d 0 r s 2 q w 2 48 d 0 these equations are similar to that for flow and transport in a porous media with an additional term representing flux perpendicular to the well at each node this term allows for the representation of fractures intersecting the well as flux values where in 1 r s represents the well radius q n is the nodal darcy flux normal to the well l is the position along the well h is the hydraulic head and k w is the hydraulic conductivity of the well which is defined in 3 fluid density the gravitational acceleration constant and fluid viscosity are represented by ρ g and μ respectively in 2 q w represents the water velocity along the well q w k w h l c w is the concentration in the well and γ n is the nodal solute flux normal to the well integrated over the circumference at elevation l the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d w is defined in 4 where d 0 is the free water diffusion coefficient a central difference approach was used for the spatial terms whereas a forward difference approach was used for time the model domain was 15 m long as illustrated in fig 3 with the base at 170 masl in the context of the field setting a single node at 173 5 masl was selected as a constant head and concentration boundary this node was chosen at the height of the highest hydraulic aperture fracture which could be correlated between the injection and observation wells elements of 0 1 m length were used with time steps of 20 s to test the suitability of the discretization an analytical solution ogata and banks 1961 to eq 2 was compared to the finite difference solution with the flux terms in 2 set to zero using a q w varied between 10 5 and 10 3 m s no difference between the numerical model and the analytical solution was observed visually indicating that the discretization was acceptable fining of the discretization beyond these values made no discernible difference to the solution a well radius of 0 05 m consistent with the field value was used a value of 5 6 10 10 m2 s was used for the free water diffusion coefficient and a value of 0 1 used for matrix tortuosity this is consistent with novakowski et al 2004 for the same tracer used in the present field study finally the fluid density gravitational acceleration constant and dynamic fluid viscosity were set as 1000 kg m3 9 81 m2 s and 1 124 10 3 kg m s respectively the top and bottom boundaries of the model were set as no flow for fluid migration and no flux for solute transport the choice of the position of the constant head boundary was varied by choosing other points as dirichlet boundary conditions to determine if this influenced the conclusions drawn from this analysis this will be further discussed in the results section once the model development was complete flow and transport were simulated in each well separately with different values of nodal flux terms to achieve fits to the shape of the concentration profile through observing which nodes required external fluxes to fit the model to the experimental profile the purpose was to identify solute carrying fractures intersecting the borehole and develop one or more depictions of flow and transport in the observation well 2 5 expanded domain with control volume finite element model to support the conclusions of the finite difference model and to simulate the entire experimental domain a 3 d control volume finite element model was used therrien and sudicky 1996 this model is capable of simulating groundwater flow and solute transport through discrete fractures coupled to a porous matrix brunner and simmons 2012 a 700 700 17 m domain was first generated the lateral domain size was selected by increasing the limits in x and y until the transport solution at specific snapshots in time no longer varied significantly 5 change in concentrations between domain sizes at the observation wells the injection well bh72 was placed at the center of the domain and the observation wells at appropriate positions relative to this the observation wells were fully penetrating whereas the injection well was an isolated 10 4 m section 172 183 m height in the model with impermeable material above and below the injection well was assigned a constant pumping rate of 92 l min observation wells are represented as 1 d line features in the domain as described in lacombe et al 1995 which allowed for mixing in the wells due to computational restraints these were placed vertically rather than at an incline initially four fully continuous fractures between the injection and observation wells were placed at elevations of 173 177 5 179 5 and 182 masl which was supported by the constant head test results the fracture elevations and the horizontal extents were later varied to explore fits to the measured data the discretization of the domain was centered on the fractures with elements of 1 mm vertical height and 10 mm horizontal length in the immediate vicinity this then coarsened outwards to 1 1 0 5 m blocks outside of the region with observation wells this was further coarsened to 100 100 0 5 m elements fig 4 shows an illustration of the model grid in the plane of the fracture the element sizes were chosen by shrinking the elements until the transport solution no longer varied with changes to the discretization the discretization was corroborated through comparison of the numerical model to an analytical solution developed by chen 1985 as the analytical solution is for just one fracture does not account for a regional gradient and uses a constant concentration source the numerical model was adapted for this but retained the grid structure and discretization the comparison showed no visibly discernable difference in breakthrough curves between the final numerical discretization and the analytical model at several locations in the domain appendix a two of the horizontal boundaries of the domain were assigned a constant head providing a regional gradient of 0 0001 across the domain for the duration of the simulation this is consistent with what was measured at the site zanini et al 2000 the other four boundaries were assigned as no flow other relevant properties to the simulation such as matrix porosity and matrix hydraulic conductivity were assigned values based on measurements described in section 2 2 the longitudinal dispersivity was initially set as 5 m which is consistent with gelhar et al 1992 this was then varied as necessary during the simulations to provide a better fit to the measured data the horizontal transverse dispersivity was set at 1 10th the longitudinal dispersivity and the vertical transverse dispersvity was 1 10th the horizontal transverse dispersivity marsily 1986 the reasonable possibility of non reversible adsorption or loss of solute from the domain was examined using a first order decay parameter while a first order decay parameter may not be completely accurate in representing these processes it will show the effects of solute loss it was quickly determined that decay was not important in achieving a fit because the duration of the experiment was short 72 h and because the tail of the breakthrough was impossible to fit no matter what conditions were used see section 3 3 at the beginning of the simulation a tracer with the properties of a fluorescent dye was placed into the isolated 10 4 m section of the injection well at a concentration of 150 mg l for 19 min it was assumed that the tracer was fully mixed in the open section of the injection well after this the tracer source was turned off and tracer breakthrough was observed at the observation wells the simulated profiles were then compared to the measured profiles and the results of the finite difference modelling an analytical solution that accounts for mixing in the well such as that described by novakowski 1992 was not implemented in this study as such solutions cannot account for multiple contributions from complex fracture distributions or a variable concentration profile to achieve a fit to the measured data and to determine which properties had the most effect on the solution a wide array of parameters was varied deterministically for the fractures aperture heterogeneity was examined by systematically changing the apertures of rectangular regions in each fracture the sizes and apertures of the regions were adjusted as necessary to approach a fit this allowed for an exploration of the effects of regions of closure or of possible channelization the horizontal extents of fractures were also varied to allow connection to specific wells but not others additional horizontal fractures were added to the model with some unconnected to any of the wells in particular the addition of a fracture at bottom of the domain was a focus for this due to the evidence from the constant head tests vertical fractures with apertures up to 1 mm were added to connect the different horizontal fractures note that for each of the properties listed above the effects were examined both individually and combined with changes to other properties resulting in complex fracture networks as matrix diffusion was a potentially key process at this site the matrix porosity was varied between 1 and 15 to observe its effects on the transport solution zones of increased matrix diffusion 40 porosity with a length of up to 4 m were also added to represent heterogeneity in the matrix porosity or the possible presence of enhanced porosity due to zones of densely spaced low aperture fractures these were added because the core from multiple boreholes contained zones with broken core and numerous fractures within a 50 cm length while the length and quantity of these regions was not well known it was possible that they influenced transport the regional horizontal gradient was too small to have an impact on the simulations however vertical gradients ranging from 0 01 to 0 67 were implemented in the numerical model there was little indication of a vertical gradient at the site from hydraulic head measurements but there was enough error in the measured values that a gradient within the range listed above was possible 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial cvfe model analysis of tracer experiment the analysis presented herein is primarily focused on one observation well 56 located 55 m downstream from the injection well the breakthrough observed at most other wells were much weaker with the fluorescence in wells 59 70 71 and 73 only increasing from the 0 015 mg l background to less than 0 03 mg l with a significant amount of background fluctuation also appearing appendix b in contrast the breakthrough at borehole 56 rose to over 1 mg l breakthrough was observed at 58 but with much lower peak concentrations that were 10 smaller than at 56 the weaker breakthrough at other wells in this experiment makes it difficult to determine the effectiveness of this method at distances of over 100 m however this does provide evidence for the presence of significant fracture heterogeneity between the injection and observation wells the heterogeneity could include poor fracture connections mean aperture differences between fractures and divergence of pathways both in the horizontal plane and up or down vertical fractures concentration profiles in borehole 56 are presented in fig 5 to interpret this experiment in a way that provides useful information regarding the hydrogeology of the fracture network it is not only necessary to determine the tracer concentrations entering the well from the formation but also to recreate the transport and dilution that was occurring via the different fractures intersecting the borehole wall in particular note the divide in concentrations at 180 masl which coincides with one of the observed fractures initial attempts at modelling this system with the 3 d cvfe model using the four continuous fracture representation described in the methods section were completely unable to replicate this as there was little to no mixing in the well in the model these produced a concentric plume as would be expected from a divergent setup this result is not shown here as it provides little additional information the decreases in concentration at the bottom of the domain relative to rest of the profile at early times and increases at late time were another particularly challenging part of the profile to explain with the initial models due to the similarity between the measurements in both the ascending and descending profiles fig 5 it is evident that the process of lowering and raising the fluorometer did not influence the measured profile recall that the fluorometer was lowered down the borehole descending profile at a rate of 2 3 m min and then brought back up ascending profile at a similar rate collecting concentration data every second furthermore a profile similar to this was observed in borehole 58 particularly the break in concentrations at approximately 180 masl diffusion through the well was also unable to explain the profile as the diffusion coefficient 5 56 10 10 m2 s was simply too small to create significant diffusion over multiple metres in a timespan of just a few days therefore the most likely explanation was advection dominated flux between fracture features i e as shown in fig 2 using the well as a conduit the wide variation in concentrations in the measured profile combined with the lack of breakthrough at several of the observation wells indicates strong tortuosity in the plane of individual horizontal fractures and or in vertical connection between fractures the next steps were to investigate this hypothesis and to determine the feasibility of constraining the position and magnitude of the most important fluxes to and within the well using numerical models 3 2 results of well model simulations through variation of nodal flux terms for both flow and transport a fit was achieved in bh56 to the measured concentration profiles using the finite difference model for the well fig 6 each fit to a line in the 3 diagrams shown was achieved using the same model configuration the best fit was determined visually non uniqueness was observed in the number of fractures and the magnitude and direction of water velocity through the well that could result in a fit each of the fits however shared a number of similar characteristics note that all the values for fluxes in this section correspond to net fluxes into or out of the well the flux terms in eqs 1 and 2 do not account for the absolute amount of mass entering the well only the mass left in the well to determine if the net water fluxes used in this study were considered reasonable estimates of total flux into the well were then compared to the net fluxes in the well model the total flux was calculated using the cubic law with a range of values from 0 0001 to 0 001 for the hydraulic gradient near borehole 56 during the experiment and the apertures as derived from the hydraulic testing results shown in fig 2 for any parameter combination within the measured values the water flux obtained from the well model fit was consistently lower than that estimated from the cubic law which would be expected as water would be also leaving the borehole at the same time to fit the measured concentrations the model required 5 6 connecting fractures in addition to the 173 5 masl fracture acting as a constant source fractures were added at elevations of approximately 170 m 171 5 m 179 5 m 182 m and 184 m in the domain for water fluxes while the direction of the resulting velocity in the borehole was not unique the magnitude needed to be on the order of 10 3 m s through the middle of the domain 173 5 179 5 masl to achieve a fit at the edges this was reduced to 10 4 m s these velocities correspond to net darcy fluxes between 5 10 5 m s for the larger fractures and 10 100 smaller for the smaller fractures the possibility of an external vertical gradient influencing the velocity over the entire domain was considered however such a gradient could not be responsible for a velocity larger than those at the domain boundaries 10 4 m s indicating that the effect of any vertical gradient would have to be small and could not be responsible for a significant component of the 10 3 m s velocity observed through the centre of the domain another feature common to multiple fits was that the fractures at 179 5 masl and 184 masl had net positive flow and solute fluxes with the majority being added from the 179 5 masl fracture fluxes 10 larger than any other fracture conversely the fractures at 170 m and 171 5 masl had net negative fluxes for both flow and solute in all fits to the measured data the net fluxes for the solute corresponded to concentrations that were significantly less 10 than the injection concentration an example of the conceptual model for transport in borehole 56 as described above is shown in fig 7 in this diagram the fracture at 173 5 masl is constant two fractures are providing a net positive influx into the well elevations of 179 5 masl and 184 masl and the others are removing solute 182 masl and 171 5 masl the fracture at 182 masl also had net negative flow and solute flux but the values were much smaller 10 100 x than in other fractures thus this fracture was not considered to be as important as the others to explaining transport into the well this model for borehole 56 was used to achieve fits in the other observation wells using the same number of fractures elevations and directions of net flux with some exceptions the positions of these fractures correspond to high transmissivity zones observed in the constant head tests for example both the 179 5 masl and 184 masl fractures were observed in almost all observation wells e g fig 2 providing additional support for their significance to flow and transport in this system notably despite the importance of the 179 5 masl fracture to solute transport in the model it was not observed in the injection well via the constant head tests also note that no fracture is needed at 187 masl in the well model indicating that the fracture observed at that elevation may not be important for solute transport in the tracer experiment the total number of horizontal fractures participating in transport based on this analysis 5 6 and using the mean spacing from the core logs indicates that only 13 16 of the identified fractures contribute transport through the network at these locations finally while it was unclear whether a fracture was present at the base of the unit from the transmissivity logs it was not possible to achieve a fit to the tracer experiment without such a feature the location of the constant concentration node 173 5 masl was varied to determine if that would influence the conclusions from the simulations by moving the constant source to both 179 5 masl and 184 masl it was observed that the 173 5 and 179 5 masl fractures were the most significant in terms of solute flux entering the well distinguishing which of the two fractures was more important with a unique solution was not possible while solute fluxes did change when moving the constant source node the magnitude of the velocities through the well as well as the number approximate positions and relative importance of the five important fracture features for transport did not the importance of the 179 5 masl fracture to fitting the measured data despite not being observed in injection well constant head tests indicates that there is at least some vertical connection at the site this is possibly only true near the injection well as the differences in the solute fluxes from fractures of similar hydraulic aperture indicate that there is not a strong vertical connection in the domain near the observation well it is not possible to make further interpretations based on the well model alone while the open borehole tracer experiment combined with a simple finite difference model for flow and transport in the borehole can provide us mostly qualitative information regarding the transport properties of the upper eramosa it does not supply any detail on absolute concentrations in the formation or provide specifics on the transport parameters of individual fractures thus the next step was to look at results of a model of the larger network system 3 3 three dimensional modelling results fig 8 shows the results of the closest fit that was achieved visually using the 3 d cvfe model this was accomplished using six fractures at approximately the same elevations as used with the well model 170 5 171 5 173 5 179 5 182 and 184 masl note that because the injection well was isolated between 172 and 183 masl three of the fractures in the borehole 56 were not connected to the source except for the 14 m fracture the apertures of each fracture were constant throughout the domain a small amount of heterogeneity was needed in the 184 masl fracture where an aperture of 700 μm between the injection and observation well was then increased to 900 μm past borehole 56 the other parameters are listed in table 2 note that while the center of the profile 173 180 masl and the decline in concentrations at 180 masl were comparable to the measured values this model remained unable to fully explain the data comparison to the best fit obtained using the well model illustrates the importance of the fracture at 173 5 masl and this suggests that the 3 d cvfe model does not capture the source of driving hydraulic head and concentration generated by this feature see further discussion below due to the sensitivity of the profile to small changes in the fracture network and the countless possible fracture geometries the primary goal was to match the overall shape of the profile at the greatest number of times simultaneously and not to achieve a perfect fit at every point most of the discrepancies observed were thus not considered important to the overall fit e g the differences between measured at simulated curves at 2 4 h the late time concentration peaks at 184 masl and at the base of the eramosa were particularly anomalous however these were caused by solute entering the well through the fractures at 173 5 179 5 and 182 masl and being pushed outwards to the edges of the well allowed by the small but present hydraulic conductivity of the matrix in these regions once there the mass was unable to leave the well because the regional gradient responsible for flow and transport near the well boundaries was simply too low the reason for this issue arising in the model but not in the measured data suggests that the hydraulic conductivity in the matrix was lower in these locations than used in the model variation of the vertical fracture properties vertical gradients and matrix properties discussed in the methods section 2 5 were unable to achieve a comparable fit to the data and were mostly unable to achieve a significant amount of vertical spreading in the well also note that no matter the combination of parameters the peaks observed fig 8 were also present in these models this highlights the need to use the well model to sort out the fluxes and assist in the interpretation of the 3 d cvfe model calculation of reynolds numbers and inertial effects using the velocities estimated in the horizontal fractures and the methods provided in quinn et al 2011b suggested that turbulence played little role if any in conclusion the addition of fractures at locations indicated by the well model combined with aperture heterogeneity different values of mean aperture was best able to explain the measured concentrations overall the conceptual model produced from this was of a series of six poorly connected horizontal fractures with varying amounts of aperture heterogeneity through the variation of parameters discussed in the methods the properties of the rock matrix while potentially more important in experiments with longer timespans or under natural gradient were not found to be particularly influential on the results of this experiment a further experiment where advection is less dominant i e natural conditions would be required to better understand the importance of the matrix there are still issues of non uniqueness with the exact parameter values used in particular for the fracture apertures numerous fits could be achieved through different combinations however like with the well model the overall conceptual model did not change significantly with these arrangements the model which achieved the closest fit at borehole 56 was also used to simulate breakthrough at other wells used in the experiment simulated concentrations similar to measured concentrations were observed at borehole 73 which was at 116 m distance from the injection well fig 9 the addition of a first order decay parameter to simulate a small amount 2 10 6 s 1 of dye loss possibly caused by vertical spreading of the tracer along the fracture network to regions outside the measurement domain was also helpful in simulating the experiment at later times for this larger distance at borehole 71 there was no simulated breakthrough which corroborates the lack of breakthrough observed in the well after correcting for background fluorescence the resulting conceptual model derived from the simulations is considered consistent with the well model in both 5 6 fractures are needed to explain the results of the tracer experiment furthermore the positions of these fractures are essentially identical while the apertures of the 173 5 m and 179 5 masl fractures in the cvfe model might be smaller than that of the others they remain the most important fractures for solute transport due to their apparent connection to the injection well in both models the fracture at 175 178 masl observed in constant head tests was not necessary to explain measured concentrations the most significant difference between this model and the well model was that the fracture at 184 masl had a net positive flux in the well model but not in the cvfe model in both models however the flux was small relative to that of other fractures so the influence was likely negligible the differences between the model and the measured constant head test data are more significant while the apertures of the fractures are reasonable based on the ranges provided in table 1 and the positions of most fractures are similar the constant head tests indicated that the fractures at 9 5 masl and 12 masl may not be connected to the injection well unless through unknown vertically connected pathways it was not possible however to recreate the measured profile without these connections further the two fractures added at the bottom of the model needed to be significantly larger than what was observed in the observation wells where they were present it is possible that the one fracture measured at 171 174 masl was actually two fractures in wells where it was observed there were multiple adjacent test intervals with similar transmissivities e g boreholes 58 and 59 in fig 2 the explanation for this was initially thought to be inadvertent overlap in the tests but it is also possible that more than one conductive fracture was present however the maximum aperture for the measured feature was approximately 400 μm which is less than half the aperture used in the model differences between apertures determined from tracer experiments and those from hydraulic tests have been observed and discussed extensively in the literature before cady et al 1993 hjerne et al 2010 silliman 1989 tsang 1992 zheng et al 2008 therefore discrepancies between the aperture determined from this analysis and that measured in constant head tests could be expected overall from the cvfe model of the tracer experiment it was possible to corroborate which fractures were important to solute transport their positions and relative importance furthermore while it was not possible to completely explain the experiment with a numerical model due to the difficulty of fitting a complex concentration profile at numerous times with a single model a better understanding of transport processes at this site was obtained from this analysis differing values of aperture between primary horizontal fractures rather than vertical connections between the horizontal fractures was indicated to be an essential factor to explaining the tortuous transport patterns that have been observed at this site thus it can be concluded that experiments conducted in open boreholes using downhole fluorometers can inform conceptual models of transport processes in sparsely fractured rock 4 conclusions in this study we used two numerical models to analyze the results of a unique network scale tracer experiment conducted in a silurian dolostone near smithville ontario the purpose was to obtain discrete fracture properties from the experiment which was conducted using open boreholes with concentrations obtained using a downhole fluorometer the first simulations were conducted using a finite difference model of one observation well which represented flow and transport through the well and nodal net fluxes accounting for solute additions to or subtractions from the well the second set of simulations was conducted using a control volume finite element model which simulated transport between the injection and observation wells through a series of discretely formulated fractures coupled with a porous matrix in a three dimensional domain from the results of this modelling the following conclusions were drawn a fit to the experimental data could be achieved using the well model having 5 6 fractures intersecting the borehole wall a 3 d control volume finite element model which was consistent with the configuration of the well model could also fit much of the measured profile through the analyses presented in this paper we were able to identify the most important horizontal fractures for transporting aqueous contaminants to the observation wells the use of both models together with the one data set helped constrain the conceptual model for transport in the fracture network based on the models presented in this paper it appears much more likely that heterogeneity in fracture aperture within and between primary horizontal fractures as opposed to vertical fracture connections between horizontal fractures is the most important factor in explaining observed tortuosity non uniqueness in model fits made it extremely difficult to constrain exact parameter values such as the fracture aperture for the different fractures consistent with previous studies only limited agreement between the transport carrying fractures as determined from the present analysis and those that would be predicted from the results of constant head tests are observed overall this study indicates that tracer experiments conducted in open boreholes with the use of a downhole fluorometer can provide useful information for large scale transport because of the difficulty in interpreting breakthroughs at distances of over 100 m and because it was not possible to fit the entire profile using the control volume finite element model this experimental setup may be best used in conjunction with other investigation techniques in this study the loss of solute with distance effectively limited the distances that could be studied to little more than 50 m larger scale experiments remain necessary to better understand transport at scales relevant to the field note that the source tracer concentration was limited to 150 mg l increasing this value by an order of magnitude would be possible without introducing significant density effects and would significantly increase the potentially observable transport distance furthermore as this study involved a forced gradient tracer experiment there are issues surrounding how representative the results are of the natural environment for example the importance of matrix diffusion was difficult to determine due to the high flow rate and short timeframe of the experiment a natural gradient experiment would be required to make further conclusions on this subject declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

1374,the uncontrolled release of methane from natural gas wells may pose risks to shallow groundwater resources numerical modeling of methane migration from deep hydrocarbon formations towards shallow

demand recent studies have shown that fracking is associated with potential environmental impacts taherdangkoo et al 2019 vengosh et al 2014 warner et al 2012 the risks on water resources are of particular concerns attributed to significant amounts of water withdrawal and consumption and water contamination due to surface spills and wellbore integrity issues rice et al 2018a rosa et al 2018 vengosh et al 2014 a key concern is upward migration of natural gas from deep hydrocarbon production zones to groundwater aquifers or surface waters gas leakage may lead to regional groundwater quality degradation as persistent long term leakage may lead to millions of kilograms of methane to be transported to shallow groundwater systems rice et al 2018b taherdangkoo et al 2020a natural gas is comprised mainly of methane with traces of ethane and propane the leaking methane exists largely as a gas phase with limited concentrations of water vapor and is dissolved in the aqueous phase methane dissolves progressively in the aqueous phase depending on salinity and gas phase pressure until an equilibrium is reached from the aqueous phase water evaporates into the gas phase depending on temperature duan et al 1992 rice et al 2018b the gas phase methane migrates from a leakage source to a shallow aquifer by the upward buoyancy while the dissolved methane migrates more slowly via

the vle models have general applications peng and robinson 1976 redlich and kwong 1949 while others are parameterized for the methane water salt system duan and mao 2006 duan et al 1992 spivey et al 2004 the predictive performance of the available vle models depend on the complexity of physical equations complex vle models allow to accurately determine the phase equilibrium of certain substances within their ranges of conditions nayar et al 2016 for example duan and mao 2006 model is able to determine methane solubility and gas phase composition of the methane water salt system with sufficient accuracy numerical modeling of methane migration from deep hydrocarbon formations towards shallow systems is complex as multiphase multi component processes and various hydrogeological conditions need to be considered such models are computationally expensive and time consuming in particular for the large scale domains the complex vle models usually contribute a significant portion of the overall simulation run times due to their dependencies on various empirical parameters the complexity of vle models potentially compromises their efficient implementation in numerical modeling

received significant attention in the machine learning community for applications including model approximation multivariate regression and experiment design rasmussen 2004 yuan et al 2008 the advantage of gpr over other ml techniques lies in its seamless integration of various tasks parameter estimation model training and uncertainty estimation aye and heyns 2017 sun et al 2014 many

and mao 2006 models the leverage method was utilized to examine the quality of the dataset and define the applicability realm of the gpr model 2 methodology 2 1 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a non parametric kernel based machine learning method built on statistical learning and bayesian theory williams and rasmussen 1995 a kernel i e covariance function describes the covariance of the gaussian random variable and together with the mean function completely defines a gaussian process one of the most important advantages of the gpr is the ability to generalize well especially when dealing with small sets of data carl edward rasmussen 1997 the motivation for employing a gpr model is based on the findings of previous studies as the availability of experimental data of methane water content is limited a gpr model assumes that an output y satisfies the following equation ceylan 2020 kopsiaftis et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 1 y f x ξ where f x is the underlying function x is the training inputs x is the test inputs and ξ n 0 σ 2 the error variance σ 2 is estimated from the input data the priori distribution of the output y the prior joint distribution of the observed value y and the predicted value y can be defined as below 2 y n 0 k x x σ 2 i 3 y y n 0 k x x σ 2 i k x x k x x k x x n k k t k k where k k ij is the covariance kernel matrix of the training set where its elements measure the correlation between x i and x j through a kernel function k k is the covariance matrix between the testing and training sets and k is the covariance matrix of the testing set k t is the transposed of the matrix k and i is the identity matrix the posterior distribution of y can be obtained as 4 y y n y σ y 2 5 y k k 1 y 6 σ y 2 k k k 1 k

exp 3 r σ l where r x i x j t x i x j is the euclidean distance between x i and x j the characteristic length scale σ l and the signal standard deviation σ f are the hyper parameters the gpr model was implemented in matlab 2020b the 5 fold cross validation method is used to improve the robustness of the training gpr model and avoid overfitting 2 2 bayesian optimization hyper parameters directly affect the behavior of the training gpr and have a significant impact on the performance of the model being trained hutter et al 2019 the hyper parameters of the gpr were tuned using the bayesian

data points which differ significantly from the bulk of the data in a dataset is of particular importance in the development of mathematical models the leverage statistical method was applied to determine the applicability domain of the gpr model and detect outliers which might influence the regression model rousseeuw and leroy 2005 the implementation procedure of the leverage method consists of calculation of standardized residuals sr determination of the hat matrix and sketching the williams plot the standardized residuals represent deviations of predictions from experimental values the hat values are the diagonal elements of the hat matrix indicating high leverage data points the hat matrix can be written as follows hoaglin and welsch 1978 10 h x x t x 1 x t where x is an n k matrix n is the number of data points k is the model parameters and x t is the transposed of the matrix x the critical leverage value h is calculated as 3n p 1 where p is the number of input parameters of the model the points within 3 standard deviation from the mean are accepted to ensure covering 99 of normally distributed data mohammadi et al 2012 2 4 thermodynamic models many thermodynamic models and empirical correlations charts are available for predicting water content of natural gases thermodynamic models are usually complex and able to predict phase behavior of a system when conditions fall within their applicability domain the performance of the gpr model is compared with the ideal model bukacek 1955 mohammadi et al 2004b and duan and mao 2006 each thermodynamic model uses a different unit system for instance the bukacek 1955 model uses american engineering units herein we present each thermodynamic model in its original form 1 the ideal model raoult s law is the simplest thermodynamic model to estimate the water content of gases mohammadi et al 2004a 2004b and carroll 2002 suggested that the ideal model can be used at low pressure conditions following these researches the accuracy of the ideal model was tested for pressures lower than 14 bar this model can be written as 11 y w 1 x g p w sat p where y w is the mole fraction of water in the gas phase xg is the mole fraction of methane in the liquid phase calculated using duan and mao 2006 correlation p mpa is the total pressure of the system and p w sat mpa is water pressure at the saturation condition obtained from the correlation of wagner and pruss 1993 2 bukacek 1955 model is similar to the ideal model and determines the water content based on temperature total pressure and water pressure at the saturation condition this model may not describe real phase behavior in water hydrocarbon systems at low temperature conditions and is applicable at temperatures ranging from 288 15 to 511 15 k and the total pressures between 1 and 690 bar carroll 2002 carroll 2020 mohammadi et al 2004b the bukacek model has been widely used in the petroleum industry to estimate water content of dry and sweet natural gases the model can be written as below in american engineering units 12 y w 47484 p w sat p b 13 log b 3083 87 459 6 t 6 69449 where y w lb mmscf 1 is water content in the gas phase and t f is temperature p w sat is calculated using wagner and pruss 1993 correlation 3 mohammadi et al 2004b model is a semi empirical approach to calculate the water content of natural gases based on the fugacity coefficient of water in the gas phase temperature and pressure this model is valid for temperatures between 273 15 and 377 59 k and pressures up to 138 1 bar the methane water content can be calculated as follows 14 y w 1 x g p w sat w p exp v w l p p w sat rt where w is the fugacity coefficient of water in the gas phase t f is temperature and r 10 731 psi ft 3 lbmol 1 r 1 is the universal gas constant xg is calculated using duan and mao 2006 correlation p w sat mpa and v w l cf lbmol 1 are obtained from daubert and danner 1985 and mccain jr 1990 correlations respectively 4 duan and mao 2006 model is a semi empirical approach to estimate the water content of methane at temperatures from 273 to 523 k and pressures from 1 to 2000 bar the methane water content can be calculated using the following equation 15 y w x w p w sat w p exp v w l p p w sat rt where x w is the mole fraction of water in the liquid and equals 1 for the ch4 h2o system all parameters are in si unit p w sat and v w l are calculated using shibue 2003 and wagner and pruss 1993 correlations 3 data acquisition the experimental data of water content of methane gas in equilibrium with the liquid water are limited and often dispersed the complied dataset contains a total of 180 data entries collected from reported experimental data chapoy et al 2003 chapoy et al 2005 folas et al 2007 frost et al 2014 kosyakov et al 1982 mohammadi et al 2004a 2004b olds et al 1942 rigby and prausnitz 1968 yarymagaev et al 1985 table 1 summarizes the statistical evaluation of input and output parameters the temperature is in the range of 243 15 and 633 2 k and pressure ranges from 4 91 to 1132 7 bar the water content in the gas phase is a function of pressure and temperature and varies widely over the range of conditions covered here the distribution of the parameter values in terms of histogram and scatter plots is depicted in fig 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction of methane water content by the gpr model the scatter plot of the calculated water content of methane versus the experimental values for the gpr model is depicted in fig 2 where accumulation of majority of data points close to the unit slope line indicate the high accommodation between the model predictions and experimental ones the statistical indexes including the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared errors mse and mean absolute deviation mad reveal the accuracy and robustness of the model the r2 value equals 0 981 mse and mad values are 3 127 10 7 and 3 403 10 4 respectively the optimum values obtained for hyper parameters of the matérn 3 2 kernel were as the characteristic length scale equal to 5 076 and the signal standard deviation equal to 0 000646 the response plot of the gpr is depicted in fig 3 the trend learned by the model is fully consistent with water content behaviors observed in experimental studies e g chapoy et al 2003 and folas et al 2007 a well accordance between experimental values and model predictions of methane water content is achieved in particular when the water content of methane gas is below 0 015 mole fraction as illustrated in fig 1 only several data points have water content values of above 0 015 mole fraction therefore the trained gpr faces difficulties in predicting experimental data under such conditions the histogram plot representing the frequency of residuals deviations of the values predicted by the proposed model from experimental measurements is depicted in fig 4 the residuals follow a normal distribution near zero mean indicating therefore the outstanding performance of the model 4 2 comparing the gpr model with thermodynamic models the predictive ability of the gpr model was compared with four thermodynamic models i e ideal model bukacek 1955 mohammadi et al 2004b and duan and mao 2006 models to ensure the fairness of the comparison analysis the data points falling within the applicability domain of each thermodynamic model were considered for example we only used 33 datapoints to analyze the predictive performance of the idea model as 33 datapoints are available at the applicability range of this model i e pressure below 14 bar the scatter plots of the thermodynamic models are presented in fig 5 the ideal model is a simple tool able to accurately predict the water content of methane at low pressure conditions also suggested by carroll 2020 the bukacek model is not able to accurately describe the real phase behavior in the water methane system as compared to complex thermodynamic models especially at high pressure conditions aimikhe and adeyemi 2019 suggested that this model performs better in the lower pressure conditions of 10 and 25 bar our analysis confirms that the predictive ability of the bukacek model is higher at low pressure conditions the predictions of mohammadi et al 2004b model and duan and mao 2006 model show an excellent agreement with the experimental data both of these models are complex depending on various empirical parameters in general complex thermodynamic models are able to describe the phase behavior of water gas systems with a high degree of accuracy duan and mao 2006 model calculates the water pressure at the saturation condition and the molar volume of liquid water by shibue 2003 and wagner and pruss 1993 correlations respectively while mohammadi et al 2004b respectively calculates these parameters using daubert and danner 1985 and mccain jr 1990 correlations duan and mao 2006 model is valid over a wider range of conditions as compared to the mohammadi et al 2004b model our analysis indicates that the duan and mao 2006 model is more accurate to determine the water content of methane statistical comparison between the gpr and thermodynamic models are presented in table 2 the analysis shows that duan and mao 2006 model is the most accurate model for predicting water content of methane gas having the highest r2 value and the lowest mse and mad values but also the gpr model reaches acceptable results when compared to the other models although the predictive accuracy of the gpr is slightly lower than duan and mao 2006 model the developed model is less complex facilitating its application for numerical modeling of methane transport in the subsurface environment 4 3 applicability domain of the gpr model the leverage method was employed to identify the applicability realm of the gpr model william s plot was sketched on the basis of the calculated standardized residuals and hat values for outputs obtained from the gpr model

1374,the uncontrolled release of methane from natural gas wells may pose risks to shallow groundwater resources numerical modeling of methane migration from deep hydrocarbon formations towards shallow systems requires knowledge of phase behavior of the water methane system usually calculated by classic thermodynamic approaches this study presents a gaussian process regression gpr model to estimate

10 7 and r2 of 0 981 furthermore the analysis showed that the gpr model exhibits an acceptable performance comparing with the well known thermodynamic models the gpr predicts the water content of methane over widespread ranges of pressure and temperature with a degree of accuracy needed for typical subsurface engineering applications keywords methane water content machine learning phase equilibrium gaussian process regression 1 introduction shale hydrocarbon extraction using directional drilling and fracking plays an essential role in meeting the exponential increase of global energy demand recent studies have shown that fracking is associated with potential environmental impacts taherdangkoo et al 2019 vengosh et al 2014 warner et al 2012 the risks on water resources are of particular concerns attributed to significant amounts of water withdrawal and consumption and water contamination due to surface spills and wellbore integrity issues rice et al 2018a rosa et al 2018 vengosh et al 2014 a key concern is upward migration of natural gas from deep hydrocarbon production zones to groundwater aquifers or surface waters gas leakage may lead to regional groundwater quality degradation as persistent long term leakage may lead to millions of kilograms of methane to be transported to shallow groundwater systems rice et al 2018b taherdangkoo et al 2020a natural gas is comprised mainly of methane with traces of ethane and propane the leaking methane exists largely as a gas phase with limited concentrations of water vapor and is dissolved in the aqueous phase methane dissolves progressively in the aqueous phase depending on salinity and gas phase pressure until an equilibrium is reached from the aqueous phase water evaporates into the gas phase depending on temperature duan et al 1992 rice et al 2018b the gas phase methane migrates from a leakage source to a shallow aquifer by the upward buoyancy while the dissolved methane migrates more slowly via groundwater flow cahill et al 2018 taherdangkoo et al 2020a previous modeling studies of water quality impacts associated with hydrocarbon development have employed multi phase flow models to simulate methane migration from the deep subsurface to freshwater aquifers along permeable pathways cahill et al 2018 kissinger et al 2013 schout et al 2020 taherdangkoo et al 2020a accurate measurement or estimation of multiphase parameters are needed for modeling fluid flow and transport processes to determine methane migration to shallow layers and assess an aquifer vulnerability to a gas leakage problem rice et al 2018b thermodynamic empirical paradigms and correlations have been developed for describing phase equilibrium or vapor liquid equilibrium vle between gas and liquid phases some of the vle models have general applications peng and robinson 1976 redlich and kwong 1949 while others are parameterized for the methane water salt system duan and mao 2006 duan et al 1992 spivey et al 2004 the predictive performance of the available vle models depend on the complexity of physical equations complex vle models allow to accurately determine the phase equilibrium of certain substances within their ranges of conditions nayar et al 2016 for example duan and mao 2006 model is able to determine methane solubility and gas phase composition of the methane water salt system with sufficient accuracy numerical modeling of methane migration from deep hydrocarbon formations towards shallow systems is complex as multiphase multi component processes and various hydrogeological conditions need to be considered such models are computationally expensive and time consuming in particular for the large scale domains the complex vle models usually contribute a significant portion of the overall simulation run times due to their dependencies on various empirical parameters the complexity of vle models potentially compromises their efficient implementation in numerical modeling frameworks grunwald et al 2020 other vle models with the advantage of calculation simplicity either are not sufficiently accurate or have limited applicability domain duan and mao 2006 machine learning ml has proved to have abilities to provide inexpensive and reliable solutions to hydrogeological problems with various degrees of complexity sit et al 2020 taherdangkoo et al 2020b tahmasebi et al 2020 moreover different optimization techniques can be employed to optimize parameters controlling the learning process and thus improving performance of ml models mohammadi and richon 2007 presented an artificial neural network model for estimating water content of natural gases employing 95 data points despite the acceptable performance shown by this model it is only valid over a limited range of conditions as a small dataset was employed for the model development recently taherdangkoo et al 2021 presented a boosted regression tree model as an alternative approach to estimate solubility of methane gas in aquatic systems over widespread ranges of pressure temperature and ionic strength zhang and xu 2020 developed a least squares boosting model to determine solubility of supercritical carbon dioxide in ionic liquids gaussian process regression gpr is a bayesian learning algorithm originally formulated by rasmussen and his coworkers williams and rasmussen 1995 gpr has received significant attention in the machine learning community for applications including model approximation multivariate regression and experiment design rasmussen 2004 yuan et al 2008 the advantage of gpr over other ml techniques lies in its seamless integration of various tasks parameter estimation model training and uncertainty estimation aye and heyns 2017 sun et al 2014 many researches have already employed the gpr to address complex issues in hydrogeology for instance li et al 2017 applied the gpr algorithm to estimate water inflow during tunnel construction in a karst area zhang and xu 2021 used gpr models to predict adsorption energies of methane related species ch3 ch2 ch c and h on cu based alloys this work presents a gpr model as an alternative approach to determine water content of methane gas the gpr model was implemented using an experimental dataset collected from literature bayesian optimization is employed to tune hyper parameters of the gpr model to assess the accuracy of the model the predictions were compared with experimental data as well as thermodynamic models i e the ideal model raoult s law bukacek 1955 mohammadi et al 2004b and duan and mao 2006 models the leverage method was utilized to examine the quality of the dataset and define the applicability realm of the gpr model 2 methodology 2 1 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a non parametric kernel based machine learning method built on statistical learning and bayesian theory williams and rasmussen 1995 a kernel i e covariance function describes the covariance of the gaussian random variable and together with the mean function completely defines a gaussian process one of the most important advantages of the gpr is the ability to generalize well especially when dealing with small sets of data carl edward rasmussen 1997 the motivation for employing a gpr model is based on the findings of previous studies as the availability of experimental data of methane water content is limited a gpr model assumes that an output y satisfies the following equation ceylan 2020 kopsiaftis et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 1 y f x ξ where f x is the underlying function x is the training inputs x is the test inputs and ξ n 0 σ 2 the error variance σ 2 is estimated from the input data the priori distribution of the output y the prior joint distribution of the observed value y and the predicted value y can be defined as below 2 y n 0 k x x σ 2 i 3 y y n 0 k x x σ 2 i k x x k x x k x x n k k t k k where k k ij is the covariance kernel matrix of the training set where its elements measure the correlation between x i and x j through a kernel function k k is the covariance matrix between the testing and training sets and k is the covariance matrix of the testing set k t is the transposed of the matrix k and i is the identity matrix the posterior distribution of y can be obtained as 4 y y n y σ y 2 5 y k k 1 y 6 σ y 2 k k k 1 k t the proper selection of the kernel function is critical in a gpr model the common kernel functions are the squared exponential rational quadratic and matérn kernels we tested all three kernel functions to obtain the optimal gpr model the best model predictions were obtained using the matérn 3 2 kernel which can be written as follows rasmussen and williams 2006 7 k x i x j θ σ f 2 1 3 r σ l exp 3 r σ l where r x i x j t x i x j is the euclidean distance between x i and x j the characteristic length scale σ l and the signal standard deviation σ f are the hyper parameters the gpr model was implemented in matlab 2020b the 5 fold cross validation method is used to improve the robustness of the training gpr model and avoid overfitting 2 2 bayesian optimization hyper parameters directly affect the behavior of the training gpr and have a significant impact on the performance of the model being trained hutter et al 2019 the hyper parameters of the gpr were tuned using the bayesian optimization algorithm bayesian optimization is a class of machine learning based optimization methods able to solve computationally expensive functions the algorithm searches to find the global minimum of f x written as below bull 2011 snoek et al 2012 8 x argmin f x x a where f x is an objective function and a is the search space of x i e set of hyper parameters the key elements for performing bayesian optimization are i a gaussian process model of f x ii a bayesian procedure for updating the gaussian process model of f x at each new evaluation and iii an acquisition function a x that defines the new point x to be evaluated this work employs the expected improvement acquisition function expected improvement evaluates f x at the point x that the highest improvement upon f the minimal value of f observed so far is expected this corresponds to the following function bull 2011 mockus 2012 9 a x max 0 f f x 2 3 leverage statistical method the identification of outliers i e data points which differ significantly from the bulk of the data in a dataset is of particular importance in the development of mathematical models the leverage statistical method was applied to determine the applicability domain of the gpr model and detect outliers which might influence the regression model rousseeuw and leroy 2005 the implementation procedure of the leverage method consists of calculation of standardized residuals sr determination of the hat matrix and sketching the williams plot the standardized residuals represent deviations of predictions from experimental values the hat values are the diagonal elements of the hat matrix indicating high leverage data points the hat matrix can be written as follows hoaglin and welsch 1978 10 h x x t x 1 x t where x is an n k matrix n is the number of data points k is the model parameters and x t is the transposed of the matrix x the critical leverage value h is calculated as 3n p 1 where p is the number of input parameters of the model the points within 3 standard deviation from the mean are accepted to ensure covering 99 of normally distributed data mohammadi et al 2012 2 4 thermodynamic models many thermodynamic models and empirical correlations charts are available for predicting water content of natural gases thermodynamic models are usually complex and able to predict phase behavior of a system when conditions fall within their applicability domain the performance of the gpr model is compared with the ideal model bukacek 1955 mohammadi et al 2004b and duan and mao 2006 each thermodynamic model uses a different unit system for instance the bukacek 1955 model uses american engineering units herein we present each thermodynamic model in its original form 1 the ideal model raoult s law is the simplest thermodynamic model to estimate the water content of gases mohammadi et al 2004a 2004b and carroll 2002 suggested that the ideal model can be used at low pressure conditions following these researches the accuracy of the ideal model was tested for pressures lower than 14 bar this model can be written as 11 y w 1 x g p w sat p where y w is the mole fraction of water in the gas phase xg is the mole fraction of methane in the liquid phase calculated using duan and mao 2006 correlation p mpa is the total pressure of the system and p w sat mpa is water pressure at the saturation condition obtained from the correlation of wagner and pruss 1993 2 bukacek 1955 model is similar to the ideal model and determines the water content based on temperature total pressure and water pressure at the saturation condition this model may not describe real phase behavior in water hydrocarbon systems at low temperature conditions and is applicable at temperatures ranging from 288 15 to 511 15 k and the total pressures between 1 and 690 bar carroll 2002 carroll 2020 mohammadi et al 2004b the bukacek model has been widely used in the petroleum industry to estimate water content of dry and sweet natural gases the model can be written as below in american engineering units 12 y w 47484 p w sat p b 13 log b 3083 87 459 6 t 6 69449 where y w lb mmscf 1 is water content in the gas phase and t f is temperature p w sat is calculated using wagner and pruss 1993 correlation 3 mohammadi et al 2004b model is a semi empirical approach to calculate the water content of natural gases based on the fugacity coefficient of water in the gas phase temperature and pressure this model is valid for temperatures between 273 15 and 377 59 k and pressures up to 138 1 bar the methane water content can be calculated as follows 14 y w 1 x g p w sat w p exp v w l p p w sat rt where w is the fugacity coefficient of water in the gas phase t f is temperature and r 10 731 psi ft 3 lbmol 1 r 1 is the universal gas constant xg is calculated using duan and mao 2006 correlation p w sat mpa and v w l cf lbmol 1 are obtained from daubert and danner 1985 and mccain jr 1990 correlations respectively 4 duan and mao 2006 model is a semi empirical approach to estimate the water content of methane at temperatures from 273 to 523 k and pressures from 1 to 2000 bar the methane water content can be calculated using the following equation 15 y w x w p w sat w p exp v w l p p w sat rt where x w is the mole fraction of water in the liquid and equals 1 for the ch4 h2o system all parameters are in si unit p w sat and v w l are calculated using shibue 2003 and wagner and pruss 1993 correlations 3 data acquisition the experimental data of water content of methane gas in equilibrium with the liquid water are limited and often dispersed the complied dataset contains a total of 180 data entries collected from reported experimental data chapoy et al 2003 chapoy et al 2005 folas et al 2007 frost et al 2014 kosyakov et al 1982 mohammadi et al 2004a 2004b olds et al 1942 rigby and prausnitz 1968 yarymagaev et al 1985 table 1 summarizes the statistical evaluation of input and output parameters the temperature is in the range of 243 15 and 633 2 k and pressure ranges from 4 91 to 1132 7 bar the water content in the gas phase is a function of pressure and temperature and varies widely over the range of conditions covered here the distribution of the parameter values in terms of histogram and scatter plots is depicted in fig 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 prediction of methane water content by the gpr model the scatter plot of the calculated water content of methane versus the experimental values for the gpr model is depicted in fig 2 where accumulation of majority of data points close to the unit slope line indicate the high accommodation between the model predictions and experimental ones the statistical indexes including the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared errors mse and mean absolute deviation mad reveal the accuracy and robustness of the model the r2 value equals 0 981 mse and mad values are 3 127 10 7 and 3 403 10 4 respectively the optimum values obtained for hyper parameters of the matérn 3 2 kernel were as the characteristic length scale equal to 5 076 and the signal standard deviation equal to 0 000646 the response plot of the gpr is depicted in fig 3 the trend learned by the model is fully consistent with water content behaviors observed in experimental studies e g chapoy et al 2003 and folas et al 2007 a well accordance between experimental values and model predictions of methane water content is achieved in particular when the water content of methane gas is below 0 015 mole fraction as illustrated in fig 1 only several data points have water content values of above 0 015 mole fraction therefore the trained gpr faces difficulties in predicting experimental data under such conditions the histogram plot representing the frequency of residuals deviations of the values predicted by the proposed model from experimental measurements is depicted in fig 4 the residuals follow a normal distribution near zero mean indicating therefore the outstanding performance of the model 4 2 comparing the gpr model with thermodynamic models the predictive ability of the gpr model was compared with four thermodynamic models i e ideal model bukacek 1955 mohammadi et al 2004b and duan and mao 2006 models to ensure the fairness of the comparison analysis the data points falling within the applicability domain of each thermodynamic model were considered for example we only used 33 datapoints to analyze the predictive performance of the idea model as 33 datapoints are available at the applicability range of this model i e pressure below 14 bar the scatter plots of the thermodynamic models are presented in fig 5 the ideal model is a simple tool able to accurately predict the water content of methane at low pressure conditions also suggested by carroll 2020 the bukacek model is not able to accurately describe the real phase behavior in the water methane system as compared to complex thermodynamic models especially at high pressure conditions aimikhe and adeyemi 2019 suggested that this model performs better in the lower pressure conditions of 10 and 25 bar our analysis confirms that the predictive ability of the bukacek model is higher at low pressure conditions the predictions of mohammadi et al 2004b model and duan and mao 2006 model show an excellent agreement with the experimental data both of these models are complex depending on various empirical parameters in general complex thermodynamic models are able to describe the phase behavior of water gas systems with a high degree of accuracy duan and mao 2006 model calculates the water pressure at the saturation condition and the molar volume of liquid water by shibue 2003 and wagner and pruss 1993 correlations respectively while mohammadi et al 2004b respectively calculates these parameters using daubert and danner 1985 and mccain jr 1990 correlations duan and mao 2006 model is valid over a wider range of conditions as compared to the mohammadi et al 2004b model our analysis indicates that the duan and mao 2006 model is more accurate to determine the water content of methane statistical comparison between the gpr and thermodynamic models are presented in table 2 the analysis shows that duan and mao 2006 model is the most accurate model for predicting water content of methane gas having the highest r2 value and the lowest mse and mad values but also the gpr model reaches acceptable results when compared to the other models although the predictive accuracy of the gpr is slightly lower than duan and mao 2006 model the developed model is less complex facilitating its application for numerical modeling of methane transport in the subsurface environment 4 3 applicability domain of the gpr model the leverage method was employed to identify the applicability realm of the gpr model william s plot was sketched on the basis of the calculated standardized residuals and hat values for outputs obtained from the gpr model

from the applicability domain of the model table 3 the application of the leverage approach showed that the developed model is statistically valid moreover the obtained modeling results comply well with water content values calculated by the thermodynamic models the gpr is able to predict the water content of methane in the ranges of pressure and temperature for which the model was trained indeed this model can be applied for conditions outside of this specific region but it is subjected to the modeler s judgment whether the deviations are acceptable or not an accurate and sufficiently
