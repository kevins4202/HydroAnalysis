described the details of our water use experiments with the date variety lulu that was irrigated with groundwater at the two salinities of 5 s1 and 15 s3 ds m 1 the current paper extends this work for lulu and brings in the two new varieties khalas and shahlah therefore only salient details of the experimental set up are repeated here 2 1 study site our experiments were carried out over the years 2015 2017 at the international centre for biosaline agriculture icba 25 09 n 55 39 e 48 m a s l near dubai the date trial at icba commenced in 2001 and 2002 and considered 18 varieties with 10 being uae cultivars and the remaining eight coming from saudi arabia the 18 cultivars encompassed a wide range of tolerances to salt we have reported early results from our studies on the salt tolerant lulu an emirati cultivar here we extend the lulu analyses and add in data from the moderately salt tolerant khalas from saudi arabia and the salt intolerant shahlah from the uae the trial considers three rates of irrigation water salinity s1 5 s2 10 and s3 15 ds m 1 over several years the hourly pattern of etc was measured using the compensation heat pulse method cphm in just the two treatments s1 and s3 for each of the three varieties there were five trees of each variety in the s1 treatment and five in the s3 treatment the centre three trees of each treatment were fitted with instruments with the outer two acting as guard trees details of the use of the cphm in date palms have been described by al muaini et al 2019a the soil of the field site is a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil abdelfattah 2013 with a sand content of over 90 the date palms were all planted on an 8 x 8 m grid spacing such that there are 156 trees per hectare a weather station located at icba measured solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 2 m and rainfall the weather data were used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto using the standard fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 the transpiration of the date palms is related to et o mm d 1 through the dimensionless crop factor k c eq 1 1 etc kc eto where et c is the crop water use mm d 1 and k c is determined from the ratio of the measured daily sapflow to the reference eto here we used our measurements of etc and eto to compute the daily pattern of kc over several years for the three varieties and the two rates of irrigation water salinity 2 2 tree characteristics and date yield at the end of the 2017 growing season icba measured the date yield and date palm canopy characteristics of trunk height leaf area per tree number of branches and branch length as well we gained access to icba s records of the date yields of the three varieties across the two salinity treatments for the years of 2012 2015 inclusive 2 3 light stick a hand held light stick al muaini et al 2019a was used to record proximally the percentage of visible light being transmitted through the canopy via a series of understory transits the percentage of light intercepted at just above the surface of the desert sand as calculated from our light stick measurements provides a proxy measure of the canopy size and leaf density each transit took 30 s and encompassed the shadow areas of 3 4 trees multiple transits of 4 5 sweeps depending on sun angle were used to cover the full shadow areas of the row of the 3 4 trees in each of treatment blocks 2 4 water productivity to gain insights into the differing salt tolerances of the three varieties we sought to use a metric of the productivity of water pw kg l 1 molden 1997 developed definitions of pw in relation to the gross or net inflow of water the depleted water the process depleted water or available water we follow his definitions and approach by using the process depletion of water there is effectively no rainfall in the date growing regions of the uae such that irrigation supplies all the water for etc under law 5 the suggested rate of irrigation for dates is 1 5 etc to cover a factor of safety and salt leaching so molden s 1997 inflow pw would be 1 5 times the process depletion pw thus in our case molden s 1997 definition of the process depletion pw is simply based on the depletion of etc the transpiration since soil water evaporation can be ignored in this hyper arid desert this then is the same as viets 1962 definition of the crop productivity per unit of water consumed in transpiration for clarity and efficiency of communication perry 2007 we use the term consumed water productivity cwp kg dates l 1 this is defined as the annual yield y kg dates divided by the annual amount of consumed water etc l the cwp is essentially a reciprocal form of the water footprint wf l kg 1 hoekstra et al 2011 elsewhere we have quantified the green blue and grey wfs of date production to assess the environmental impacts of date production the value of groundwater for irrigation and the benefit cost ratio of using desalinated water for irrigating dates al muaini et al 2019b here however we seek to use the inverse metric of cwp to understand better the differences in the biophysical performances of the three varieties in relation to their tolerances to irrigation water salinity 3 results and discussion we first describe the impact of the two rates of irrigation water salinity on the canopy characteristics and date yield for the three varieties and then proceed to discuss the temporal pattern and values of the kc values for the varieties we then show it is possible to predict kc from proximal measurements of li we conclude with a discussion of how the cwp can provide a metric of the salt tolerance for the three varieties 3 1 tree characteristics and date yield the increase in salinity stunted the height of the date palms with reductions of 33 34 and 43 for lulu khalas and shahlah respectively between treatments s1 and s3 table 1 there were similar reductions in the other canopy characteristics of the palm trees as listed in table 1 the date yield reductions between treatments s1 and s3 were 29 43 and 52 for the varieties lulu khalas and shahlah and as expected they were in the order of their presumed salt tolerance 3 2 tree water use and the crop factors the year to year variation in the weather in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi is very small there is an absence of significant rain with the number of rain days or even cloudy days being very small given this lack of year to year variability we present our multi year results for the daily values of etc and kc in figs 1 6 on single graphs using day of year doy as the abscissa there are some gaps in our daily etc measurement records caused by the inevitable equipment failures as expected from sensitive electronic devices operating in such a harsh desert environment however these gaps do not limit our ability to gain understanding of the palms water use dynamics interactions with the prevailing weather and an assessment of the impact of the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation in the graphs of the seasonal pattern of etc figs 1 6 because of the different tree sizes and leaf areas the daily rates of water use vary greatly in each graph we wish to show the coherence between etc and eto so the left hand ordinate axis is scaled for each graph to show how etc tracked the seasonal pattern in eto the units of both axes are mm d 1 and to convert the tree water use measured by sap flow in l d 1 to mm d 1 we used the tree spacing of 8 x 8 m the largest left hand axis is for shahlah s1 where etc peaked at over 4 mm d 1 and the smallest was for khalas s3 where the peak etc was just 1 75 mm d 1 the data for the graphs of kc used the quotient of measured etc eto and all the ordinate axes range from 0 to 0 5 3 2 1 lulu the patterns of etc and kc for the salt tolerant lulu s1 treatment are shown in fig 1 whereas the peak eto was about 12 mm d 1 the peak etc was just 4 mm d 1 there is a coherence between the two traces albeit with some deviations due to various challenges in maintaining the correct rates of irrigation at 1 5 etc the trace of kc in fig 1 revealed a slight rise in kc late in the year which we consider to be due to a seasonal growth of leaf area in autumn the average daily kc for lulu s1 was 0 31 0 05 table 2 the etc and kc results for lulu s3 are shown in fig 2 and the rates of water use were just under about half of those of the s1 treatment with the average kc being 0 17 0 03 table 2 again there was a rise in kc in late october and now a drop in kc can be seen over the first two months of the year this period is when the date fruit are filling however it would seem that in both salinity treatments assuming a seasonally constant kc is reasonable at least for practical purposes the annual rates of water use were 50 kl tree 1 for the s1 trees and 28 4 kl tree 1 for s3 table 2 a drop of 43 3 2 2 khalas the khalas trees are smaller table 1 and have a lower leaf area table 2 than the equivalent lulu trees their rates of etc were correspondingly less figs 3 and 4 within the variability resulting from difficulties with irrigation management the rates of etc tracked eto the annual average kc values for the khalas trees were 0 26 0 05 for s1 and 0 14 0 03 for s3 and both traces also showed a slight four month long peak in kc during winter the total annual water use values by the khalas trees were 43 1 kl tree 1 s1 and 23 2 kl tree 1 s3 a drop of 46 table 2 3 2 3 shahlah the salt intolerant shahlah s1 trees had the largest leaf area per tree table 2 whereas the s3 trees had the smallest leaf area per tree of all trees the seasonal patterns of etc and kc were similar to those of the other two varieties fig 5 and 6 the s1 kc was 0 35 0 05 the largest of all treatments whereas the kc of the s3 treatment was 0 19 0 05 table 2 we sought to see if it were possible to predict kc values through use of proximal sensing of the fractional light interception li using a light stick 3 3 light interception and the crop factor on day of year doy 260 in 2015 19 september an intensive campaign of li measurements was undertaken using the light stick under the canopies of all six plots of the trees of the three varieties at the two salinities this date was chosen to provide detailed observations of li at that time of year in autumn when the crop factor kc was close to the annual average value figs 1 4 we have already published the li results for lulu al muaini et al 2019a and they were 0 26 0 05 for the s1 treatment and 0 20 0 03 for s3 table 2 here in figs 7 and 8 we present the results for khalas and shahlah at the two salinities the transits with the light stick shown in figs 7 and 8 were used to compute the respective li values for khalas the values of li were found to be 0 31 0 05 for s1 and 0 19 0 04 for s3 table 2 the corresponding values for shahlah were 0 34 0 08 and 0 18 0 03 o connell et al 2008 and goodwin et al 2015 found the ratio kc li 1 to be 1 1 2 for apples and pears al muaini et al 2018 reported using a different kc data set for lulu that the lulu kc li 1 was 1 1 1 our revised lulu values provide corroboration the values of kc li 1 for khalas and shahlah were very similar table 2 on average for all varieties and salinity treatments the mean kc li 1 was 0 95 that this value is not too dissimilar to the values for apples and pears would seem to be a measure of how well adapted the date palms are to this hot and saline environment for given their interception of radiant energy they could still maintain reasonable rates of transpiration despite the heat and salinity in contrast al yamani et al 2019a found much lower ratios for the xerophytic and halophytic arid forest species of al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr zizphus spina christi with kc li 1 being 0 4 0 6 al yamani et al 2019b they found kc li 1 to be just 0 1 for the hardy and woody xerophytic al samr tree acacia tortilis the values of kc li 1 we have found here for three date varieties did not show any difference in relation to their respective degrees of salt tolerance this is convenient for being able to predict kc and hence etc from proximal measurements of li for irrigation scheduling and implementation of law 5 we have recommended that irrigation be applied daily at 1 5 etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction al muaini et al 2019a by use of this characterisation that kc li 1 is 0 95 for dates it will be possible to use the light stick to extend the li results from these 8 x 8 m plantings to commercial farms with different tree spacings and varying tree canopy characteristics to predict the kc however the differing salt tolerances of these date varieties means that in terms of date yield there will be differing economic returns from the date trees and the economic values derived for irrigation water will be different between varieties and will differ according to the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation therefore we sought to find a metric that would characterise the value of irrigation to date production in relation to water salinity 3 4 consumed water productivity and salt tolerance as indicated above we considered the consumed water use cwp to be etc and the annual values of etc are reproduced in table 3 along with the respective date yields y the computed cwp revealed an interesting pattern with salinity by variety table 3 whereas between treatments s1 and s3 the drop in etc was 43 46 for all varieties there were clear differences in the drop in yield the percentage loss in yield between s1 and s3 was just 29 for lulu and 43 for khalas and 52 for the salt intolerant shahlah in terms of the ratio of the s3 value of cwp to the cwp for s1 for lulu it was greater than one being 1 24 so despite the drop in water use the salt tolerant lulu was still able to maintain a reasonable productivity of dates for the moderately tolerant khalas the ratio was unity since water use and date production declined in equal proportion for the salt intolerant shahlah the cwp dropped from 1 5 to 1 34 kg dates kl 1 as the salinity rose from 5 to 15 ds m 1 the cwp metric provides a useful measure to characterise the salt tolerance of date cultivars furthermore the cwp could be rephrased in economic terms molden 1997 say by using the date price in uae dirhams dhs per kilogram one uae dhs is currently worth us 0 27 february 2019 this analysis provides an economic measure of the value of the groundwater being used for irrigating the dates in dhs kl 1 as a function of salinity al muaini et al 2019b considered the current price for dates to be dhs 10 per kilogram february 2019 so the cwp column in table 3 would be in dhs kl 1 if multiplied by 10 this could be used to demonstrate the value of groundwater as related to salinity and cultivar such an economic assessment could be carried out for a wider range of date varieties through determination of etc using proximal measures of li and from data on date yields by variety and groundwater salinity nonetheless beyond this simple valuation of water it is important to note that for the date grower farm gross margin zekri et al 2010 will be dominated by the date price dhs kg 1 multiplied by the absolute yield y kg not the value of the water as the ratio of dhs kl 1 but it is interesting in passing to compare this computed value of groundwater which is of the order of 10 20 dhs kl 1 with the cost of desalinating brackish groundwater which is 5 5 dhs kl 1 al muaini et al 2019b 4 conclusions through direct measurements using devices to measure sap flow we have quantified the etc of three date varieties irrigated with water at two salinities 5 and 15 ds m 1 from these results we calculated the respective kc values so that the trees water use etc could be predicted from the reference evapotranspiration eto by proximal sensing using a light stick we measured the fraction of light intercepted li by the trees canopies as a function of variety and salinity the ratio kc li 1 was about 0 95 which enables proximal sensing via a light stick to be used to predict etc for all varieties and both salinities these predictions will then be able to be used to schedule irrigation at the recommended rate of 1 5 etc accounting for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction whereas the drop in etc across all varieties was 43 46 between the 5 and 15 ds m 1 irrigation treatments there were large differences in the drop in date production by variety date production between s1 and s3 dropped just 29 for lulu 43 for khalas and 52 for shahlah the consumed water productivity cwp kg dates kl 1 provides a metric of the varying degrees of salt tolerance for the salt tolerant lulu the cwp for s3 was higher 2 21 kg dates kl 1 than that for s1 1 78 kg dates kl 1 although production was higher with s1 89 1 kg tree 1 than s3 62 9 kg tree 1 the cwp for the moderately tolerant khalas was the same for both treatments 1 kg dates kl 1 for the salt intolerant shahlah cwp dropped from s1 1 5 kg dates kl 1 to s3 1 34 kg dates kl 1 by using the price obtained for dates the cwp can also be used to assess the value of irrigation water by variety and groundwater salinity

uae cultivars and the remaining eight coming from saudi arabia the 18 cultivars encompassed a wide range of tolerances to salt we have reported early results from our studies on the salt tolerant lulu an emirati cultivar here we extend the lulu analyses and add in data from the moderately salt tolerant khalas from saudi arabia and the salt intolerant shahlah from the uae the trial considers three rates of irrigation water salinity s1 5 s2 10 and s3 15 ds m 1 over several years the hourly pattern of etc was measured using the compensation heat pulse method cphm in just the two treatments s1 and s3 for each of the three varieties there were five trees of each variety in the s1 treatment and five in the s3 treatment the centre three trees of each treatment were fitted with instruments with the outer two acting as guard trees details of the use of the cphm in date palms have been described by al muaini et al 2019a the soil of the field site is a typic torriorthent sandy skeletal hyperthermic soil abdelfattah 2013 with a sand content of over 90 the date palms were all planted on an 8 x 8 m grid spacing such that there are 156 trees per hectare a weather station located at icba measured solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 2 m and rainfall the weather data were used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto using the standard fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 the transpiration of the date palms is related to et o mm d 1 through the dimensionless crop factor k c eq 1 1 etc kc eto where et c is the crop water use mm d 1 and k c is determined from the ratio of the measured daily sapflow to the reference eto here we used our measurements of etc and eto to compute the daily pattern of kc over several years for the three varieties and the two rates of irrigation water salinity 2 2 tree characteristics and date yield at the end of the 2017 growing season icba measured the date yield and date palm canopy characteristics of trunk height leaf area per tree number of branches and branch length as well we gained access to icba s records of the date yields of the three varieties across the two salinity treatments for the years of 2012 2015 inclusive 2 3 light stick a hand held light stick al muaini et al 2019a was used to record proximally the percentage of visible light being transmitted through the canopy via a series of understory transits the percentage of light intercepted at just above the surface of the desert sand as calculated from our light stick measurements provides a proxy measure of the canopy size and leaf density each transit took 30 s and encompassed the shadow areas of 3 4 trees multiple transits of 4 5 sweeps depending on sun angle were used to cover the full shadow areas of the row of the 3 4 trees in each of treatment blocks 2 4 water productivity to gain insights into the differing salt tolerances of the three varieties we sought to use a metric of the productivity of water pw kg l 1 molden 1997 developed definitions of pw in relation to the gross or net inflow of water the depleted water the process depleted water or available water we follow his definitions and approach by using the process depletion of water there is effectively no rainfall in the date growing regions of the uae such that irrigation supplies all the water for etc under law 5 the suggested rate of irrigation for dates is 1 5 etc to cover a factor of safety and salt leaching so molden s 1997 inflow pw would be 1 5 times the process depletion pw thus in our case molden s 1997 definition of the process depletion pw is simply based on the depletion of etc the transpiration since soil water evaporation can be ignored in this hyper arid desert this then is the same as viets 1962 definition of the crop productivity per unit of water consumed in transpiration for clarity and efficiency of communication perry 2007 we use the term consumed water productivity cwp kg dates l 1 this is defined as the annual yield y kg dates divided by the annual amount of consumed water etc l the cwp is essentially a reciprocal form of the water footprint wf l kg 1 hoekstra et al 2011 elsewhere we have quantified the green blue and grey wfs of date production to assess the environmental impacts of date production the value of groundwater for irrigation and the benefit cost ratio of using desalinated water for irrigating dates al muaini et al 2019b here however we seek to use the inverse metric of cwp to understand better the differences in the biophysical performances of the three varieties in relation to their tolerances to irrigation water salinity 3 results and discussion we first describe the impact of the two rates of irrigation water salinity on the canopy characteristics and date yield for the three varieties and then proceed to discuss the temporal pattern and values of the kc values for the varieties we then show it is possible to predict kc from proximal measurements of li we conclude with a discussion of how the cwp can provide a metric of the salt tolerance for the three varieties 3 1 tree characteristics and date yield the increase in salinity stunted the height of the date palms with reductions of 33 34 and 43 for lulu khalas and shahlah respectively between treatments s1 and s3 table 1 there were similar reductions in the other canopy characteristics of the palm trees as listed in table 1 the date yield reductions between treatments s1 and s3 were 29 43 and 52 for the varieties lulu khalas and shahlah and as expected they were in the order of their presumed salt tolerance 3 2 tree water use and the crop factors the year to year variation in the weather in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi is very small there is an absence of significant rain with the number of rain days or even cloudy days being very small given this lack of year to year variability we present our multi year results for the daily values of etc and kc in figs 1 6 on single graphs using day of year doy as the abscissa there are some gaps in our daily etc measurement records caused by the inevitable equipment failures as expected from sensitive electronic devices operating in such a harsh desert environment however these gaps do not limit our ability to gain understanding of the palms water use dynamics interactions with the prevailing weather and an assessment of the impact of the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation in the graphs of the seasonal pattern of etc figs 1 6 because of the different tree sizes and leaf areas the daily rates of water use vary greatly in each graph we wish to show the coherence between etc and eto so the left hand ordinate axis is scaled for each graph to show how etc tracked the seasonal pattern in eto the units of both axes are mm d 1 and to convert the tree water use measured by sap flow in l d 1 to mm d 1 we used the tree spacing of 8 x 8 m the largest left hand axis is for shahlah s1 where etc peaked at over 4 mm d 1 and the smallest was for khalas s3 where the peak etc was just 1 75 mm d 1 the data for the graphs of kc used the quotient of measured etc eto and all the ordinate axes range from 0 to 0 5 3 2 1 lulu the patterns of etc and kc for the salt tolerant lulu s1 treatment are shown in fig 1 whereas the peak eto was about 12 mm d 1 the peak etc was just 4 mm d 1 there is a coherence between the two traces albeit with some deviations due to various challenges in maintaining the correct rates of irrigation at 1 5 etc the trace of kc in fig 1 revealed a slight rise in kc late in the year which we consider to be due to a seasonal growth of leaf area in autumn the average daily kc for lulu s1 was 0 31 0 05 table 2 the etc and kc results for lulu s3 are shown in fig 2 and the rates of water use were just under about half of those of the s1 treatment with the average kc being 0 17 0 03 table 2 again there was a rise in kc in late october and now a drop in kc can be seen over the first two months of the year this period is when the date fruit are filling however it would seem that in both salinity treatments assuming a seasonally constant kc is reasonable at least for practical purposes the annual rates of water use were 50 kl tree 1 for the s1 trees and 28 4 kl tree 1 for s3 table 2 a drop of 43 3 2 2 khalas the khalas trees are smaller table 1 and have a lower leaf area table 2 than the equivalent lulu trees their rates of etc were correspondingly less figs 3 and 4 within the variability resulting from difficulties with irrigation management the rates of etc tracked eto the annual average kc values for the khalas trees were 0 26 0 05 for s1 and 0 14 0 03 for s3 and both traces also showed a slight four month long peak in kc during winter the total annual water use values by the khalas trees were 43 1 kl tree 1 s1 and 23 2 kl tree 1 s3 a drop of 46 table 2 3 2 3 shahlah the salt intolerant shahlah s1 trees had the largest leaf area per tree table 2 whereas the s3 trees had the smallest leaf area per tree of all trees the seasonal patterns of etc and kc were similar to those of the other two varieties fig 5 and 6 the s1 kc was 0 35 0 05 the largest of all treatments whereas the kc of the s3 treatment was 0 19 0 05 table 2 we sought to see if it were possible to predict kc values through use of proximal sensing of the fractional light interception li using a light stick 3 3 light interception and the crop factor on day of year doy 260 in 2015 19 september an intensive campaign of li measurements was undertaken using the light stick under the canopies of all six plots of the trees of the three varieties at the two salinities this date was chosen to provide detailed observations of li at that time of year in autumn when the crop factor kc was close to the annual average value figs 1 4 we have already published the li results for lulu al muaini et al 2019a and they were 0 26 0 05 for the s1 treatment and 0 20 0 03 for s3 table 2 here in figs 7 and 8 we present the results for khalas and shahlah at the two salinities the transits with the light stick shown in figs 7 and 8 were used to compute the respective li values for khalas the values of li were found to be 0 31 0 05 for s1 and 0 19 0 04 for s3 table 2 the corresponding values for shahlah were 0 34 0 08 and 0 18 0 03 o connell et al 2008 and goodwin et al 2015 found the ratio kc li 1 to be 1 1 2 for apples and pears al muaini et al 2018 reported using a different kc data set for lulu that the lulu kc li 1 was 1 1 1 our revised lulu values provide corroboration the values of kc li 1 for khalas and shahlah were very similar table 2 on average for all varieties and salinity treatments the mean kc li 1 was 0 95 that this value is not too dissimilar to the values for apples and pears would seem to be a measure of how well adapted the date palms are to this hot and saline environment for given their interception of radiant energy they could still maintain reasonable rates of transpiration despite the heat and salinity in contrast al yamani et al 2019a found much lower ratios for the xerophytic and halophytic arid forest species of al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr zizphus spina christi with kc li 1 being 0 4 0 6 al yamani et al 2019b they found kc li 1 to be just 0 1 for the hardy and woody xerophytic al samr tree acacia tortilis the values of kc li 1 we have found here for three date varieties did not show any difference in relation to their respective degrees of salt tolerance this is convenient for being able to predict kc and hence etc from proximal measurements of li for irrigation scheduling and implementation of law 5 we have recommended that irrigation be applied daily at 1 5 etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction al muaini et al 2019a by use of this characterisation that kc li 1 is 0 95 for dates it will be possible to use the light stick to extend the li results from these 8 x 8 m plantings to commercial farms with different tree spacings and varying tree canopy characteristics to predict the kc however the differing salt tolerances of these date varieties means that in terms of date yield there will be differing economic returns from the date trees and the economic values derived for irrigation water will be different between varieties and will differ according to the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation therefore we sought to find a metric that would characterise the value of irrigation to date production in relation to water salinity 3 4 consumed water productivity and salt tolerance as indicated above we considered the consumed water use cwp to be etc and the annual values of etc are reproduced in table 3 along with the respective date yields y the computed cwp revealed an interesting pattern with salinity by variety table 3 whereas between treatments s1 and s3 the drop in etc was 43 46 for all varieties there were clear differences in the drop in yield the percentage loss in yield between s1 and s3 was just 29 for lulu and 43 for khalas and 52 for the salt intolerant shahlah in terms of the ratio of the s3 value of cwp to the cwp for s1 for lulu it was greater than one being 1 24 so despite the drop in water use the salt tolerant lulu was still able to maintain a reasonable productivity of dates for the moderately tolerant khalas the ratio was unity since water use and date production declined in equal proportion for the salt intolerant shahlah the cwp dropped from 1 5 to 1 34 kg dates kl 1 as the salinity rose from 5 to 15 ds m 1 the cwp metric provides a useful measure to characterise the salt tolerance of date cultivars furthermore the cwp could be rephrased in economic terms molden 1997 say by using the date price in uae dirhams dhs per kilogram one uae dhs is currently worth us 0 27 february 2019 this analysis provides an economic measure of the value of the groundwater being used for irrigating the dates in dhs kl 1 as a function of salinity al muaini et al 2019b considered the current price for dates to be dhs 10 per kilogram february 2019 so the cwp column in table 3 would be in dhs kl 1 if multiplied by 10 this could be used to demonstrate the value of groundwater as related to salinity and cultivar such an economic assessment could be carried out for a wider range of date varieties through determination of etc using proximal measures of li and from data on date yields by variety and groundwater salinity nonetheless beyond this simple valuation of water it is important to note that for the date grower farm gross margin zekri et al 2010 will be dominated by the date price dhs kg 1 multiplied by the absolute yield y kg not the value of the water as the ratio of dhs kl 1 but it is interesting in passing to compare this computed value of groundwater which is of the order of 10 20 dhs kl 1 with the cost of desalinating brackish groundwater which is 5 5 dhs kl 1 al muaini et al 2019b 4 conclusions through direct measurements using devices to measure sap flow we have quantified the etc of three date varieties irrigated with water at two salinities 5 and 15 ds m 1 from these results we calculated the respective kc values so that the trees water use etc could be predicted from the reference evapotranspiration eto by proximal sensing using a light stick we measured the fraction of light intercepted li by the trees canopies as a function of variety and salinity the ratio kc li 1 was about 0 95 which enables proximal sensing via a light stick to be used to predict etc for all varieties and both salinities these predictions will then be able to be used to schedule irrigation at the recommended rate of 1 5 etc accounting for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction whereas the drop in etc across all varieties was 43 46 between the 5 and 15 ds m 1 irrigation treatments there were large differences in the drop in date production by variety date production between s1 and s3 dropped just 29 for lulu 43 for khalas and 52 for shahlah the consumed water productivity cwp kg dates kl 1 provides a metric of the varying degrees of salt tolerance for the salt tolerant lulu the cwp for s3 was higher 2 21 kg dates kl 1 than that for s1 1 78 kg dates kl 1 although production was higher with s1 89 1 kg tree 1 than s3 62 9 kg tree 1 the cwp for the moderately tolerant khalas was the same for both treatments 1 kg dates kl 1 for the salt intolerant shahlah cwp dropped from s1 1 5 kg dates kl 1 to s3 1 34 kg dates kl 1 by using the price obtained for dates the cwp can also be used to assess the value of irrigation water by variety and groundwater salinity 
10961,this study investigated the response of the fruit quality fruit yield and water use efficiency wue to regulated deﬁcit irrigation rdi during the different growth stages of apple trees malus pumila mill in the loess plateau of northern china different water deﬁcit treatments were applied in 2016 and 2017 on a ﬁeld planted with 5 year old apple trees the treatments included low l moderate m and severe s water deﬁcit treatments during the bud burst to leaﬁng i flowering to fruit set ii and fruit growth iii stages compared with full irrigation fi water deficit treatment during the different growth stages had significant effects on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the l and m water deficit treatments during stage iii significantly reduced the apple yield by 10 89 and 13 46 in 2016 and 3 66 and 10 10 in 2017 respectively a water deficit during stage iii decreased the single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and fruit water content by 2 79 11 31 15 24 20 36 and 4 26 10 07 respectively and increased fruit firmness soluble solid content and soluble reducing sugar content by 12 70 21 31 13 83 33 60 and 10 13 21 48 respectively the l and m water deficit treatments applied during stage i resulted in apple quality and yield that were similar to those resulting from the fi treatment but the wue was significantly higher in the l and m water deficit treatments than in the fi treatment the optimal period for water deficit treatment is stage ii during which the highest yield and wue were found the l and m treatments during stage ii increased the fruit yield by 13 93 and 13 28 in 2016 and 17 94 and 17 13 in 2017 respectively the wue of the apple trees was higher with the i i l and i i m treatments greater than 7 kg m 3 than with other treatments in addition water deficit treatment during stage ii caused a slight increase in fruit firmness and a slight decrease in fruit water content which produces apples suitable for storage single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content were significantly improved making the apples sweeter thus a water deficit during stage ii had a significant positive effect on apple quality with the i i m treatment being optimal and the ii l treatment being second best the optimal water deficit treatment of the ii m treatment enhances the fruit quality yield and wue of apple trees in water scarce environments keywords regulated deficit irrigation surge root irrigation apple tree malus pumila mill fruit yield fruit quality water use efficiency 1 introduction drought and soil erosion in the loess plateau of china have led to a severe water shortage in the region in recent years the local apple industry has expanded rapidly with more than 628 600 ha being cultivated for this purpose accounting for a quarter of china s apple yield shaanxi provincial bureau of statistics 2016 the water demand of apple trees is high which seriously affects the distribution of water resources in the region increasing the difference between water supply and demand the water shortage is severely restricting the further development of the apple industry in the region song et al 2018 therefore how the water use efficiency wue can be improved and irrigation water rationally distributed in the region are crucial research questions to improve the wue scholars have proposed advanced water saving irrigation techniques such as sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation intermittent irrigation film hole irrigation and surge root irrigation sri sri is a new technology of microirrigation and is similar to subsurface drip irrigation in sri the wue is improved because irrigation water is directly transported to the roots of the crop rather than to the soil which reduces the amount of water evaporation and irrigation water is not affected by the wind dai et al 2019 wu et al 2010 the sri approach is currently evolving scholars have improved the material and flow channel of the sri emitter zhang et al 2007 2017 which has improved the crack resistance of the emitter and casing pipe and has solved the problem of silt blockage furthermore irrigation uniformity and anticlogging ability have been improved making sri especially suitable for the irrigation of economically important trees wu et al 2010 discovered that the greatest improvements to the yield and quality of jujube trees were obtained using sri compared with using tube or drip irrigation among the three irrigation methods sri resulted in the highest net income ratio which was 235 0 compared with the ratio for no irrigation ni scholars have proposed the regulated deficit irrigation rdi method for most appropriately distributing limited irrigation water chalmers and ende 1975 this method uses the physiological function of crops to save water by formulating a rational irrigation system and optimizing the irrigation time and quota of the limited irrigation water during the crops entire growth period rdi controls crop vegetative growth and leaf water potential by regulating soil moisture and stomatal opening can be regulated using leaf water potential which has a strong effect on photosynthesis and water use of crops fábio et al 2002 numerous field experiments have demonstrated that crops have certain adaptability to water deficits a moderate water deficit may not considerably reduce crop yield cui et al 2008 crop growth is inhibited when crops have been subjected to a short term water deficit but after the water supply is restored crops overcompensate kou et al 2014 rdi employs the physiological water saving characteristics and drought resistance ability of crops to save water increase yield improve crop quality and obtain the maximum benefits for a limited water input since the theory of rdi was proposed scholars ali et al 2018 candogan and yazgan 2016 chaichi et al 2016 sampathkumar et al 2013 singh et al 2010 have verified its effects on the growth and yield of wheat corn soybean and cotton from different perspectives in addition many studies have assessed the growth of fruit trees under rdi mainly concentrating on the physiological and biochemical reactions in dryland fruit trees such as apple chenafi et al 2016 peach yuan et al 2009 pear cheng et al 2012 grape faci et al 2014 and jujube qiang et al 2015 crops research has shown that for fruit trees moderate water stress inhibits overgrowth by balancing vegetative with reproductive growth and has little effect on the normal growth and development of fruits which achieves the purpose of water saving while producing a stable yield and high quality fruits although much research has been conducted on rdi there is little research on the rdi of apple trees under the special irrigation method of sri in the loess plateau of china the water consumption of apple trees is higher than that of ordinary crops and the water demand during the different growth periods is inflexible chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 the main irrigation method employed in this region is flood irrigation and the wue is low kou et al 2014 an appropriate irrigation system is urgently required to improve the wue of apple trees in this region therefore the objectives of this study were to i determine the effects of rdi on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees and ii determine the optimal water deficit period of apple trees to provide a scientific basis for water management and the precise irrigation of apple trees 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location and growth conditions field experiments were conducted during the apple growing seasons april november of 2016 and 2017 the experiments were performed at a modern agriculture apple demonstration orchard with microirrigation that is located in qianshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m this area is a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a semiarid climate the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with favorable hydraulic properties gao et al 2018 total precipitation over the entire growth stage of the apple trees was 441 7 and 475 0 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 the highest daily mean temperatures in 2016 and 2017 were 28 9 and 30 0 c respectively the daily mean temperature was 15 c for 151 days in 2016 and 148 days in 2017 fig 1 the average number of annual sunshine hours was 2632 9 h moreover in the experimental location groundwater was more than 50 m below the ground level with no replenishment effect on the designed soil proﬁle table 1 presents the basic properties of the soil profile at the beginning of the study 2 2 experimental design five year old apple trees malus pumila mill were selected as the experimental trees the selected trees were healthy and showed uniform growth the trees were planted with 2 m within row spacing and 3 m inter row spacing 1665 plants ha 1 their height was 2 5 3 0 m more than 90 of the trees absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter were located at a depth of 80 cm song et al 2018 therefore the depth of soil water content swc controlled in this study was 80 cm the layout of the test irrigation system is illustrated in fig 2 the entire growing season of the apple trees was divided into the bud burst to leaﬁng stage stage i mid april mid may flowering to fruit set stage stage ii late may mid june fruit growth stage stage iii late june late september and fruit maturation stage stage iv early october late october the divisions of the season into stages and the effective rainfall in each stage in 2016 and 2017 are presented in table 2 apple trees are tolerant to drought and suitable swc is 40 θf to 85 θf where θf is the field capacity therefore the experimental treatments were low l moderate m and severe s water deﬁcit treatments with three irrigation levels in each growing stage the three irrigation levels applied were defined based on swc l 70 θf 85 θf m 55 θf 70 θf and s 40 θf 55 θf when swc was below the lower limit irrigation was performed until swc reached its upper limit because of the considerable rainfall in 2016 and 2017 swc did not decrease to 40 θf 55 θf during stages ii or iii therefore the s water deficit treatment was not conducted in stages ii and iii additionally the physiological activity of the trees during stage iv was slow because of the rapidly decreasing temperature at the end of the growing season so no irrigated that is no water deﬁcit in stage iv also full irrigation fi 85 θf 100 θf and ni treatments were used as controls overall nine treatments were designed and applied each treatment was applied to three apple trees and 81 trees in total were arranged in a strip plot design according to completely randomized blocks with three replications the 81 apple trees selected were healthy vigorous and uniformly sized and isolated trees were set between each treatment standard agronomic measures such as fertilization trimming girdling insecticide spraying and weed control were the same for all trees the scheme of rdi is displayed in table 3 for the different growth stages of the apple trees in the field experiment irrigation water was obtained from a deep well that contained water of suitable quality for apple growth a water meter nominal diameter 25 mm was used to control the irrigation amount for each treatment in early april 0 6 kg plant 1 of p2o5 0 5 kg plant 1 of k2o and 1 kg plant 1 of organic fertilizer sheep manure were used as base fertilizer at 30 cm from the main trunk of the fruit tree and a venturi fertilizer injector was used to apply urea 0 33 kg plant 1 through sri supplied irrigation water in stage iii june 20 2016 and june 16 2017 0 3 kg plant 1 of k2o and 0 17 kg plant 1 of urea were applied as topdressing li et al 2015 song et al 2016 each apple tree had one emitter located 30 cm from the trunk buried at a depth of 40 cm and positioned 30 cm east of the tree trunk fig 3 through each emitter a 5 0 l h 1 flow rate was maintained 2 3 monitored and calculated data 2 3 1 meteorological factors air temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation intensity wind velocity wind direction and rainfall were recorded by an automated weather station every minute record 1 time for every 30 min 2 3 2 swc using a trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de the vertical swc profile was measured at 10 cm intervals over the 80 cm deep soil layer at horizontal distances of 10 20 and 30 cm from the emitter fig 3 the irrigation quantity and date for the different treatments were recorded over the entire growth of the apple trees 2 3 3 fruit yield the yield of apples from each treatment was weighed immediately after harvesting the harvest dates were october 28 and 29 in 2016 and october 24 and 25 in 2017 2 3 4 fruit quality after the fruit maturation stage one fruit was taken from each of the upper middle and lower parts of an apple tree s eastern southern western and northern aspects resulting in a total of 12 fruits obtained per tree the mean weight of these 12 fruits was calculated using the weighting method fruit firmness was measured using an ft 327 type fruit sclerometer in three positions the upper middle and lower parts of the fruit with the firmness in these three parts averaged to determine the actual fruit firmness the vertical and horizontal diameters of each fruit were measured using a vernier caliper and these diameters were used as the apple grade index based on local classification apples was divided into third grade r 60 mm second grade 60 r 75 mm first grade 75 r 90 mm and special grade r 90 mm first and special grade fruit were defined as excellent fruit and the excellent fruit percentage was calculated as number of excellent fruits total number of fruits 100 a fruit s degree of coloration was measured using photoshop and fruit photographic analysis with all fruits photographed under the same lighting conditions after selecting an area in a photograph the redness r and brightness l were determined using the photograph s histogram and r l indicated the degree of coloration of the fruit the fruits water content was measured using the oven drying method fresh fruits were first dried at 105 for 30 min and then dried at 70 until their weight did not change organic acid content was measured using the naoh titration method vitamin c vc content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol sodium salt method soluble solid content was measured using a wyt 1 type hold refraction instrument and soluble reducing sugar content was measured using the thermal titration method with fehling s reagent 2 3 5 evapotranspiration and wue the evapotranspiration etc mm for the different treatments was obtained from the water balance formula in the 80 cm deep soil layer 1 e t c δ w i p g d r where δw is the reduction of soil water storage between the beginning and end of the experiment mm and i p g d and r are the irrigation effective rainfall recharge of underground water deep percolation and runoff mm respectively the underground water at the experimental location was at more than 50 m below the ground level and no runoff was generated during the growing season thus g and r were neglected eq 1 could thus be simplified to 2 e t c δ w i p d the wue kg m 3 was calculated as dai et al 2019 3 w u e y e t c where y is the yield kg hm 2 and etc is the evapotranspiration m3 hm 2 2 4 data analysis the data were analyzed using analysis of variance performed with the spss statistical software v 21 0 spss inc 2013 data for each year were analyzed separately the significance of the treatment effect was determined using the f test and means were compared using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 water consumption of apple trees under rdi as illustrated in fig 4 the water consumption of an apple tree over the entire growing season was 4590 74 7765 38 m3 hm 2 in 2016 and 4770 36 7627 61 m3 hm 2 in 2017 compared with the ni treatment rdi resulted in significantly higher water consumption p 0 05 but it exerted a significantly stronger water saving effect compared with the fi treatment in 2016 and 2017 the percentage of water saved using rdi was in the ranges of 3 81 32 77 and 2 63 22 80 respectively the order from large to small of water consumption of the apple trees in each stage was stage iii ii i and iv water consumption during stage iii was 59 and 71 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 respectively and this percentage was much higher than those for the other three growth stages water consumption during stage ii was 11 and 21 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in early october the apple trees had entered stage iv they consumed less water in stage iv than in other stages water consumption in this stage ranged from 5 to 11 comparing the water consumption of the apple trees subjected to the different water deficit treatments water consumption decreased with an increase in the water deficit in the different growth stages indicating that a water deficit actively inhibits transpiration compared with the fi treatment the l and m treatments in the different growth stages decreased water consumption by 3 81 9 11 and 6 30 14 58 in 2016 and by 2 59 8 95 and 5 18 14 34 in 2017 respectively when there was a water deficit at a certain growth stage the treatment with a large water deficit resulted in higher water consumption after rehydration in the next stage for example compared with the l deficit treatment when the m water deficit treatment was applied in stage iii water consumption in stage iv was 72 31 higher in 2016 and 18 77 higher in 2017 3 2 effect of rdi on apple quality 3 2 1 physical fruit attributes as detailed in table 4 all water deficit treatments in the different growth stages resulted in higher fruit firmness although significant differences were observed among the treatments in 2016 and 2017 the highest fruit firmness of 7 6 and 7 4 kg cm 2 respectively was obtained with the iii m treatment and for the fi treatment the highest firmness was 6 3 and 6 1 kg cm 2 fruit firmness was higher for greater water deficits in both years a water deficit during stage iii improved fruit firmness significantly p 0 05 when compared with the fi treatment the different water deficit treatments in the different growth stages had no significant effect on the degree of coloration p 0 05 however water deficit treatment had a significant effect on single fruit weight p 0 05 in both years the i l and ii l treatments significantly increased the single fruit weight p 0 05 compared with the fi treatment the single fruit weight after the i l and ii l treatments was 4 17 and 9 69 higher in 2016 and 3 16 and 4 40 higher in 2017 respectively the i m i s and ii m treatment had no significant effect on single fruit weight p 0 05 water deficit treatment in stage iii resulted in lower single fruit weight and single fruit weight was significantly lower in the m treatment p 0 05 as indicated in table 4 the different water deficit treatments in the different growth stages affected the percentage of apples considered excellent quality compared with the fi treatment the iii l and iii m treatments resulted in a significantly lower excellent fruit percentage p 0 05 15 24 20 36 lower in 2016 and 15 27 18 45 lower in 2017 the excellent fruit percentage was improved with the i l i m ii l and ii m treatments and increased significantly with the i l treatment in 2017 and the ii m treatment in 2016 p 0 05 3 2 2 chemical fruit attributes water deficit treatment in the various growth stages improved the fruit quality table 5 the 2 year results demonstrated that a greater water deficit resulted in lower water content water deficit treatment during stages ii and iii significantly decreased water content p 0 05 but the effect was nonsignificant for treatment in stage i p 0 05 water deficit treatment had the greatest effect on water content when used in stage iii compared with the fi treatment the iii l and iii m treatments resulted in 4 26 and 5 26 lower water content in 2016 and 5 58 and 10 07 lower water content in 2017 respectively compared with water content water deficit treatment had the opposite effect on soluble solid and reducing sugar content both were increased when the water deficit was greater in both years water deficit treatment in stage i had no significant effect on soluble solid content p 0 05 but treatment in stages ii and iii significantly increased soluble solid content p 0 05 soluble reducing sugar content was significantly affected by water deficit treatment p 0 05 during the different growth stages in 2016 and 2017 compared with the fi treatment water deficit treatment in stage ii resulted in soluble reducing sugar content that was 15 85 28 34 higher in 2016 and 15 42 31 45 higher in 2017 in both years the largest soluble reducing sugar content 17 98 in 2016 and 17 64 in 2017 was obtained with the ii m treatment the effects of water deficit treatment on the organic acid and vc content of the fruit were nonsignificant p 0 05 the organic acid content of the apples was mainly affected by respiration and the application of potassium fertilizer rather than by the water deficit the presented results indicated that using the different water deficit treatments during the different growth stages affected the quality indices of the apples water deficit treatment mainly enhanced fruit firmness single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content but reduced water content indicating that water deficit treatment can regulate the quality of apples water deficit treatment during stage ii caused a slight increase in fruit firmness and a slight decrease in fruit water content which made these apples ideal for storage additionally the single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content were significantly improved making the apples sweeter therefore water deficit treatment during stage ii had a significant positive effect on apple quality with the ii m treatment being optimal and the ii l treatment being second best 3 3 effect of rdi on apple yield and wue as illustrated in fig 5 the relationship between the apple yield and water consumption was not linear and the fi treatment which consumed the most water did not result in the highest yield in both years the i l i m ii l and ii m treatments resulted in higher yield than the fi treatment with this effect was found to be significant for the ii l and ii m treatments p 0 05 the highest yield of 42 416 9 and 43 866 7 kg hm 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively was obtained with the ii l treatment the yield under rdi treatment was significantly higher than that under the ni treatment p 0 05 indicating that rdi can effectively increase the yield by comparing with the yield obtained using the fi treatment water deficit treatment during stage i had no significant effect on yield p 0 05 in either year compared with the fi treatment the ii l and ii m treatments resulted in 13 93 and 13 28 higher yield in 2016 and 17 94 and 17 13 higher yield in 2017 respectively indicating that water deficit treatment during stage ii actively increases the fruit yield this was because a water deficit during stage ii inhibits the growth of new shoots and leaves which is conducive to fruit formation however water deficit treatment during stage iii significantly reduced the fruit yield p 0 05 in both years compared with that obtained using the fi treatment the fruit yield obtained using the iii l and iii m treatments was 10 89 and 13 46 lower in 2016 and 3 66 and 10 10 lower in 2017 respectively this was because the water consumed during stage iii is mainly for fruit growth a water deficit thus directly affects the yield fig 5 also shows that water deficit treatment increased the wue by 1 31 26 16 in 2016 except for iii l and 4 85 19 49 in 2017 the wue of the apple trees was larger in the ii l and ii m treatments greater than 7 kg m 3 the wue was smaller with the fi treatment which consumed the most water and the ni treatment which consumed the least water 6 13 and 5 03 kg m 3 in 2016 and 5 97 and 5 19 kg m 3 in 2017 respectively both wue values were lower than 6 2 kg m 3 the wue of then trees treated with a water deficit during stage iii was low whereas that of the trees treated with a water deficit during stage ii was high the highest wue was obtained for the ii m treatment 7 74 kg m 3 in 2016 and 7 38 kg m 3 in 2017 by comparing the fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the fruit yield and wue were lower when a water deficit was applied during stage iii therefore water deficit treatment should not be applied during stage iii and sufficient irrigation should be maintained during this stage when the i l and i m water deficit treatments were employed the fruit yield and wue of the trees were higher than those obtained when the fi treatment was used thus l and m water deficit treatments should be applied in stage i however the optimal stage for water deficit treatment is stage ii during which the fruit yield and wue of the trees were the maximum 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption of apple trees under rdi xu 2016 studied the water demand regulation of the apple park on the loess plateau in china and discovered that supplementary irrigation is required during stages i and ii and the early part of stage iii of a normal hydrological year and that the rainfall during late stage iii and during stage iv meets the water demand of apple trees without the need for irrigation rainfall in 2016 and 2017 was plentiful therefore the s water deficit treatment 40 θf 55 θf was not employed in stages ii and iii and water deficit treatment was not applied in stage iv numerous studies have shown that the main water consumption period of apple trees is from june to october water consumption increases slowly in stage i increases rapidly in stage ii peaks in stage iii and is low in stage iv chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 su et al 2005 discovered that when drip irrigation was employed the water consumption profile of apple trees over the whole growth period exhibited a single peak water consumption gradually began to increase in early april peaked in july and decreased after august guo 2006 used fuji apples grown in dry lands as the research object and obtained results regarding water consumption regulation in a drought year that were consistent with the results of su et al 2005 with water consumption intensity peaking from the end of june to the beginning of july the present study discovered that the water consumption of the apple trees during the four growth stages were in the order stage iii ii i iv which was similar to previous research findings generally the temperature during stage i of apple tree growth is lower than that during other stages and the light intensity is weaker stage i is mainly for the germination and initial growth of leaves to accumulate sufficient water kucukyumuk et al 2013 therefore transpiration and evaporation are weaker and water consumption is lower with the increasing temperature apple trees enter stage ii in late may and during this period new shoots emerge on the apple trees flower buds differentiate and the leaves enter their initial period of rapid growth zhou et al 2015 water consumption thus increases accounting for approximately 10 20 of the total water consumption over the entire growth period in mid june apple trees enter stage iii of growth which is the period determining the final yield and fruit quality zheng et al 2017 in the present study the water consumed during stage iii was 59 and 71 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 respectively which is much higher than the percentages for the other growth stages this was due to the high temperature and strong solar radiation during this period which promoted fruit development and rapid leaf growth transpiration and evaporation were thus stronger and water consumption was higher stage iv of apple tree growth occurred in early october during this period the temperature was lower approximately 8 on average and the sunshine hours were decreased relative humidity was higher due to increased rainfall dai et al 2019 additionally the vegetative organs of the apple trees stopped growing and the leaves began to wither and fall off under the influence of temperature fruit growth was not significant during this period and the growth of the apple trees was relatively stable zhou et al 2015 thus water consumption was low accounting for 5 and 11 of all water consumed over the growing season studies have demonstrated that water consumption decreases with an increase in the water deficit during the different growth stages cheng et al 2012 cui et al 2008 qiang et al 2015 indicating that water deficit treatment actively inhibits transpiration which was confirmed in this study this may be because a water deficit changes the distribution of photosynthate between the roots and crowns of fruit trees cui et al 2009 that is the roots obtain more assimilation products which is conducive to later growth and development when the growth of crowns is inhibited leaf area is reduced thereby reducing transpiration 4 2 effect of rdi on apple quality this study demonstrated that rdi can increase fruit firmness which is similar to the conclusions of marsal et al 2010 cuevas et al 2007 bussakorn et al 2002 and others this is because a water deficit limits the expansion and division of pulp cells resulting in the higher density of pulp cells in this study fruit firmness increased with an increase in the water deficit this may be because insufficient swc inhibits the activity of biological enzymes and degradation of cell wall cellulose and pectin water deficit treatment during stages i ii and iii had no significant effect on degree of fruit coloration in either year p 0 05 this may have been because the optimal environment for the development of the color of apples should be provided in stage iv during which sufficient illumination time of 6 8 h should be maintained and the average daily temperature should be 12 8 c zeng 2017 in the present study the climate in stage iv in 2016 was only slightly different to that in 2017 so the apples grown in these two years had only small differences in coloration rdi can reduce the final single fruit weight and volume cuevas et al 2007 leib et al 2006 in the present study the i m and i s treatments had little effect on the single fruit weight and volume whereas the iii l and iii m treatments significantly reduced them indicating that water deficit treatment in stage i had a weaker effect on weight and volume than did stage iii a possible reason is that a water deficit during stage i significantly inhibited the vegetative growth of the fruit trees cui et al 2009 so that some of the photosynthate accumulated in the plants providing crucial energy for the reproductive growth of the trees when entering stage ii additionally the compensation effect after the water deficit would greatly increase the photosynthetic rate and be more conducive to energy storage kou et al 2014 thus treatment in stage i did not reduce the single fruit weight and volume stage iii is a critical period for the development of flesh cells and a water deficit seriously inhibits the expansion of flesh cells which may cause the single fruit weight and volume to decrease significantly in this study water deficit treatment during stage ii resulted in the increased single fruit weight and volume this may have been because a water deficit during stage ii leads to the wilting of flower buds affecting the completion of the pollination process rodríguez et al 2007 and causing young fruit to fall off the surviving fruit would have more nutrients and a greater water supply thus increasing the single fruit weight and volume ansari et al 2018 demonstrated that the application and subsequent relief of water stress promote fruit growth thus resulting in larger fruit water deficit treatment increased soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content in a previous study leib et al 2006 which is in agreement with our result verreynne et al 2001 indicated that water deﬁcit treatment increased the organic acid content of citrus by 11 13 however the present study found that water deficit treatment had no significant effect on apples organic acid content which is consistent with the findings of bussakorn et al 2002 indicating that the effect of a water deficit on the organic acid content of fruit varies greatly according to the fruit variety water deficit treatment during the different growth stages has been found to increase the sugar acid ratio alikhani koupaei et al 2018 grinan et al 2019 in agreement with our result the difference in the increased sugar acid ratio between 2016 and 2017 may have resulted from the temperature difference and water stress during iii stage in both years chen et al 2005 also indicated that high temperature and drought result in an increased sugar acid ratio 4 3 effect of rdi on apple yield and wue numerous field experiments have shown that crops have certain adaptability to water deficits timely and moderate water deficits partially inhibit the growth of vegetative organs but do not significantly reduce crop yield cui et al 2009 qiang et al 2015 this may be because the growth of crop reproductive organs and vegetative organs is mutually dependent and competitive when crops are subjected to water stress they have the ability to minimize damage prevent species extinction and redistribute nutrients through self regulation wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 this is the theoretical basis for the water saving effects of rdi and its ability to maintain or even increase yield in this study water deficit treatment during stage i had no significant effect on the apple yield p 0 05 whereas such treatment during stage iii significantly reduced the yield p 0 05 leib et al 2006 also discovered that moderate water deficit treatment during stage iii significantly decreased the apple yield the possible reason is that stage i is the initial stage of vegetative organ growth in apple trees during which water accumulates for use in flower bud differentiation a moderate water deficit in stage i may not cause much reduction in crop yield kang and cai 2002 in a previous study the growth rate of vegetative organs in the stage iii of apple tree growth was slow and water was mainly consumed for the growth and development of reproductive organs cui et al 2008 a water deficit during stage iii can restrict photosynthesis which reduces the assimilates produced through photosynthesis conversely fruit tissue expansion is sensitive to water deficits therefore a water deficit inevitably influences the growth of fruit tissue and results in a decreased fruit yield the present study demonstrated that the l and m water deficit treatments during stage ii significantly increased the fruit yield p 0 05 qiang et al 2015 also reported that the moderate water deficit treatment during stage ii promoted the growth and yield of jujube fruits and improved the wue this is perhaps because the growth of shoots and leaves is inhibited when a water deficit is applied during stage ii which is conducive to fruit formation gucci et al 2019 also indicated that suitable water stress during stage ii could inhibit the growth of vegetative organs rather than accumulating in vegetative organs organic matter accumulated in reproductive organs promoting fruit growth 5 conclusions experiments applying rdi of varying degrees during the different apple tree growth stages indicated that rdi saved significantly more water than fi our results revealed that water deficit treatment had significant effects on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the optimal period for water deficit treatment was discovered to be the flowering to fruit set stage during which the yield and wue of apple trees were the highest in addition water deficit treatment during the flowering to fruit set stage had a significantly positive effect on apple quality controlling swc to be 55 θf 70 θf obtained the best results and controlling swc to be 70 θf 85 θf obtained the second best results therefore the optimal water deficit treatment involves controlling swc to be 55 θf 70 θf during the flowering to fruit set stage such treatment can enhance the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees in water scarce environments however because considerable rainfall occurred in 2016 and 2017 the s water deficit treatment could not be applied due to excessive rainfall during the flowering to fruit setting and fruit growth stages and further study is required to the effects of the s water deficit treatment in addition research investigating the effect of water deﬁcits during compound stages and multiple stages should be conducted in the future acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program no 2016yfc0400204 and by the national natural science foundation of china no 51479161

10961,this study investigated the response of the fruit quality fruit yield and water use efficiency wue to regulated deﬁcit irrigation rdi during the different growth stages of apple trees malus pumila mill in the loess plateau of northern china different water deﬁcit treatments were applied in 2016 and 2017 on a ﬁeld planted with 5 year old apple trees the treatments included low l moderate m and severe s water deﬁcit treatments during the bud burst to leaﬁng i flowering to fruit set ii and fruit growth iii stages compared with full irrigation fi water deficit treatment during the different growth stages had significant effects on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the l and m water deficit treatments during stage iii significantly reduced the apple yield by 10 89 and 13 46 in 2016 and 3 66 and 10 10 in 2017 respectively a water deficit during stage iii decreased the single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and fruit water content by 2 79 11 31 15 24 20 36 and 4 26 10 07 respectively and increased fruit firmness soluble solid content and soluble reducing sugar content by 12 70 21 31 13 83 33 60 and 10 13 21 48 respectively the l and m water deficit treatments applied during stage i resulted in apple quality and yield that were similar to those resulting from the fi treatment but the wue was significantly higher in the l and m water deficit treatments than in the fi treatment the optimal period for water deficit treatment is stage ii during which the highest yield and wue were found the l and m treatments during stage ii increased the fruit yield by 13 93 and 13 28 in 2016 and 17 94 and 17 13 in 2017 respectively the wue of the apple trees was higher with the i i l and i i m treatments greater than 7 kg m 3 than with other treatments in addition water deficit treatment during stage ii caused a slight increase in fruit firmness and a slight decrease in fruit water content which produces apples suitable for storage single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content were significantly improved making the apples sweeter thus a water deficit during stage ii had a significant positive effect on apple quality with the i i m treatment being optimal and the ii l treatment being second best the optimal water deficit treatment of the ii m treatment enhances the fruit quality yield and wue of apple trees in water scarce environments keywords regulated deficit irrigation surge root irrigation apple tree malus pumila mill fruit yield fruit quality water use efficiency 1 introduction drought and soil erosion in the loess plateau of china have led to a severe water shortage in the region in recent years the local apple industry has expanded rapidly with more than 628 600 ha being cultivated for this purpose accounting for a quarter of china s apple yield shaanxi provincial bureau of statistics 2016 the water demand of apple trees is high which seriously affects the distribution of water resources in the region increasing the difference between water supply and demand the water shortage is severely restricting the further development of the apple industry in the region song et al 2018 therefore how the water use efficiency wue can be improved and irrigation water rationally distributed in the region are crucial research questions to improve the wue scholars have proposed advanced water saving irrigation techniques such as sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation intermittent irrigation film hole irrigation and surge root irrigation sri sri is a new technology of microirrigation and is similar to subsurface drip irrigation in sri the wue is improved because irrigation water is directly transported to the roots of the crop rather than to the soil which reduces the amount of water evaporation and irrigation water is not affected by the wind dai et al 2019 wu et al 2010 the sri approach is currently evolving scholars have improved the material and flow channel of the sri emitter zhang et al 2007 2017 which has improved the crack resistance of the emitter and casing pipe and has solved the problem of silt blockage furthermore irrigation uniformity and anticlogging ability have been improved making sri especially suitable for the irrigation of economically important trees wu et al 2010 discovered that the greatest improvements to the yield and quality of jujube trees were obtained using sri compared with using tube or drip irrigation among the three irrigation methods sri resulted in the highest net income ratio which was 235 0 compared with the ratio for no irrigation ni scholars have proposed the regulated deficit irrigation rdi method for most appropriately distributing limited irrigation water chalmers and ende 1975 this method uses the physiological function of crops to save water by formulating a rational irrigation system and optimizing the irrigation time and quota of the limited irrigation water during the crops entire growth period rdi controls crop vegetative growth and leaf water potential by regulating soil moisture and stomatal opening can be regulated using leaf water potential which has a strong effect on photosynthesis and water use of crops fábio et al 2002 numerous field experiments have demonstrated that crops have certain adaptability to water deficits a moderate water deficit may not considerably reduce crop yield cui et al 2008 crop growth is inhibited when crops have been subjected to a short term water deficit but after the water supply is restored crops overcompensate kou et al 2014 rdi employs the physiological water saving characteristics and drought resistance ability of crops to save water increase yield improve crop quality and obtain the maximum benefits for a limited water input since the theory of rdi was proposed scholars ali et al 2018 candogan and yazgan 2016 chaichi et al 2016 sampathkumar et al 2013 singh et al 2010 have verified its effects on the growth and yield of wheat corn soybean and cotton from different perspectives in addition many studies have assessed the growth of fruit trees under rdi mainly concentrating on the physiological and biochemical reactions in dryland fruit trees such as apple chenafi et al 2016 peach yuan et al 2009 pear cheng et al 2012 grape faci et al 2014 and jujube qiang et al 2015 crops research has shown that for fruit trees moderate water stress inhibits overgrowth by balancing vegetative with reproductive growth and has little effect on the normal growth and development of fruits which achieves the purpose of water saving while producing a stable yield and high quality fruits although much research has been conducted on rdi there is little research on the rdi of apple trees under the special irrigation method of sri in the loess plateau of china the water consumption of apple trees is higher than that of ordinary crops and the water demand during the different growth periods is inflexible chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 the main irrigation method employed in this region is flood irrigation and the wue is low kou et al 2014 an appropriate irrigation system is urgently required to improve the wue of apple trees in this region therefore the objectives of this study were to i determine the effects of rdi on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees and ii determine the optimal water deficit period of apple trees to provide a scientific basis for water management and the precise irrigation of apple trees 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location and growth conditions field experiments were conducted during the apple growing seasons april november of 2016 and 2017 the experiments were performed at a modern agriculture apple demonstration orchard with microirrigation that is located in qianshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m this area is a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a semiarid climate the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with favorable hydraulic properties gao et al 2018 total precipitation over the entire growth stage of the apple trees was 441 7 and 475 0 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 the highest daily mean temperatures in 2016 and 2017 were 28 9 and 30 0 c respectively the daily mean temperature was 15 c for 151 days in 2016 and 148 days in 2017 fig 1 the average number of annual sunshine hours was 2632 9 h moreover in the experimental location groundwater was more than 50 m below the ground level with no replenishment effect on the designed soil proﬁle table 1 presents the basic properties of the soil profile at the beginning of the study 2 2 experimental design five year old apple trees malus pumila mill were selected as the experimental trees the selected trees were healthy and showed uniform growth the trees were planted with 2 m within row spacing and 3 m inter row spacing 1665 plants ha 1 their height was 2 5 3 0 m more than 90 of the trees absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter were located at a depth of 80 cm song et al 2018 therefore the depth of soil water content swc controlled in this study was 80 cm the layout of the test irrigation system is illustrated in fig 2 the entire growing season of the apple trees was divided into the bud burst to leaﬁng stage stage i mid april mid may flowering to fruit set stage stage ii late may mid june fruit growth stage stage iii late june late september and fruit maturation stage stage iv early october late october the divisions of the season into stages and the effective rainfall in each stage in 2016 and 2017 are presented in table 2 apple trees are tolerant to drought and suitable swc is 40 θf to 85 θf where θf is the field capacity therefore the experimental treatments were low l moderate m and severe s water deﬁcit treatments with three irrigation levels in each growing stage the three irrigation levels applied were defined based on swc l 70 θf 85 θf m 55 θf 70 θf and s 40 θf 55 θf when swc was below the lower limit irrigation was performed until swc reached its upper limit because of the considerable rainfall in 2016 and 2017 swc did not decrease to 40 θf 55 θf during stages ii or iii therefore the s water deficit treatment was not conducted in stages ii and iii additionally the physiological activity of the trees during stage iv was slow because of the rapidly decreasing temperature at the end of the growing season so no irrigated that is no water deﬁcit in stage iv also full irrigation fi 85 θf 100 θf and ni treatments were used as controls overall nine treatments were designed and applied each treatment was applied to three apple trees and 81 trees in total were arranged in a strip plot design according to completely randomized blocks with three replications the 81 apple trees selected were healthy vigorous and uniformly sized and isolated trees were set between each treatment standard agronomic measures such as fertilization trimming girdling insecticide spraying and weed control were the same for all trees the scheme of rdi is displayed in table 3 for the different growth stages of the apple trees in the field experiment irrigation water was obtained from a deep well that contained water of suitable quality for apple growth a water meter nominal diameter 25 mm was used to control the irrigation amount for each treatment in early april 0 6 kg plant 1 of p2o5 0 5 kg plant 1 of k2o and 1 kg plant 1 of organic fertilizer sheep manure were used as base fertilizer at 30 cm from the main trunk of the fruit tree and a venturi fertilizer injector was used to apply urea 0 33 kg plant 1 through sri supplied irrigation water in stage iii june 20 2016 and june 16 2017 0 3 kg plant 1 of k2o and 0 17 kg plant 1 of urea were applied as topdressing li et al 2015 song et al 2016 each apple tree had one emitter located 30 cm from the trunk buried at a depth of 40 cm and positioned 30 cm east of the tree trunk fig 3 through each emitter a 5 0 l h 1 flow rate was maintained 2 3 monitored and calculated data 2 3 1 meteorological factors air temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation intensity wind velocity wind direction and rainfall were recorded by an automated weather station every minute record 1 time for every 30 min 2 3 2 swc using a trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de the vertical swc profile was measured at 10 cm intervals over the 80 cm deep soil layer at horizontal distances of 10 20 and 30 cm from the emitter fig 3 the irrigation quantity and date for the different treatments were recorded over the entire growth of the apple trees 2 3 3 fruit yield the yield of apples from each treatment was weighed immediately after harvesting the harvest dates were october 28 and 29 in 2016 and october 24 and 25 in 2017 2 3 4 fruit quality after the fruit maturation stage one fruit was taken from each of the upper middle and lower parts of an apple tree s eastern southern western and northern aspects resulting in a total of 12 fruits obtained per tree the mean weight of these 12 fruits was calculated using the weighting method fruit firmness was measured using an ft 327 type fruit sclerometer in three positions the upper middle and lower parts of the fruit with the firmness in these three parts averaged to determine the actual fruit firmness the vertical and horizontal diameters of each fruit were measured using a vernier caliper and these diameters were used as the apple grade index based on local classification apples was divided into third grade r 60 mm second grade 60 r 75 mm first grade 75 r 90 mm and special grade r 90 mm first and special grade fruit were defined as excellent fruit and the excellent fruit percentage was calculated as number of excellent fruits total number of fruits 100 a fruit s degree of coloration was measured using photoshop and fruit photographic analysis with all fruits photographed under the same lighting conditions after selecting an area in a photograph the redness r and brightness l were determined using the photograph s histogram and r l indicated the degree of coloration of the fruit the fruits water content was measured using the oven drying method fresh fruits were first dried at 105 for 30 min and then dried at 70 until their weight did not change organic acid content was measured using the naoh titration method vitamin c vc content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol sodium salt method soluble solid content was measured using a wyt 1 type hold refraction instrument and soluble reducing sugar content was measured using the thermal titration method with fehling s reagent 2 3 5 evapotranspiration and wue the evapotranspiration etc mm for the different treatments was obtained from the water balance formula in the 80 cm deep soil layer 1 e t c δ w i p g d r where δw is the reduction of soil water storage between the beginning and end of the experiment mm and i p g d and r are the irrigation effective rainfall recharge of underground water deep percolation and runoff mm respectively the underground water at the experimental location was at more than 50 m below the ground level and no runoff was generated during the growing season thus g and r were neglected eq 1

the data were analyzed using analysis of variance performed with the spss statistical software v 21 0 spss inc 2013 data for each year were analyzed separately the significance of the treatment effect was determined using the f test and means were compared using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 water consumption of apple trees under rdi as illustrated in fig 4 the water consumption of an apple tree over the entire growing season was 4590 74 7765 38 m3 hm 2 in 2016 and 4770 36 7627 61 m3 hm 2 in 2017 compared with the ni treatment rdi resulted in significantly higher water consumption p 0 05 but it exerted a significantly stronger water saving effect compared with the fi treatment in 2016 and 2017 the percentage of water saved using rdi was in the ranges of 3 81 32 77 and 2 63 22 80 respectively the order from large to small of water consumption of the apple trees in each stage was stage iii ii i and iv water consumption during stage iii was 59 and 71 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 respectively and this percentage was much higher than those for the other three growth stages water consumption during stage ii was 11 and 21 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in early october the apple trees had entered stage iv they consumed less water in stage iv than in other stages water consumption in this stage ranged from 5 to 11 comparing the water consumption of the apple trees subjected to the different water deficit treatments water consumption decreased with an increase in the water deficit in the different growth stages indicating that a water deficit actively inhibits transpiration compared with the fi treatment the l and m treatments in the different growth stages decreased water consumption by 3 81 9 11 and 6 30 14 58 in 2016 and by 2 59 8 95 and 5 18 14 34 in 2017 respectively when there was a water deficit at a certain growth stage the treatment with a large water deficit resulted in higher water consumption after rehydration in the next stage for example compared with the l deficit treatment when the m water deficit treatment was applied in stage iii water consumption in stage iv was 72 31 higher in 2016 and 18 77 higher in 2017 3 2 effect of rdi on apple quality 3 2 1 physical fruit attributes as detailed in table 4 all water deficit treatments in the different growth stages resulted in higher fruit firmness although significant differences were observed among the treatments in 2016 and 2017 the highest fruit firmness of 7 6 and 7 4 kg cm 2 respectively was obtained with the iii m treatment and for the fi treatment the highest firmness was 6 3 and 6 1 kg cm 2 fruit firmness was higher for greater water deficits in both years a water deficit during stage iii improved fruit firmness significantly p 0 05 when compared with the fi treatment the different water deficit treatments in the different growth stages had no significant effect on the degree of coloration p 0 05 however water deficit treatment had a significant effect on single fruit weight p 0 05 in both years the i l and ii l treatments significantly increased the single fruit weight p 0 05 compared with the fi treatment the single fruit weight after the i l and ii l treatments was 4 17 and 9 69 higher in 2016 and 3 16 and 4 40 higher in 2017 respectively the i m i s and ii m treatment had no significant effect on single fruit weight p 0 05 water deficit treatment in stage iii resulted in lower single fruit weight and single fruit weight was significantly lower in the m treatment p 0 05 as indicated in table 4 the different water deficit treatments in the different growth stages affected the percentage of apples considered excellent quality compared with the fi treatment the iii l and iii m treatments resulted in a significantly lower excellent fruit percentage p 0 05 15 24 20 36 lower in 2016 and 15 27 18 45 lower in 2017 the excellent fruit percentage was improved with the i l i m ii l and ii m treatments and increased significantly with the i l treatment in 2017 and the ii m treatment in 2016 p 0 05 3 2 2 chemical fruit attributes water deficit treatment in the various growth stages improved the fruit quality table 5 the 2 year results demonstrated that a greater water deficit resulted in lower water content water deficit treatment during stages ii and iii significantly decreased water content p 0 05 but the effect was nonsignificant for treatment in stage i p 0 05 water deficit treatment had the greatest effect on water content when used in stage iii compared with the fi treatment the iii l and iii m treatments resulted in 4 26 and 5 26 lower water content in 2016 and 5 58 and 10 07 lower water content in 2017 respectively compared with water content water deficit treatment had the opposite effect on soluble solid and reducing sugar content both were increased when the water deficit was greater in both years water deficit treatment in stage i had no significant effect on soluble solid content p 0 05 but treatment in stages ii and iii significantly increased soluble solid content p 0 05 soluble reducing sugar content was significantly affected by water deficit treatment p 0 05 during the different growth stages in 2016 and 2017 compared with the fi treatment water deficit treatment in stage ii resulted in soluble reducing sugar content that was 15 85 28 34 higher in 2016 and 15 42 31 45 higher in 2017 in both years the largest soluble reducing sugar content 17 98 in 2016 and 17 64 in 2017 was obtained with the ii m treatment the effects of water deficit treatment on the organic acid and vc content of the fruit were nonsignificant p 0 05 the organic acid content of the apples was mainly affected by respiration and the application of potassium fertilizer rather than by the water deficit the presented results indicated that using the different water deficit treatments during the different growth stages affected the quality indices of the apples water deficit treatment mainly enhanced fruit firmness single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content but reduced water content indicating that water deficit treatment can regulate the quality of apples water deficit treatment during stage ii caused a slight increase in fruit firmness and a slight decrease in fruit water content which made these apples ideal for storage additionally the single fruit weight excellent fruit percentage and soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content were significantly improved making the apples sweeter therefore water deficit treatment during stage ii had a significant positive effect on apple quality with the ii m treatment being optimal and the ii l treatment being second best 3 3 effect of rdi on apple yield and wue as illustrated in fig 5 the relationship between the apple yield and water consumption was not linear and the fi treatment which consumed the most water did not result in the highest yield in both years the i l i m ii l and ii m treatments resulted in higher yield than the fi treatment with this effect was found to be significant for the ii l and ii m treatments p 0 05 the highest yield of 42 416 9 and 43 866 7 kg hm 2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively was obtained with the ii l treatment the yield under rdi treatment was significantly higher than that under the ni treatment p 0 05 indicating that rdi can effectively increase the yield by comparing with the yield obtained using the fi treatment water deficit treatment during stage i had no significant effect on yield p 0 05 in either year compared with the fi treatment the ii l and ii m treatments resulted in 13 93 and 13 28 higher yield in 2016 and 17 94 and 17 13 higher yield in 2017 respectively indicating that water deficit treatment during stage ii actively increases the fruit yield this was because a water deficit during stage ii inhibits the growth of new shoots and leaves which is conducive to fruit formation however water deficit treatment during stage iii significantly reduced the fruit yield p 0 05 in both years compared with that obtained using the fi treatment the fruit yield obtained using the iii l and iii m treatments was 10 89 and 13 46 lower in 2016 and 3 66 and 10 10 lower in 2017 respectively this was because the water consumed during stage iii is mainly for fruit growth a water deficit thus directly affects the yield fig 5 also shows that water deficit treatment increased the wue by 1 31 26 16 in 2016 except for iii l and 4 85 19 49 in 2017 the wue of the apple trees was larger in the ii l and ii m treatments greater than 7 kg m 3 the wue was smaller with the fi treatment which consumed the most water and the ni treatment which consumed the least water 6 13 and 5 03 kg m 3 in 2016 and 5 97 and 5 19 kg m 3 in 2017 respectively both wue values were lower than 6 2 kg m 3 the wue of then trees treated with a water deficit during stage iii was low whereas that of the trees treated with a water deficit during stage ii was high the highest wue was obtained for the ii m treatment 7 74 kg m 3 in 2016 and 7 38 kg m 3 in 2017 by comparing the fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the fruit yield and wue were lower when a water deficit was applied during stage iii therefore water deficit treatment should not be applied during stage iii and sufficient irrigation should be maintained during this stage when the i l and i m water deficit treatments were employed the fruit yield and wue of the trees were higher than those obtained when the fi treatment was used thus l and m water deficit treatments should be applied in stage i however the optimal stage for water deficit treatment is stage ii during which the fruit yield and wue of the trees were the maximum 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption of apple trees under rdi xu 2016 studied the water demand regulation of the apple park on the loess plateau in china and discovered that supplementary irrigation is required during stages i and ii and the early part of stage iii of a normal hydrological year and that the rainfall during late stage iii and during stage iv meets the water demand of apple trees without the need for irrigation rainfall in 2016 and 2017 was plentiful therefore the s water deficit treatment 40 θf 55 θf was not employed in stages ii and iii and water deficit treatment was not applied in stage iv numerous studies have shown that the main water consumption period of apple trees is from june to october water consumption increases slowly in stage i increases rapidly in stage ii peaks in stage iii and is low in stage iv chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 su et al 2005 discovered that when drip irrigation was employed the water consumption profile of apple trees over the whole growth period exhibited a single peak water consumption gradually began to increase in early april peaked in july and decreased after august guo 2006 used fuji apples grown in dry lands as the research object and obtained results regarding water consumption regulation in a drought year that were consistent with the results of su et al 2005 with water consumption intensity peaking from the end of june to the beginning of july the present study discovered that the water consumption of the apple trees during the four growth stages were in the order stage iii ii i iv which was similar to previous research findings generally the temperature during stage i of apple tree growth is lower than that during other stages and the light intensity is weaker stage i is mainly for the germination and initial growth of leaves to accumulate sufficient water kucukyumuk et al 2013 therefore transpiration and evaporation are weaker and water consumption is lower with the increasing temperature apple trees enter stage ii in late may and during this period new shoots emerge on the apple trees flower buds differentiate and the leaves enter their initial period of rapid growth zhou et al 2015 water consumption thus increases accounting for approximately 10 20 of the total water consumption over the entire growth period in mid june apple trees enter stage iii of growth which is the period determining the final yield and fruit quality zheng et al 2017 in the present study the water consumed during stage iii was 59 and 71 of all water consumed over the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 respectively which is much higher than the percentages for the other growth stages this was due to the high temperature and strong solar radiation during this period which promoted fruit development and rapid leaf growth transpiration and evaporation were thus stronger and water consumption was higher stage iv of apple tree growth occurred in early october during this period the temperature was lower approximately 8 on average and the sunshine hours were decreased relative humidity was higher due to increased rainfall dai et al 2019 additionally the vegetative organs of the apple trees stopped growing and the leaves began to wither and fall off under the influence of temperature fruit growth was not significant during this period and the growth of the apple trees was relatively stable zhou et al 2015 thus water consumption was low accounting for 5 and 11 of all water consumed over the growing season studies have demonstrated that water consumption decreases with an increase in the water deficit during the different growth stages cheng et al 2012 cui et al 2008 qiang et al 2015 indicating that water deficit treatment actively inhibits transpiration which was confirmed in this study this may be because a water deficit changes the distribution of photosynthate between the roots and crowns of fruit trees cui et al 2009 that is the roots obtain more assimilation products which is conducive to later growth and development when the growth of crowns is inhibited leaf area is reduced thereby reducing transpiration 4 2 effect of rdi on apple quality this study demonstrated that rdi can increase fruit firmness which is similar to the conclusions of marsal et al 2010 cuevas et al 2007 bussakorn et al 2002 and others this is because a water deficit limits the expansion and division of pulp cells resulting in the higher density of pulp cells in this study fruit firmness increased with an increase in the water deficit this may be because insufficient swc inhibits the activity of biological enzymes and degradation of cell wall cellulose and pectin water deficit treatment during stages i ii and iii had no significant effect on degree of fruit coloration in either year p 0 05 this may have been because the optimal environment for the development of the color of apples should be provided in stage iv during which sufficient illumination time of 6 8 h should be maintained and the average daily temperature should be 12 8 c zeng 2017 in the present study the climate in stage iv in 2016 was only slightly different to that in 2017 so the apples grown in these two years had only small differences in coloration rdi can reduce the final single fruit weight and volume cuevas et al 2007 leib et al 2006 in the present study the i m and i s treatments had little effect on the single fruit weight and volume whereas the iii l and iii m treatments significantly reduced them indicating that water deficit treatment in stage i had a weaker effect on weight and volume than did stage iii a possible reason is that a water deficit during stage i significantly inhibited the vegetative growth of the fruit trees cui et al 2009 so that some of the photosynthate accumulated in the plants providing crucial energy for the reproductive growth of the trees when entering stage ii additionally the compensation effect after the water deficit would greatly increase the photosynthetic rate and be more conducive to energy storage kou et al 2014 thus treatment in stage i did not reduce the single fruit weight and volume stage iii is a critical period for the development of flesh cells and a water deficit seriously inhibits the expansion of flesh cells which may cause the single fruit weight and volume to decrease significantly in this study water deficit treatment during stage ii resulted in the increased single fruit weight and volume this may have been because a water deficit during stage ii leads to the wilting of flower buds affecting the completion of the pollination process rodríguez et al 2007 and causing young fruit to fall off the surviving fruit would have more nutrients and a greater water supply thus increasing the single fruit weight and volume ansari et al 2018 demonstrated that the application and subsequent relief of water stress promote fruit growth thus resulting in larger fruit water deficit treatment increased soluble solid and soluble reducing sugar content in a previous study leib et al 2006 which is in agreement with our result verreynne et al 2001 indicated that water deﬁcit treatment increased the organic acid content of citrus by 11 13 however the present study found that water deficit treatment had no significant effect on apples organic acid content which is consistent with the findings of bussakorn et al 2002 indicating that the effect of a water deficit on the organic acid content of fruit varies greatly according to the fruit variety water deficit treatment during the different growth stages has been found to increase the sugar acid ratio alikhani koupaei et al 2018 grinan et al 2019 in agreement with our result the difference in the increased sugar acid ratio between 2016 and 2017 may have resulted from the temperature difference and water stress during iii stage in both years chen et al 2005 also indicated that high temperature and drought result in an increased sugar acid ratio 4 3 effect of rdi on apple yield and wue numerous field experiments have shown that crops have certain adaptability to water deficits timely and moderate water deficits partially inhibit the growth of vegetative organs but do not significantly reduce crop yield cui et al 2009 qiang et al 2015 this may be because the growth of crop reproductive organs and vegetative organs is mutually dependent and competitive when crops are subjected to water stress they have the ability to minimize damage prevent species extinction and redistribute nutrients through self regulation wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 this is the theoretical basis for the water saving effects of rdi and its ability to maintain or even increase yield in this study water deficit treatment during stage i had no significant effect on the apple yield p 0 05 whereas such treatment during stage iii significantly reduced the yield p 0 05 leib et al 2006 also discovered that moderate water deficit treatment during stage iii significantly decreased the apple yield the possible reason is that stage i is the initial stage of vegetative organ growth in apple trees during which water accumulates for use in flower bud differentiation a moderate water deficit in stage i may not cause much reduction in crop yield kang and cai 2002 in a previous study the growth rate of vegetative organs in the stage iii of apple tree growth was slow and water was mainly consumed for the growth and development of reproductive organs cui et al 2008 a water deficit during stage iii can restrict photosynthesis which reduces the assimilates produced through photosynthesis conversely fruit tissue expansion is sensitive to water deficits therefore a water deficit inevitably influences the growth of fruit tissue and results in a decreased fruit yield the present study demonstrated that the l and m water deficit treatments during stage ii significantly increased the fruit yield p 0 05 qiang et al 2015 also reported that the moderate water deficit treatment during stage ii promoted the growth and yield of jujube fruits and improved the wue this is perhaps because the growth of shoots and leaves is inhibited when a water deficit is applied during stage ii which is conducive to fruit formation gucci et al 2019 also indicated that suitable water stress during stage ii could inhibit the growth of vegetative organs rather than accumulating in vegetative organs organic matter accumulated in reproductive organs promoting fruit growth 5 conclusions experiments applying rdi of varying degrees during the different apple tree growth stages indicated that rdi saved significantly more water than fi our results revealed that water deficit treatment had significant effects on the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of the apple trees the optimal period for water deficit treatment was discovered to be the flowering to fruit set stage during which the yield and wue of apple trees were the highest in addition water deficit treatment during the flowering to fruit set stage had a significantly positive effect on apple quality controlling swc to be 55 θf 70 θf obtained the best results and controlling swc to be 70 θf 85 θf obtained the second best results therefore the optimal water deficit treatment involves controlling swc to be 55 θf 70 θf during the flowering to fruit set stage such treatment can enhance the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees in water scarce environments however because considerable rainfall occurred in 2016 and 2017 the s water deficit treatment could not be applied due to excessive rainfall during the flowering to fruit setting and fruit growth stages and further study is required to the effects of the s water deficit treatment in addition research investigating the effect of water deﬁcits during compound stages and multiple stages should be conducted in the future acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program no 2016yfc0400204 and by the national natural science foundation of china no 51479161

10962,assessing the potential impacts of climate change on cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield and water demand is crucial in allocating water resources in this study cotton yield and water requirement under future climate scenarios was evaluated in qira oasis china six general circulation models gcms under moderate and high representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 and elevated c o 2 eco2 concentration 218 502ppm were used to project climate for near 2041 2060 and far future 2061 2080 periods with current management practices the impacts of climate change on cotton yield and water requirement were simulated using the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 which was calibrated with experimental data 2007 2014 in a previous study for the study region the gcms predicted an increase of 2 38 c and 3 24 c in temperature and 3 5 and 5 3 mm in precipitation during the growing seasons april october for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively for 2041 2060 seed cotton yield was projected to increase by 0 24mg ha 1 5 6 under rcp4 5 and 0 19mg ha 1 4 5 under rcp8 5 comparing to the baseline yield of 4 23mg ha 1 however for 2061 2080 the model predicted a 0 32mg ha 1 7 6 yield increase under rcp4 5 but a 0 28mg ha 1 6 5 decrease under rcp8 5 the increased cotton yield was mainly attributable to the fertilization effect of eco2 dominating the detrimental effects of shorter growing seasons 8 0 9 5 days alleviated low temperature stress also slightly promoted cotton yield averaged across the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios simulated cropping season water requirement for the 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were 728mm and 706mm respectively an decrease by 7 5 and 10 3 relative to the present day baseline 786mm respectively this decrease was attributed to shorter growing seasons and eco2 these results suggest that the region s agricultural water crisis may be alleviated in the future keywords climate change gcms rzwqm2 model crop water requirement seed cotton yield 1 introduction according to the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 global warming has occurred in the recent past and will continue during the 21st century associated with the accumulation of greenhouse gases climate change is expected to decisively affect agricultural production cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a major irrigated cash crop in china s xinjiang province which accounts for 70 and 80 respectively in terms of national cotton production and acreage national bureau of statistic of china 2018 with the steep rise in the cost of irrigation water in 2016 farmers enthusiasm for planting corn zea mays l wheat triticum æstivum l and vegetable crops declined in contrast as a drought tolerant crop cotton is suitable for growing in regions with high soil salinity and or low irrigation availability accordingly a potential increase in cotton acreage is expected in xinjiang in a comprehensive assessment of agriculture and water management in the upper tarim river basin which took into account irrigation and river transmission losses huang et al 2018 warned of the risk of decreasing river discharge by the end of the 21st century if the area devoted to agricultural continued to expand using ricardian method wang et al 2009 analyzed the effects of temperature and precipitation on net crop revenues wheat maize and rice in china and showed that global warming and the projected increase in precipitation were likely to benefit irrigated farms as it would be profitable for farmers to switch from irrigation to rain fed agriculture and thereby save on irrigation costs however depending on regional conditions and crop cultivars climate change may have a negative impact on crop production although cereal production is projected to increase with the fertilizing effect of eco2 in northwest china piao et al 2010 the impact of increased temperature and eco2 on crop development has also extensively studied changes in temperature and eco2 have modified crop phenology badeck et al 2004 tao et al 2006 doi and katano 2008 current cotton cultivars growth period has shortened due to rising temperatures wang et al 2008 gérardeaux et al 2013 wang et al 2017 phenological changes lead to changes in cotton water requirement yields and water use efficiency especially in semi arid and arid regions the results of several investigators chun et al 2011 bassu et al 2014 liu et al 2019 covering a wide range of crops and regions indicated that eco2 could increase the crop dry matter accumulation and enhance crop yield due to increasing photosynthesis and reduce crop water requirement by decreasing stomatal conductance and transpiration in c3 plants an increase in the co2 o2 ratio at the chloroplast caused by eco2 improve the efficiency of net carbon gain through acceleration of the carboxylation reaction and inhibition of the oxygenation reaction ogren 2003 in c4 plants significant enhancement of photosynthesis and growth by eco2 occurs only under water stress conditions morgan et al 2011 the fertilization effect of eco2 on c3 crop e g wheat soybeans cotton was more significant than c4 crop e g corn sorghum however photosynthetic rate would decrease when the air temperature exceeded a maximum temperature erice et al 2011 li and zhou 2015 reported that within xinjiang province water requirement for cotton would decrease in the future attavanich and mccarl 2014 also predicted that a 65 to 96 increase in cotton yields would occur due to the overriding effect of c o 2 fertilisation similarly williams et al 2015 reported that by 2030 the effects of c o 2 fertilisation would counteract the effect of decreased water availability and yield would increase by 5 9 vs the present however by 2050 cotton yield would decrease by 3 6 as the change in climatic parameters would then outweigh the benefits of c o 2 fertilisation in contrast other studies have revealed that increased temperature and changes in precipitation would offset the positive impacts of c o 2 fertilisation on crop yield hatfield et al 2011 paz et al 2012 hatfield and prueger 2015 especially under extreme heat studying the impact of climate change on cotton production in three major cotton producing regions of china between 1961 and 2010 chen et al 2015 found that increase in average temperature by 1 c increased cotton yields by 0 13 7 in both the northwest region and the yellow river valley where greater precipitation was expected however a decrease in diurnal temperature range would reduce cotton yield in some provinces using the infocrop model to simulate the impact of climate change on cotton production in india under different emission scenarios a2 b2 and a1b hebbar et al 2013 found that the projected higher temperature and lower precipitation might decrease cotton yield in northern india while eco2 would have no significant effects on cotton production the uncertainties in current studies arise from the wide range of climatic and agricultural systems models scenarios and sites used the effects of climate change on crop production have been studied through laboratory control experiment field co2 enrichment trials long term on site observation and model simulation compared with laboratory or field studies models have the advantage of being low cost high efficiency and affording an easy control of variables agricultural systems models are vital tools for evaluating the impact of climate change on crop water demand and yield as they comprehensively consider various environmental factors which are difficult to control in the field webber et al 2017 shelia et al 2019 one of the crop simulation models used for assessing climate change effects on cotton water requirement and yield is the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model yang et al 2014 used the apsim ozcot crop growth model to evaluate the response of cotton phenology yield and water use to climate change under the hadcm3 global climate model at alaer and shihezi xinjiang china their results showed shorter growing seasons and higher yield before 2070 due to the fertilization effect of eco2 however a decline in yield was simulated in the late 21st century due to a severe shortening of growth periods compared to single model approaches multiple climate models were found to provide a more representative range of climate change impacts tao et al 2009 kassie et al 2015 araya et al 2015 in addition dssat model appeared to be the most appropriate as it combines an acceptable set of physiological bases gérardeaux et al 2013 rahman et al 2018 integrating 29 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios used the dssat model to evaluate the potential impacts of climate variability on cotton production in pakistan under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the simulated cotton seed yield decreased by 8 and 12 respectively for year 2039 and 20 and 30 for year 2069 relative to the baseline 1980 2010 others voloudakis et al 2015 gérardeaux et al 2013 adhikari et al 2016 reported climate change impacts on cotton production using the aquacrop crop simulation model and the csm cropgro cotton model another system model used to project climate change effects on crop production is the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 ko et al 2012 wang et al 2015 assessed the potential effects of climate change and eco2 on n o 3 n losses and crop production using the rzwqm2 model using the rzwqm2 model to simulate climate change effects on corn production under current management practices including full or deficit irrigation regimes ma et al 2017 showed that by the end of the 21st century maize yield and biomass would decrease however studies evaluating the rzwqm2 model s ability to simulate cotton phenology yield and water requirement in response to future climate change are sparse in addition the stomatal resistance parameter in the shuttleworth wallace equation that computes potential crop transpiration as well as the photosynthetic rate of c3 crops are both affected by atmospheric co2 concentration c o 2 a t m therefore it possesses an advantage to assess the effects of climate change on evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation as simulated by rzwqm2 model agricultural water use accounts for the largest proportion 97 7 of total water requirement in the qira oasis approximately a quarter of irrigation water is extracted from groundwater hotan water resources planning 2013 which is directly pumped into water channels to flood irrigate the farmlands given such unsustainable farmland irrigation and water management strategies the annual average water shortage in the qira oasis ranges from 5 2 to 11 5 106m3 agricultural production contributes over 80 of the region s total gross domestic product gdp water demand for cotton one of the main agricultural crops in the region is mainly concentrated from april to august however there is lack of structures to store seasonal snowmelt water in early spring to meet the demand of local irrigation water demand in summer to maintain agricultural production farmers have intensified their exploitation of groundwater quantification of projected climate change impacts on cotton yield becomes particularly important for arid regions with a wide distributed planting acreage bange et al 2010 to sustain the production of cotton in arid regions it is imperative to understand the impacts of changes in temperature precipitation and c o 2 a t m on cotton yield and cotton crop water requirement in this paper we used the calibrated and validated rzwqm2 model which provided readily available crop and soil parameters liu et al 2017 coupled with future climate change projections drawn from six gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and eco2 six gcms climate projections simulated temperature and rainfall well in china were selected in this paper wu et al

quantify the effects of climate change on cotton production and crop water requirement and ii to assess climate change impacts and propose adaptation strategy in extremely arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region located on the southern rim of the taklimakan desert xinjiang northwest china and extending over an area of 274km2 the qira oasis 36 54 n 3709 n 8037 e 8059 e fig 1 was selected to represent an extremely arid region for which changes in cotton yield and water requirement under a projected future climate could be assessed the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 15 85 c and 42 62mm 1955 2000 respectively and the free water surface evaporation is 2700mm the soil texture is a fine sand the water supply to the qira oasis region depends strictly on endorheic river discharge which comes from a high altitude valley in the kunlun mountains xue et al 2017a b average annual runoff of qira river is approximately 1 23 108m3 1957 2008 compounded by the extension of farmlands the qira river s 0 285 106m3 decline in annual runoff between 1957 and 2008 has incited enormous challenges to agricultural water management in this region increased agricultural water demand causes the lower reaches of the qira river to frequent dry up 2 2 rzwqm2 model description in the present study the rzwqm2 model a hybrid model between rzwqm and dssat4 0 was used to evaluate the effect of climate change on cotton water requirement and production as a process oriented agricultural system model rzwqm2 can simulate long term effects of management and climate change on carbon nitrogen cycles and soil water plant processes ahuja et al 2000 management practices simulated in the model mainly includes crop variety selection planting and harvesting operations fertilizer tillage and irrigation cotton yield was simulated based on photothermal unit accumulation from planting to harvest using the csm cropgro cotton model dssat v4 5 incorporated into rzwqm2 tsuji et al 1998 crop yield is calculated from biomass allocated to growing organs which is affected by the amount of light intercepted by plants growing within an optimum temperature range the effect of co2 on cotton photosynthesis follows the michaelis menten equation islam et al 2012a optimal upper limited air temperature for cotton growth is 35 c the cardinal base and optimum temperatures for cotton development and reproduction are 16 5 c after emergence and 33 c respectively the temperature stress factor ft in csm cropgro cotton model is given in boote et al 1998 the formula of ft is given as 1 f t t t b t o 1 t b 1 1 t t o 2 t m t o 2 t t o 1 t o 1 t t o 2 t t o 2 where t is the ambient temperature t b is the base temperature t o 1 is the lowest temperature at which maximum rate is attained t o 2 is the upper temperature at which maximum rate is sustained t m is the maximum air temperature the rzwqm2 model was calibrated and validated using 2007 to 2014 crop and soil parameters from a previous field experiment in cele national station of observation research for desert grassland ecosystems chinese academy of sciences 37 01 n 80 43 e located in the qira oasis in this study the parameters used in the rzwqm2 model are consistent with those in liu et al 2017 which presented details in the calibration and validation of rzwqm2 for the qira oasis the experimental field plot characterized by a fine sand measured 150m north south 140m east west cotton cv ceke no 1 was planted at a 0 3m interrow spacing at an average rate of 40 plants m 2 with the exception of climate variables t m a x t m i n a n d p r e c i p i t a t i o n and c o 2 a t m all other parameters and agricultural management practices for the projected future climate scenarios were identical to those implemented during the baseline period planting date was set at apr 11 each year the average planting date of the 2006 2015 field experiments harvest date was set as the date of maturity 100 open bolls the crop water requirement was assumed to be equivalent to e t p o t which in this case was computed using rzwqm2 by assuming no water and no nitrogen stresses thereby precluding its interaction with climate change for both historical and future climate scenarios in the rzwqm2 model the shuttleworth wallace equation a modified penman monteith equation is used to calculate the e t p o t increased c o 2 a t m reduces transpiration due to an increase in stomatal resistance and increases yield due to an increased photosynthetic rate for cotton islam et al 2012a decreased potential transpiration demand caused by eco2 was considered in rzwqm2 model the decrease in potential transpiration decreases root water uptake and actual transpiration and reduces plant water stress islam et al 2012b cotton early maturity was planted at a 0 3m interrow spacing and 0 04m planting depth 2 3 meteorological data observed historical meteorological data including daily t m a x t m i n shortwave or solar radiation r

was used to convert sunshine hours n into r s mj m 2 changes in weather variables were calculated by subtracting the monthly averages of simulated historical weather data from the monthly average of simulated future climate data subsequently those monthly changes of each gcms were superimposed to the observed historical weather data to generate future weather data the monthly observed historical weather parameters during 1970 2000 april 1 to oct 31 were listed in supplemental material table a1 monthly t m a x t m i n a n d p of future climate under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios with a 5 longitude latitude degree spatial resolution was obtained from the world climglobal climate dataset http worldclim org which houses bias corrected global gridded layers hijmans et al 2005 the data available are the most recent gcms climate projections used in the fifth assessment ipcc report for four rcps in contrast with the special report on emission scenarios sres the rcps considered the impact of human responses to climate change in response to future emission scenarios among the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios the rcp2 6 scenario represents low emissions the rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios represent medium emissions and the rcp8 5 represents high emissions van vuuren et al 2011 accordingly the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were selected for this study the increase in projected monthly t m a x and t m i n and p were superimposed onto the daily baseline 1970 2000 to serve as future climate variables absolute relative percentage changes in r s v and rh of projected future climate scenarios were small to negligible wang et al 2015 so these meteorological parameters were assumed to remain unchanged each climate scenario model was run separately using the rzwqm2 model to simulate cotton growth and production the c o 2 a t m was set to 330ppm for the baseline period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the c o 2 a t m was set to 548ppm and 628ppm for the 2041 2060 period and 631ppm and 832ppm for 2061 2080 period respectively more details about future climate data used in rzwqm2 are given in supplemental material tables a2 a3 2 4 management practices for adaptation strategy various cotton cultivars and planting dates were fed into rzwqm2 model to optimize cotton yield under future climate in this region six cotton cultivars in the dssat csm cotton model database were tested using default parameters in the database which were listed in supplemental material table a4 planting dates of 10 20 30 40 days before or 10 20 days after the original planting date april 11th were selected when running the rzwqm2 model 2 5 statistical analysis the proc anova procedure of sas 9 2 software was used to determine the significance of mean difference in seed cotton yield e t p o t and water use efficiency wue as affected by climate change difference was considered significant at p 0 05 level using duncan s multiple range test for this purpose we assumed that year to year values of seed cotton yield e t p o t and wue were statistically independent as we simulated each climatic scenarios separately 3 results 3 1 projected future climate scenarios the predicted future climates showed increasing trends for both air temperature and precipitation the baseline average t m a x and t m i n during the growing season april 1 to oct 31 were 27 67 c and 20 58 c respectively and precipitation was 29 5mm for 2041 2060 the mean temperature during the growing season increased by 1 78 2 24 c and 2 46 2 94 c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 2 a and b in contrast for 2061 2080 the mean projected temperature increased by 1 82 2 81 c and 3 56 4 55 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 2c and d precipitation was projected to increase by 6 5 and 1 7 for 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively whilst for 2061 2080 the increase in precipitation was 4 8 and 5 7 respectively 3 2 climate change impact on cotton phenology the rzwqm2 model simulated cotton maturity was 8 days earlier than the baseline scenario for 2041 2060 and 9 5 days earlier for 2061 2080 when averaged across all climatic models and rcp scenarios a plot of cotton post sowing development stages for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 fig 3 a d shows that for both these future periods mean cotton emergence occurred 2 and 3 days earlier under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively likewise under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the mean flowering stage was shortened by 5 and 6 days for 2041 2060 respectively and the time to flowering for 2061 2080 was shortened by 6 and 8 days respectively fig 3e h the simulated mean boll cracking stage was shortened by 7 and 9 days for 2041 2060 and 8 and 11 days for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 3i l 3 3 seed cotton yield response to future climate change the rzwqm2 predicted a future increase in cotton yield except for the 2061 2080 period under the rcp8 5 scenario the simulated average seed cotton yield under the baseline was 4 23mg ha 1 an increases vs baseline of 0 24mg ha 1 5 6 and 0 19mg ha 1 4 5 were found for the average seed cotton yield for the 2041 2060 period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 4 a b for the 2041 2060 period the simulated average seed cotton yield under cn and mc climatic models were significantly higher than other climatic scenarios however simulated average seed cotton yield for 2061 2080 increased by 0 32mg ha 1 7 6 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 4c but decreased by 0 28mg ha 1 6 5 under the rcp8 5 scenario with a maximum reduction of 0 73mg ha 1 17 3 for the mp climate model fig 4d for the 2061 2080 period under the rcp4 5 scenario the simulated average seed cotton yield under bc and mg climatic models was significantly higher than other climatic scenarios the simulated average seed cotton yield under mp climatic model was significantly lower than other climatic scenarios for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 3 4 simulated crop water requirement under future climate change scenarios the simulated average cotton water requirement from sowing to maturity table 1 declined from 786mm at baseline to 735mm in 2041 2060 and 693mm in 2061 2080 compared to the baseline the simulated e t p o t for 2041 2060 decreased by 51mm 7 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 65mm 8 under the rcp8 5 scenarios when averaged six gcms relative to the baseline the simulated e t p o t for 2061 2080 decreased by 68mm 9 and 93mm 12 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios when averaged six gcms respectively the differences for all climatic scenarios were insignificant except for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 scenario the simulated wue increased by 0 7kg ha mm 13 and 0 75kg ha mm 14 for 2041 2060 and 0 96kg ha mm 17 8 and 0 33kg ha mm 6 for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios comparing to baseline water use efficiency wue of 5 38kg ha mm respectively the wue under cn and mc climatic models for 2041 2060 was significantly higher than other climatic scenarios under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 due to significant increase in cotton yield compared to the baseline the simulated wue under cn mc and mg climatic models significant increased for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 scenario however a significant decrease in wue was simulated under mp climatic scenario for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 comparing to other climatic scenarios 3 5 adaptation strategy by cultivar and planting date selection the largest reduction in cotton yield predicted by the six gcms was with the mpi esm lr mp for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario therefore an adaptation strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change on cotton yield is proposed based on mp climate model the simulated effect of different cultivars and planting dates on seed cotton yield was evaluated under the mp climate model for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario table 2 compared to the baseline cultivar ceke no 1 the simulated seed cotton yield and wue were projected to increase for all cultivars except for tx0003 gp 3774 with a seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions sfdur and average seeds per pod under standard growing conditions sdpdv of 35 and 27 respectively cultivar ib0001 dp 77 showed the greatest yield 6 60mg ha 1 greater than the baseline cultivar ceke no 1 3 50 mg ha 1 with a sfdur and sdpdv of 18 and 15 respectively the various model parameters for cotton cultivars ib0001 dp 77 and ceke no 1 are shown in table 3 the simulated seed cotton yield increased from 3 79 mg ha 1 to 4 38 mg ha 1 as the planting date varied from 10 to 40 days before the baseline but decreased from 2 36 mg ha 1 to 2 97 mg ha 1 as the planting date advanced from 10 to 20 days after the baseline the simulated effect of planting date on e t p o t was less affected 4 discussion 4 1 changes in temperature and precipitation huang et al 2018 projected increases of 2 18 3 03 c for 2041 2070 and of 2 69 4 99 c for 2071 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to a 1970 2000 baseline for a site in hotan on the southern rim of the taklimakan desert xinjiang the changes in mean p in the present study were much smaller than those reported by huang et al 2018 who found projected increases of 28 43 for 2041 2070 and 34 66 for 2071 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively however slight changes in rainfall would have little effect on simulating cotton growth owing to the baseline rainfall being quite small 29 5mm 4 2 cotton phenology and water requirement under all future climate scenarios the days to emergence flowering boll cracking and maturity for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were shorter than those for the baseline period fig 3 using the cosim cotton model associated with the centre regional climate model precis for a site in the shiyang river basin of northwestern china chen et al 2011 noted that simulated flowering and boll opening stages of cotton were significantly advanced by 5 and 17 days for 2071 2100 respectively when averaged across the a2 and b2 emission scenarios this shortening of the cotton s development also concurred with the results of yang et al 2014 who found that the cotton growing season in alaer xinjiang would be shortened by about 13 days in 2050 and 16 days in 2070 for a late maturity variety and about 22 days in 2050 and 26 days in 2070 for medium maturity variety the differences in projected cotton phenology may be caused by the selected crop cultivars crop model and regional conditions simulated crop water requirement agrees with those in luo et al 2015 which reported a decrease in cotton water use as simulated by ozcot model at moree goondiwindi and warren australia under irrigated condition in 2030 s both eco2 and future climate were considered the effects of eco2 and shorter growth period on cotton water use offset the negative impacts of increased temperatures increases in simulated e t p o t ranged from 85mm to 113mm 10 8 14 4 when only temperature increases without co2 fertilization effect fig 5 a the decrease in aet was due to simulated shorter growth period decreased in simulated e t p o t ranged from 9mm to 67mm 1 2 8 5 when eco2 in the absence of increased temperature fig 5b however yang et al 2014 reported that irrigation water increased by 35mm for 2050 and 32mm for 2070 with late maturity cultivar in alar xinjiang this may be caused by the selected different sites climatic scenarios cultivars and models the simulated low cotton water requirements in our study would probably alleviate the annual maximum environmental flow requirement 0 75 108 m3 which accounts for 58 8 of the natural river runoff in this region xue et al 2015 4 3 seed cotton yield the simulated increase in seed cotton yield in the present study was mainly attributable to the enhancement of c o 2 a t m from 330 to 832ppm under eco2 without temperature increases seed cotton yield for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 increased by 35 1 and 41 across rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 which was consistent with reddy and zhao 2005 who found a 35 of increase in cotton yield projected by the gossym model when only an increase in c o 2 a t m was considered luo et al 2015 reported that under irrigation conditions in australia increased cotton lint yield benefits from interactive effects of eco2 and future climate for 2020 2039 when compared with baseline climate 1980 1999 using the gossym model reddy et al 2002 indicated that a 10 of increase in cotton yields was simulated when the c o 2 a t m increased to 540ppm but a 9 decrease was ensued when both the climatic t m a x and t m i n precipitation radiation and wind speed and c o 2 a t m were changed our simulation results also showed that seed cotton yield would decrease by 22 4 and 28 6 for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively with baseline c o 2 a t m 330ppm and projected temperature increases fig 7 using the apsim model williams et al 2015 showed declines in simulated cotton yields of 3 for 2030 and 17 8 for 2050 when the effect of c o 2 fertilisation was not considered using the dssat model adhikari et al 2016 found a 4 17 of decrease in seed cotton yield when c o 2 a t m was assumed to be remain at 380ppm due to no water stress and slight changes in rainfall the impact of rainfall on cotton yield were small to negligible in the present paper however high temperature appeared to have a rather negative effect on yields voloudakis et al 2015 in the present paper a 3 56 4 55 c increase in temperature was projected under rcp8 5 that resulted in decrease in seed cotton yield by 6 5 for 2061 2080 which was similar to other studies involving c3 species in the literature using dssat model lal et al 1998 demonstrated that the positive effect of eco2 on wheat yield was nearly cancelled out when air temperature was increased by 3 c and wheat yield was decreased by 32 with a 5 c increase in air temperature and doubling of c o 2 a t m in addition the shorter growth period caused by higher temperature resulted in the severe decreases in seed cotton yield for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenarios in the present paper using rzwqm2 model saseendran et al 2016 showed seed cotton yield loss of 10 for 2080 under rcp8 5 due to the adverse effect of temperature superseded the fertilization effect of co2 in cotton growth when the ambient air temperature exceed 35 c cotton was subjected to high temperature stress in contrast low temperature stress occured when the ambient air temperature was below 15 c our simulation study suggested that the effects of potential low temperature stress on cotton growth might be alleviated in this region which in turn slightly increased cotton yield although heat temperature stress was aggravated under the increased air temperatures of future scenarios cold temperature stress was alleviated in cool days singh et al 2007 and luo 2011 indicated that there was a significant reduction in flower and boll retention at temperatures above 36 c luo et al 2014 also found that there would be more heat stress events when daily maximum temperature exceeded 35 c however most studies did not consider the effect of low temperature stress on crop growth the simulated average temperature stress factors for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 according to different climate model scenarios are shown in table 4 compared to the baseline the average variability of decreased low temperature stress factor t 15 c is greater than the increased high temperature stress t 36 c for all scenarios except for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario as cotton is a warm season crop high temperatures may be more conducive to crop growth if there is no water stress 4 4 adaptation strategy by cultivar and planting date selection seed cotton yield in the future increased when current cotton cultivars were replaced by cotton cultivars with longer growth period yang et al 2014 indicated that replacing faster maturing cotton cultivars by slower maturing cultivars might increase seed cotton yield moreover an early planting date was proven to be a relatively easy adaptation strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change on cotton yield in an extremely arid region sowing cotton one month earlier than the current planting date 11 april was found to be effective for seed cotton yield production in the future in this region these simulation results were similar to those of saseendran et al 2016 and rahman et al 2018 who reported that an earlier planting date five weeks or six weeks than the current planting date could enhance seed cotton yield in pakistan and lower mississippi delta region respectively the potential increase in water use should be taken into account when planting cotton cultivars with longer growth stages and sowing cotton earlier in this region however a too early planting date might increase the chances of cold stress luo et al 2016 selecting suitable cotton cultivars and planting date in combination with water saving irrigation technology may be a good choice for the local producers in the future 4 5 uncertainty of simulation significant differences in simulated average seed cotton yield under different climatic models were probably caused by the variation in maximum and minimum temperature under different climatic models supplemental material tables a2 a3 which suggested that the inclusion of multiple future climate models may reduce the uncertainty in climate change effect projection for example yang et al 2014 indicated that under the a2 scenarios cotton yield would increase by 0 43mg ha 1 by 2050 however they only used the hadcm3 global climate model to simulate cotton yield response to climate change in northwest china in the case of the dssat model limitations in crop growth were based largely on air temperature the model being less sensitive to eco2 than to elevated temperatures thorp et al 2014 rahman et al 2018 this may then have affected simulation accuracy in the present paper as dssat crop model was used in rzwqm2 in addition there are important considerations with respect to present crop models prediction of the effects of eco2 and high temperatures on crop yield these models may be too simplistic to provide realistic predictions of yield boote et al 2013 improving experimental studies on crop growth response to c o 2 fertilization and extremely high temperatures and incorporated data into crop models may help improve simulation accuracy 5 conclusions in this study through the aid of a well calibrated rzwqm2 model the effects of climate change on cotton yield and crop water requirement in an extremely arid region precipitation 40 mm y 1 were analyzed the simulated days to emergence flowering boll cracking and harvest stages for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were shorter for all of future climatic scenarios the model projected that seed cotton yield would increase for 2041 2060 with current management practices however an increase in seed cotton yield under rcp4 5 but a decrease under rcp8 5 for 2061 2080 were predicted in this region the increase in temperature alleviated low temperature stress which in turn slightly increased cotton yield simulated cotton water requirement decreased by 7 5 and 10 3 in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 when averaged over rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively in addition increases in average wue were simulated in this region for all future gcms significant differences in seed cotton yield water requirement and wue were found under different climatic scenarios this study suggested that climate change might alleviate agricultural water crisis in this area in the future however for the rcp8 5 scenario in 2061 2080 replacing cotton cultivars and earlier planting could mitigate the reduction of cotton yield due to future temperature increase acknowledgements this study was carried out during a visiting study at mcgill university and was

10962,assessing the potential impacts of climate change on cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield and water demand is crucial in allocating water resources in this study cotton yield and water requirement under future climate scenarios was evaluated in qira oasis china six general circulation models gcms under moderate and high representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios 4 5 and 8 5 and elevated c o 2 eco2 concentration 218 502ppm were used to project climate for near 2041 2060 and far future 2061 2080 periods with current management practices the impacts of climate change on cotton yield and water requirement were simulated using the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 which was calibrated with experimental data 2007 2014 in a previous study for the study region the gcms predicted an increase of 2 38 c and 3 24 c in temperature and 3 5 and 5 3 mm in precipitation during the growing seasons april october for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively for 2041 2060 seed cotton yield was projected to increase by 0 24mg ha 1 5 6 under rcp4 5 and 0 19mg ha 1 4 5 under rcp8 5 comparing to the baseline yield of 4 23mg ha 1 however for 2061 2080 the model predicted a 0 32mg ha 1 7 6 yield increase under rcp4 5 but a 0 28mg ha 1 6 5 decrease under rcp8 5 the increased cotton yield was mainly attributable to the fertilization effect of eco2 dominating the detrimental effects of shorter growing seasons 8 0 9 5 days alleviated low temperature stress also slightly promoted cotton yield averaged across the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios simulated cropping season water requirement for the 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were 728mm and 706mm respectively an decrease by 7 5 and 10 3 relative to the present day baseline 786mm respectively this decrease was attributed to shorter growing seasons and eco2 these results suggest that the region s agricultural water crisis may be alleviated in the future keywords climate change gcms rzwqm2 model crop water requirement seed cotton yield 1 introduction according to the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 global warming has occurred in the recent past and will continue during the 21st century associated with the accumulation of greenhouse gases climate change is expected to decisively affect agricultural production cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a major irrigated cash crop in china s xinjiang province which accounts for 70 and 80 respectively in terms of national cotton production and acreage national bureau of statistic of china 2018 with the steep rise in the cost of irrigation water in 2016 farmers enthusiasm for planting corn zea mays l wheat triticum æstivum l and vegetable crops declined in contrast as a drought tolerant crop cotton is suitable for growing in regions with high soil salinity and or low irrigation availability accordingly a potential increase in cotton acreage is expected in xinjiang in a comprehensive assessment of agriculture and water management in the upper tarim river basin which took into account irrigation and river transmission losses huang et al 2018 warned of the risk of decreasing river discharge by the end of the 21st century if the area devoted to agricultural continued to expand using ricardian method wang et al 2009 analyzed the effects of temperature and precipitation on net crop revenues wheat maize and rice in china and showed that global warming and the projected increase in precipitation were likely to benefit irrigated farms as it would be profitable for farmers to switch from irrigation to rain fed agriculture and thereby save on irrigation costs however depending on regional conditions and crop cultivars climate change may have a negative impact on crop production although cereal production is projected to increase with the fertilizing effect of eco2 in northwest china piao et al 2010 the impact of increased temperature and eco2 on crop development has also extensively studied changes in temperature and eco2 have modified crop phenology badeck et al 2004 tao et al 2006 doi and katano 2008 current cotton cultivars growth period has shortened due to rising temperatures wang et al 2008 gérardeaux et al 2013 wang et al 2017 phenological changes lead to changes in cotton water requirement yields and water use efficiency especially in semi arid and arid regions the results of several investigators chun et al 2011 bassu et al 2014 liu et al 2019 covering a wide range of crops and regions indicated that eco2 could increase the crop dry matter accumulation and enhance crop yield due to increasing photosynthesis and reduce crop water requirement by decreasing stomatal conductance and transpiration in c3 plants an increase in the co2 o2 ratio at the chloroplast caused by eco2 improve the efficiency of net carbon gain through acceleration of the carboxylation reaction and inhibition of the oxygenation reaction ogren 2003 in c4 plants significant enhancement of photosynthesis and growth by eco2 occurs only under water stress conditions morgan et al 2011 the fertilization effect of eco2 on c3 crop e g wheat soybeans cotton was more significant than c4 crop e g corn sorghum however photosynthetic rate would decrease when the air temperature exceeded a maximum temperature erice et al 2011 li and zhou 2015 reported that within xinjiang province water requirement for cotton would decrease in the future attavanich and mccarl 2014 also predicted that a 65 to 96 increase in cotton yields would occur due to the overriding effect of c o 2 fertilisation similarly williams et al 2015 reported that by 2030 the effects of c o 2 fertilisation would counteract the effect of decreased water availability and yield would increase by 5 9 vs the present however by 2050 cotton yield would decrease by 3 6 as the change in climatic parameters would then outweigh the benefits of c o 2 fertilisation in contrast other studies have revealed that increased temperature and changes in precipitation would offset the positive impacts of c o 2 fertilisation on crop yield hatfield et al 2011 paz et al 2012 hatfield and prueger 2015 especially under extreme heat studying the impact of climate change on cotton production in three major cotton producing regions of china between 1961 and 2010 chen et al 2015 found that increase in average temperature by 1 c increased cotton yields by 0 13 7 in both the northwest region and the yellow river valley where greater precipitation was expected however a decrease in diurnal temperature range would reduce cotton yield in some provinces using the infocrop model to simulate the impact of climate change on cotton production in india under different emission scenarios a2 b2 and a1b hebbar et al 2013 found that the projected higher temperature and lower precipitation might decrease cotton yield in northern india while eco2 would have no significant effects on cotton production the uncertainties in current studies arise from the wide range of climatic and agricultural systems models scenarios and sites used the effects of climate change on crop production have been studied through laboratory control experiment field co2 enrichment trials long term on site observation and model simulation compared with laboratory or field studies models have the advantage of being low cost high efficiency and affording an easy control of variables agricultural systems models are vital tools for evaluating the impact of climate change on crop water demand and yield as they comprehensively consider various environmental factors which are difficult to control in the field webber et al 2017 shelia et al 2019 one of the crop simulation models used for assessing climate change effects on cotton water requirement and yield is the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model yang et al 2014 used the apsim ozcot crop growth model to evaluate the response of cotton phenology yield and water use to climate change under the hadcm3 global climate model at alaer and shihezi xinjiang china their results showed shorter growing seasons and higher yield before 2070 due to the fertilization effect of eco2 however a decline in yield was simulated in the late 21st century due to a severe shortening of growth periods compared to single model approaches multiple climate models were found to provide a more representative range of climate change impacts tao et al 2009 kassie et al 2015 araya et al 2015 in addition dssat model appeared to be the most appropriate as it combines an acceptable set of physiological bases gérardeaux et al 2013 rahman et al 2018 integrating 29 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios used the dssat model to evaluate the potential impacts of climate variability on cotton production in pakistan under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the simulated cotton seed yield decreased by 8 and 12 respectively for year 2039 and 20 and 30 for year 2069 relative to the baseline 1980 2010 others voloudakis et al 2015 gérardeaux et al 2013 adhikari et al 2016 reported climate change impacts on cotton production using the aquacrop crop simulation model and the csm cropgro cotton model another system model used to project climate change effects on crop production is the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 ko et al 2012 wang et al 2015 assessed the potential effects of climate change and eco2 on n o 3 n losses and crop production using the rzwqm2 model using the rzwqm2 model to simulate climate change effects on corn production under current management practices including full or deficit irrigation regimes ma et al 2017 showed that by the end of the 21st century maize yield and biomass would decrease however studies evaluating the rzwqm2 model s ability to simulate cotton phenology yield and water requirement in response to future climate change are sparse in addition the stomatal resistance parameter in the shuttleworth wallace equation that computes potential crop transpiration as well as the photosynthetic rate of c3 crops are both affected by atmospheric co2 concentration c o 2 a t m therefore it possesses an advantage to assess the effects of climate change on evapotranspiration and biomass accumulation as simulated by rzwqm2 model agricultural water use accounts for the largest proportion 97 7 of total water requirement in the qira oasis approximately a quarter of irrigation water is extracted from groundwater hotan water resources planning 2013 which is directly pumped into water channels to flood irrigate the farmlands given such unsustainable farmland irrigation and water management strategies the annual average water shortage in the qira oasis ranges from 5 2 to 11 5 106m3 agricultural production contributes over 80 of the region s total gross domestic product gdp water demand for cotton one of the main agricultural crops in the region is mainly concentrated from april to august however there is lack of structures to store seasonal snowmelt water in early spring to meet the demand of local irrigation water demand in summer to maintain agricultural production farmers have intensified their exploitation of groundwater quantification of projected climate change impacts on cotton yield becomes particularly important for arid regions with a wide distributed planting acreage bange et al 2010 to sustain the production of cotton in arid regions it is imperative to understand the impacts of changes in temperature precipitation and c o 2 a t m on cotton yield and cotton crop water requirement in this paper we used the calibrated and validated rzwqm2 model which provided readily available crop and soil parameters liu et al 2017 coupled with future climate change projections drawn from six gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and eco2 six gcms climate projections simulated temperature and rainfall well in china were selected in this paper wu et al 2013 jiang and wu 2013 chen and frauenfeld 2014 the six gcms includes bcc csm1 1 bc ccsm4 cc cnrm cm5 cn miroc5 mc mri cgcm3 mg and mpi esm lr mp therefore the objectives of the study was i to quantify the effects of climate change on cotton production and crop water requirement and ii to assess climate change impacts and propose adaptation strategy in extremely arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region located on the southern rim of the taklimakan desert xinjiang northwest china and extending over an area of 274km2 the qira oasis 36 54 n 3709 n 8037 e 8059 e fig 1 was selected to represent an extremely arid region for which changes in cotton yield and water requirement under a projected future climate could be assessed the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 15 85 c and 42 62mm 1955 2000 respectively and the free water surface evaporation is 2700mm the soil texture is a fine sand the water supply to the qira oasis region depends strictly on endorheic river discharge which comes from a high altitude valley in the kunlun mountains xue et al 2017a b average annual runoff of qira river is approximately 1 23 108m3 1957 2008 compounded by the extension of farmlands the qira river s 0 285 106m3 decline in annual runoff between 1957 and 2008 has incited enormous challenges to agricultural water management in this region increased agricultural water demand causes the lower reaches of the qira river to frequent dry up 2 2 rzwqm2 model description in the present study the rzwqm2 model a hybrid model between rzwqm and dssat4 0 was used to evaluate the effect of climate change on cotton water requirement and production as a process oriented agricultural system model rzwqm2 can simulate long term effects of management and climate change on carbon nitrogen cycles and soil water plant processes ahuja et al 2000 management practices simulated in the model mainly includes crop variety selection planting and harvesting operations fertilizer tillage and irrigation cotton yield was simulated based on photothermal unit accumulation from planting to harvest using the csm cropgro cotton model dssat v4 5 incorporated into rzwqm2 tsuji et al 1998 crop yield is calculated from biomass allocated to growing organs which is affected by the amount of light intercepted by plants growing within an optimum temperature range the effect of co2 on cotton photosynthesis follows the michaelis menten equation islam et al 2012a optimal upper limited air temperature for cotton growth is 35 c the cardinal base and optimum temperatures for cotton development and reproduction are 16 5 c after emergence and 33 c respectively the temperature stress factor ft in csm cropgro cotton model is given in boote et al 1998 the formula of ft is given as 1 f t t t b t o 1 t b 1 1 t t o 2 t m t o 2 t t o 1 t o 1 t t o 2 t t o 2 where t is the ambient temperature t b is the base temperature t o 1 is the lowest temperature at which maximum rate is attained t o 2 is the upper temperature at which maximum rate is sustained t m is the maximum air temperature the rzwqm2 model was calibrated and validated using 2007 to 2014 crop and soil parameters from a previous field experiment in cele national station of observation research for desert grassland ecosystems chinese academy of sciences 37 01 n 80 43 e located in the qira oasis in this study the parameters used in the rzwqm2 model are consistent with those in liu et al 2017 which presented details in the calibration and validation of rzwqm2 for the qira oasis the experimental field plot characterized by a fine sand measured 150m north south 140m east west cotton cv ceke no 1 was planted at a 0 3m interrow spacing at an average rate of 40 plants m 2 with the exception of climate variables t m a x t m i n a n d p r e c i p i t a t i o n and c o 2 a t m all other parameters and agricultural management practices for the projected future climate scenarios were identical to those implemented during the baseline period planting date was set at apr 11 each year the average planting date of the 2006 2015 field experiments harvest date was set as the date of maturity 100 open bolls the crop water requirement was assumed to be equivalent to e t p o t which in this case was computed using rzwqm2 by assuming no water and no nitrogen stresses thereby precluding its interaction with climate change for both historical and future climate scenarios in the rzwqm2 model the shuttleworth wallace equation a modified penman monteith equation is used to calculate the e t p o t increased c o 2 a t m reduces transpiration due to an increase in stomatal resistance and increases yield due to an increased photosynthetic rate for cotton islam et al 2012a decreased potential transpiration demand caused by eco2 was considered in rzwqm2 model the decrease in potential transpiration decreases root water uptake and actual transpiration and reduces plant water stress islam et al 2012b cotton early maturity was planted at a 0 3m interrow spacing and 0 04m planting depth 2 3 meteorological data observed historical meteorological data including daily t m a x t m i n shortwave or solar radiation r s wind speed v relative humidity rh and precipitation p from 1970 to 2000 were downloaded from the china meteorological data sharing services system cmdsss http data cma cn the brock method brock 1981 was used to convert sunshine hours n into r s mj m 2 changes in weather variables were calculated by subtracting the monthly averages of simulated historical weather data from the monthly average of simulated future climate data subsequently those monthly changes of each gcms were superimposed to the observed historical weather data to generate future weather data the monthly observed historical weather parameters during 1970 2000 april 1 to oct 31 were listed in supplemental material table a1 monthly t m a x t m i n a n d p of future climate under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios with a 5 longitude latitude degree spatial resolution was obtained from the world climglobal climate dataset http worldclim org which houses bias corrected global gridded layers hijmans et al 2005 the data available are the most recent gcms climate projections used in the fifth assessment ipcc report for four rcps in contrast with the special report on emission scenarios sres the rcps considered the impact of human responses to climate change in response to future emission scenarios among the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios the rcp2 6 scenario represents low emissions the rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 scenarios represent medium emissions and the rcp8 5 represents high emissions van vuuren et al 2011 accordingly the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were selected for this study the increase in projected monthly t m a x and t m i n and p were superimposed onto the daily baseline 1970 2000 to serve as future climate variables absolute relative percentage changes in r s v and rh of projected future climate scenarios were small to negligible wang et al 2015 so these meteorological parameters were assumed to remain unchanged each climate scenario model was run separately using the rzwqm2 model to simulate cotton growth and production the c o 2 a t m was set to 330ppm for the baseline period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the c o 2 a t m was set to 548ppm and 628ppm for the 2041 2060 period and 631ppm and 832ppm for 2061 2080 period respectively more details about future climate data used in rzwqm2 are given in supplemental material tables a2 a3 2 4 management practices for adaptation strategy various cotton cultivars and planting dates were fed into rzwqm2 model to optimize cotton yield under future climate in this region six cotton cultivars in the dssat csm cotton model database were tested using default parameters in the database which were listed in supplemental material table a4 planting dates of 10 20 30 40 days before or 10 20 days after the original planting date april 11th were selected when running the rzwqm2 model 2 5 statistical analysis the proc anova procedure of sas 9 2 software was used to determine the significance of mean difference in seed cotton yield e t p o t and water use efficiency wue as affected by climate change difference was considered significant at p 0 05 level using duncan s multiple range test for this purpose we assumed that year to year values of seed cotton yield e t p o t and wue were statistically independent as we simulated each climatic scenarios separately 3 results 3 1 projected future climate scenarios the predicted future climates showed increasing trends for both air temperature and precipitation the baseline average t m a x and t m i n during the growing season april 1 to oct 31 were 27 67 c and 20 58 c respectively and precipitation was 29 5mm for 2041 2060 the mean temperature during the growing season increased by 1 78 2 24 c and 2 46 2 94 c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 2 a and b in contrast for 2061 2080 the mean projected temperature increased by 1 82 2 81 c and 3 56 4 55 c under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 2c and d precipitation was projected to increase by 6 5 and 1 7 for 2041 2060 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively whilst for 2061 2080 the increase in precipitation was 4 8 and 5 7 respectively 3 2 climate change impact on cotton phenology the rzwqm2 model simulated cotton maturity was 8 days earlier than the baseline scenario for 2041 2060 and 9 5 days earlier for 2061 2080 when averaged across all climatic models and rcp scenarios a plot of cotton post sowing development stages for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 fig 3 a d shows that for both these future periods mean cotton emergence occurred 2 and 3 days earlier under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively likewise under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the mean flowering stage was shortened by 5 and 6 days for 2041 2060 respectively and the time to flowering for 2061 2080 was shortened by 6 and 8 days respectively fig 3e h the simulated mean boll cracking stage was shortened by 7 and 9 days for 2041 2060 and 8 and 11 days for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 3i l 3 3 seed cotton yield response to future climate change the rzwqm2 predicted a future increase in cotton yield except for the 2061 2080 period under the rcp8 5 scenario the simulated average seed cotton yield under the baseline was 4 23mg ha 1 an increases vs baseline of 0 24mg ha 1 5 6 and 0 19mg ha 1 4 5 were found for the average seed cotton yield for the 2041 2060 period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 4 a b for the 2041 2060 period the simulated average seed cotton yield under cn and mc climatic models were significantly higher than other climatic scenarios however simulated average seed cotton yield for 2061 2080 increased by 0 32mg ha 1 7 6 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 4c but decreased by 0 28mg ha 1 6 5 under the rcp8 5 scenario with a maximum reduction of 0 73mg ha 1 17 3 for the mp climate model fig 4d for the 2061 2080 period under the rcp4 5 scenario the simulated average seed cotton yield under bc and mg climatic models was significantly higher than other climatic scenarios the simulated average seed cotton yield under mp climatic model was significantly lower than other climatic scenarios for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 3 4 simulated crop water requirement under future climate change scenarios the simulated average cotton water requirement from sowing to maturity table 1 declined from 786mm at baseline to 735mm in 2041 2060 and 693mm in 2061 2080 compared to the baseline the simulated e t p o t for 2041 2060 decreased by 51mm 7 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 65mm 8 under the rcp8 5 scenarios when averaged six gcms relative to the baseline the simulated e t p o t for 2061 2080 decreased by 68mm 9 and 93mm 12 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios when averaged six gcms respectively the differences for all climatic scenarios were insignificant except for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 scenario the simulated wue increased by 0 7kg ha mm 13 and 0 75kg ha mm 14 for 2041 2060 and 0 96kg ha mm 17 8 and 0 33kg ha mm 6 for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios comparing to baseline water use efficiency wue of 5 38kg ha mm respectively the wue under cn and mc climatic models for 2041 2060 was significantly higher than other climatic scenarios under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 due to significant increase in cotton yield compared to the baseline the simulated wue under cn mc and mg climatic models significant increased for 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 scenario however a significant decrease in wue was simulated under mp climatic scenario for 2061 2080 under rcp8 5 comparing to other climatic scenarios 3 5 adaptation strategy by cultivar and planting date selection the largest reduction in cotton yield predicted by the six gcms was with the mpi esm lr mp for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario therefore an adaptation strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change on cotton yield is proposed based on mp climate model the simulated effect of different cultivars and planting dates on seed cotton yield was evaluated under the mp climate model for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario table 2 compared to the baseline cultivar ceke no 1 the simulated seed cotton yield and wue were projected to increase for all cultivars except for tx0003 gp 3774 with a seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions sfdur and average seeds per pod under standard growing conditions sdpdv of 35 and 27 respectively cultivar ib0001 dp 77 showed the greatest yield 6 60mg ha 1 greater than the baseline cultivar ceke no 1 3 50 mg ha 1 with a sfdur and sdpdv of 18 and 15 respectively the various model parameters for cotton cultivars ib0001 dp 77 and ceke no 1 are shown in table 3 the simulated seed cotton yield increased from 3 79 mg ha 1 to 4 38 mg ha 1 as the planting date varied from 10 to 40 days before the baseline but decreased from 2 36 mg ha 1 to 2 97 mg ha 1 as the planting date advanced from 10 to 20 days after the baseline the simulated effect of planting date on e t p o t was less affected 4 discussion 4 1 changes in temperature and precipitation huang et al 2018 projected increases of 2 18 3 03 c for 2041 2070 and of 2 69 4 99 c for 2071 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to a 1970 2000 baseline for a site in hotan on the southern rim of the taklimakan desert xinjiang the changes in mean p in the present study were much smaller than those reported by huang et al 2018 who found projected increases of 28 43 for 2041 2070 and 34 66 for 2071 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively however slight changes in rainfall would have little effect on simulating cotton growth owing to the baseline rainfall being quite small 29 5mm 4 2 cotton phenology and water requirement under all future climate scenarios the days to emergence flowering boll cracking and maturity for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were shorter than those for the baseline period fig 3 using the cosim cotton model associated with the centre regional climate model precis for a site in the shiyang river basin of northwestern china chen et al 2011 noted that simulated flowering and boll opening stages of cotton were significantly advanced by 5 and 17 days for 2071 2100 respectively when averaged across the a2 and b2 emission scenarios this shortening of the cotton s development also concurred with the results of yang et al 2014 who found that the cotton growing season in alaer xinjiang would be shortened by about 13 days in 2050 and 16 days in 2070 for a late maturity variety and about 22 days in 2050 and 26 days in 2070 for medium maturity variety the differences in projected cotton phenology may be caused by the selected crop cultivars crop model and regional conditions simulated crop water requirement agrees with those in luo et al 2015 which reported a decrease in cotton water use as simulated by ozcot model at moree goondiwindi and warren australia under irrigated condition in 2030 s both eco2 and future climate were considered the effects of eco2 and shorter growth period on cotton water use offset the negative impacts of increased temperatures increases in simulated e t p o t ranged from 85mm to 113mm 10 8 14 4 when only temperature increases without co2 fertilization effect fig 5 a the decrease in aet was due to simulated shorter growth period decreased in simulated e t p o t ranged from 9mm to 67mm 1 2 8 5 when eco2 in the absence of increased temperature fig 5b however yang et al 2014 reported that irrigation water increased by 35mm for 2050 and 32mm for 2070 with late maturity cultivar in alar xinjiang this may be caused by the selected different sites climatic scenarios cultivars and models the simulated low cotton water requirements in our study would probably alleviate the annual maximum environmental flow requirement 0 75 108 m3 which accounts for 58 8 of the natural river runoff in this region xue et al 2015 4 3 seed cotton yield the simulated increase in seed cotton yield in the present study was mainly attributable to the enhancement of c o 2 a t m from 330 to 832ppm under eco2 without temperature increases seed cotton yield for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 increased by 35 1 and 41 across rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6 which was consistent with reddy and zhao 2005 who found a 35 of increase in cotton yield projected by the gossym model when only an increase in c o 2 a t m was considered luo et al 2015 reported that under irrigation conditions in australia increased cotton lint yield benefits from interactive effects of eco2 and future climate for 2020 2039 when compared with baseline climate 1980 1999 using the gossym model reddy et al 2002 indicated that a 10 of increase in cotton yields was simulated when the c o 2 a t m increased to 540ppm but a 9 decrease was ensued when both the climatic t m a x and t m i n precipitation radiation and wind speed and c o 2 a t m were changed our simulation results also showed that seed cotton yield would decrease by 22 4 and 28 6 for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively with baseline c o 2 a t m 330ppm and projected temperature increases fig 7 using the apsim model williams et al 2015 showed declines in simulated cotton yields of 3 for 2030 and 17 8 for 2050 when the effect of c o 2 fertilisation was not considered using the dssat model adhikari et al 2016 found a 4 17 of decrease in seed cotton yield when c o 2 a t m was assumed to be remain at 380ppm due to no water stress and slight changes in rainfall the impact of rainfall on cotton yield were small to negligible in the present paper however high temperature appeared to have a rather negative effect on yields voloudakis et al 2015 in the present paper a 3 56 4 55 c increase in temperature was projected under rcp8 5 that resulted in decrease in seed cotton yield by 6 5 for 2061 2080 which was similar to other studies involving c3 species in the literature using dssat model lal et al 1998 demonstrated that the positive effect of eco2 on wheat yield was nearly cancelled out when air temperature was increased by 3 c and wheat yield was decreased by 32 with a 5 c increase in air temperature and doubling of c o 2 a t m in addition the shorter growth period caused by higher temperature resulted in the severe decreases in seed cotton yield for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenarios in the present paper using rzwqm2 model saseendran et al 2016 showed seed cotton yield loss of 10 for 2080 under rcp8 5 due to the adverse effect of temperature superseded the fertilization effect of co2 in cotton growth when the ambient air temperature exceed 35 c cotton was subjected to high temperature stress in contrast low temperature stress occured when the ambient air temperature was below 15 c our simulation study suggested that the effects of potential low temperature stress on cotton growth might be alleviated in this region which in turn slightly increased cotton yield although heat temperature stress was aggravated under the increased air temperatures of future scenarios cold temperature stress was alleviated in cool days singh et al 2007 and luo 2011 indicated that there was a significant reduction in flower and boll retention at temperatures above 36 c luo et al 2014 also found that there would be more heat stress events when daily maximum temperature exceeded 35 c however most studies did not consider the effect of low temperature stress on crop growth the simulated average temperature stress factors for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 according to different climate model scenarios are shown in table 4 compared to the baseline the average variability of decreased low temperature stress factor t 15 c is greater than the increased high temperature stress t 36 c for all scenarios except for 2061 2080 under the rcp8 5 scenario as cotton is a warm season crop high temperatures may be more conducive to crop growth if there is no water stress 4 4 adaptation strategy by cultivar and planting date selection seed cotton yield in the future increased when current cotton cultivars were replaced by cotton cultivars with longer growth period yang et al 2014 indicated that replacing faster maturing cotton cultivars by slower maturing cultivars might increase seed cotton yield moreover an early planting date was proven to be a relatively easy adaptation strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change on cotton yield in an extremely arid region sowing cotton one month earlier than the current planting date 11 april was found to be effective for seed cotton yield production in the future in this region these simulation results were similar to those of saseendran et al 2016 and rahman et al 2018 who reported that an earlier planting date five weeks or six weeks than the current planting date could enhance seed cotton yield in pakistan and lower mississippi delta region respectively the potential increase in water use should be taken into account when planting cotton cultivars with longer growth stages and sowing cotton earlier in this region however a too early planting date might increase the chances of cold stress luo et al 2016 selecting suitable cotton cultivars and planting date in combination with water saving irrigation technology may be a good choice for the local producers in the future 4 5 uncertainty of simulation significant differences in simulated average seed cotton yield under different climatic models were probably caused by the variation in maximum and minimum temperature under different climatic models supplemental material tables a2 a3 which suggested that the inclusion of multiple future climate models may reduce the uncertainty in climate change effect projection for example yang et al 2014 indicated that under the a2 scenarios cotton yield would increase by 0 43mg ha 1 by 2050 however they only used the hadcm3 global climate model to simulate cotton yield response to climate change in northwest china in the case of the dssat model limitations in crop growth were based largely on air temperature the model being less sensitive to eco2 than to elevated temperatures thorp et al 2014 rahman et al 2018 this may then have affected simulation accuracy in the present paper as dssat crop model was used in rzwqm2 in addition there are important considerations with respect to present crop models prediction of the effects of eco2 and high temperatures on crop yield these models may be too simplistic to provide realistic predictions of yield boote et al 2013 improving experimental studies on crop growth response to c o 2 fertilization and extremely high temperatures and incorporated data into crop models may help improve simulation accuracy 5 conclusions in this study through the aid of a well calibrated rzwqm2 model the effects of climate change on cotton yield and crop water requirement in an extremely arid region precipitation 40 mm y 1 were analyzed the simulated days to emergence flowering boll cracking and harvest stages for 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were shorter for all of future climatic scenarios the model projected that seed cotton yield would increase for 2041 2060 with current management practices however an increase in seed cotton yield under rcp4 5 but a decrease under rcp8 5 for 2061 2080 were predicted in this region the increase in temperature alleviated low temperature stress which in turn slightly increased cotton yield simulated cotton water requirement decreased by 7 5 and 10 3 in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 when averaged over rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively in addition increases in average wue were simulated in this region for all future gcms significant differences in seed cotton yield water requirement and wue were found under different climatic scenarios this study suggested that climate change might alleviate agricultural water crisis in this area in the future however for the rcp8 5 scenario in 2061 2080 replacing cotton cultivars and earlier planting could mitigate the reduction of cotton yield due to future temperature increase acknowledgements this study was carried out during a visiting study at mcgill university and was

10963,bangladesh is one of the most densely populated nations that nonetheless has largely achieved staple self sufficiency this development has been enabled in part by the rapid proliferation of small scale irrigation pumps that enabled double rice cropping as well as by a competitive market system in which farmers purchase water at affordable fee for service prices from private irrigation pump owners excess groundwater abstraction in areas of high shallow tube well density and increased fuel costs for pumping have however called into question the sustainability of bangladesh s groundwater irrigation economy cost saving agronomic methods are called for alongside aligned policies markets and farmers incentives the study assesses different institutions and water pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in bangladesh each of which varies in their incentive structure for water conservation and the level of economic risk involved for farmers and service providers using primary data collected from 139 irrigation service providers and 556 client farmers we empirically examine the structure of irrigation service types and associated market and institutional dimensions our findings demonstrate that competition among pump owners social capital and personal relationships and economic and agronomic risk perceptions of both pump owners and farmers significantly influence the structure of irrigation services and water pricing methods greater competition among pump owners increases the likelihood of pay per hour services and reduces the likelihood of crop harvest sharing arrangements based on these findings we explore policy implications for enhancing irrigation services and irrigation sustainability in bangladesh keywords boro rice

has underpinned this success according to brri 2019a in 1971 72 with a national average yield 1 28 ton ha total paddy rice produced in bangladesh was 11 1 mmt from 9 3 million ha of cultivated land in which the contribution of high yielding rice varieties was 16 1 1 8 mmt brri 2019b in contrast in 2017 18 with a national average yield 3 0 ton ha total paddy production in bangladesh was 36 3 mmt from 11 6 million ha of land this is 226 more than productivity levels observed in 1971 72 with the contribution of high yielding and stress tolerant cultivars increasing to 94 3 34 2 mmt brri 2019b during 1971 2018 the total rice area of bangladesh increased by 25 from 9 3 million ha in 1971 72 to 11 6 million ha in 2017 18 brri 2019b the implications of these changes on food self sufficiency are widely documented bera and kelley 2002 dorosh 2000 hossain 1988 hossain et al 2012 2007 2006 2003 mottaleb et al 2015 in contrast the contribution of small scale irrigation systems in bangladesh has received relatively less attention although it has been perhaps as equally important as the introduction of new varieties in the enhancement of cereal productivity in bangladesh as elaborated below after independence in 1971 the bangladesh government started investing heavily in irrigation and until 1979 ground and surface water pumping was largely government managed original emphasis was on pumping surface and ground water with the bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc supplying surface water irrigation pumps establishing deep tube wells dtws and subsidized fuel to farmer groups and individuals mottaleb et al 2017 small scale pump irrigation only rapidly expanded when the government privatized the irrigation facilities and liberalized agricultural machinery imports hossain 2009 mottaleb et al 2017 entrepreneurial farmers acquired irrigation pumps for their own land and then provided irrigation services to the neighboring farmers on a service for fee basis irrigation services and pricing can vary substantially across and within locales aggarwal 2007 dinar and subramanian 1997 garrido and calatrava 2010 johansson et al 2002 rhodes and sampath 1988 sampath 1992 wichelns 2010 bangladesh is no exception and over time different irrigation services payments methods and institutions have developed in rural economies chowdhury 2012 rahman et al 2015 payments for irrigation services are now primarily monetized but in kind payments through crop sharing are still common in parts of the country such service provision arrangements reduce monetary outlays for farmers and provide risk sharing mechanisms kajisa and sakurai 2005 monetized payments include fixed and variable rates that may or may not include fuel cost sharing by farmers irrigation services that imply real marginal costs e g volumetric irrigation water pricing and or extra fuel costs by farmers likely incentivize farmers to use water more efficiently and on a need based basis dinar and subramanian 1997 easter and liu 2005 these therefore appear to be more environmentally and socially desirable methods irrigation services and efficiency become particularly important against the backdrop of declining per capita availability of renewable internal freshwater resources throughout the developing world world bank 2019a bangladesh is primarily a downstream delta located in the eastern lower indo gangetic plains igp a relatively fertile plain area that is intensively cultivated declining groundwater tables are particularly prominent in the drier northwestern igp erenstein and thorpe 2011 and are only occasionally reported in specific locations of the more humid and flood prone eastern igp in bangladesh qureshi et al 2015 the total freshwater withdrawal in bangladesh in 2008 was 35 9 billion m³ of which 88 was used for crop irrigation world bank 2019b out of bangladesh s 8 million hectares of cropland 67 5 37 m ha is under irrigation of which 77 is derived from groundwater abstraction badc 2015 irrigation is particularly prominent for winter season boro rice with farmers applying 500 1000 l of water per kg of grain produced bouman 2009 despite being primarily a river delta with recurrent flooding the massive extraction of groundwater has resulted in gradually declining water tables in some locales particularly in rajshahi division and to some extent in khulna division by between 0 01 0 05 m yearly dey et al 2017 shamsudduha et al 2009 given the high population density and intensively double cropped rice systems these indications of declining groundwater tables are an increasing concern in parts of the country this calls for water saving agronomic methods alongside aligned policies markets and farmers incentives the study thereby assesses different institutions and water pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in bangladesh we examine the factors that affect varying irrigation payment methods in bangladesh in order to better inform incentives and policies to efficiently use irrigation water to our knowledge this is the first empirical attempt to examine the factors that influence types of irrigation contract choice between irrigation service providers and client farmers in bangladesh 2 evolution and expansion of mechanized irrigation in bangladesh aspiring to achieve food self sufficiency the government of bangladesh initially heavily invested in agricultural mechanization hossain 2009 justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 during the early green revolution of the 1960s farmers were encouraged to cultivate dwarf rice varieties apply fertilizer and irrigation to expand the irrigated area the government first established centralized irrigation systems from which the ground water based deep tube wells dtws and surface water based low lift pumps llps were supplied to farmers groups and cooperatives on rental basis until 1978 under the control of the badc the government also supplied fuel for pumping at a 75 subsidized rate hossain 2009 by 1978 a total of 9000 dtws and 35 000 llps were reportedly managed by badc ide 2012 in the early 1980s bangladesh undertook market liberalization policies gisselquist et al 2002 justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 earlier in 1970 in order to reduce the economic and operative burdens in badc began selling dtws and llps to farmers cooperatives and individual farmers over time the latter group became some of the original pump service providers hossain 2009 the proliferation of pump sets used for irrigation in bangladesh however accelerated in 1989 after the removal of several tariff and non tariff barriers on the imports of agricultural machinery including diesel engines justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 during that time the ban on the imports of small horsepower engines and other agricultural machinery by the private sector particularly from china was removed justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 restrictions of minimum distances between shallow tubewells stws to limit over abstraction were also abolished hossain 2009 these actions accelerated the proliferation of the private led small scale irrigation system in bangladesh fig 1 the shift to service provision for irrigation was also observed in other south asian countries particularly india and more recently in parts sub saharan africa where groundwater irrigation is feasible diao et al 2017 takeshima et al 2013 in 1982 83 bangladesh relied on a mix of stws llps and dtws to irrigate 1 52 million hectares of land table 1 the total rice and wheat productions were 13 63 and 1 10 mmt respectively in contrast in 2015 16 the irrigated area had increased nearly 5 fold to 5 million hectares of land with a more than 10 fold increase in irrigation pumps particularly stw s table 1 average cropping intensity the number of crops harvested from the same land per year reached 194 in 2017 18 bbs 2018b with total rice maize and wheat production in 2015 16 registered at 36 3 3 02 and 1 09 mmt respectively bbs 2019 2018b brri 2019a bangladesh is now self sufficient in rice production combined with increased economic growth this has resulted in a decline in extreme poverty hossain 2009 with the expansion of groundwater abstraction different forms of pump ownership and management have emerged chowdhury 2012 described five types of irrigation systems in bangladesh including 1 traditional methods e g swing basket 2 government managed and centralized canal irrigation projects and decentralized 3 llps 4 stws and 5 dtws initially the government provided considerable subsidies to establish dtws at present the establishment of dtws is primarily private with individuals and or groups of farmers or cooperatives owning and managing dtws command areas in contrast as a stw establishment is relatively less costly most stws are owned by individuals relatives and or friends owners of stw pumps usually enter into informal contractual agreements with client farmers for irrigation services with the size of the command area determined by the engine capacity as well as mutual agreements between client farmers and service providers different forms of irrigation water pricing and payment methods have subsequently emerged following the decentralization of badc s control over tube wells and llps the primary payment method for irrigation water that emerged was the sharing one fourth of the crop harvested by farmers with pump owners chowdhury 2012 rahman et al 2015 payment methods have evolved over time towards different forms of monetary systems these include cash payment per hour of pumping or a seasonal flat rate basis depending on crop type payment methods and the amount of payment per hectare still vary greatly even within small geographic areas rahman et al 2015 although volumetric pricing is rare krupnik et al 2015 3 conceptual framework and model specification 3 1 conceptual framework we hypothesize that irrigation water markets consisting of a pump owner and farmer clients settle on an irrigation water payment method that tends to maximize the profit of the pump owner while also minimizing farmers costs for purchasing irrigation services these actors ability to achieve such a mutually agreeable equilibrium payment method is likely to be associated with the negotiation power of the pump owner and client farmers in addition to other environmental market and exogenous factors in a functional form a mutually agreeable irrigation water payment method p m i between pump owner p and client farmers f can be represented as 1 p m i ζ p m p f e n p f n p p γ j i v c r ϛ i where p m i is the method of irrigation service payment that was chosen in the current season determined based on the interaction of the negotiation power of the pump owner n p p and the negotiation power of the client farmer n p f that maximizes pump owner profits ᴨ p and minimizes farmers irrigation costs c f within an irrigation command area p m p f e is conversely the payment method practiced in the previous year for the same crop note that because p m p f e is the payment method for irrigation decided in the previous year a new payment method p m i s is likely to be decided only through the interaction of both the pump owner and client farmers if the preexisting payment method p m p f e cannot ensure profit maximization and cost minimization for pump owners and farmers respectively the factor γ j includes environmental and domain variables such as the competition among pump owners which can be captured by the density of irrigation service providers in a village and water availability in the cropping season while i v includes irrigation scheme specific characteristics such as the quality of field drainage arrow 1968 and otsuka and hayami 1988 assert that the presence of a strong patron client type community relationship can mitigate market failure problems and ensure pareto optimality in eq 1 the variable c r is the indicator of the community relationship between the pump owner and the client farmers lastly ϛ i is the random error term several factors can influence the negotiation power of pump owners n p p and the client famers n p f for example the perceptions of drought or market risk and willingness to act irrigate under different levels of risk social networks human and social capital and physical assets such as landholdings of the pump owner and the client farmer could influence price negotiation these factors can influence the negotiation power of the pump owner and the client farmer and therefore the irrigation water pricing method for example in an ideal environment a risk taking farmer may prefer to pay cash to the pump owner on fixed cost per hour basis or cash per season per unit of land basis because by doing so he or she can be the net residual claimer at the end of the rice production season in contrast a risk taking pump owner might prefer to choose crop sharing as his or her preferred method from which they can more reliably claim a portion of grain produced at the end of the season the degree of human and social capital and specifically the relationship between pump owners and client farmers can also influence negotiation power and as such the choice of the irrigation payment system in functional form this relationship can be described for farmers in eq 2 2 n p f ζ f f h c f r f s c f s r f p ᵟ i and for pump owners in eq 3 3 n p p ζ f p h c p r p s c p s r p f φ i in these equations n p p and n p f are the negotiation power of the pump owner and client farmer respectively h c p h c f are the level of human capital measured by years of formal schooling and r p and r f are the self assessed risk scores provided by pump owners and farmers respectively see section 3 2 s c p and s c f are the social capital and physical asset scores of the pump owner and client farmer s r p f and s r f p are an indicator of the social relationship between pump owner and client farmer and ᵟ i and φ i are error terms also described in section 3 2 we further hypothesize that the strength of the social relationship between pump owner and client farmer can vary and is likely to have a considerable degree of influence on the payment method for example both pump owner and the client farmer may be familial relatives and they could for example can reside in the same village shop in the same markets and may pray in the mosque these social interactions and their resulting relationships therefore can also influence irrigation water pricing payment methods and fees as it is infeasible to estimate all three eqs 1 3 separately to identify the factors influencing the method of irrigation payment in a particular location we developed reduced form functions collapsing eqs 1 3 separately separately for farmer clients eq 4 and pump owners eq 5 as follows for client farmers 4 p m s ζ p m f e h c f r f s c f s r f p γ j i v c

personal and social relation factors as well as human capital endowment and environment domain that can affect the mode of irrigation water payment method the resulting empirical model is specified as

payment method is on a cash per hour irrigation service basis or a value of two where farmers pay cash per season per land unit but farmers are not required to supply their own fuel the model assumes a value of three if farmers share a portion of their harvested crops with the pump owner for irrigation the default payment method p m s 0 is cash per season with client farmer supplying fuel

for pump owner and client farmers 4 data sources 4 1 study area and sampling this study is based on primary data collected from april 22 to june 8 in 2015 from 139 pump owners who provided irrigation services and from 556 farmer clients who purchased their irrigation services in bangladesh dry season boro rice is the major irrigated crop although some supplementary irrigation may also provided to the summer wet season aus and aman rice and other winter crops such as wheat or maize krupnik et al 2017 qureshi et al 2015 as the primary focus of this study is to examine the factors that affect the payment methods and amount of payment for irrigation services we focus on the dry season boro rice farmers and the irrigation service providers pump owners in the completed 2013 14 season we focused on two prevailing smallholder irrigation systems surface water irrigation using llps that are common in barishal division and ground water extraction using stws which are more common in north and west including dhaka rangpur and khulna divisions fig 2 pump owners were randomly selected based lists of irrigation service providers supplied by the department of agricultural extension after selecting the pump owner we requested them to supply the names of four client farmers who purchased irrigation services in the 2013 14 winter season of 89 pump owners and their 356 clients farmers were sampled from barishal division and a further 50 pump owners and 200 client farmers were sampled from dhaka khulna and rangpur divisions table 2 the sample thereby covers four divisions nine districts 12 sub districts 15 unions and 43 villages fig 2 according to badc 2015 out of 1 63 million dws stws and llps 19 3 were electrically powered with the remainder mainly reliant on diesel in our sample out of 139 irrigation schemes only six used electricity with the remainder using diesel 4 2 descriptive findings we identified four major irrigation payment methods fig 3 including 1 hourly payment in which farmer clients pay cash per hour to pump owners includes both with and without client fuel given our limited sample size 2 seasonal with client fuel in which client farmers pay a fixed cash rate per season per unit of land and in addition supply fuel or provide fuel costs for the full season 3 seasonal without client fuel where farmer clients pay a flat cash rate per season per unit of land without additional fuel charges and 4 crop sharing also known as share cropping in which farmer clients trade an agreed share of harvested grain and or straw typically 10 20 in lieu of cash for irrigation all of the sampled irrigation service providers were using the centrifugal pumps and practiced flood irrigation no solar irrigation pumps were identified and none of the sampled farmer clients or irrigation service providers used alternate wetting and drying awd or system of rice intensification sri techniques which was widely promoted but also critiqued in bangladesh and south asia to address the increasing water scarcity in rice based cropping systems bouman and tuong 2001 lampayan et al 2015 overall out of 556 sampled farmers and 139 service providers 9 practice the hourly system 32 used the seasonal system with client farmer fuel supply 51 used the seasonal without fuel and 8 crop sharing systems respectively a total of 512 client farmers and 128 service providers thus followed cash based payment services with only 44 sampled farmer clients and 11 service providers using sharecropping primarily in selected locales table 2 a total of 460 farmer clients and 115 service providers followed seasonal payment of which 282 farmers and 70 service providers paid a seasonal flat rate and the other 178 farmer clients and 45 service providers provided fuel or paid fuel costs the observed mix payment categories a base rate plus farmers supply or payment per unit of fuel used for irrigation services can be described as a two part tariff system dinar and subramanian 1997 easter and liu 2005 and to some extent incentivize need based irrigation as farmers can save on fuel costs the hourly payment service was split into two relatively small subsets 20 client farmers who also supplied fuel and another 32 only paying the hourly rate for simplicity we clubbed these groups together during analyses on average a client farmer allocated 0 22 ha land for boro rice in 2013 14 each sampled command areas had 19 client farmers with a mean command area of 5 74 ha table 3 on average more than 40 of the sampled client farmers reported that they participate in preparing within field canals and drainage systems on an annual voluntary basis nearly 77 reported irrigation water was sufficiently available in the 2013 14 boro season table 3 more than 95 of the sampled pump owners and client farmers live in the same village and nearly 74 pray in the same mosque or temple on average nearly 35 of the sampled client farmer and pump owners are relatives table 3 on average 43 pump owners operated in each sample village pump owners who worked on a crop share basis served 78 farmers on average each of whom cultivated 0 15 ha of boro rice on average the pump owner provided irrigation to 16 ha of land and there were only four irrigation providers in the same village table 3 in contrast other pump owners who worked on cash based services managed relatively small command areas smaller numbers of farmer clients who also had many alternative irrigation service providers 39 67 found in the same village table 3 these pump owners also used relatively lower horsepower pumps table 3 interestingly the client farmers engaged in cash based services cultivate larger boro on more land voluntary participation canal and drainage maintenance was not reported in share crop schemes and was only associated with cash based services 33 58 table 3 llps were comprised 100 of the sample where crop sharing was used and 54 69 where the cash payment was accepted table 3 on average farmers relying on hourly irrigation services paid bdt bangladesh taka 80 per hour 1 1 usd 1 bdt 83 approximately comprising bdt 56 per hour for farmer clients who provided fuel costs and bdt 95 per hour for those who did not in the 2013 14 boro season the price of diesel the major fuel of the irrigation pumps was bdt 70 l the seasonal irrigation service payments averaged a cost of bdt 25 200 ha but differed by modality table 4 the hourly irrigation service implied the lowest cost to farmer clients bdt 21 900 ha farmer clients in the crop sharing group paid the highest service charge sharing on average 16 7 of their harvests with the pump owners equivalent to bdt 32 300 ha 2 2 calculated based on the average yield per hectare of 5 89 tons and the price of rice at harvest per 40 kg was bdt 600 table 4 total seasonal boro production costs averaged bdt 90 800 ha for farmers in which 27 cost was derived from irrigation on average an irrigation engine consumed 401 l ha of diesel equivalent fuel for an entire season for irrigation however the fuel consumption in crop sharing arrangements was the lowest 174 l ha table 4 reflective of the more common use of llps compared to stws that are more energetically costly krupnik et al 2015 bangladesh is a net importer of crude oil and petroleum products during 2016 18 triennium average bangladesh imported 1 18 mmt of crude oil and 463 000 tons of refined petroleum products bpc 2018 at a value of worth of usd 3 38 billion gob 2018 although no solar irrigation pumps were found in our study the greenhouse gas implications of fossil fuel based irrigation relative to alternative power sources should be further studied table 4 also compares the gross irrigation service revenue to the pump owner being highest for crop sharing in contrast the boro rice yields were lowest for crop share services and highest for hourly services table 4 sampled farmer clients reported irrigation services were determined by local tradition 42 and to a lesser extent by the pump owner 23 in study areas table 5 however in the case of crop sharing survey respondents indicated that prior to the cropping season farmers and pump owners would meet and decide the crop share percentage based on current fuel and paddy prices pump owners provided a much longer list of the factors that they consider in determining irrigation pricing albeit a similar share acknowledged local tradition 47 more commonly though pricing decisions considered fuel price 83 consultation with client farmers 61 or simply following other nearby pump owners pricing systems 55 some respondents elaborated that members of an irrigation scheme pump owners and client farmers often meet before the beginning of the season to discuss and decide on irrigation service charges on average a sampled client farmer had 4 6 years of formal schooling 0 81 ha of land and five family members seven percent were engaged in off farm economic activities table 6 by contrast pump owners were somewhat better endowed with 6 7 years of schooling and 0 94 ha of land an on average more than five family members although with similar 8 engagement in off farm income generation considering risk taking profiles on average pump owners ranked themselves somewhat more risk taking mean score of 6 95 scores than farmer clients 6 21 score fifty nine percent of pump owners reported at least one blood relative engaged in politics or governmental positions against only 41 of the sampled farmers pump owners accepting crop share payments were endowed with less land 0 19 ha though they were more risk taking risk score of 7 36 than pump owners in the other groups farmer clients engaged in crop sharing were in general more resource constrained and risk averse and hence appear to be more interested in sharing risks with pump owners in the form of crop sharing agreement for irrigation water in contrast pump owners who opt for crop sharing are in general more risk taking and seemingly short on their own crop production or engaged in grain trading and hence interested in in kind produce payment as a compliment these various variables are included in our empirical estimation procedures discussed below 5 empirical findings factors influencing irrigation service choice we hypothesize the different irrigation services provide different incentive mechanisms to conserve water from farmer clients point of view using the seasonal with client fuel service a two part tariff payment as the default group in table 7 we anticipated the hourly rate to provide the biggest incentive to conserve pump fuel use which may be considered as a rough proxy for irrigation water compared the seasonal flat rate without farmer s fuel and crop sharing payments the number of irrigation service providers in a village is positively associated with the hourly service payment system for both pump owner and client farmer whereas the crop sharing method is strongly and negatively associated the findings suggest that competition among irrigation service providers thereby encourages the adoption of relatively water conserving irrigation services voluntary participation in irrigation command area maintenance which we used as a proxy for community relationship is negatively associated with seasonal payment without farmer client fuel supply systems in addition to crop sharing irrigation services for both pump owner and client farmer this suggests that the presence of a strong community relationship discourages flat rate irrigation services that are less efficient directly in terms of fuel and indirectly water the availability of irrigation water during the season was positively associated with crop sharing in the case of pump owners and all types of irrigation services compared to two part tariff methods for client farmers the poor drainage dummy was positively associated with crop sharing for both the pump owner and client farmer reflecting problems with canal and field water management in lower elevation areas of barisal division krupnik et al 2017 poor floodwater drainage systems tend to make the irrigated boro rice farming riskier and less productive with crop sharing allowing the partitioning of risks between farmers and pump owners while reducing the cash costs for the latter having a blood relative in a government job or active in politics positively affected only the seasonal flat rate without fuel use by farmers this could potentially be indicative of the farmers increased negotiation power where feasible more risk taking farmers likely prefer to reduce their reliance on seasonal flat rate without fuel and crop sharing systems which provide forms of risk sharing e g kajisa and sakurai 2005 and are therefore more favorably viewed by risk averse farmers relatively more educated pump owners and farmers are more likely to prefer a crop sharing method farmers that however derive most of their income from off farm employment also appear to be more likely to choose crop sharing or the seasonal flat rate without fuel systems possibly because they have higher assured opportunity costs interestingly the size of pump owner s landholdings was positively associated with the likelihood of using seasonal flat rate payments without fuel whereas client farmer farm size was negatively correlated with all irrigation services compared to the two part base tariff well off pump owners are economically more capable of bearing irrigation expenses including the cost of fuel for an entire season conversely economically affluent client farmers are more likely to choose the two part tariff in which farmers can be the residual claimer after paying the irrigation charge finally the social relation index between pump owner and farmers has negatively associated the likelihood of crop sharing suggesting that social bondage can increase incentives to opt for socially desirable payment systems but without such capital less risky and potentially more cost effective irrigation services may prevail compared to the two part tariff payment as a base the hourly seasonal flat rate and crop sharing payment systems are less prevalent in northern or western bangladesh where civil infrastructure is relatively more developed with greater cropping intensity mottaleb et al 2016 6 conclusions and policy recommendations bangladesh s privatization policies and the liberalization of machinery imports contributed to the rapid proliferation of small scale mechanized pumps and irrigation services provision using primary information collected from 556 farmers and 139 pump owners this study demonstrates that different irrigation service payment systems have emerged in bangladesh over time with a shift away from crop sharing towards cash based options this study unpacks the development of varying types of pricing systems and explores the factors that contributed to their differentiation today irrigation in bangladesh primarily relies on groundwater abstraction using a diesel engine and centrifugal pump with a significant environmental footprint currently out of 5 3 million ha of the total irrigated land 58 is irrigated by 1 31 million diesel engines badc 2015 on average 401 l of diesel were used to irrigate one ha of boro rice land during the 2013 14 winter season this equates to roughly 1 23 billion liters of diesel being consumed for in a single season stationary burning of one liter of diesel results in the release of 2 69 kg of direct and embodied carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2006 in a single boro season bangladesh thus produces 3 30 billion kg co2 from burning diesel for irrigation alone actual emissions from rice cropping are set to be even higher when accounting for pump efficiency losses groundwater depth and considering emissions of ch4 and n2o from soil water based processes related to agronomic management practices policy may want to explore alternative irrigation modalities including increased rural electrification electric motors solar irrigation options and more fuel efficient diesel pump alternatives that when appropriately managed could help mitigate these externalities our study demonstrates that bangladesh s irrigation payment systems are mainly groundwater based with traditional centrifugal pumps used for water abstraction recently projects led by the international maize and wheat improvement center cimmyt have introduced axial flow pumps afp that are suitable for surface water irrigation and respond to governmental policy priorities championing increased surface water use krupnik et al 2015 mottaleb 2018 afps can lift from 72 to 55 more water at 1 and 2 m lifts respectively compared to centrifugal llps with 51 and 21 greater fuel efficiency respectively mottaleb 2018 valle et al 2014 currently roughly 173 000 centrifugal llps are engaged in irrigating 1 16 million ha of land using surface water rapid replacement of the llps by afps cold help to mitigate some of the negative environmental ramifications of irrigation while offering pump owners and farmer clients opportunities for fuel and overall payment cost reductions respectively where appropriate awd can also be attempted qureshi et al 2015 although evidence in bangladesh indicates new irrigation pricing structures and business models that align pump owner and farmer clients interests for example volumetric based payment systems may be needed to encourage widespread adoption pearson et al 2018 other novel pricing systems are also being experimented with at this time including pay as you go dtw irrigation system that equates with volumetric water pricing using smart cards and automatic payment machines located at the pump source although this system remains in a pilot stage and is used only in select areas of northwest bangladesh islam 2016 these topics are similarly relevant to the irrigated systems that prevail in other south asian countries the study confirms that geography and pump type can influence the irrigation service choice in which farmer clients and pump owners in relatively riskier environments such as barisal division are more likely to choose crop sharing social capital and risk profiles also substantially influence irrigation payment types public support reducing crop production risks could potentially encourage risk averting farmers to choose more socially desirable water conserving irrigation services such as hourly or two part tariff methods that both constitute a variable production cost and hence provide an incentive to reduce the quantity of water applied finally our findings indicate that competition among pump owners could contribute to the emergence of socially desirable irrigation services with an in built incentive for water conservation these hypotheses however need to be verified with further research a major policy recommendation therefore will be how to encourage and maintain healthy competition among service providers to enhance smallholder adoption of sustainable and environmentally sounds irrigation practices alongside increased food security given bangladesh s pursuit of the

index calculation principal component analysis pca was used to generate the relation indices for each household based on information regarding whether or not the pump owner is a blood relative brother sister or first cousin of their client farmers yes 1 or 0 otherwise a dummy for whether or not client farmer and the pump owner live the same village yes 1 or 0 otherwise and a dummy for whether or not client farmer and pump owner pray in the same mosque or temple yes 1 or 0 otherwise while the importance of social interactions and repeated transactions in mitigating market failure is often recognized in the literature following the seminal papers of arrow 1968 and otsuka and hayami 1988 the application of social bonds and relations in influencing irrigation water pricing method and payment has not been previously explored pca is a multivariate procedure used to reduce dimensions of a dataset by aggregating similar variables through orthogonal liner combination mathematically from an initial set of n correlated variables pca creates orthogonal components where each component is a linear weighted combination of the original variables for n social interaction variables between pump owner and client farmer for instance where amn represents the weight for the m th principal component and the n th variable the weights for each principal component pc are given by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix shown in table a1 using first pc scores and the mean and standard deviation of the original dataset social relation indices were computed as follows a3 w j i n γ

10963,bangladesh is one of the most densely populated nations that nonetheless has largely achieved staple self sufficiency this development has been enabled in part by the rapid proliferation of small scale irrigation pumps that enabled double rice cropping as well as by a competitive market system in which farmers purchase water at affordable fee for service prices from private irrigation pump owners excess groundwater abstraction in areas of high shallow tube well density and increased fuel costs for pumping have however called into question the sustainability of bangladesh s groundwater irrigation economy cost saving agronomic methods are called for alongside aligned policies markets and farmers incentives the study assesses different institutions and water pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in bangladesh each of which varies in their incentive structure for water conservation and the level of economic risk involved for farmers and service providers using primary data collected from 139 irrigation service providers and 556 client farmers we empirically examine the structure of irrigation service types and associated market and institutional dimensions our findings demonstrate that competition among pump owners social capital and personal relationships and economic and agronomic risk perceptions of both pump owners and farmers significantly influence the structure of irrigation services and water pricing methods greater competition among pump owners increases the likelihood of pay per hour services and reduces the likelihood of crop harvest sharing arrangements based on these findings we explore policy implications for enhancing irrigation services and irrigation sustainability in bangladesh keywords boro rice

in the early 1970s its post independence era with a population of less than 70 million dorosh 2000 hossain 2009 bangladesh s population has more than doubled since 164 7 million in 2017 gob 2018 making it the 8th largest populace on a relatively modest land mass 93rd among 215 countries in terms geographic size and hence ranks among the top five most densely populated countries world bank 2019a yet the country is now almost self sufficient in staple food production ahmed et al 2000 dorosh 2000 hossain 2009 hossain et al 2007 1994 mottaleb et al 2015 this achievement comes despite low and declining per capita arable land due to population pressure and competition for other land uses united nations 2017 domestic rice and wheat production have more than doubled from an yearly average of 14 1 million metric tons mmt during 1971 1990 to 37 4 mmt in 2017 18 bbs 2018a 2017 brri 2019a the rapid adoption of modern high yielding varieties hyv along with the proliferation of irrigation has underpinned this success according to brri 2019a in 1971 72 with a national average yield 1 28 ton ha total paddy rice produced in bangladesh was 11 1 mmt from 9 3 million ha of cultivated land in which the contribution of high yielding rice varieties was 16 1 1 8 mmt brri 2019b in contrast in 2017 18 with a national average yield 3 0 ton ha total paddy production in bangladesh was 36 3 mmt from 11 6 million ha of land this is 226 more than productivity levels observed in 1971 72 with the contribution of high yielding and stress tolerant cultivars increasing to 94 3 34 2 mmt brri 2019b during 1971 2018 the total rice area of bangladesh increased by 25 from 9 3 million ha in 1971 72 to 11 6 million ha in 2017 18 brri 2019b the implications of these changes on food self sufficiency are widely documented bera and kelley 2002 dorosh 2000 hossain 1988 hossain et al 2012 2007 2006 2003 mottaleb et al 2015 in contrast the contribution of small scale irrigation systems in bangladesh has received relatively less attention although it has been perhaps as equally important as the introduction of new varieties in the enhancement of cereal productivity in bangladesh as elaborated below after independence in 1971 the bangladesh government started investing heavily in irrigation and until 1979 ground and surface water pumping was largely government managed original emphasis was on pumping surface and ground water with the bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc supplying surface water irrigation pumps establishing deep tube wells dtws and subsidized fuel to farmer groups and individuals mottaleb et al 2017 small scale pump irrigation only rapidly expanded when the government privatized the irrigation facilities and liberalized agricultural machinery imports hossain 2009 mottaleb et al 2017 entrepreneurial farmers acquired irrigation pumps for their own land and then provided irrigation services to the neighboring farmers on a service for fee basis irrigation services and pricing can vary substantially across and within locales aggarwal 2007 dinar and subramanian 1997 garrido and calatrava 2010 johansson et al 2002 rhodes and sampath 1988 sampath 1992 wichelns 2010 bangladesh is no exception and over time different irrigation services payments methods and institutions have developed in rural economies chowdhury 2012 rahman et al 2015 payments for irrigation services are now primarily monetized but in kind payments through crop sharing are still common in parts of the country such service provision arrangements reduce monetary outlays for farmers and provide risk sharing mechanisms kajisa and sakurai 2005 monetized payments include fixed and variable rates that may or may not include fuel cost sharing by farmers irrigation services that imply real marginal costs e g volumetric irrigation water pricing and or extra fuel costs by farmers likely incentivize farmers to use water more efficiently and on a need based basis dinar and subramanian 1997 easter and liu 2005 these therefore appear to be more environmentally and socially desirable methods irrigation services and efficiency become particularly important against the backdrop of declining per capita availability of renewable internal freshwater resources throughout the developing world world bank 2019a bangladesh is primarily a downstream delta located in the eastern lower indo gangetic plains igp a relatively fertile plain area that is intensively cultivated declining groundwater tables are particularly prominent in the drier northwestern igp erenstein and thorpe 2011 and are only occasionally reported in specific locations of the more humid and flood prone eastern igp in bangladesh qureshi et al 2015 the total freshwater withdrawal in bangladesh in 2008 was 35 9 billion m³ of which 88 was used for crop irrigation world bank 2019b out of bangladesh s 8 million hectares of cropland 67 5 37 m ha is under irrigation of which 77 is derived from groundwater abstraction badc 2015 irrigation is particularly prominent for winter season boro rice with farmers applying 500 1000 l of water per kg of grain produced bouman 2009 despite being primarily a river delta with recurrent flooding the massive extraction of groundwater has resulted in gradually declining water tables in some locales particularly in rajshahi division and to some extent in khulna division by between 0 01 0 05 m yearly dey et al 2017 shamsudduha et al 2009 given the high population density and intensively double cropped rice systems these indications of declining groundwater tables are an increasing concern in parts of the country this calls for water saving agronomic methods alongside aligned policies markets and farmers incentives the study thereby assesses different institutions and water pricing methods for irrigation services that have emerged in bangladesh we examine the factors that affect varying irrigation payment methods in bangladesh in order to better inform incentives and policies to efficiently use irrigation water to our knowledge this is the first empirical attempt to examine the factors that influence types of irrigation contract choice between irrigation service providers and client farmers in bangladesh 2 evolution and expansion of mechanized irrigation in bangladesh aspiring to achieve food self sufficiency the government of bangladesh initially heavily invested in agricultural mechanization hossain 2009 justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 during the early green revolution of the 1960s farmers were encouraged to cultivate dwarf rice varieties apply fertilizer and irrigation to expand the irrigated area the government first established centralized irrigation systems from which the ground water based deep tube wells dtws and surface water based low lift pumps llps were supplied to farmers groups and cooperatives on rental basis until 1978 under the control of the badc the government also supplied fuel for pumping at a 75 subsidized rate hossain 2009 by 1978 a total of 9000 dtws and 35 000 llps were reportedly managed by badc ide 2012 in the early 1980s bangladesh undertook market liberalization policies gisselquist et al 2002 justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 earlier in 1970 in order to reduce the economic and operative burdens in badc began selling dtws and llps to farmers cooperatives and individual farmers over time the latter group became some of the original pump service providers hossain 2009 the proliferation of pump sets used for irrigation in bangladesh however accelerated in 1989 after the removal of several tariff and non tariff barriers on the imports of agricultural machinery including diesel engines justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 during that time the ban on the imports of small horsepower engines and other agricultural machinery by the private sector particularly from china was removed justice and biggs 2013 mottaleb et al 2017 restrictions of minimum distances between shallow tubewells stws to limit over abstraction were also abolished hossain 2009 these actions accelerated the proliferation of the private led small scale irrigation system in bangladesh fig 1 the shift to service provision for irrigation was also observed in other south asian countries particularly india and more recently in parts sub saharan africa where groundwater irrigation is feasible diao et al 2017 takeshima et al 2013 in 1982 83 bangladesh relied on a mix of stws llps and dtws to irrigate 1 52 million hectares of land table 1 the total rice and wheat productions were 13 63 and 1 10 mmt respectively in contrast in 2015 16 the irrigated area had increased nearly 5 fold to 5 million hectares of land with a more than 10 fold increase in irrigation pumps particularly stw s table 1 average cropping intensity the number of crops harvested from the same land per year reached 194 in 2017 18 bbs 2018b with total rice maize and wheat production in 2015 16 registered at 36 3 3 02 and 1 09 mmt respectively bbs 2019 2018b brri 2019a bangladesh is now self sufficient in rice production combined with increased economic growth this has resulted in a decline in extreme poverty hossain 2009 with the expansion of groundwater abstraction different forms of pump ownership and management have emerged chowdhury 2012 described five types of irrigation systems in bangladesh including 1 traditional methods e g swing basket 2 government managed and centralized canal irrigation projects and decentralized 3 llps 4 stws and 5 dtws initially the government provided considerable subsidies to establish dtws at present the establishment of dtws is primarily private with individuals and or groups of farmers or cooperatives owning and managing dtws command areas in contrast as a stw establishment is relatively less costly most stws are owned by individuals relatives and or friends owners of stw pumps usually enter into informal contractual agreements with client farmers for irrigation services with the size of the command area determined by the engine capacity as well as mutual agreements between client farmers and service providers different forms of irrigation water pricing and payment methods have subsequently emerged following the decentralization of badc s control over tube wells and llps the primary payment method for irrigation water that emerged was the sharing one fourth of the crop harvested by farmers with pump owners chowdhury 2012 rahman et al 2015 payment methods have evolved over time towards different forms of monetary systems these include cash payment per hour of pumping or a seasonal flat rate basis depending on crop type payment methods and the amount of payment per hectare still vary greatly even within small geographic areas rahman et al 2015 although volumetric pricing is rare krupnik et al 2015 3 conceptual framework and model specification 3 1 conceptual framework we hypothesize that irrigation water markets consisting of a pump owner and farmer clients settle on an irrigation water payment method that tends to maximize the profit of the pump owner while also minimizing farmers costs for purchasing irrigation services these actors ability to achieve such a mutually agreeable equilibrium payment method is likely to be associated with the negotiation power of the pump owner and client farmers in addition to other environmental market and exogenous factors in a functional form a mutually agreeable irrigation water payment method p m i between pump owner p and client farmers f can be represented as 1 p m i ζ p m p f e n p f n p p γ j i v c r ϛ i where p m i is the method of irrigation service payment that was chosen in the current season determined based on the interaction of the negotiation power of the pump owner n p p and the negotiation power of the client farmer n p f that maximizes pump owner profits ᴨ p and minimizes farmers irrigation costs c f within an irrigation command area p m p f e is conversely the payment method practiced in the previous year for the same crop note that because p m p f e is the payment method for irrigation decided in the previous year a new payment method p m i s is likely to be decided only through the interaction of both the pump owner and client farmers if the preexisting payment method p m p f e cannot ensure profit maximization and cost minimization for pump owners and farmers respectively the factor γ j includes environmental and domain variables such as the competition among pump owners which can be captured by the density of irrigation service providers in a village and water availability in the cropping season while i v includes irrigation scheme specific characteristics such as the quality of field drainage arrow 1968 and otsuka and hayami 1988 assert that the presence of a strong patron client type community relationship can mitigate market failure problems and ensure pareto optimality in eq 1 the variable c r is the indicator of the community relationship between the pump owner and the client farmers lastly ϛ i is the random error term several factors can influence the negotiation power of pump owners n p p and the client famers n p f for example the perceptions of drought or market risk and willingness to act irrigate under different levels of risk social networks human and social capital and physical assets such as landholdings of the pump owner and the client farmer could influence price negotiation these factors can influence the negotiation power of the pump owner and the client farmer and therefore the irrigation water pricing method for example in an ideal environment a risk taking farmer may prefer to pay cash to the pump owner on fixed cost per hour basis or cash per season per unit of land basis because by doing so he or she can be the net residual claimer at the end of the rice production season in contrast a risk taking pump owner might prefer to choose crop sharing as his or her preferred method from which they can more reliably claim a portion of grain produced at the end of the season the degree of human and social capital and specifically the relationship between pump owners and client farmers can also influence negotiation power and as such the choice of the irrigation payment system in functional form this relationship can be described for farmers in eq 2 2 n p f ζ f f h c f r f s c f s r f p ᵟ i and for pump owners in eq 3 3 n p p ζ f p h c p r p s c p s r p f φ i in these equations n p p and n p f are the negotiation power of the pump owner and client farmer respectively h c p h c f are the level of human capital measured by years of formal schooling and r p and r f are the self assessed risk scores provided by pump owners and farmers respectively see section 3 2 s c p and s c f are the social capital and physical asset scores of the pump owner and client farmer s r p f and s r f p are an indicator of the social relationship between pump owner and client farmer and ᵟ i and φ i are error terms also described in section 3 2 we further hypothesize that the strength of the social relationship between pump owner and client farmer can vary and is likely to have a considerable degree of influence on the payment method for example both pump owner and the client farmer may be familial relatives and they could for example can reside in the same village shop in the same markets and may pray in the mosque these social interactions and their resulting relationships therefore can also influence irrigation water pricing payment methods and fees as it is infeasible to estimate all three eqs 1 3 separately to identify the factors influencing the method of irrigation payment in a particular location we developed reduced form functions collapsing eqs 1 3 separately separately for farmer clients eq 4 and pump owners eq 5 as follows for client farmers 4 p m s ζ p m f e h c f r f s c f s r f p γ j i v c

personal and social relation factors as well as human capital endowment and environment domain that can affect the mode of irrigation water payment method the resulting empirical model is specified as follows 6 p m s β 0 e v s β s h c i θ i ϓ i s o c i a l r e l a t i o n i n d e x i λ s n o r t h e r n r e g i o n d u m m y s ε i where p m s is the dependent variable that assumes a value of zero if the payment method in an irrigation scheme requiring cash payment seasonally per unit of land by the client farmer in addition to the supply of fuel from the farmer we assume a value one if the payment method is on a cash per hour irrigation service basis or a value of two where farmers pay cash per season per land unit but farmers are not required to supply their own fuel the model assumes a value of three if farmers share a portion of their harvested crops with the pump owner for irrigation the default payment method p m s 0 is cash per season with client farmer supplying fuel explanatory variables include a vector of irrigation scheme specific variables evi that include 1 the number of irrigation service providers pump owners operating in a sampled village 2 a dummy

variable value of one if there was no reported shortage of water in the pump command area at the peak of the boro rice season zero otherwise and 4 a dummy if the command area has a poor water drainage system value of one if excessive water accumulates within the irrigation scheme that causes stagnant waterlogging and that can potentially reduce crop productivity 0 otherwise the vector of variables hci is comprised of pump owner and client farmer specific variables including 5 familial relative dummies that assume a value of one if the pump owner and client farmer have at least one blood relative employed in a government sector or who works as or around local politicians zero otherwise 6 at the time of data collection we asked the sampled respondents on how much risk they usually take in their daily economic activities and asked them to score it in between zero to ten in which with zero indicating a completely risk averse attitude of the sampled pump owners and farmer clients and 10 indicating a strong preference for risk taking the self assessed general risk scores provided by pump owners and farmer clients are included in hci the vector hci includes some additional variables for the pump owner and client farmer 7 number of years of schooling 8 the household size measured by the number of immediate family members 9 area total land cultivated land ha during the boro season

relation indexi includes the social interaction indicators between a pump owner and client farmer this index is constructed by applying the principal component analysis pca to dummy variables for pump owner and client farmer familiar relations residence the same village and for owners and clients who pray in the same mosque or temple these variables are intended to capture the influence of the social and personal relationships on irrigation water payment method details of the process of generating the relation index are included in appendix a the northern region dummy is a dummy variable

for pump owner and client farmers 4 data sources 4 1 study area and sampling this study is based on primary data collected from april 22 to june 8 in 2015 from 139 pump owners who provided irrigation services and from 556 farmer clients who purchased their irrigation services in bangladesh dry season boro rice is the major irrigated crop although some supplementary irrigation may also provided to the summer wet season aus and aman rice and other winter crops such as wheat or maize krupnik et al 2017 qureshi et al 2015 as the primary focus of this study is to examine the factors that affect the payment methods and amount of payment for irrigation services we focus on the dry season boro rice farmers and the irrigation service providers pump owners in the completed 2013 14 season we focused on two prevailing smallholder irrigation systems surface water irrigation using llps that are common in barishal division and ground water extraction using stws which are more common in north and west including dhaka rangpur and khulna divisions fig 2 pump owners were randomly selected based lists of irrigation service providers supplied by the department of agricultural extension after selecting the pump owner we requested them to supply the names of four client farmers who purchased irrigation services in the 2013 14 winter season of 89 pump owners and their 356 clients farmers were sampled from barishal division and a further 50 pump owners and 200 client farmers were sampled from dhaka khulna and rangpur divisions table 2 the sample thereby covers four divisions nine districts 12 sub districts 15 unions and 43 villages fig 2 according to badc 2015 out of 1 63 million dws stws and llps 19 3 were electrically powered with the remainder mainly reliant on diesel in our sample out of 139 irrigation schemes only six used electricity with the remainder using diesel 4 2 descriptive findings we identified four major irrigation payment methods fig 3 including 1 hourly payment in which farmer clients pay cash per hour to pump owners includes both with and without client fuel given our limited sample size 2 seasonal with client fuel in which client farmers pay a fixed cash rate per season per unit of land and in addition supply fuel or provide fuel costs for the full season 3 seasonal without client fuel where farmer clients pay a flat cash rate per season per unit of land without additional fuel charges and 4 crop sharing also known as share cropping in which farmer clients trade an agreed share of harvested grain and or straw typically 10 20 in lieu of cash for irrigation all of the sampled irrigation service providers were using the centrifugal pumps and practiced flood irrigation no solar irrigation pumps were identified and none of the sampled farmer clients or irrigation service providers used alternate wetting and drying awd or system of rice intensification sri techniques which was widely promoted but also critiqued in bangladesh and south asia to address the increasing water scarcity in rice based cropping systems bouman and tuong 2001 lampayan et al 2015 overall out of 556 sampled farmers and 139 service providers 9 practice the hourly system 32 used the seasonal system with client farmer fuel supply 51 used the seasonal without fuel and 8 crop sharing systems respectively a total of 512 client farmers and 128 service providers thus followed cash based payment services with only 44 sampled farmer clients and 11 service providers using sharecropping primarily in selected locales table 2 a total of 460 farmer clients and 115 service providers followed seasonal payment of which 282 farmers and 70 service providers paid a seasonal flat rate and the other 178 farmer clients and 45 service providers provided fuel or paid fuel costs the observed mix payment categories a base rate plus farmers supply or payment per unit of fuel used for irrigation services can be described as a two part tariff system dinar and subramanian 1997 easter and liu 2005 and to some extent incentivize need based irrigation as farmers can save on fuel costs the hourly payment service was split into two relatively small subsets 20 client farmers who also supplied fuel and another 32 only paying the hourly rate for simplicity we clubbed these groups together during analyses on average a client farmer allocated 0 22 ha land for boro rice in 2013 14 each sampled command areas had 19 client farmers with a mean command area of 5 74 ha table 3 on average more than 40 of the sampled client farmers reported that they participate in preparing within field canals and drainage systems on an annual voluntary basis nearly 77 reported irrigation water was sufficiently available in the 2013 14 boro season table 3 more than 95 of the sampled pump owners and client farmers live in the same village and nearly 74 pray in the same mosque or temple on average nearly 35 of the sampled client farmer and pump owners are relatives table 3 on average 43 pump owners operated in each sample village pump owners who worked on a crop share basis served 78 farmers on average each of whom cultivated 0 15 ha of boro rice on average the pump owner provided irrigation to 16 ha of land and there were only four irrigation providers in the same village table 3 in contrast other pump owners who worked on cash based services managed relatively small command areas smaller numbers of farmer clients who also had many alternative irrigation service providers 39 67 found in the same village table 3 these pump owners also used relatively lower horsepower pumps table 3 interestingly the client farmers engaged in cash based services cultivate larger boro on more land voluntary participation canal and drainage maintenance was not reported in share crop schemes and was only associated with cash based services 33 58 table 3 llps were comprised 100 of the sample where crop sharing was used and 54 69 where the cash payment was accepted table 3 on average farmers relying on hourly irrigation services paid bdt bangladesh taka 80 per hour 1 1 usd 1 bdt 83 approximately comprising bdt 56 per hour for farmer clients who provided fuel costs and bdt 95 per hour for those who did not in the 2013 14 boro season the price of diesel the major fuel of the irrigation pumps was bdt 70 l the seasonal irrigation service payments averaged a cost of bdt 25 200 ha but differed by modality table 4 the hourly irrigation service implied the lowest cost to farmer clients bdt 21 900 ha farmer clients in the crop sharing group paid the highest service charge sharing on average 16 7 of their harvests with the pump owners equivalent to bdt 32 300 ha 2 2 calculated based on the average yield per hectare of 5 89 tons and the price of rice at harvest per 40 kg was bdt 600 table 4 total seasonal boro production costs averaged bdt 90 800 ha for farmers in which 27 cost was derived from irrigation on average an irrigation engine consumed 401 l ha of diesel equivalent fuel for an entire season for irrigation however the fuel consumption in crop sharing arrangements was the lowest 174 l ha table 4 reflective of the more common use of llps compared to stws that are more energetically costly krupnik et al 2015 bangladesh is a net importer of crude oil and petroleum products during 2016 18 triennium average bangladesh imported 1 18 mmt of crude oil and 463 000 tons of refined petroleum products bpc 2018 at a value of worth of usd 3 38 billion gob 2018 although no solar irrigation pumps were found in our study the greenhouse gas implications of fossil fuel based irrigation relative to alternative power sources should be further studied table 4 also compares the gross irrigation service revenue to the pump owner being highest for crop sharing in contrast the boro rice yields were lowest for crop share services and highest for hourly services table 4 sampled farmer clients reported irrigation services were determined by local tradition 42 and to a lesser extent by the pump owner 23 in study areas table 5 however in the case of crop sharing survey respondents indicated that prior to the cropping season farmers and pump owners would meet and decide the crop share percentage based on current fuel and paddy prices pump owners provided a much longer list of the factors that they consider in determining irrigation pricing albeit a similar share acknowledged local tradition 47 more commonly though pricing decisions considered fuel price 83 consultation with client farmers 61 or simply following other nearby pump owners pricing systems 55 some respondents elaborated that members of an irrigation scheme pump owners and client farmers often meet before the beginning of the season to discuss and decide on irrigation service charges on average a sampled client farmer had 4 6 years of formal schooling 0 81 ha of land and five family members seven percent were engaged in off farm economic activities table 6 by contrast pump owners were somewhat better endowed with 6 7 years of schooling and 0 94 ha of land an on average more than five family members although with similar 8 engagement in off farm income generation considering risk taking profiles on average pump owners ranked themselves somewhat more risk taking mean score of 6 95 scores than farmer clients 6 21 score fifty nine percent of pump owners reported at least one blood relative engaged in politics or governmental positions against only 41 of the sampled farmers pump owners accepting crop share payments were endowed with less land 0 19 ha though they were more risk taking risk score of 7 36 than pump owners in the other groups farmer clients engaged in crop sharing were in general more resource constrained and risk averse and hence appear to be more interested in sharing risks with pump owners in the form of crop sharing agreement for irrigation water in contrast pump owners who opt for crop sharing are in general more risk taking and seemingly short on their own crop production or engaged in grain trading and hence interested in in kind produce payment as a compliment these various variables are included in our empirical estimation procedures discussed below 5 empirical findings factors influencing irrigation service choice we hypothesize the different irrigation services provide different incentive mechanisms to conserve water from farmer clients point of view using the seasonal with client fuel service a two part tariff payment as the default group in table 7 we anticipated the hourly rate to provide the biggest incentive to conserve pump fuel use which may be considered as a rough proxy for irrigation water compared the seasonal flat rate without farmer s fuel and crop sharing payments the number of irrigation service providers in a village is positively associated with the hourly service payment system for both pump owner and client farmer whereas the crop sharing method is strongly and negatively associated the findings suggest that competition among irrigation service providers thereby encourages the adoption of relatively water conserving irrigation services voluntary participation in irrigation command area maintenance which we used as a proxy for community relationship is negatively associated with seasonal payment without farmer client fuel supply systems in addition to crop sharing irrigation services for both pump owner and client farmer this suggests that the presence of a strong community relationship discourages flat rate irrigation services that are less efficient directly in terms of fuel and indirectly water the availability of irrigation water during the season was positively associated with crop sharing in the case of pump owners and all types of irrigation services compared to two part tariff methods for client farmers the poor drainage dummy was positively associated with crop sharing for both the pump owner and client farmer reflecting problems with canal and field water management in lower elevation areas of barisal division krupnik et al 2017 poor floodwater drainage systems tend to make the irrigated boro rice farming riskier and less productive with crop sharing allowing the partitioning of risks between farmers and pump owners while reducing the cash costs for the latter having a blood relative in a government job or active in politics positively affected only the seasonal flat rate without fuel use by farmers this could potentially be indicative of the farmers increased negotiation power where feasible more risk taking farmers likely prefer to reduce their reliance on seasonal flat rate without fuel and crop sharing systems which provide forms of risk sharing e g kajisa and sakurai 2005 and are therefore more favorably viewed by risk averse farmers relatively more educated pump owners and farmers are more likely to prefer a crop sharing method farmers that however derive most of their income from off farm employment also appear to be more likely to choose crop sharing or the seasonal flat rate without fuel systems possibly because they have higher assured opportunity costs interestingly the size of pump owner s landholdings was positively associated with the likelihood of using seasonal flat rate payments without fuel whereas client farmer farm size was negatively correlated with all irrigation services compared to the two part base tariff well off pump owners are economically more capable of bearing irrigation expenses including the cost of fuel for an entire season conversely economically affluent client farmers are more likely to choose the two part tariff in which farmers can be the residual claimer after paying the irrigation charge finally the social relation index between pump owner and farmers has negatively associated the likelihood of crop sharing suggesting that social bondage can increase incentives to opt for socially desirable payment systems but without such capital less risky and potentially more cost effective irrigation services may prevail compared to the two part tariff payment as a base the hourly seasonal flat rate and crop sharing payment systems are less prevalent in northern or western bangladesh where civil infrastructure is relatively more developed with greater cropping intensity mottaleb et al 2016 6 conclusions and policy recommendations bangladesh s privatization policies and the liberalization of machinery imports contributed to the rapid proliferation of small scale mechanized pumps and irrigation services provision using primary information collected from 556 farmers and 139 pump owners this study demonstrates that different irrigation service payment systems have emerged in bangladesh over time with a shift away from crop sharing towards cash based options this study unpacks the development of varying types of pricing systems and explores the factors that contributed to their differentiation today irrigation in bangladesh primarily relies on groundwater abstraction using a diesel engine and centrifugal pump with a significant environmental footprint currently out of 5 3 million ha of the total irrigated land 58 is irrigated by 1 31 million diesel engines badc 2015 on average 401 l of diesel were used to irrigate one ha of boro rice land during the 2013 14 winter season this equates to roughly 1 23 billion liters of diesel being consumed for in a single season stationary burning of one liter of diesel results in the release of 2 69 kg of direct and embodied carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2006 in a single boro season bangladesh thus produces 3 30 billion kg co2 from burning diesel for irrigation alone actual emissions from rice cropping are set to be even higher when accounting for pump efficiency losses groundwater depth and considering emissions of ch4 and n2o from soil water based processes related to agronomic management practices policy may want to explore alternative irrigation modalities including increased rural electrification electric motors solar irrigation options and more fuel efficient diesel pump alternatives that when appropriately managed could help mitigate these externalities our study demonstrates that bangladesh s irrigation payment systems are mainly groundwater based with traditional centrifugal pumps used for water abstraction recently projects led by the international maize and wheat improvement center cimmyt have introduced axial flow pumps afp that are suitable for surface water irrigation and respond to governmental policy priorities championing increased surface water use krupnik et al 2015 mottaleb 2018 afps can lift from 72 to 55 more water at 1 and 2 m lifts respectively compared to centrifugal llps with 51 and 21 greater fuel efficiency respectively mottaleb 2018 valle et al 2014 currently roughly 173 000 centrifugal llps are engaged in irrigating 1 16 million ha of land using surface water rapid replacement of the llps by afps cold help to mitigate some of the negative environmental ramifications of irrigation while offering pump owners and farmer clients opportunities for fuel and overall payment cost reductions respectively where appropriate awd can also be attempted qureshi et al 2015 although evidence in bangladesh indicates new irrigation pricing structures and business models that align pump owner and farmer clients interests for example volumetric based payment systems may be needed to encourage widespread adoption pearson et al 2018 other novel pricing systems are also being experimented with at this time including pay as you go dtw irrigation system that equates with volumetric water pricing using smart cards and automatic payment machines located at the pump source although this system remains in a pilot stage and is used only in select areas of northwest bangladesh islam 2016 these topics are similarly relevant to the irrigated systems that prevail in other south asian countries the study confirms that geography and pump type can influence the irrigation service choice in which farmer clients and pump owners in relatively riskier environments such as barisal division are more likely to choose crop sharing social capital and risk profiles also substantially influence irrigation payment types public support reducing crop production risks could potentially encourage risk averting farmers to choose more socially desirable water conserving irrigation services such as hourly or two part tariff methods that both constitute a variable production cost and hence provide an incentive to reduce the quantity of water applied finally our findings indicate that competition among pump owners could contribute to the emergence of socially desirable irrigation services with an in built incentive for water conservation these hypotheses however need to be verified with further research a major policy recommendation therefore will be how to encourage and maintain healthy competition among service providers to enhance smallholder adoption of sustainable and environmentally sounds irrigation practices alongside increased food security given bangladesh s pursuit of the

recognized in the literature following the seminal papers of arrow 1968 and otsuka and hayami 1988 the application of social bonds and relations in influencing irrigation water pricing method and payment has not been previously explored pca is a multivariate procedure used to reduce dimensions of a dataset by aggregating similar variables through orthogonal liner combination mathematically from an initial set of n correlated variables pca creates orthogonal components where each component is a linear weighted combination of the original variables for n social interaction variables between pump owner and client farmer for instance where amn represents the weight for the m th principal component and the n th variable the weights for each principal component pc are given by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix shown in table a1 using first pc scores and the mean and standard deviation of the original dataset social relation indices were computed as follows a3 w j i n γ

10964,processing tomato is a widespread crop in the mediterranean area where often there are problems of high salinity of irrigation water with considerable harmful effects on yield pyraclostrobin is a strobilurin based fungicide pbf having a broad range of applications strobilurins are reported to have biostimulant effect on plant mitigating abiotic stress therefore the objective of this work was to investigate the ability of pbf to improve gas exchange parameters chlorophyll activity of antioxidative enzymes as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx yield characteristics and water use efficiency wue of tomato under salinity a two year research was carried out in southern italy on tomato cv coronel grown in pots under plastic greenhouse to compare two soil salinity levels electrical conductivity ece 1 1 and 5 4 ds m 1 in combination with or without pbf as expected salinity had harmful effects on physiological and biochemical parameters of tomato that in turn affected yield and wue but improved fruit quality in fact salinity reduced fruit mean weight 19 0 and yield 21 4 and increased fruit blossom end rot 55 7 total soluble solids 18 2 and dry matter 18 5 content overall pbf increased leaf chlorophyll content 6 1 and the activity of sod pod cat and apx mainly under salinity moreover it reduced stomatal conductance 12 5 and transpiration 11 7 but improved assimilation rate 7 8 and intrinsic wue 23 3 that in turn increased yield 8 1 and yield wue 6 5 the improvement in yield produced by pbf was highest in salt stressed plants in view of the positive effects of pbf its use should be promoted in defence programs of tomato crop above all in areas with salinity problems keywords solanum lycopersicum salinity strobilurin gas exchange chlorophyll antioxidative enzymes 1 introduction high salinity is one of the main abiotic stresses causing agricultural production decline this problem is of particular importance in light of the growing irrigated agriculture worldwide it is reported that about 20 of agricultural land and 33 of irrigated areas are affected by salinity and these areas are growing at a rate of 10 per year fifty per cent of agricultural land can be affected by salinity by 2050 jamil et al 2011 in particular the risk of salinization impends on the soils of coastal agricultural areas where the water used for irrigation can have very high salt content due to the salinization of the aquifers by the marine intrusion polemio 2016 the phenomenon is widespread in several mediterranean countries such as italy scheidleger et al 2004 boari et al 2012 salinity is detrimental to crops as a consequence of its negative physiological biochemical and morphological effects which results in reduced biomass production and yield flagella et al 2002 munns 2002 the reduction of plant growth due to salinity is mainly determined by the following factors that contribute to the decline of the photosynthetic activity munns et al 2006 munns and tester 2008 i the increase of the osmotic pressure of the medium which reduces the plant ability to absorb water similar to water stress ii ionic excess e g na and cl up to a toxic level for plant cells iii ionic imbalance that affects the nutritional status of the plant and acts on the biochemical and metabolic components related to plant growth salt stress as well as other environmental stresses increases production of reactive oxygen species ros to the origin of oxidative stress in plant cells abdelgawad et al 2016 asadi karam and keramat 2017 ros are highly cytotoxic and can react with different biomolecules eg nucleic acids proteins lipids causing dna mutation protein denaturation lipid peroxidation until cell death kaur and zhawar 2016 nxele et al 2017 the elimination of ros can be achieved by the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx caverzan et al 2016 kaur and zhawar 2016 among the strategies that can be implemented to reduce the harmful effects of salinity we can mention some concerning the use of biostimulants that improve physiological and or biochemical processes of plants under stress boari et al 2014 2016 arya et al 2018 due to the similarity in many aspects of physiological response of plants to water and salt stress as well as the interesting results reported in literature concerning the biostimulant action of strobilurins in attenuating water stress it has been hypothesized that these latter compounds can alleviate also the detrimental effects of salinity strobilurins are a class of broad spectrum fungicides of natural origin from which various structural variants have been obtained wu and von tiedemann 2001 these natural molecules are produced by a group of fungi belonging to the basidiomycetes e g oudemansiella mucida schrad ex fr hoehn and strobilurus tenacellus pers ex fr singer agents of wood rot of some tree species bartlett et al 2002 the fungicidal action is carried out through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration of some pathogenic fungi of agricultural crops by blocking the electron transport at the outer side of the cytochrome bc1 complex balba 2007 in recent years several studies proved the complementary biostimulant properties of strobilurin based crop protection products to reduce water requirements and mitigate abiotic stress in fact after the application of these fungicides a change in the plant metabolism has been observed often with positive physiological effects including the increase in the production of abscisic acid aba and the activation of some enzymes involved in oxidative stress sod pod cat apx köehle et al 2003 liang et al 2018 which may improve gas exchange and water use efficiency wue especially under water stress conditions venancio et al 2003 joshi et al 2014 experimental findings on tomato under water stress and treated with strobilurins showed an improvement in the water status of the plant in terms of osmotic potential relative water content and water stress index gas exchange yield and wue giuliani et al 2011 cantore et al 2016 boari et al 2017 giuliani et al 2018 in addition a positive effect on nitrate reductase activity which results in improved nitrogen metabolism was observed joshi et al 2014 amaro et al 2018 it has also been shown that strobilurins promote the increase of chlorophyll chl and slow down its degradation baranyiova et al 2014 tomato worldwide the second most valuable vegetable crop next to potato battilani et al 2012 is common among open field crops in southern italy often in soils affected by salinity problems and or irrigated with saline water tomato is indicated as moderately sensitive to salinity flagella et al 2002 according to the mass and hoffman 1977 model as known several factors by different extent contribute to yield reduction due to salinity e g the number and mean weight of fruits and the percentage of waste mainly determined by the number of fruits affected by blossom end rot in relation to the salinity level the type of salts and the phenological phase impacted by salt stress cucci et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 the adverse effects of salinity on yield are offset by a significant improvement in the quality of fruits due to the increase in dry matter content total soluble solids and titratable acidity cantore et al 2008a 2012 which results in improved taste as occurred also under water deficit conditions colella et al 2014 candido et al 2015 because of the economic importance of tomato crop the spreading of salinity problem in many areas occupied by this crop and the economic damage that may result there is a growing interest in the search of new solutions that can mitigate the negative effects of salinity we hypothesized that a strobilurin based agrochemical pyraclostrobin in addition to fungicidal action may have a biostimulant action able to mitigate the harmful effects of salt stress on tomato plant as already noticed for water stress as far as we know there are no experimental findings in literature that have studied the interactive effect between salt stress and strobilurins therefore the aim of this work was to evaluate the single and combined effect of salinity and a pyraclostrobin based fungicide pbf on gas exchanges and related parameters some biochemical characteristics biomass yield quality and wue of tomato 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site characteristics the research was carried out for

to the different transplant date of the two years the two tomato crop cycles have been characterized by a different trend in air temperature in the first year when the transplant was performed on 20th july the daily minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures showed a stable trend until the end of august and then decreased thereafter in the second year on the other hand with transplantation on 2nd april the temperature trend was increasing from transplanting to harvesting fig 1 tmin ranged between 10 and 25 5 c while tmax between 17 5 and 38 c in 2010 in 2011 tmin ranged between 7 and 22 c while tmax between 15 and 34 c fig 1 daily maximum relative air humidity in both years ranged between 90 and 100 except in rare cases in which lower values were recorded the minimum daily relative humidity however was much more variable with values ranging between 20 and 90 in the first year and between 25 and 95 in the second one fig 1 3 2 soil salinity evapotranspiration and water supply soil ece during the tomato growing cycles underwent a slight increase about 1 2 ds m 1 as average of the two years as a consequence of salts supplied with irrigation water in fact from the transplant to the harvest time in s0 ece passed from about 1 1 to about 2 4 ds m 1 while in s1 these values ranged from about 5 4 to 6 5 ds m 1 table 1 etc as average of the treatments was about 81 and 72 l pot 1 respectively the first and second year on average this parameter underwent a 12 9 reduction between s0 and s1 and a slight increase on average 1 5 with the application of pbf table 2 since the irrigation was cut a few days before the harvest the total water supply tws was lower than etc in particular it ranged from 81 and 70 7 l pot 1 of s0 to 70 5 and 62 1 l pot 1 of s1 in the first and second year respectively table 2 3 3 gas exchange chlorophyll canopy temperature and leaf water potential salinity influenced all the examined physiological parameters of tomato plants table 3 in particular in saline treatment as the average of the two years a t gs and spad index decreased respectively by 19 0 27 7 28 3 and 2 2 while wuei ψl and tc increased respectively by 13 1 30 3 and 4 7 the decline of a t gs and spad showed a growing trend during the crop cycle the application of pbf affected some of the examined physiological parameters table 3 in particular in the measures performed after spraying pbf in py1 in respect to py0 a wuei and chl on average increased respectively of 7 8 23 3 and 6 1 while t and gs decreased on average by 11 7 and 12 5 respectively in both years in the last measuring date the positive effect of pbf on a and chl was higher in the saline treatment interaction salinity x pbf 3 4 antioxidant enzymes the activity of antioxidant enzymes was affected differently by salinity both in leaves and roots depending on the type of enzyme fig 2 in leaves the activity of sod cat and apx in the s1 treatment increased average of pbf treatments and years by 14 6 145 5 and 95 2 respectively compared to the control while in roots it increased by 4 9 29 5 and 37 6 respectively instead in the same conditions pod decreased by 17 1 and 11 1 in leaves and roots respectively pbf increased the antioxidant enzyme activity to a large extent in the salt treatment indeed the activity of all the evaluated enzymes was enhanced by the application of pbf both in leaves and roots on average salinity treatments and years by 41 2 and 28 9 sod 73 0 and 51 2 pod 120 2 and 53 5 cat 83 1 and 118 8 apx respectively fig 2 3 5 biomass yield characteristics and water use efficiency salinity caused a decline in dry biomass of shoots and fruits respectively by 12 4 and 18 0 and an increase in root shoot ratio dry biomass by 18 7 on average table 4 moreover in s1 total and marketable yield decreased on average by 24 7 and 21 4 respectively the decline in fruit size whose average weight decreased by 19 mainly contributed to the yield reduction due to salinity the salinity has also led to a 55 7 increase in the number of fruits with blossom end rot table 5 fruit dm tss ta ph and fi were not influenced by salinity in the first year however in the second year dm tss and ta increased respectively by 18 5 18 2 and 26 3 while the other three parameters did not change table 6 the chromatic characteristics of fruits showed some changes under salinity conditions in particular with reference to fruit surface l underwent an increase which resulted significant only in the first year 7 0 while a and b increased in both years on average 6 and 12 3 respectively on the fruit pulp salinity led to an increase in a and b on average by 5 8 and 12 7 table 7 wueb and wuey were not influenced by salinity in the first year while wuey decreased by 20 1 in the second one table 8 pbf affected biomass accumulation and yield while had no effect on fruit quality in particular the dry biomass of shoots and fruits in py1 increased by 5 1 and 9 0 respectively table 4 pbf resulted in an average increase by 7 9 and 8 1 in total and marketable yield respectively as well as by 5 9 in fruit mean weight the positive effect of pbf on yield was greater in the salt treatment interaction salinity x pbf levels table 5 fig 3 in addition pbf led to a significant increase on average 6 5 in wuey table 8 4 discussion 4 1 effect of salinity on physiological biochemical morphological and yield features of tomato as expected salinity negatively affected the gas exchange of tomato plants the increase in soil salinity initially causes the reduction of gs by osmotic effect and if the salinity stress lasts the toxic effect caused by a gradual na and cl ions accumulation in plant organs can occur such effect interferes with the ion balance in the cytoplasm munns and tester 2008 maathuis et al 2014 the decrease in gs leads to the simultaneous reduction of t and a generally as effect of osmotic stress t decreases more than a hernández and almansa 2002 parida and das 2005 but as the toxic effect appears a is more inhibited because of the damage suffered at the biochemical level munns and tester 2008 this would lead to an initial increase in wuei and a subsequent decrease lovelli et al 2012 in our trial the increase in wuei led us to hypothesize that salt stress experienced by tomato has been such as to make osmotic stress prevailing as it is also evident from the considerable reduction of the xylematic potential álvarez et al 2012 t reduction is also confirmed by tc data which in s1 increased as a consequence of the cooling effect reduction due to lower t sirault et al 2009 on the other hand also leaf chl content a toxic stress indicator zhang et al 2018 declined only at the last measurement date chl reduction can be attributed to the inhibition of saline induced chl biosynthesis khan 2006 which may be caused by nutritional imbalance the negative effects of salinity on a have led to the reduction of biomass production and to the variation in its partitioning also the production of biomass in salinity conditions is reduced both for decline in a and for the greater allocation of photosynthetates in roots to the detriment of leaves whose expansion can dramatically decrease further reducing photosynthesis maggio et al 2007 in fact an increase in the root shoot ratio was already reported as response to saline stress mainly due to osmotic effect rather than to a salt specific one hsiao and xu 2000 this is confirmed by our trial in which the root dry biomass remained unchanged for the two salinity levels while root shoot ratio increased with increase in salinity as obtained on tomatoes also by other authors albacete et al 2008 lovelli et al 2012 the higher proportion of the roots may constitute a typical mechanism of resistance to salt stress cassaniti et al 2012 salinity has led to a smaller yield reduction than expected based on the characteristics parameters values of maas and hoffman 1977 model for tomato in fact using the critical threshold 2 5 ds m 1 and slope 9 9 m ds 1 values reported in the literature for tomato flagella et al 2002 and considering the average ece recorded in s1 a 35 reduction in yield would be expected instead of 20 therefore we can consider that coronel the cultivar used in our trial presents a greater tolerance to salinity confirming the genotypic variability of tomato plant for this character as already observed by several authors cucci et al 2000 cantore et al 2008a yield reduction determined by salinity was mainly caused by the decline of fruit size other authors have shown that in the early phases of stress and with mild or moderate salt stress the reduction of mean weight of fruits prevails while with a stronger stress there is also a decrease in number of fruits due to both the reduction in number of flowers and fruit set cuartero and fernández munõz 1999 plants affected by salinity showed a high incidence of fruits with blossom end rot saline stress is considered among the predisposing factors of this disease due to the na ca2 antagonism at the origin of the nutritional imbalance that leads to the reduction of calcium in fruits grattan and grieve 1999 in the second year the salinity improved some quality traits of tomato in particular dm tss and ta as already demonstrated under salt cucci et al 2000 santamaria et al 2004 boari et al 2016 and water stress giuliani et al 2017 lovelli et al 2017 however in the first year no effect was observed probably due to the different cultivation time then ripening of fruits coincided with lower temperatures the very high dm and tss values recorded in the first year can be attributed to favourable environmental factors salinity did not have any effect on the fruit fi as noticed by cuartero et al 1996 instead with higher salinity levels other authors reported a decline in tomato fruit fi cantore et al 2012 salinity caused the increase in fruit red index a and yellow index b which are positively correlated to the lycopene and β carotene content respectively dumas et al 2003 cantore et al 2008b there are numerous experimental findings showing a positive effect of salt stress on the content of these important antioxidants improving tomato nutritional value ehret et al 2013 the wueb and wuey were not affected by salinity in the first year while wuey was negatively affected in the second one similar results for wueb have been reported by romero aranda et al 2001 and reina sánchez et al 2005 while al karaki 2000 reported a decline of this parameter in saline conditions this discrepancy might be attributed to the range of salinity tested by al karaki 2000 which was much higher than that used in our trial as well as by reina sánchez et al 2005 and romero aranda et al 2001 wuey reduction caused by salinity in the second year of our trial is in accordance with findings of romero aranda et al 2001 and reina sánchez et al 2005 actually the water used by the plant decreased with the increase in salinity to which a proportional reduction of total biomass was related while the fruit production decreased more drastically probably water uptake by plants under salinity conditions was primarily used to meet transpiration and vegetative growing demands and secondarily allocated to fruit growth ehret and ho 1986 johnson et al 1992 the different results obtained in the two years for the wuey were probably attributable to the different cultivation time and therefore to the different climatic conditions during the crop cycle 4 2 effect of pyraclostrobin on physiological biochemical morphological and yield features of tomato according to previous literature pbf influenced physiological and biochemical parameters of tomato with consequent effects on morphological and productive characteristics as well as wue moreover the interactive effect of pbf with salinity on physiological and productive performances of tomato was demonstrated thus confirming the hypotheses inspiring our experiment pbf reduced gs in agreement with previous findings on tomato cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2018 rice debona et al 2016 barley soybean and wheat nason et al al 2007 studies carried out on wheat grossmann et al 1999 nason et al 2007 and grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 showed that this would occur due to the increased production of aba a hormone notoriously involved in regulation of the stomatal opening venancio et al 2003 furthermore according to gs decline pbf reduced t as also previously observed as a result of the application of strobilurins on tomato marek et al 2018 wheat barley and soybean nason et al 2007 by applying azoxystrobin on tomato plants giuliani et al 2018 obtained genotype dependent results actually they found increase or no changes in t values depending on the considered cultivar thus demonstrating differences related to the genotype in the physiological responses to strobilurins even within the same species several studies showed the positive effect of strobilurins on the photosynthetic activity of tomato giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 and wheat baranyiova et al 2014 according to these results in our trial pbf promoted tomato a increase despite the concomitant decline of gs that reduced the flow of co2 to the photosynthetic sites this apparent contradiction can be explained by the increase in chl content that results in photosynthetic efficiency improvement contrasting results were obtained on rice debona et al 2016 soybean barley and wheat nason et al 2007 several experimental findings have highlighted the positive effect of strobilurins on chl biosynthesis ramos et al 2015 giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 schiattone 2018 as well as on slowing down its degradation green effect amaro et al 2018 liang et al 2018 the increase in pigment biosynthesis involves the improvement of nitrate reductase activity by strobilurins marek et al 2018 which by improving nitrogen metabolism viana and kiehl 2010 would rise its availability for the plant and therefore would also improve the formation of chl being its main constituent kluge et al 2014 the increase in nitrate reductase activity associated with the application of strobilurins beside tomato marek et al 2018 was also found in japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 maize barbosa et al 2011 and soybean soares et al 2011 on the other hand chl degradation slowing down would be determined by the effect of strobilurins on phytohormone balance in particular on one hand strobilurins would reduce the synthesis of ethylene giuliani et al 2019 a hormone notoriously involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chl on the other hand it would promote the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of the pigment delaying the senescence process grossmann et al 1999 amaro et al 2018 grossmann et al 1999 and venancio et al 2003 reported that in wheat bud tissue the kresoxim methyl strobilurin inhibits the biosynthesis of ethylene through the reduction of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc synthase activity the slowing of senescence was also related to the decline of lipid peroxidation as a consequence of the reduction of oxidative stress zhang et al 2010 amaro et al 2018 liang et al 2018 the enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes sod pod cat apx observed in our trial as a result of the application of pbf would confirm this latter hypothesis senescence is considered a process associated with ros li et al 2007 to counter the ros stress plants have evolved strategies in which antioxidant enzymes play an important role hadrami et al 2005 pompeu et al 2008 the pod cat and apx are key enzymes in the active oxygen scavenging system able to inhibit ros accumulation actually sod catalyses superoxide anion radicals o2 dismutation to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oxygen o2 while the three other enzymes provide to the h2o2 elimination preventing its toxic accumulation zhao et al 2007 under salt stress pbf determined a higher increase in chl and a compared to the salt control similar results were obtained on tomato under water deficit giuliani et al 2018 this can be explained by the increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes determined by pbf which may have played primary role in the control of oxidative processes promoted by saline stress similar findings were obtained on barley where the application of pbf inhibited the manifestation of the physiological leaf spot a physiological disease attributable to oxidative stress due to the doubling of pod activity köehle et al 2003 also other authors have found the improvement in the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes following the application of strobilurins on ginseng liang et al 2018 and japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 the increase in a and the decline in gs contributed to enhance tomato wuei as observed also by other authors ramos et al 2015 giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 indicating greater capacity to assimilate co2 with low water loss generating greater water saving and higher synthesis of photo assimilates similar effects after application of strobilurins were observed in grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 and winter wheat baranyiova et al 2014 as expected the better physiological performance due to the pbf allowed greater biosynthesis and translocation of photo assimilated to fruits resulting in increased tomato yield these results are consistent with literature reporting evidences that the application of strobilurins in tomato plants promote higher marketable fruit yield giuliani et al 2010 cantore et al 2016 marek et al 2018 giuliani et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated the increase in yield determined by strobilurins also in other crops such as japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 maize shetley et al 2015 beans jadoski et al 2015 soybean joshi et al 2014 and grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 the increase in fruit yield of pbf treated plants in our trial was higher in saline stress conditions confirming the best physiological performance promoted by pbf moreover the effect of pbf on wuey confirmed that the application of strobilurin could significantly improve wue related to fruit yield giuliani et al 2018 2019 therefore it can be said that this fungicide as well as the phytosanitary defence of tomato crop can contribute to increase its tolerance to salinity one of the most widespread and harmful abiotic stresses similar results were obtained on tomato subjected to water stress giuliani et al 2011 cantore et al 2016 an abiotic stress whose response of the plant presents many similarities with the salt stress 5 conclusions the results of the research confirmed the harmful effects of salinity at physiological and productive level and the positive one in terms of tomato quality coronel has proved to be a tomato cultivar more tolerant to salinity respect to the tolerance levels reported in classical literature wue was negatively influenced by salinity in the second year while in the first one it did not change demonstrating the influence that also environmental conditions may have on this parameter this research confirmed that pbf besides being a valid fungicide for the phytosanitary defence of many crops could have biostimulant effects on physiological and biochemical parameters that lead to an increase in yield and water use efficiency of tomato furthermore the hypothesis underlying the research was confirmed in fact as well as strobilurin based fungicides have proven effective in reducing water stress pbf reduced the negative effects of salt stress on tomato the results of this research obtained in a controlled environment would require further experimental confirmation at field scale however in view of the different experimental findings that have demonstrated the positive effect of strobilurins on the production and attenuation of water stress in open field it can be reasonably asserted that pbf applied in open field would increase tomato s tolerance to salinity however since it is a pesticide we do not believe its use should be exclusively aimed at reducing the salt stress but it should be destined mainly for phytosanitary defence and prefer it to other pesticides if the water and or soil salinity are a

10964,processing tomato is a widespread crop in the mediterranean area where often there are problems of high salinity of irrigation water with considerable harmful effects on yield pyraclostrobin is a strobilurin based fungicide pbf having a broad range of applications strobilurins are reported to have biostimulant effect on plant mitigating abiotic stress therefore the objective of this work was to investigate the ability of pbf to improve gas exchange parameters chlorophyll activity of antioxidative enzymes as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx yield characteristics and water use efficiency wue of tomato under salinity a two year research was carried out in southern italy on tomato cv coronel grown in pots under plastic greenhouse to compare two soil salinity levels electrical conductivity ece 1 1 and 5 4 ds m 1 in combination with or without pbf as expected salinity had harmful effects on physiological and biochemical parameters of tomato that in turn affected yield and wue but improved fruit quality in fact salinity reduced fruit mean weight 19 0 and yield 21 4 and increased fruit blossom end rot 55 7 total soluble solids 18 2 and dry matter 18 5 content overall pbf increased leaf chlorophyll content 6 1 and the activity of sod pod cat and apx mainly under salinity moreover it reduced stomatal conductance 12 5 and transpiration 11 7 but improved assimilation rate 7 8 and intrinsic wue 23 3 that in turn increased yield 8 1 and yield wue 6 5 the improvement in yield produced by pbf was highest in salt stressed plants in view of the positive effects of pbf its use should be promoted in defence programs of tomato crop above all in areas with salinity problems keywords solanum lycopersicum salinity strobilurin gas exchange chlorophyll antioxidative enzymes 1 introduction high salinity is one of the main abiotic stresses causing agricultural production decline this problem is of particular importance in light of the growing irrigated agriculture worldwide it is reported that about 20 of agricultural land and 33 of irrigated areas are affected by salinity and these areas are growing at a rate of 10 per year fifty per cent of agricultural land can be affected by salinity by 2050 jamil et al 2011 in particular the risk of salinization impends on the soils of coastal agricultural areas where the water used for irrigation can have very high salt content due to the salinization of the aquifers by the marine intrusion polemio 2016 the phenomenon is widespread in several mediterranean countries such as italy scheidleger et al 2004 boari et al 2012 salinity is detrimental to crops as a consequence of its negative physiological biochemical and morphological effects which results in reduced biomass production and yield flagella et al 2002 munns 2002 the reduction of plant growth due to salinity is mainly determined by the following factors that contribute to the decline of the photosynthetic activity munns et al 2006 munns and tester 2008 i the increase of the osmotic pressure of the medium which reduces the plant ability to absorb water similar to water stress ii ionic excess e g na and cl up to a toxic level for plant cells iii ionic imbalance that affects the nutritional status of the plant and acts on the biochemical and metabolic components related to plant growth salt stress as well as other environmental stresses increases production of reactive oxygen species ros to the origin of oxidative stress in plant cells abdelgawad et al 2016 asadi karam and keramat 2017 ros are highly cytotoxic and can react with different biomolecules eg nucleic acids proteins lipids causing dna mutation protein denaturation lipid peroxidation until cell death kaur and zhawar 2016 nxele et al 2017 the elimination of ros can be achieved by the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx caverzan et al 2016 kaur and zhawar 2016 among the strategies that can be implemented to reduce the harmful effects of salinity we can mention some concerning the use of biostimulants that improve physiological and or biochemical processes of plants under stress boari et al 2014 2016 arya et al 2018 due to the similarity in many aspects of physiological response of plants to water and salt stress as well as the interesting results reported in literature concerning the biostimulant action of strobilurins in attenuating water stress it has been hypothesized that these latter compounds can alleviate also the detrimental effects of salinity strobilurins are a class of broad spectrum fungicides of natural origin from which various structural variants have been obtained wu and von tiedemann 2001 these natural molecules are produced by a group of fungi belonging to the basidiomycetes e g oudemansiella mucida schrad ex fr hoehn and strobilurus tenacellus pers ex fr singer agents of wood rot of some tree species bartlett et al 2002 the fungicidal action is carried out through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration of some pathogenic fungi of agricultural crops by blocking the electron transport at the outer side of the cytochrome bc1 complex balba 2007 in recent years several studies proved the complementary biostimulant properties of strobilurin based crop protection products to reduce water requirements and mitigate abiotic stress in fact after the application of these fungicides a change in the plant metabolism has been observed often with positive physiological effects including the increase in the production of abscisic acid aba and the activation of some enzymes involved in oxidative stress sod pod cat apx köehle et al 2003 liang et al 2018 which may improve gas exchange and water use efficiency wue especially under water stress conditions venancio et al 2003 joshi et al 2014 experimental findings on tomato under water stress and treated with strobilurins showed an improvement in the water status of the plant in terms of osmotic potential relative water content and water stress index gas exchange yield and wue giuliani et al 2011 cantore et al 2016 boari et al 2017 giuliani et al 2018 in addition a positive effect on nitrate reductase activity which results in improved nitrogen metabolism was observed joshi et al 2014 amaro et al 2018 it has also been shown that strobilurins promote the increase of chlorophyll chl and slow down its degradation baranyiova et al 2014 tomato worldwide the second most valuable vegetable crop next to potato battilani et al 2012 is common among open field crops in southern italy often in soils affected by salinity problems and or irrigated with saline water tomato is indicated as moderately sensitive to salinity flagella et al 2002 according to the mass and hoffman 1977 model as known several factors by different extent contribute to yield reduction due to salinity e g the number and mean weight of fruits and the percentage of waste mainly determined by the number of fruits affected by blossom end rot in relation to the salinity level the type of salts and the phenological phase impacted by salt stress cucci et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 the adverse effects of salinity on yield are offset by a significant improvement in the quality of fruits due to the increase in dry matter content total soluble solids and titratable acidity cantore et al 2008a 2012 which results in improved taste as occurred also under water deficit conditions colella et al 2014 candido et al 2015 because of the economic importance of tomato crop the spreading of salinity problem in many areas occupied by this crop and the economic damage that may result there is a growing interest in the search of new solutions that can mitigate the negative effects of salinity we hypothesized that a strobilurin based agrochemical pyraclostrobin in addition to fungicidal action may have a biostimulant action able to mitigate the harmful effects of salt stress on tomato plant as already noticed for water stress as far as we know there are no experimental findings in literature that have studied the interactive effect between salt stress and strobilurins therefore the aim of this work was to evaluate the single and combined effect of salinity and a pyraclostrobin based fungicide pbf on gas exchanges and related parameters some biochemical characteristics biomass yield quality and wue of tomato 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site characteristics the research was carried out for

to the different transplant date of the two years the two tomato crop cycles have been characterized by a different trend in air temperature in the first year when the transplant was performed on 20th july the daily minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures showed a stable trend until the end of august and then decreased thereafter in the second year on the other hand with transplantation on 2nd april the temperature trend was increasing from transplanting to harvesting fig 1 tmin ranged between 10 and 25 5 c while tmax between 17 5 and 38 c in 2010 in 2011 tmin ranged between 7 and 22 c while tmax between 15 and 34 c fig 1 daily maximum relative air humidity in both years ranged between 90 and 100 except in rare cases in which lower values were recorded the minimum daily relative humidity however was much more variable with values ranging between 20 and 90 in the first year and between 25 and 95 in the second one fig 1 3 2 soil salinity evapotranspiration and water supply soil ece during the tomato growing cycles underwent a slight increase about 1 2 ds m 1 as average of the two years as a consequence of salts supplied with irrigation water in fact from the transplant to the harvest time in s0 ece passed from about 1 1 to about 2 4 ds m 1 while in s1 these values ranged from about 5 4 to 6 5 ds m 1 table 1 etc as average of the treatments was about 81 and 72 l pot 1 respectively the first and second year on average this parameter underwent a 12 9 reduction between s0 and s1 and a slight increase on average 1 5 with the application of pbf table 2 since the irrigation was cut a few days before the harvest the total water supply tws was lower than etc in particular it ranged from 81 and 70 7 l pot 1 of s0 to 70 5 and 62 1 l pot 1 of s1 in the first and second year respectively table 2 3 3 gas exchange chlorophyll canopy temperature and leaf water potential salinity influenced all the examined physiological parameters of tomato plants table 3 in particular in saline treatment as the average of the two years a t gs and spad index decreased respectively by 19 0 27 7 28 3 and 2 2 while wuei ψl and tc increased respectively by 13 1 30 3 and 4 7 the decline of a t gs and spad showed a growing trend during the crop cycle the application of pbf affected some of the examined physiological parameters table 3 in particular in the measures performed after spraying pbf in py1 in respect to py0 a wuei and chl on average increased respectively of 7 8 23 3 and 6 1 while t and gs decreased on average by 11 7 and 12 5 respectively in both years in the last measuring date the positive effect of pbf on a and chl was higher in the saline treatment interaction salinity x pbf 3 4 antioxidant enzymes the activity of antioxidant enzymes was affected differently by salinity both in leaves and roots depending on the type of enzyme fig 2 in leaves the activity of sod cat and apx in the s1 treatment increased average of pbf treatments and years by 14 6 145 5 and 95 2 respectively compared to the control while in roots it increased by 4 9 29 5 and 37 6 respectively instead in the same conditions pod decreased by 17 1 and 11 1 in leaves and roots respectively pbf increased the antioxidant enzyme activity to a large extent in the salt treatment indeed the activity of all the evaluated enzymes was enhanced by the application of pbf both in leaves and roots on average salinity treatments and years by 41 2 and 28 9 sod 73 0 and 51 2 pod 120 2 and 53 5 cat 83 1 and 118 8 apx respectively fig 2 3 5 biomass yield characteristics and water use efficiency salinity caused a decline in dry biomass of shoots and fruits respectively by 12 4 and 18 0 and an increase in root shoot ratio dry biomass by 18 7 on average table 4 moreover in s1 total and marketable yield decreased on average by 24 7 and 21 4 respectively the decline in fruit size whose average weight decreased by 19 mainly contributed to the yield reduction due to salinity the salinity has also led to a 55 7 increase in the number of fruits with blossom end rot table 5 fruit dm tss ta ph and fi were not influenced by salinity in the first year however in the second year dm tss and ta increased respectively by 18 5 18 2 and 26 3 while the other three parameters did not change table 6 the chromatic characteristics of fruits showed some changes under salinity conditions in particular with reference to fruit surface l underwent an increase which resulted significant only in the first year 7 0 while a and b increased in both years on average 6 and 12 3 respectively on the fruit pulp salinity led to an increase in a and b on average by 5 8 and 12 7 table 7 wueb and wuey were not influenced by salinity in the first year while wuey decreased by 20 1 in the second one table 8 pbf affected biomass accumulation and yield while had no effect on fruit quality in particular the dry biomass of shoots and fruits in py1 increased by 5 1 and 9 0 respectively table 4 pbf resulted in an average increase by 7 9 and 8 1 in total and marketable yield respectively as well as by 5 9 in fruit mean weight the positive effect of pbf on yield was greater in the salt treatment interaction salinity x pbf levels table 5 fig 3 in addition pbf led to a significant increase on average 6 5 in wuey table 8 4 discussion 4 1 effect of salinity on physiological biochemical morphological and yield features of tomato as expected salinity negatively affected the gas exchange of tomato plants the increase in soil salinity initially causes the reduction of gs by osmotic effect and if the salinity stress lasts the toxic effect caused by a gradual na and cl ions accumulation in plant organs can occur such effect interferes with the ion balance in the cytoplasm munns and tester 2008 maathuis et al 2014 the decrease in gs leads to the simultaneous reduction of t and a generally as effect of osmotic stress t decreases more than a hernández and almansa 2002 parida and das 2005 but as the toxic effect appears a is more inhibited because of the damage suffered at the biochemical level munns and tester 2008 this would lead to an initial increase in wuei and a subsequent decrease lovelli et al 2012 in our trial the increase in wuei led us to hypothesize that salt stress experienced by tomato has been such as to make osmotic stress prevailing as it is also evident from the considerable reduction of the xylematic potential álvarez et al 2012 t reduction is also confirmed by tc data which in s1 increased as a consequence of the cooling effect reduction due to lower t sirault et al 2009 on the other hand also leaf chl content a toxic stress indicator zhang et al 2018 declined only at the last measurement date chl reduction can be attributed to the inhibition of saline induced chl biosynthesis khan 2006 which may be caused by nutritional imbalance the negative effects of salinity on a have led to the reduction of biomass production and to the variation in its partitioning also the production of biomass in salinity conditions is reduced both for decline in a and for the greater allocation of photosynthetates in roots to the detriment of leaves whose expansion can dramatically decrease further reducing photosynthesis maggio et al 2007 in fact an increase in the root shoot ratio was already reported as response to saline stress mainly due to osmotic effect rather than to a salt specific one hsiao and xu 2000 this is confirmed by our trial in which the root dry biomass remained unchanged for the two salinity levels while root shoot ratio increased with increase in salinity as obtained on tomatoes also by other authors albacete et al 2008 lovelli et al 2012 the higher proportion of the roots may constitute a typical mechanism of resistance to salt stress cassaniti et al 2012 salinity has led to a smaller yield reduction than expected based on the characteristics parameters values of maas and hoffman 1977 model for tomato in fact using the critical threshold 2 5 ds m 1 and slope 9 9 m ds 1 values reported in the literature for tomato flagella et al 2002 and considering the average ece recorded in s1 a 35 reduction in yield would be expected instead of 20 therefore we can consider that coronel the cultivar used in our trial presents a greater tolerance to salinity confirming the genotypic variability of tomato plant for this character as already observed by several authors cucci et al 2000 cantore et al 2008a yield reduction determined by salinity was mainly caused by the decline of fruit size other authors have shown that in the early phases of stress and with mild or moderate salt stress the reduction of mean weight of fruits prevails while with a stronger stress there is also a decrease in number of fruits due to both the reduction in number of flowers and fruit set cuartero and fernández munõz 1999 plants affected by salinity showed a high incidence of fruits with blossom end rot saline stress is considered among the predisposing factors of this disease due to the na ca2 antagonism at the origin of the nutritional imbalance that leads to the reduction of calcium in fruits grattan and grieve 1999 in the second year the salinity improved some quality traits of tomato in particular dm tss and ta as already demonstrated under salt cucci et al 2000 santamaria et al 2004 boari et al 2016 and water stress giuliani et al 2017 lovelli et al 2017 however in the first year no effect was observed probably due to the different cultivation time then ripening of fruits coincided with lower temperatures the very high dm and tss values recorded in the first year can be attributed to favourable environmental factors salinity did not have any effect on the fruit fi as noticed by cuartero et al 1996 instead with higher salinity levels other authors reported a decline in tomato fruit fi cantore et al 2012 salinity caused the increase in fruit red index a and yellow index b which are positively correlated to the lycopene and β carotene content respectively dumas et al 2003 cantore et al 2008b there are numerous experimental findings showing a positive effect of salt stress on the content of these important antioxidants improving tomato nutritional value ehret et al 2013 the wueb and wuey were not affected by salinity in the first year while wuey was negatively affected in the second one similar results for wueb have been reported by romero aranda et al 2001 and reina sánchez et al 2005 while al karaki 2000 reported a decline of this parameter in saline conditions this discrepancy might be attributed to the range of salinity tested by al karaki 2000 which was much higher than that used in our trial as well as by reina sánchez et al 2005 and romero aranda et al 2001 wuey reduction caused by salinity in the second year of our trial is in accordance with findings of romero aranda et al 2001 and reina sánchez et al 2005 actually the water used by the plant decreased with the increase in salinity to which a proportional reduction of total biomass was related while the fruit production decreased more drastically probably water uptake by plants under salinity conditions was primarily used to meet transpiration and vegetative growing demands and secondarily allocated to fruit growth ehret and ho 1986 johnson et al 1992 the different results obtained in the two years for the wuey were probably attributable to the different cultivation time and therefore to the different climatic conditions during the crop cycle 4 2 effect of pyraclostrobin on physiological biochemical morphological and yield features of tomato according to previous literature pbf influenced physiological and biochemical parameters of tomato with consequent effects on morphological and productive characteristics as well as wue moreover the interactive effect of pbf with salinity on physiological and productive performances of tomato was demonstrated thus confirming the hypotheses inspiring our experiment pbf reduced gs in agreement with previous findings on tomato cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2018 rice debona et al 2016 barley soybean and wheat nason et al al 2007 studies carried out on wheat grossmann et al 1999 nason et al 2007 and grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 showed that this would occur due to the increased production of aba a hormone notoriously involved in regulation of the stomatal opening venancio et al 2003 furthermore according to gs decline pbf reduced t as also previously observed as a result of the application of strobilurins on tomato marek et al 2018 wheat barley and soybean nason et al 2007 by applying azoxystrobin on tomato plants giuliani et al 2018 obtained genotype dependent results actually they found increase or no changes in t values depending on the considered cultivar thus demonstrating differences related to the genotype in the physiological responses to strobilurins even within the same species several studies showed the positive effect of strobilurins on the photosynthetic activity of tomato giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 and wheat baranyiova et al 2014 according to these results in our trial pbf promoted tomato a increase despite the concomitant decline of gs that reduced the flow of co2 to the photosynthetic sites this apparent contradiction can be explained by the increase in chl content that results in photosynthetic efficiency improvement contrasting results were obtained on rice debona et al 2016 soybean barley and wheat nason et al 2007 several experimental findings have highlighted the positive effect of strobilurins on chl biosynthesis ramos et al 2015 giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 schiattone 2018 as well as on slowing down its degradation green effect amaro et al 2018 liang et al 2018 the increase in pigment biosynthesis involves the improvement of nitrate reductase activity by strobilurins marek et al 2018 which by improving nitrogen metabolism viana and kiehl 2010 would rise its availability for the plant and therefore would also improve the formation of chl being its main constituent kluge et al 2014 the increase in nitrate reductase activity associated with the application of strobilurins beside tomato marek et al 2018 was also found in japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 maize barbosa et al 2011 and soybean soares et al 2011 on the other hand chl degradation slowing down would be determined by the effect of strobilurins on phytohormone balance in particular on one hand strobilurins would reduce the synthesis of ethylene giuliani et al 2019 a hormone notoriously involved in the processes of senescence and degradation of chl on the other hand it would promote the increase of cytokinins involved in the biosynthesis of the pigment delaying the senescence process grossmann et al 1999 amaro et al 2018 grossmann et al 1999 and venancio et al 2003 reported that in wheat bud tissue the kresoxim methyl strobilurin inhibits the biosynthesis of ethylene through the reduction of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc synthase activity the slowing of senescence was also related to the decline of lipid peroxidation as a consequence of the reduction of oxidative stress zhang et al 2010 amaro et al 2018 liang et al 2018 the enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes sod pod cat apx observed in our trial as a result of the application of pbf would confirm this latter hypothesis senescence is considered a process associated with ros li et al 2007 to counter the ros stress plants have evolved strategies in which antioxidant enzymes play an important role hadrami et al 2005 pompeu et al 2008 the pod cat and apx are key enzymes in the active oxygen scavenging system able to inhibit ros accumulation actually sod catalyses superoxide anion radicals o2 dismutation to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oxygen o2 while the three other enzymes provide to the h2o2 elimination preventing its toxic accumulation zhao et al 2007 under salt stress pbf determined a higher increase in chl and a compared to the salt control similar results were obtained on tomato under water deficit giuliani et al 2018 this can be explained by the increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes determined by pbf which may have played primary role in the control of oxidative processes promoted by saline stress similar findings were obtained on barley where the application of pbf inhibited the manifestation of the physiological leaf spot a physiological disease attributable to oxidative stress due to the doubling of pod activity köehle et al 2003 also other authors have found the improvement in the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes following the application of strobilurins on ginseng liang et al 2018 and japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 the increase in a and the decline in gs contributed to enhance tomato wuei as observed also by other authors ramos et al 2015 giuliani et al 2018 marek et al 2018 indicating greater capacity to assimilate co2 with low water loss generating greater water saving and higher synthesis of photo assimilates similar effects after application of strobilurins were observed in grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 and winter wheat baranyiova et al 2014 as expected the better physiological performance due to the pbf allowed greater biosynthesis and translocation of photo assimilated to fruits resulting in increased tomato yield these results are consistent with literature reporting evidences that the application of strobilurins in tomato plants promote higher marketable fruit yield giuliani et al 2010 cantore et al 2016 marek et al 2018 giuliani et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated the increase in yield determined by strobilurins also in other crops such as japanese cucumber amaro et al 2018 maize shetley et al 2015 beans jadoski et al 2015 soybean joshi et al 2014 and grapevine diaz espejo et al 2012 the increase in fruit yield of pbf treated plants in our trial was higher in saline stress conditions confirming the best physiological performance promoted by pbf moreover the effect of pbf on wuey confirmed that the application of strobilurin could significantly improve wue related to fruit yield giuliani et al 2018 2019 therefore it can be said that this fungicide as well as the phytosanitary defence of tomato crop can contribute to increase its tolerance to salinity one of the most widespread and harmful abiotic stresses similar results were obtained on tomato subjected to water stress giuliani et al 2011 cantore et al 2016 an abiotic stress whose response of the plant presents many similarities with the salt stress 5 conclusions the results of the research confirmed the harmful effects of salinity at physiological and productive level and the positive one in terms of tomato quality coronel has proved to be a tomato cultivar more tolerant to salinity respect to the tolerance levels reported in classical literature wue was negatively influenced by salinity in the second year while in the first one it did not change demonstrating the influence that also environmental conditions may have on this parameter this research confirmed that pbf besides being a valid fungicide for the phytosanitary defence of many crops could have biostimulant effects on physiological and biochemical parameters that lead to an increase in yield and water use efficiency of tomato furthermore the hypothesis underlying the research was confirmed in fact as well as strobilurin based fungicides have proven effective in reducing water stress pbf reduced the negative effects of salt stress on tomato the results of this research obtained in a controlled environment would require further experimental confirmation at field scale however in view of the different experimental findings that have demonstrated the positive effect of strobilurins on the production and attenuation of water stress in open field it can be reasonably asserted that pbf applied in open field would increase tomato s tolerance to salinity however since it is a pesticide we do not believe its use should be exclusively aimed at reducing the salt stress but it should be destined mainly for phytosanitary defence and prefer it to other pesticides if the water and or soil salinity are a
